Preface
The central theme of Introduction to Electric Circuits is the concept that electric circuits are part
of the basic fabric of modern technology. Given this theme, we endeavor to show how the
analysis and design of electric circuits are inseparably intertwined with the ability of the engineer
to design complex electronic, communication, computer, and control systems as well as consumer
products.
A p p r o a c h a n d O r g a n i z a t i o n
This book is designed for a one- to three-term course in electric circuits or linear circuit analysis and is
structured for maximum ﬂexibility. The ﬂowchart in Figure 1 demonstrates alternative chapter
organizations that can accommodate different course outlines without disrupting continuity.
The presentation is geared to readers who are being exposed to the basic concepts of electric
circuits for the ﬁrst time, and the scope of the work is broad. Students should come to the course with the
basic knowledge of differential and integral calculus.
This book endeavors to prepare the reader to solve realistic problems involving electric circuits.
Thus, circuits are shown to be the results of real inventions and the answers to real needs in industry, the
ofﬁce, and the home. Although the tools of electric circuit analysis may be partially abstract, electric
circuits are the building blocks of modern society. The analysis and design of electric circuits are critical
skills for all engineers.

Revisions to Improve Clarity
Chapter 10, covering AC circuits, has been largely rewritten to improve clarity of exposition.
In addition, revisions have been made through the text to improve clarity. Sometimes these revisions
are small, involving sentences or paragraphs. Other larger revisions involved pages or even entire
sections. Often these revisions involve examples. Consequently, the 9th edition contains 36 new
examples.
More Problems
The 9th edition contains 180 new problems, bringing the total number of problems to more than 1,400.
This edition uses a variety of problem types and they range in difﬁculty from simple to challenging,
including:
 Straightforward analysis problems.
 Analysis of complicated circuits.
 Simple design problems. (For example, given a circuit and the speciﬁed response, determine the
required RLC values.)
 Compare and contrast, multipart problems that draw attention to similarities or differences between
two situations.
 MATLAB and PSpice problems.
 Design problems. (Given some speciﬁcations, devise a circuit that satisﬁes those speciﬁcations.)
 How Can We Check . . . ? (Verify that a solution is indeed correct.)

Introduction
Each chapter begins with an introduction that motivates consideration of the material of that chapter.
Examples
Because this book is oriented toward providing expertise in problem solving, we have included more
than 260 illustrative examples. Also, each example has a title that directs the student to exactly what is
being illustrated in that particular example.
Various methods of solving problems are incorporated into select examples. These cases show
students that multiple methods can be used to derive similar solutions or, in some cases, that multiple
solutions can be correct. This helps students build the critical thinking skills necessary to discern the
best choice between multiple outcomes.
Much attention has been given to using PSpice and MATLAB to solve circuits problems. Two
appendices, one introducing PSpice and the other introducing MATLAB, brieﬂy describe the
capabilities of the programs and illustrate the steps needed to get started using them. Next, PSpice

and MATLAB are used throughout the text to solve various circuit analysis and design problems. For
example, PSpice is used in Chapter 5 to ﬁnd a Thevenin equivalent circuit and in Chapter 15 to represent
circuit inputs and outputs as Fourier series. MATLAB is frequently used to obtain plots of circuit inputs
and outputs that help us to see what our equations are telling us. MALAB also helps us with some long
and tedious arithmetic. For example, in Chapter 10, MATLAB helps us do the complex arithmetic that
we must do in order to analyze ac circuits, and in Chapter 14, MATLAB helps with the partial fraction
required to ﬁnd inverse Laplace transforms.

Of course, there’s more to using PSpice and MATLAB than simply running the programs. We
pay particular attention to interpreting the output of these computer programs and checking it to make
sure that it is correct. Frequently, this is done in the section called “How Can We Check . . . ?” that is
included in every chapter. For example, Section 8.9 shows how to interpret and check a PSpice
“Transient Response,” and Section 13.7 shows how to interpret and check a frequency response
produced using MATLAB or PSpice.
Design Examples, a Problem-Solving Method, and
“How Can We Check . . . ?” Sections
Each chapter concludes with a design example that uses the methods of that chapter to solve a design
problem. A formal ﬁve-step problem-solving method is introduced in Chapter 1 and then used in each
of the design examples. An important step in the problem-solving method requires you to check
your results to verify that they are correct. Each chapter includes a section entitled “How Can We
Check . . . ? ” that illustrates how the kind of results obtained in that chapter can be checked to ensure
correctness.
Key Equations and Formulas

help you pinpoint critical information.

Introduction to Signal Processing
Signal processing is an important application of electric circuits. This book introduces signal processing
in two ways. First, two sections (Sections 6.6 and 7.9) describe methods to design electric circuits that
implement algebraic and differential equations. Second, numerous examples and problems throughout
this book illustrate signal processing. The input and output signals of an electric circuit are explicitly
identiﬁed in each of these examples and problems. These examples and problems investigate the
relationship between the input and output signals that is imposed by the circuit.
Interactive Examples and Exercises
Numerous examples throughout this book are labeled as interactive examples. This label indicates that
computerized versions of that example are available at the textbook’s companion site, www.wiley.com/
svoboda. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the textbook example and the computerized
example available on the Web site. Figure 2a shows an example from Chapter 3. The problem presented
by the interactive example shown in Figure 2b is similar to the textbook example but different in several
ways:
 The values of the circuit parameters have been randomized.
 The independent and dependent sources may be reversed.
 The reference direction of the measured voltage may be reversed.
 A different question is asked. Here, the student is asked to work the textbook problem backward,
using the measured voltage to determine the value of a circuit parameter.
The interactive example poses a problem and then accepts and checks the user’s answer. Students are
provided with immediate feedback regarding the correctness of their work. The interactive example
chooses parameter values somewhat randomly, providing a seemingly endless supply of problems. This
pairing of a solution to a particular problem with an endless supply of similar problems is an effective
aid for learning about electric circuits.
The interactive exercise shown in Figure 2c considers a similar, but different, circuit. Like the
interactive example, the interactive exercise poses a problem and then accepts and checks the user’s
answer. Student learning is further supported by extensive help in the form of worked example
problems, available from within the interactive exercise, using the Worked Example button.
Variations of this problem are obtained using the New Problem button. We can peek at the
answer, using the Show Answer button. The interactive examples and exercises provide hundreds of
additional practice problems with countless variations, all with answers that are checked immediately
by the computer.

The almost ubiquitous use of computers and the Web have provided an exciting opportunity to rethink
supplementary material. The supplements available have been greatly enhanced.

 Interactive Examples The interactive examples and exercises are powerful support resources
for students. They were created as tools to assist students in mastering skills and building
their conﬁdence. The examples selected from the text and included on the Web give students
options for navigating through the problem. They can immediately request to see the solution or
select a more gradual approach to help. Then they can try their hand at a similar problem by simply
electing to change the values in the problem. By the time students attempt the homework, they have
built the conﬁdence and skills to complete their assignments successfully. It’s a virtual homework
helper.

I n t r o d u c t i o n
A circuit consists of electrical elements connected together. Engineers use electric circuits to solve
problems that are important to modern society. In particular:
1.
Electric circuits are used in the generation, transmission, and consumption of electric power and
energy.
2.
Electric circuits are used in the encoding, decoding, storage, retrieval, transmission, and processing
of information.
In this chapter, we will do the following:
 Represent
the
current
and
voltage
of
an
electric
circuit
element,
paying
particular
attention to the reference direction of the current and to the reference direction or polarity of
the voltage.
 Calculate the power and energy supplied or received by a circuit element.
 Use
the
passive
convention
to
determine
whether
the
product
of
the
current
and
voltage of a circuit element is the power supplied by that element or the power received by
the element.
 Use scientiﬁc notation to represent electrical quantities with a wide range of magnitudes.
1.2
E l e c t r i c C i r c u i t s a n d C u r r e n t
The outstanding characteristics of electricity when compared with other power sources are its
mobility and ﬂexibility. Electrical energy can be moved to any point along a couple of wires and,
depending on the user’s requirements, converted to light, heat, or motion.
An electric circuit or electric network is an interconnection of electrical elements linked
together in a closed path so that an electric current may ﬂow continuously.
1

Consider a simple circuit consisting of two well-known electrical elements, a battery and a
resistor, as shown in Figure 1.2-1. Each element is represented by the two-terminal element
shown in Figure 1.2-2. Elements are sometimes called devices, and terminals are sometimes called
nodes.
Charge may ﬂow in an electric circuit. Current is the time rate of change of charge past a given
point. Charge is the intrinsic property of matter responsible for electric phenomena. The quantity of
charge q can be expressed in terms of the charge on one electron, which is 1.602  1019 coulombs.
Thus, 1 coulomb is the charge on 6.24  1018 electrons. The current through a speciﬁed area is
deﬁned by the electric charge passing through the area per unit of time. Thus, q is deﬁned as the charge
expressed in coulombs (C).
Charge is the quantity of electricity responsible for electric phenomena.
Then we can express current as
i ¼ dq
dt
ð1:2-1Þ
The unit of current is the ampere (A); an ampere is 1 coulomb per second.
Current is the time rate of ﬂow of electric charge past a given point.
Note that throughout this chapter we use a lowercase letter, such as q, to denote a variable that is a
function of time, q(t). We use an uppercase letter, such as Q, to represent a constant.
The ﬂow of current is conventionally represented as a ﬂow of positive charges. This convention
was initiated by Benjamin Franklin, the ﬁrst great American electrical scientist. Of course, we
now know that charge ﬂow in metal conductors results from electrons with a negative charge.
Nevertheless, we will conceive of current as the ﬂow of positive charge, according to accepted
convention.
Figure 1.2-3 shows the notation that we use to describe a current. There are two parts to
this notation: a value (perhaps represented by a variable name) and an assigned direction. As a
matter of vocabulary, we say that a current exists in or through an element. Figure 1.2-3 shows
that there are two ways to assign the direction of the current through an element. The current i1
is the rate of ﬂow of electric charge from terminal a to terminal b. On the other hand, the
current i2 is the ﬂow of electric charge from terminal b to terminal a. The currents i1 and i2 are

similar but different. They are the same size but have different directions. Therefore, i2 is the negative
of i1 and
i1 ¼ i2
We always associate an arrow with a current to denote its direction. A complete description of current
requires both a value (which can be positive or negative) and a direction (indicated by an arrow).
If the current ﬂowing through an element is constant, we represent it by the constant I, as shown in
Figure 1.2-4. A constant current is called a direct current (dc).
A direct current (dc) is a current of constant magnitude.
A time-varying current i(t) can take many forms, such as a ramp, a sinusoid, or an exponential, as
shown in Figure 1.2-5. The sinusoidal current is called an alternating current (ac).

S y s t e m s o f U n i t s
In representing a circuit and its elements, we must deﬁne a consistent system of units for the quantities
occurring in the circuit. At the 1960 meeting of the General Conference of Weights and Measures, the
representatives modernized the metric system and created the Systeme International d’Unites,
commonly called SI units.
SI is Systeme International d’Unites or the International System of Units.
The fundamental, or base, units of SI are shown in Table 1.3-1. Symbols for units that represent proper
(persons’) names are capitalized; the others are not. Periods are not used after the symbols, and the symbols do
not take on plural forms. The derived units for other physical quantities are obtained by combining the
fundamental units. Table 1.3-2 shows the more common derived units along with their formulas in terms of
the fundamental units or preceding derived units. Symbols are shown for the units that have them.

The basic units such as length in meters (m), time in seconds (s), and current in amperes (A) can
be used to obtain the derived units. Then, for example, we have the unit for charge (C) derived from the
product of current and time (A  s). The fundamental unit for energy is the joule (J), which is force times
distance or N  m.
The great advantage of the SI system is that it incorporates a decimal system for relating larger
or smaller quantities to the basic unit. The powers of 10 are represented by standard preﬁxes given in
Table 1.3-3. An example of the common use of a preﬁx is the centimeter (cm), which is 0.01 meter.
The decimal multiplier must always accompany the appropriate units and is never written by itself.
Thus, we may write 2500 W as 2.5 kW. Similarly, we write 0.012 A as 12 mA.

A mass of 150 grams experiences a force of 100 newtons. Find the energy or work expended if the mass moves
10 centimeters. Also, ﬁnd the power if the mass completes its move in 1 millisecond.
Solution
The energy is found as
energy ¼ force  distance ¼ 100  0:1 ¼ 10 J
Note that we used the distance in units of meters. The power is found from
power ¼

1. Electric Circuit Variables

1.4
V o l t a g e
The basic variables in an electrical circuit are current and voltage. These variables
describe the ﬂow of charge through the elements of a circuit and the energy required to
cause charge to ﬂow. Figure 1.4-1 shows the notation we use to describe a voltage.
There are two parts to this notation: a value (perhaps represented by a variable name)
and an assigned direction. The value of a voltage may be positive or negative. The
direction of a voltage is given by its polarities (þ, ). As a matter of vocabulary, we say
that a voltage exists across an element. Figure 1.4-1 shows that there are two ways to
label the voltage across an element. The voltage vba is proportional to the work required to move a
positive charge from terminal a to terminal b. On the other hand, the voltage vab is proportional to the
work required to move a positive charge from terminal b to terminal a. We sometimes read vba as “the
voltage at terminal b with respect to terminal a.” Similarly, vab can be read as “the voltage at terminal a
with respect to terminal b.” Alternatively, we sometimes say that vba is the voltage drop from terminal a
to terminal b. The voltages vab and vba are similar but different. They have the same magnitude but
different polarities. This means that
vab ¼ vba
When considering vba, terminal b is called the “þ terminal” and terminal a is called the “ terminal.” On
the other hand, when talking about vab, terminal a is called the “þ terminal” and terminal b is called the
“ terminal.”
The voltage across an element is the work (energy) required to move a unit positive charge
from the  terminal to the þ terminal. The unit of voltage is the volt, V.
The equation for the voltage across the element is
v ¼ dw
dq
ð1:4-1Þ
where v is voltage, w is energy (or work), and q is charge. A charge of 1 coulomb delivers an energy of
1 joule as it moves through a voltage of 1 volt.
1.5
P o w e r a n d E n e r g y
The power and energy delivered to an element are of great importance. For example, the useful output
of an electric lightbulb can be expressed in terms of power. We know that a 300-watt bulb delivers more
light than a 100-watt bulb.

where p is power in watts, w is energy in joules, and t is time in seconds. The power
associated with the current through an element is
p ¼ dw
dt ¼ dw
dq  dq
dt ¼ v  i
ð1:5-2Þ
From Eq. 1.5-2, we see that the power is simply the product of the voltage across
an element times the current through the element. The power has units of watts.
Two circuit variables are assigned to each element of a circuit: a voltage and a
current. Figure 1.5-1 shows that there are two different ways to arrange the direction
of the current and the polarity of the voltage. In Figure 1.5-1a, the current is directed
from the þ toward the  of the voltage polarity. In contrast, in Figure 1.5-1b, the
current is directed from the  toward the þ of the voltage polarity.
First, consider Figure 1.5-1a. When the current enters the circuit element at the
þ terminal of the voltage and exits at the  terminal, the voltage and current are said to
“adhere to the passive convention.” In the passive convention, the voltage pushes a
positive charge in the direction indicated by the current. Accordingly, the power
calculated by multiplying the element voltage by the element current
p ¼ vi
is the power received by the element. (This power is sometimes called “the power absorbed by the
element” or “the power dissipated by the element.”) The power received by an element can be either
positive or negative. This will depend on the values of the element voltage and current.
Next, consider Figure 1.5-1b. Here the passive convention has not been used. Instead, the current
enters the circuit element at the  terminal of the voltage and exits at the þ terminal. In this case, the
voltage pushes a positive charge in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by the current.
Accordingly, when the element voltage and current do not adhere to the passive convention, the power
calculated by multiplying the element voltage by the element current is the power supplied by the
element. The power supplied by an element can be either positive or negative, depending on the values
of the element voltage and current.
The power received by an element and the power supplied by that same element are related by
power received ¼ power supplied
The rules for the passive convention are summarized in Table 1.5-1. When the element voltage
and current adhere to the passive convention, the energy received by an element can be determined

The analysis and design of electric circuits are the primary activities described in this book and are key
skills for an electrical engineer. The analysis of a circuit is concerned with the methodical study of a
given circuit designed to obtain the magnitude and direction of one or more circuit variables, such as a
current or voltage.
The analysis process begins with a statement of the problem and usually includes a given circuit model.
The goal is to determine the magnitude and direction of one or more circuit variables, and the ﬁnal task is to
verify that the proposed solution is indeed correct. Usually, the engineer ﬁrst identiﬁes what is known and the
principles that will be used to determine the unknown variable.
The problem-solving method that will be used throughout this book is shown in Figure 1.6-1.
Generally, the problem statement is given. The analysis process then moves sequentially through
the ﬁve steps shown in Figure 1.6-1. First, we describe the situation and the assumptions. We also
record or review the circuit model that is provided. Second, we state the goals and requirements, and we

normally record the required circuit variable to be determined. The third step is to create a plan that will
help obtain the solution of the problem. Typically, we record the principles and techniques that pertain
to this problem. The fourth step is to act on the plan and carry out the steps described in the plan. The
ﬁnal step is to verify that the proposed solution is indeed correct. If it is correct, we communicate this
solution by recording it in writing or by presenting it verbally. If the veriﬁcation step indicates that the
proposed solution is incorrect or inadequate, then we return to the plan steps, reformulate an improved
plan, and repeat steps 4 and 5.
To illustrate this analytical method, we will consider an example. In Example 1.6-1, we use the
steps described in the problem-solving method of Figure 1.6-1.
E X A M P L E 1 . 6 - 1
The Formal Problem-Solving Method
An experimenter in a lab assumes that an element is absorbing power and uses a voltmeter and ammeter to measure
the voltage and current as shown in Figure 1.6-2. The measurements indicate that the voltage is v ¼ þ12 V and the
current is i ¼ 2 A. Determine whether the experimenter’s assumption is correct.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions: Strictly speaking, the element is absorbing power. The value
of the power absorbed by the element may be positive or zero or negative. When we say that someone “assumes that
an element is absorbing power,” we mean that someone assumes that the power absorbed by the element is positive.
The meters are ideal. These meters have been connected to the element in such a way as to measure the
voltage labeled v and the current labeled i. The values of the voltage and current are given by the meter readings.
State the Goals: Calculate the power absorbed by the element to determine whether the value of the power
absorbed is positive.
Generate a Plan: Verify that the element voltage and current adhere to the passive convention. If so, the
power absorbed by the device is p ¼ vi. If not, the power absorbed by the device is p ¼ vi.
Act on the Plan: Referring to Table 1.5-1, we see that the element voltage and current do adhere to the
passive convention. Therefore, power absorbed by the element is
p ¼ vi ¼ 12  2
ð
Þ ¼ 24 W
The value of the power absorbed is not positive.
Verify the Proposed Solution: Let’s reverse the ammeter probes as shown in Figure 1.6-3. Now the
ammeter measures the current i1 rather than the current i, so i1 ¼ 2 A and v ¼ 12 V. Because i1 and v do not adhere to
the passive convention, p ¼ i1  v ¼ 24 W is the power supplied by the element. Supplying 24 W is equivalent to
absorbing 24 W, thus verifying the proposed solution.

Design is a purposeful activity in which a designer visualizes a desired outcome. It is the process
of originating circuits and predicting how these circuits will fulﬁll objectives. Engineering design is the
process of producing a set of descriptions of a circuit that satisfy a set of performance requirements and
constraints.
The design process may incorporate three phases: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The ﬁrst
task is to diagnose, deﬁne, and prepare—that is, to understand the problem and produce an explicit
statement of goals; the second task involves ﬁnding plausible solutions; the third concerns judging the
validity of solutions relative to the goals and selecting among alternatives. A cycle is implied in which
the solution is revised and improved by reexamining the analysis. These three phases are part of a
framework for planning, organizing, and evolving design projects.
Design is the process of creating a circuit to satisfy a set of goals.
The problem-solving process shown in Figure 1.6-1 is used in Design Examples included in each
chapter.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able quickly to identify
those solutions that need more work.
This text includes some examples that illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of
the particular problems discussed in that chapter. At the end of each chapter, some problems are
presented that provide an opportunity to practice these techniques.

How Can We Check Power and the Passive Convention?
A laboratory report states that the measured values of v and i for the circuit element
shown in Figure 1.7-1 are 5 V and 2 A, respectively. The report also states that the
power absorbed by the element is 10 W. How can we check the reported value of the
power absorbed by this element?
Solution
Does the circuit element absorb 10 W or þ10 W? The voltage and current shown in Figure 1.7-1 do not adhere to
the passive sign convention. Referring to Table 1.5-1, we see that the product of this voltage and current is the
power supplied by the element rather than the power absorbed by the element.
Then the power supplied by the element is
p ¼ vi ¼ 5
ð
Þ 2
ð Þ ¼ 10 W
The power absorbed and the power supplied by an element have the same magnitude but the opposite sign. Thus,
we have veriﬁed that the circuit element is indeed absorbing 10 W.

Jet Valve Controller
A small, experimental space rocket uses a two-
element circuit, as shown in Figure 1.8-1, to
control a jet valve from point of liftoff at t ¼ 0
until expiration of the rocket after one minute.
The energy that must be supplied by element 1
for the one-minute period is 40 mJ. Element 1 is a
battery to be selected.
It is known that i(t)¼ Det/60 mA for t 0,
and the voltage across the second element is v2(t)¼
Bet/60 V for t 0. The maximum magnitude
of the current, D, is limited to 1 mA. Determine
the required constants D and B and describe the
required battery.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
1.
The current enters the plus terminal of the second element.
2.
The current leaves the plus terminal of the ﬁrst element.
3.
The wires are perfect and have no effect on the circuit (they do not absorb energy).
4.
The model of the circuit, as shown in Figure 1.8-1, assumes that the voltage across the two elements is
equal; that is, v1 ¼ v2.
5.
The battery voltage v1 is v1 ¼ Bet/60 V where B is the initial voltage of the battery that will
discharge exponentially as it supplies energy to the valve.
6.
The circuit operates from t ¼ 0 to t ¼ 60 s.

Charge is the intrinsic property of matter responsible for

DP 1-1 A particular circuit element is available in three grades.
Grade A guarantees that the element can safely absorb 1=2 W
continuously. Similarly, Grade B guarantees that 1=4 W can be
absorbed safely, and Grade C guarantees that 1=8 W can be
absorbed safely. As a rule, elements that can safely absorb more
power are also more expensive and bulkier.
The voltage across an element is expected to be about
20 V, and the current in the element is expected to be about
8 mA. Both estimates are accurate to within 25 percent. The
voltage and current reference adhere to the passive convention.

Not surprisingly, the behavior of an electric circuit depends on the behaviors of the individual
circuit elements that comprise the circuit. Of course, different types of circuit elements behave
differently. The equations that describe the behaviors of the various types of circuit elements are
called the constitutive equations. Frequently, the constitutive equations describe a relationship
between the current and voltage of the element. Ohm’s law is a well-known example of a constitutive
equation.
In this chapter, we will investigate the behavior of several common types of circuit
element:
 Resistors.
 Independent voltage and current sources.
 Open circuits and short circuits.
 Voltmeters and ammeters.
 Dependent sources.
 Transducers.
 Switches.

The art of engineering is to take a bright idea and, using money, materials, knowledgeable people,
and a regard for the environment, produce something the buyer wants at an affordable price.
Engineers use models to represent the elements of an electric circuit. A model is a description
of those properties of a device that we think are important. Frequently, the model will consist of
an equation relating the element voltage and current. Though the model is different from the electric
device, the model can be used in pencil-and-paper calculations that will predict how a circuit composed
of actual devices will operate. Engineers frequently face a trade-off when selecting a model for a
device. Simple models are easy to work with but may not be accurate. Accurate models are usually more
complicated and harder to use. The conventional wisdom suggests that simple models be used ﬁrst. The
results obtained using the models must be checked to verify that use of these simple models is
appropriate. More accurate models are used when necessary.
20

The idealized models of electric devices are precisely deﬁned. It is important to distinguish
between actual devices and their idealized models, which we call circuit elements. The goal of circuit
analysis is to predict the quantitative electrical behavior of physical circuits. Its aim is to predict and to
explain the terminal voltages and terminal currents of the circuit elements and thus the overall operation
of the circuit.
Models of circuit elements can be categorized in a variety of ways. For example, it is
important to distinguish linear models from nonlinear models because circuits that consist
entirely of linear circuit elements are easier to analyze than circuits that contain some
nonlinear elements.
An element or circuit is linear if the element’s excitation and response satisfy certain
properties. Consider the element shown in Figure 2.2-1. Suppose that the excitation is the
current i and the response is the voltage v. When the element is subjected to a current i1, it
provides a response v1. Furthermore, when the element is subjected to a current i2, it
provides a response v2. For a linear element, it is necessary that the excitation i1 þ i2 result
in a response v1 þ v2. This is usually called the principle of superposition.
Also, multiplying the input of a linear device by a constant must have the consequence
of multiplying the output by the same constant. For example, doubling the size of the input causes
the size of the output to double. This is called the property of homogeneity. An element is linear if,
and only if, the properties of superposition and homogeneity are satisﬁed for all excitations
and responses.
A linear element satisﬁes the properties of both superposition and homogeneity.
Let us restate mathematically the two required properties of a linear circuit, using the arrow
notation to imply the transition from excitation to response:
i ! v
Then we may state the two properties required as follows.
Superposition:
i1 ! v1
i2 ! v2
then
i1 þ i2 ! v1 þ v2
ð2:2-1Þ
Homogeneity:
i ! v
then
ki ! kv
ð2:2-2Þ
A device that does not satisfy either the superposition or the homogeneity principle is said to be
nonlinear.

Solution
The response to a current i1 is

The response to a current i2 is

The sum of these responses is

ð
Þ
Because the sum of the responses to i1 and i2 is equal to the response to i1 þ i2, the principle of superposition is
satisﬁed. Next, consider the principle of homogeneity. Because
v1 ¼ Ri1
we have for an excitation i2 ¼ ki1
v2 ¼ Ri2 ¼ Rki1
Therefore,
v2 ¼ kv1
satisﬁes the principle of homogeneity. Because the element satisﬁes the properties of both superposition and
homogeneity, it is linear.

We may classify circuit elements in two categories, passive and active, by determining whether they absorb
energy or supply energy. An element is said to be passive if the total energy delivered to it from the rest of
the circuit is always nonnegative (zero or positive). Then for a passive element, with the current ﬂowing
into the þ terminal as shown in Figure 2.3-1a, this means that

A Model of a Linear Device
A linear element has voltage v and current i as shown in Figure 2.2-2a. Values of the current i and corresponding
voltage v have been tabulated as shown in Figure 2.2-2b. Represent the element by an equation that expresses v as a
function of i. This equation is a model of the element. Use the model to predict the value of v corresponding to a
current of i ¼ 100 mA and the value of i corresponding to a voltage of v ¼ 18 V.
Solution
Figure 2.2-3 is a plot of the voltage v versus the current i. The points marked by dots represent corresponding values
of v and i from the rows of the table in Figure 2.2-2b. Because the circuit element is linear, we expect these points to
lie on a straight line, and indeed they do. We can represent the straight line by the equation
v ¼ mi þ b
where m is the slope and b is the v-intercept. Noticing that the straight line passes through the origin, v ¼ 0 when
i ¼ 0, we see that b ¼ 0. We are left with
v ¼ mi
The slope m can be calculated from the data in any two rows of the table in Figure 2.2-2b. For example:

A passive element absorbs energy.
An element is said to be active if it is capable of delivering energy. Thus, an active element violates
Eq. 2.3-1 when it is represented by Figure 2.3-1a. In other words, an active element is one that is capable of
generating energy. Active elements are potential sources of energy, whereas passive elements are sinks or
absorbers of energy. Examples of active elements include batteries and generators. Consider the element
shown in Figure 2.3-1b. Note that the current ﬂows into the negative terminal and out of the positive
terminal. This element is said to be active if

The ability of a material to resist the ﬂow of charge is called its resistivity, r. Materials that are good
electrical insulators have a high value of resistivity. Materials that are good conductors of electric
current have low values of resistivity. Resistivity values for selected materials are given in Table 2.4-1.
Copper is commonly used for wires because it permits current to ﬂow relatively unimpeded. Silicon is
commonly used to provide resistance in semiconductor electric circuits. Polystyrene is used as an
insulator.
Resistance is the physical property of an element or device that impedes the ﬂow of current; it
is represented by the symbol R.
Georg Simon Ohm was able to show that the current in a circuit composed of a battery
and a conducting wire of uniform cross-section could be expressed as
i ¼ Av
rL
ð2:4-1Þ
where A is the cross-sectional area, r the resistivity, L the length, and v the voltage across the
wire element. Ohm, who is shown in Figure 2.4-1, deﬁned the constant resistance R as
R ¼ rL
A
ð2:4-2Þ
Ohm’s law, which related the voltage and current, was published in 1827 as
v ¼ Ri
ð2:4-3Þ
The unit of resistance R was named the ohm in honor of Ohm and is usually abbreviated by the
V (capital omega) symbol, where 1 V ¼ 1 V/A. The resistance of a 10-m length of common
TV cable is 2 mV.
An element that has a resistance R is called a resistor. A resistor is represented by the
two-terminal symbol shown in Figure 2.4-2. Ohm’s law, Eq. 2.4-3, requires that the i-versus-v
relationship be linear. As shown in Figure 2.4-3, a resistor may become nonlinear outside its
normal rated range of operation. We will assume that a resistor is linear unless stated
otherwise. Thus, we will use a linear model of the resistor as represented by Ohm’s law.
In Figure 2.4-4, the element current and element voltage of a resistor are labeled. The
relationship between the directions of this current and voltage is important. The voltage
direction marks one resistor terminal þ and the other . The current ia ﬂows from the terminal
marked þ to the terminal marked . This relationship between the current and voltage
reference directions is a convention called the passive convention. Ohm’s law states that when
the element voltage and the element current adhere to the passive convention, then
v ¼ Ria

Consider Figure 2.4-4. The element currents ia and ib are the same except for the assigned direction, so
ia ¼ ib
The element current ia and the element voltage v adhere to the passive convention,
v ¼ Ria
Replacing ia by ib gives
v ¼ Rib
There is a minus sign in this equation because the element current ib and the element voltage v do not
adhere to the passive convention. We must pay attention to the current direction so that we don’t
overlook this minus sign.
Ohm’s law, Eq. 2.4-3, can also be written as
i ¼ Gv
ð2:4-5Þ
where G denotes the conductance in siemens (S) and is the reciprocal of R; that is, G ¼ 1=R. Many
engineers denote the units of conductance as mhos with the ℧symbol, which is an inverted omega (mho is
ohm spelled backward). However, we will use SI units and retain siemens as the units for conductance.
Most discrete resistors fall into one of four basic categories: carbon composition, carbon ﬁlm,
metal ﬁlm, or wirewound. Carbon composition resistors have been in use for nearly 100 years and are
still popular. Carbon ﬁlm resistors have supplanted carbon composition resistors for many general-
purpose uses because of their lower cost and better tolerances. Two wirewound resistors are shown in
Figure 2.4-5.
Carbon composition resistors, as shown in Figure 2.4-6, are used in circuits because of their low
cost and small size. General-purpose resistors are available in standard values for tolerances of 2, 5, 10,
and 20 percent. Carbon composition resistors and some wirewounds have a color code with three to ﬁve
bands. A color code is a system of standard colors adopted for identiﬁcation of the resistance of
resistors. Figure 2.4-7 shows a metal ﬁlm resistor with its color bands. This is a 1=4-watt resistor,
implying that it should be operated at or below 1=4 watt of power delivered to it. The normal range of
resistors is from less than 1 ohm to 10 megohms. Typical values of some commercially available
resistors are given in Appendix D.

Let us devise a model for a car battery when the lights are left on and the engine is
off. We have all experienced or seen a car parked with its lights on. If we leave the car
for a period, the battery will run down or go dead. An auto battery is a 12-V constant-
voltage source, and the lightbulb can be modeled by a resistor of 6 ohms. The circuit is
shown in Figure 2.4-8. Let us ﬁnd the current i, the power p, and the energy supplied by
the battery for a four-hour period.
Solution
According to Ohm’s law, Eq. 2.4-3, we have
v ¼ Ri
Because v ¼ 12 V and R ¼ 6 V, we have i ¼ 2 A.
To ﬁnd the power delivered by the battery, we use

auto battery may store 106 J in a fully charged condition.

An active two-terminal element that supplies energy to a circuit is a source of energy. An independent
voltage source provides a speciﬁed voltage independent of the current through it and is independent of
any other circuit variable.
A source is a voltage or current generator capable of supplying energy to a circuit.
An independent current source provides a current independent of the voltage across the source
element and is independent of any other circuit variable. Thus, when we say a source is independent, we
mean it is independent of any other voltage or current in the circuit.
An independent source is a voltage or current generator not dependent on other circuit
variables.
Suppose the voltage source is a battery and
v tð Þ ¼ 9 volts
The voltage of this battery is known to be 9 volts regardless of the circuit in which the battery is used. In
contrast, the current of the voltage source is not known and depends on the circuit in which the source is
used. The current could be 6 amps when the voltage source is connected to one circuit and 6 milliamps
when the voltage source is connected to another circuit.
Figure 2.5-1b shows the symbol that is used to represent a current source. The current of a current
source is speciﬁed, but the voltage is determined by the rest of the circuit. A current source is described
by specifying the function i(t), for example,
i tð Þ ¼ 6 sin 500t
or
i tð Þ ¼ 0:25
or
i tð Þ ¼ t þ 8
A current source speciﬁed by i(t) ¼ 0.25 milliamps will have a current of 0.25 milliamps in any
circuit in which it is used. The voltage across this current source will depend on the particular circuit.
The preceding paragraphs have ignored some complexities to give a simple description of the
way sources work. The voltage across a 9-volt battery may not actually be 9 volts. This voltage
depends on the age of the battery, the temperature, variations in manufacturing, and the battery

voltage and current sources described in the preceding paragraphs. It would be ideal if the real
sources worked like these simple sources. Indeed, the word ideal is used to make this distinction. The
simple sources described in the previous paragraph are called the ideal voltage source and the ideal
current source.
The voltage of an ideal voltage source is given to be a speciﬁed function, say v(t). The
current is determined by the rest of the circuit.
The current of an ideal current source is given to be a speciﬁed function, say i(t). The
voltage is determined by the rest of the circuit.
An ideal source is a voltage or a current generator independent of the current through
the voltage source or the voltage across the current source.
Engineers frequently face a trade-off when selecting a model for a device. Simple models are
easy to work with but may not be accurate. Accurate models are usually more complicated and
harder to use. The conventional wisdom suggests that simple models be used ﬁrst. The results
obtained using the models must be checked to verify that use of these simple models is appropriate.
More accurate models are used when necessary.

A Battery Modeled as a Voltage Source
Consider the plight of the engineer who needs to analyze a circuit containing a 9-volt battery. Is it really necessary
for this engineer to include the dependence of battery voltage on the age of the battery, the temperature, variations
in manufacturing, and the battery current in this analysis? Hopefully not. We expect the battery to act enough like
an ideal 9-volt voltage source that the differences can be ignored. In this case, it is said that the battery is modeled as
an ideal voltage source.
To be speciﬁc, consider a battery speciﬁed by the plot of voltage versus current shown in Figure 2.5-2a. This
plot indicates that the battery voltage will be v ¼ 9 volts when i  10 milliamps. As the current increases above 10
milliamps, the voltage decreases from 9 volts. When i  10 milliamps, the dependence of the battery voltage on the
battery current can be ignored and the battery can be modeled as an ideal voltage source.

The short circuit and open circuit are special cases of ideal sources. A short circuit is
an ideal voltage source having v(t) ¼ 0. The current in a short circuit is determined by the
rest of the circuit. An open circuit is an ideal current source having i(t) ¼ 0. The voltage
across an open circuit is determined by the rest of the circuit. Figure 2.5-3 shows the
symbols used to represent the short circuit and the open circuit. Notice that the power
absorbed by each of these devices is zero.
Open and short circuits can be added to a circuit without disturbing the branch currents
and voltages of all the other devices in the circuit. Figure 2.6-3 shows how this can be done.
Figure 2.6-3a shows an example circuit. In Figure 2.6-3b an open circuit and a short circuit
have been added to this example circuit. The open circuit was connected between two nodes
of the original circuit. In contrast, the short circuit was added by cutting a wire and inserting
the short circuit. Adding open circuits and short circuits to a network in this way does not
change the network.
Open circuits and short circuits can also be described as special cases of resistors.
A resistor with resistance R ¼ 0 (G ¼ 1) is a short circuit. A resistor with conductance
G ¼ 0 (R ¼ 1) is an open circuit.

Measurements of dc current and voltage are made with direct-reading (analog) or digital meters, as
shown in Figure 2.6-1. A direct-reading meter has an indicating pointer whose angular deﬂection
depends on the magnitude of the variable it is measuring. A digital meter displays a set of digits
indicating the measured variable value.
To measure a voltage or current, a meter is connected to a circuit, using terminals called probes.
These probes are color coded to indicate the reference direction of the variable being measured.
Frequently, meter probes are colored red and black. An ideal voltmeter measures the voltage from the
red to the black probe. The red terminal is the positive terminal, and the black terminal is the negative
terminal (see Figure 2.6-2b).
An ideal ammeter measures the current ﬂowing through its terminals, as shown in Figure 2.6-2a
and has zero voltage, vm, across its terminals. An ideal voltmeter measures the voltage across
its terminals, as shown in Figure 2.6-2b, and has terminal current, im, equal to zero. Practical measuring
The distinction between these two equations is important. Eq. 2.5-1, involving the vi relationship
shown in Figure 2.5-2a, is more accurate but also more complicated. Equation 2.5-2 is simpler but may be
inaccurate.
Suppose that R ¼ 1000 ohms. Equation 2.5-2 gives the current of the ideal voltage source:
i ¼
9
1000 ¼ 9 mA
ð2:5-3Þ
Because this current is less than 10 milliamps, the ideal voltage source is a good model for the battery, and it is
reasonable to expect that the battery current is 9 milliamps.
Suppose, instead, that R ¼ 600 ohms. Once again, Eq. 2.5-2 gives the current of the ideal voltage source:
i ¼ 9
600 ¼ 15 mA
ð2:5-4Þ
Because this current is greater than 10 milliamps, the ideal voltage source is not a good model for the battery.
In this case, it is reasonable to expect that the battery current is different from the current for the ideal voltage source.

instruments only approximate the ideal conditions. For a practical ammeter, the voltage across its
terminals is usually negligibly small. Similarly, the current into a voltmeter is usually negligible.
Ideal voltmeters act like open circuits, and ideal ammeters act like short circuits. In other words,
the model of an ideal voltmeter is an open circuit, and the model of an ideal ammeter is a short circuit.
Consider the circuit of Figure 2.6-3a and then add an open circuit with a voltage v and a short circuit
with a current i as shown in Figure 2.6-3b. In Figure 2.6-3c, the open circuit has been replaced by a
voltmeter, and the short circuit has been replaced by an ammeter. The voltmeter will measure the
voltage labeled v in Figure 2.6-3b whereas the ammeter will measure the current labeled i. Notice that
Figure 2.6-3c could be obtained from Figure 2.6-3a by adding a voltmeter and an ammeter. Ideally,
adding the voltmeter and ammeter in this way does not disturb the circuit. One more interpretation of
Figure 2.6-3 is useful. Figure 2.6-3b could be formed from Figure 2.6-3c by replacing the voltmeter and
the ammeter by their (ideal) models.
The reference direction is an important part of an element voltage or element current. Figures 2.6-
4 and 2.6-5 show that attention must be paid to reference directions when measuring an element voltage
or element current. Figure 2.6-4a shows a voltmeter. Voltmeters have two color-coded probes. This
color coding indicates the reference direction of the voltage being measured. In Figures 2.6-4b and
Figure 2.6-4c the voltmeter is used to measure the voltage across the 6-kV resistor. When the voltmeter
is connected to the circuit as shown in Figure 2.6-4b, the voltmeter measures va, with þ on the left, at the
red probe. When the voltmeter probes are interchanged as shown in Figure 2.6-4c, the voltmeter
measures vb, with þ on the right, again at the red probe. Note vb ¼ va.

Dependent sources model the situation in which the voltage or current of one circuit element is
proportional to the voltage or current of the second circuit element. (In contrast, a resistor is a circuit
element in which the voltage of the element is proportional to the current in the same element.)
Dependent sources are used to model electronic devices such as transistors and ampliﬁers. For example,
the output voltage of an ampliﬁer is proportional to the input voltage of that ampliﬁer, so an ampliﬁer
can be modeled as a dependent source.
Figure 2.7-1a shows a circuit that includes a dependent source. The diamond symbol represents a
dependent source. The plus and minus signs inside the diamond identify the dependent source as a
voltage source and indicate the reference polarity of the element voltage. The label “5i” represents the
voltage of this dependent source. This voltage is a product of two factors, 5 and i. The second factor, i,
indicates that the voltage of this dependent source is controlled by the current, i, in the 18-V resistor.
The ﬁrst factor, 5, is the gain of this dependent source. The gain of this dependent source is the ratio of
the controlled voltage, 5i, to the controlling current, i. This gain has units of V=A or V. Because this
dependent source is a voltage source and because a current controls the voltage, the dependent source is
called a current-controlled voltage source (CCVS).
Figure 2.7-1b shows the circuit from 2.7-1a, using a different point of view. In Figure 2.7-1b, a
short circuit has been inserted in series with the 18-V resistor. Now we think of the controlling current i
as the current in a short circuit rather than the current in the 18-V resistor itself. In this way, we can

always treat the controlling current of a dependent source as the current in a short circuit. We will use
this second point of view to categorize dependent sources in this section.
Figure 2.7-1c shows a circuit that includes a dependent source, represented by the diamond
symbol. The arrow inside the diamond identiﬁes the dependent source as a current source and indicates
the reference direction of the element current. The label “0.2v” represents the current of this dependent
source. This current is a product of two factors, 0.2 and v. The second factor, v, indicates that the current
of this dependent source is controlled by the voltage, v, across the 18-V resistor. The ﬁrst factor, 0.2, is
the gain of this dependent source. The gain of this dependent source is the ratio of the controlled current,
0.2v, to the controlling voltage, v. This gain has units of A/V. Because this dependent source is a current
source and because a voltage controls the current, the dependent source is called a voltage-controlled
current source (VCCS).

We are now ready to categorize dependent source. Each dependent source consists of two parts:
the controlling part and the controlled part. The controlling part is either an open circuit or a short circuit.
The controlled part is either a voltage source or a current source. There are four types of dependent source

sources are called the voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS), current-controlled voltage source
(CCVS), voltage-controlled current source (VCCS), and current-controlled current source (CCCS).
The symbols that represent dependent sources are shown in Table 2.7-1.
Consider the CCVS shown in Table 2.7-1. The controlling element is a short circuit. The element
current and voltage of the controlling element are denoted as ic and vc. The voltage across a short circuit
is zero, so vc ¼ 0. The short-circuit current, ic, is the controlling signal of this dependent source. The
controlled element is a voltage source. The element current and voltage of the controlled element are
denoted as id and vd. The voltage vd is controlled by ic:
vd ¼ ric
The constant r is called the gain of the CCVS. The current id, like the current in any voltage source, is
determined by the rest of the circuit.
Next, consider the VCVS shown in Table 2.7-1. The controlling element is an open circuit. The
current in an open circuit is zero, so ic ¼ 0. The open-circuit voltage, vc, is the controlling signal of this
dependent source. The controlled element is a voltage source. The voltage vd is controlled by vc:
vd ¼ bvc
The constant b is called the gain of the VCVS. The current id is determined by the rest of the circuit.
The controlling element of the VCCS shown in Table 2.7-1 is an open circuit. The current in this
open circuit is ic ¼ 0. The open-circuit voltage, vc, is the controlling signal of this dependent source. The
controlled element is a current source. The current id is controlled by vc:
id ¼ gvc
The constant g is called the gain of the VCCS. The voltage vd, like the voltage across any current source,
is determined by the rest of the circuit.
The controlling element of the CCCS shown in Table 2.7-1 is a short circuit. The voltage across this
short circuit is vc ¼ 0. The short-circuit current, ic, is the controlling signal of this dependent source. The
controlled element is a current source. The current id is controlled by ic:

Figure 2.7-2 illustrates the use of dependent sources to model electronic devices. In certain
circumstances, the behavior of the transistor shown in Figure 2.7-2a can be represented using the
model shown in Figure 2.7-2b. This model consists of a dependent source and a resistor. The
controlling element of the dependent source is an open circuit connected across the resistor.
The controlling voltage is vbe. The gain of the dependent source is gm. The dependent source is
used in this model to represent a property of the transistor, namely, that the current ic is proportional to the
voltage vbe, that is,
ic ¼ gmvbe
where gm has units of amperes/volt. Figures 2.7-2c and d illustrate the utility of this model.
Figure 2.7-2d is obtained from Figure 2.7-2c by replacing the transistor by the transistor model.

Power and Dependent Sources
Determine the power absorbed by the VCVS in Figure 2.7-3.
Solution
The VCVS consists of an open circuit and a controlled-voltage source. There is no current in the open circuit, so no
power is absorbed by the open circuit.
The voltage vc across the open circuit is the controlling signal of the VCVS. The voltmeter measures
vc to be

Transducers are devices that convert physical quantities to electrical quantities.
This section describes two transducers: potentiometers and temperature sensors.
Potentiometers convert position to resistance, and temperature sensors convert
temperature to current.
Figure 2.8-1a shows the symbol for the potentiometer. The potentiometer is a
resistor having a third contact, called the wiper, that slides along the resistor. Two
parameters, Rp and a, are needed to describe the potentiometer. The parameter Rp
speciﬁes the potentiometer resistance (Rp > 0). The parameter a represents the
wiper position and takes values in the range 0  a  1. The values a ¼ 0 and a ¼ 1
correspond to the extreme positions of the wiper.
Figure 2.8-1b shows a model for the potentiometer that consists of two resistors.
The resistances of these resistors depend on the potentiometer parameters Rp and a.
Frequently, the position of the wiper corresponds to the angular position of a
shaft connected to the potentiometer. Suppose y is the angle in degrees and 0  y 
360. Then,
a ¼ y
360
Temperature sensors, such as the AD590 manufactured by Analog Devices, are current
sources having current proportional to absolute temperature. Figure 2.8-3a shows the symbol used
to represent the temperature sensor. Figure 2.8-3b shows the circuit model of the temperature
sensor. For the temperature sensor to operate properly, the branch voltage v must satisfy the

When this condition is satisﬁed, the current, i, in microamps, is numerically equal to
the temperature T, in degrees Kelvin. The phrase numerically equal indicates that the current
and temperature have the same value but different units. This relationship can be expressed as
i ¼ k  T

Switches have two distinct states: open and closed. Ideally, a switch acts as a short circuit
when it is closed and as an open circuit when it is open.
Figures 2.9-1 and 2.9-2 show several types of switches. In each case, the time when
the switch changes state is indicated. Consider ﬁrst the single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switches
shown in Figure 2.9-1. The switch in Figure 2.9-1a is initially open. This switch changes state,
becoming closed, at time t ¼ 0 s. When this switch is modeled as an ideal switch, it is treated like an
open circuit when t < 0 s and like a short circuit when t > 0 s. The ideal switch changes state
instantaneously. The switch in Figure 2.9-1b is initially closed. This switch changes state, becoming
open, at time t ¼ 0 s.
Next, consider the single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) switch shown in Figure 2.9-1a. This SPDT
switch acts like two SPST switches, one between terminals c and a, another between terminals c and b.
Before t ¼ 0 s, the switch between c and a is closed and the switch between c and b is open. At t ¼ 0 s,
both switches change state; that is, the switch between a and c opens, and the switch between c and b
closes. Once again, the ideal switches are modeled as open circuits when they are open and as short
circuits when they are closed.
In some applications, it makes a difference whether the switch between c and b closes before,
or after, the switch between c and a opens. Different symbols are used to represent these two types
of single-pole, double-throw switch. The break-before-make switch is manufactured so that the
switch between c and b closes after the switch between c and a opens. The symbol for the break-
before-make switch is shown in Figure 2.9-2a. The make-before-break switch is manufactured so
that the switch between c and b closes before the switch between c and a opens. The symbol for
the make-before-break switch is shown in Figure 2.9-2b. Remember: the switch transition from
terminal a to terminal b is assumed to take place instantaneously. This instantaneous transition is
an accurate model when the actual make-before-break transition is very fast compared to the circuit
time response.

Figure 2.9-3 illustrates the use of open and short circuits for modeling ideal switches. In Figure 2.9-3a, a circuit

speciﬁcations have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-
entry errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able quickly to identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of

How Can We Check Voltage and Current Values?
The meters in the circuit of Figure 2.10-1 indicate that v1 ¼ 4 V, v2 ¼ 8 V and that i ¼ 1 A. How can we
check that the values of v1, v2, and i have been measured correctly? Let’s check the values of v1, v2, and i in
two ways:
(a)
Verify that the given values satisfy Ohm’s law for both resistors.
(b)
Verify that the power supplied by the voltage source is equal to the power absorbed by the resistors.

Solution
(a)
Consider the 8-V resistor. The current i ﬂows through this resistor from top to bottom. Thus, the current i and
the voltage v2 adhere to the passive convention. Therefore, Ohm’s law requires that v2 ¼ 8i. The values v2 ¼ 8
V and i ¼ 1 A satisfy this equation.
Next, consider the 4-V resistor. The current i ﬂows through this resistor from left to right. Thus, the
current i and the voltage v1 do not adhere to the passive convention. Therefore, Ohm’s law requires that
v1 ¼ 4(i). The values v1 ¼ 4 V and i ¼ 1 A satisfy this equation.
Thus, Ohm’s law is satisﬁed.
(b)
The current i ﬂows through the voltage source from bottom to top. Thus the current i and the voltage 12 V do
not adhere to the passive convention. Therefore, 12i ¼ 12(1) ¼ 12 W is the power supplied by the voltage
source. The power absorbed by the 4-V resistor is 4i2 ¼ 4(12) ¼ 4 W, and the power absorbed by the 8-V
resistor is 8i2 ¼ 8(12) ¼ 8 W. The power supplied by the voltage source is indeed equal to the power absorbed
by the resistors.

Temperature Sensor
Currentscanbemeasuredeasily,usingammeters.Atemperaturesensor,suchasAnalogDevices’AD590,canbeused
to measure temperature by converting temperature to current. Figure 2.11-1 shows a symbol used to represent a
temperature sensor. For this sensor to operate properly, the voltage v must satisfy the condition
4 volts  v  30 volts
When this condition is satisﬁed, the current i, in mA, is numerically equal to the temperature T, in 	K. The
phrase numerically equal indicates that the two variables have the same value but different units.
i ¼ k  T
where
k ¼ 1 mA
	K
The goal is to design a circuit using the AD590 to measure the temperature of a container of water. In addition
to the AD590 and an ammeter, several power supplies and an assortment of standard 2 percent resistors are
available. The power supplies are voltage sources. Power supplies having voltages of 10, 12, 15, 18, or 24 volts
are available.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
For the temperature transducer to operate properly, its element voltage must be between 4 volts and 30 volts. The
power supplies and resistors will be used to establish this voltage. An ammeter will be used to measure the current
in the temperature transducer.
The circuit must be able to measure temperatures in the range from 0	C to 100	C because water is a liquid at
these temperatures. Recall that the temperature in 	C is equal to the temperature in 	K minus 273	.
State the Goal
Use the power supplies and resistors to cause the voltage v of the temperature transducer to be between 4 volts
and 30 volts.
Use an ammeter to measure the current, i, in the temperature transducer.
Generate a Plan
Model the power supply as an ideal voltage source and the temperature transducer as an ideal current source. The
circuit shown in Figure 2.11-2a causes the voltage across the temperature transducer to be equal to the power
supply voltage. Because all of the available power supplies have voltages between 4 volts and 30 volts, any one of
the power supplies can be used. Notice that the resistors are not needed.
In Figure 2.11-2b, a short circuit has been added in a way that does not disturb the network. In Figure 2.11-2c,
this short circuit has been replaced with an (ideal) ammeter. Because the ammeter will measure the current in the
temperature transducer, the ammeter reading will be numerically equal to the temperature in 	K.

2. Circuit Elements

Although any of the available power supplies is adequate to meet the speciﬁcations, there may still be an
advantage to choosing a particular power supply. For example, it is reasonable to choose the power supply that
causes the transducer to absorb as little power as possible.
Act on the Plan
The power absorbed by the transducer is
p ¼ v  i
where v is the power supply voltage. Choosing v as small as possible, 10 volts in this case, makes the power
absorbed by the temperature transducer as small as possible. Figure 2.11-3a shows the ﬁnal design. Figure 2.11-3b
shows a graph that can be used to ﬁnd the temperature corresponding to any ammeter current.
Verify the Proposed Solution
Let’s try an example. Suppose the temperature of the water is 80.6	F. This temperature is equal to 27	C or 300	K.
The current in the temperature sensor will be
i ¼
1 mA
	K


300	K ¼ 300 mA
Next, suppose that the ammeter in Figure 2.11-3a reads 300 mA. A sensor current of 300 mA corresponds to a
temperature of
T ¼ 300 mA
1 mA
	K
¼ 300	K ¼ 27	C ¼ 80:6	F
The graph in Figure 2.11-3b indicates that a sensor current of 300 mA does correspond to a temperature of 27	C.
This example shows that the circuit is working properly.

The engineer uses models, called circuit elements, to repre-
sent the devices that make up a circuit. In this book, we
consider only linear elements or linear models of devices. A
device is linear if it satisﬁes the properties of both superpo-
sition and homogeneity.
The relationship between the reference directions of the
current and voltage of a circuit element is important. The
voltage polarity marks one terminal þ and the other . The
element voltage and current adhere to the passive convention
if the current is directed from the terminal marked þ to the
terminal marked .
Resistors are widely used as circuit elements. When the
resistor voltage and current adhere to the passive convention,
resistors obey Ohm’s law; the voltage across the terminals of
the resistor is related to the current into the positive terminal
as v ¼ Ri. The power delivered to a resistance is p ¼ i2R ¼
v2=R watts.
An independent source provides a current or a voltage
independent of other circuit variables. The voltage of an
independent voltage source is speciﬁed, but the current is
not. Conversely, the current of an independent current source
is speciﬁed whereas the voltage is not. The voltages of
independent voltage sources and currents of independent
current sources are frequently used as the inputs to electric
circuits.
A dependent source provides a current (or a voltage) that is
dependent on another variable elsewhere in the circuit. The
constitutive equations of dependent sources are summarized
in Table 2.7-1.
The short circuit and open circuit are special cases of inde-
pendent sources. A short circuit is an ideal voltage source
having v(t) ¼ 0. The current in a short circuit is determined by
the rest of the circuit. An open circuit is an ideal current source
having i(t) ¼ 0. The voltage across an open circuit is determined
by the rest of the circuit. Open circuits and short circuits can also
be described as special cases of resistors. A resistor with
resistance R ¼ 0 (G ¼ 1) is a short circuit. A resistor with
conductance G ¼ 0 (R ¼ 1) is an open circuit.
An ideal ammeter measures the current ﬂowing through its
terminals and has zero voltage across its terminals. An ideal
voltmeter measures the voltage across its terminals and has
terminal current equal to zero. Ideal voltmeters act like open
circuits, and ideal ammeters act like short circuits.
Transducers are devices that convert physical quantities,
such as rotational position, to an electrical quantity such
as voltage. In this chapter, we describe two transducers:
potentiometers and temperature sensors.
Switches are widely used in circuits to connect and disconnect
elements and circuits. An open switch is modeled as an open
circuit and a closed switch is modeled as a short circuit.

Figure P 2.6-3b, the voltmeter is replaced by the model of an ideal
voltmeter, an open circuit. Ideally, there is no current in the 100-V
resistor, and the voltmeter measures vmi = 12 V, the ideal value of
vm. In Figure P 2.6-3c, the voltmeter is modeled by the resistance
Rm. Now the voltage measured by the voltmeter is

error caused by the fact that the voltmeter is not ideal.

In this chapter, we will do the following:
 Write equations using Kirchhoff’s laws.
Not surprisingly, the behavior of an electric circuit is determined both by the types of
elements that comprise the circuit and by the way those elements are connected together. The
constitutive equations describe the elements themselves, and Kirchhoff’s laws describe the way the
elements are connected to each other to form the circuit.
 Analyze simple electric circuits, using only Kirchhoff’s laws and the constitutive equations of the
circuit elements.
 Analyze two very common circuit conﬁgurations: series resistors and parallel resistors.
We will see that series resistors act like a “voltage divider,” and parallel resistors act like a “current
divider.” Also, series resistors and parallel resistors provide our first examples of an “equivalent circuit.”
Figure 3.1-1 illustrates this important concept. Here, a circuit has been partitioned into two parts, A and B.
Replacing B by an equivalent circuit, Beq, does not change the current or voltage of any circuit element
in part A. It is in this sense that Beq is equivalent to B. We will see how to obtain an equivalent circuit when
part B consists either of series resistors or of parallel resistors.
 Determine equivalent circuits for series voltage sources and parallel current sources.
 Determine the equivalent resistance of a resistive circuit.
Often, circuits consisting entirely of resistors can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor by
repeatedly replacing series and/or parallel resistors by equivalent resistors.

An electric circuit consists of circuit elements that are connected together. The places where the
elements are connected to each other are called nodes. Figure 3.2-1a shows an electric circuit
that consists of six elements connected together at four nodes. It is common practice to draw electric
circuits using straight lines and to position the elements horizontally or vertically as shown in Figure
3.2-1b.
The circuit is shown again in Figure 3.2-1c, this time emphasizing the nodes. Notice that
redrawing the circuit, using straight lines and horizontal and vertical elements, has changed the way
that the nodes are represented. In Figure 3.2-1a, nodes are represented as points. In Figures 3.2-1b,c,
nodes are represented using both points and straight-line segments.
The same circuit can be drawn in several ways. One drawing of a circuit might look much
different from another drawing of the same circuit. How can we tell when two circuit drawings represent
the same circuit? Informally, we say that two circuit drawings represent the same circuit if

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of drawing A and the nodes of drawing B.
(A one-to-one correspondence is a matching. In this one-to-one correspondence, each node in

not important.)

Kirchhoff’s Laws
55

In 1847, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, a professor at the University of Berlin, formulated
two important laws that provide the foundation for analysis of electric circuits. These laws are
referred to as Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) in his honor.
Kirchhoff’s laws are a consequence of conservation of charge and conservation of energy.
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff is pictured in Figure 3.2-3.
Kirchhoff’s current law states that the algebraic sum of the currents entering any node is
identically zero for all instants of time.
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL): The algebraic sum of the currents into a node at
any instant is zero.
The phrase algebraic sum indicates that we must take reference directions into account as
we add up the currents of elements connected to a particular node. One way to take
reference directions into account is to use a plus sign when the current is directed away from
the node and a minus sign when the current is directed toward the node. For example,
consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.2-1c. Four elements of this circuit—elements 1, 2, 3,
and 4—are connected to node a. By Kirchhoff’s current law, the algebraic sum of the
element currents i1, i2, i3, and i4 must be zero. Currents i2 and i3 are directed away from
node a, so we will use a plus sign for i2 and i3. In contrast, currents i1 and i4 are directed toward node
a, so we will use a minus sign for i1 and i4. The KCL equation for node a of Figure 3.2-1c is
i1 þ i2 þ i3  i4 ¼ 0
(3.2-1)
An alternate way of obtaining the algebraic sum of the currents into a node is to set the sum of all
the currents directed away from the node equal to the sum of all the currents directed toward that node.
Using this technique, we ﬁnd that the KCL equation for node a of Figure 3.2-1c is
i2 þ i3 ¼ i1 þ i4
(3.2-2)
Clearly, Eqs. 3.2-1 and 3.2-2 are equivalent.
Solution
The circuit drawing shown in Figure 3.2-2a has ﬁve nodes, labeled r, s, t, u, and v. The circuit drawing in Figure
3.2-1c has four nodes. Because the two drawings have different numbers of nodes, there cannot be a one-to-one
correspondence between the nodes of the two drawings. Hence, these drawings represent different circuits.
The circuit drawing shown in Figure 3.2-2b has four nodes and six elements, the same numbers of nodes and
elements as the circuit drawing in Figure 3.2-1c. The nodes in Figure 3.2-2b have been labeled in the same way as the
corresponding nodes in Figure 3.2-1c. For example, node c in Figure 3.2-2b corresponds to node c in Figure 3.2-1c.
The elements in Figure 3.2-2b have been labeled in the same way as the corresponding elements in Figure 3.2-1c. For
example, element 5 in Figure 3.2-2b corresponds to element 5 in Figure 3.2-1c. Corresponding elements are indeed
connected to corresponding nodes. For example, element 2 is connected to nodes a and b, in both Figure 3.2-2b and in
Figure 3.2-1c. Consequently, Figure 3.2-2b and Figure 3.2-1c represent the same circuit.
The circuit drawing shown in Figure 3.2-2c has four nodes and six elements, the same number of nodes and
elements as the circuit drawing in Figure 3.2-1c. The nodes and elements in Figure 3.2-2c have been labeled in the
same way as the corresponding nodes and elements in Figure 3.2-1c. Corresponding elements are indeed connected
to corresponding nodes. Therefore, Figure 3.2-2c and Figure 3.2-1c represent the same circuit.
The circuit drawing shown in Figure 3.2-2d has four nodes and six elements, the same numbers of nodes and
elements as the circuit drawing in Figure 3.2-1c. However, the nodes and elements of Figure 3.2-2d cannot be
labeled so that corresponding elements of Figure 3.2-1c are connected to corresponding nodes. (For example, in
Figure 3.2-1c, three elements are connected between the same pair of nodes, a and b. That does not happen in
Figure 3.2-2d.) Consequently, Figure 3.2-2d and Figure 3.2-1c represent different circuits.

3. Resistive Circuits

Similarly, the Kirchhoff’s current law equation for node b of Figure 3.2-1c is
i1 ¼ i2 þ i3 þ i6
Before we can state Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we need the deﬁnition of a loop. A loop is a closed
path through a circuit that does not encounter any intermediate node more than once. For example,
starting at node a in Figure 3.2-1c, we can move through element 4 to node c, then through element 5 to
node d, through element 6 to node b, and ﬁnally through element 3 back to node a. We have a closed
path, and we did not encounter any of the intermediate nodes—b, c, or d—more than once.
Consequently, elements 3, 4, 5, and 6 comprise a loop. Similarly, elements 1, 4, 5, and 6 comprise
a loop of the circuit shown in Figure 3.2-1c. Elements 1 and 3 comprise yet another loop of this circuit.
The circuit has three other loops: elements 1 and 2, elements 2 and 3, and elements 2, 4, 5, and 6.
We are now ready to state Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL): The algebraic sum of the voltages around any loop in a
circuit is identically zero for all time.
The phrase algebraic sum indicates that we must take polarity into account as we add up the voltages of
elements that comprise a loop. One way to take polarity into account is to move around the loop in the
clockwise direction while observing the polarities of the element voltages. We write the voltage with a
plus sign when we encounter the þ of the voltage polarity before the . In contrast, we write the voltage
with a minus sign when we encounter the  of the voltage polarity before the þ. For example, consider
the circuit shown in Figure 3.2-1c. Elements 3, 4, 5, and 6 comprise a loop of the circuit. By Kirchhoff’s
voltage law, the algebraic sum of the element voltages v3, v4, v5, and v6 must be zero. As we move
around the loop in the clockwise direction, we encounter the þ of v4 before the , the  of v5 before
the þ, the  of v6 before the þ, and the  of v3 before the þ. Consequently, we use a minus sign for
v3, v5, and v6 and a plus sign for v4. The KCL equation for this loop of Figure 3.2-1c is
v4  v5  v6  v3 ¼ 0
Similarly, the Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation for the loop consisting of elements 1, 4, 5, and 6 is
v4  v5  v6 þ v1 ¼ 0
The Kirchhoff’s voltage law equation for the loop consisting of elements 1 and 2 is
v2 þ v1 ¼ 0

INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.2-4a. Determine the power supplied by element C and the power received by
element D.
Solution
Figure 3.2-4a provides a value for the current in element C but not for the voltage v across element C. The voltage and
current of element C given in Figure 3.2-4a adhere to the passive convention, so the product of this voltage and current
is the power received by element C. Figure 3.2-4a provides a value for the voltage across element D but not for the
current i in element D. The voltage and current of element D given in Figure 3.2-4a do not adhere to the passive
convention, so the product of this voltage and current is the power supplied by element D.
We need to determine the voltage v across element C and the current i in element D. We will use Kirchhoff’s laws to
determine values of v and i. First, we identify and label the nodes of the circuit as shown in Figure 3.2-4b.

Let’s see what information we can obtain using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws. Applying Ohm’s law to each of

v 1 tð Þ ¼ 10i 1 tð Þ; v o tð Þ ¼ 25i2 tð Þ and v 3 tð Þ ¼ 15i 3 tð Þ
(3.2-3)
Apply KCL at node a and also at node c to get

Apply KVL to the loop consisting of the voltage source, 10-V resistor, and the capacitor to get

Apply KVL to the loop consisting of the capacitor, 25-V resistor, and the 15-V resistor to get

Let us consider a single-loop circuit, as shown in Figure 3.3-1. In anticipation of using Ohm’s
law, the passive convention has been used to assign reference directions to resistor voltages
and currents.
The connection of resistors in Figure 3.3-1 is said to be a series connection because
all the elements carry the same current. To identify a pair of series elements, we look for
two elements connected to a single node that has no other elements connected to it. Notice,
for example, that resistors R1 and R2 are both connected to node b and that no other
circuit elements are connected to node b. Consequently, i1 ¼ i2, so both resistors have the
same current. A similar argument shows that resistors R2 and R3 are also connected in
series. Noticing that R2 is connected in series with both R1 and R3, we say that all three
resistors are connected in series. The order of series resistors is not important. For example,
the voltages and currents of the three resistors in Figure 3.3-1 will not change if we
interchange the positions R2 and R3.
Using KCL at each node of the circuit in Figure 3.3-1, we obtain
a: is ¼ i1
b: i1 ¼ i2
c: i2 ¼ i3
d: i3 ¼ is
Consequently,
is ¼ i1 ¼ i2 ¼ i3
To determine i1, we use KVL around the loop to obtain
v1 þ v2 þ v3  vs ¼ 0
where, for example, v1 is the voltage across the resistor R1. Using Ohm’s law for each resistor,
R1i1 þ R2i2 þ R2i3  vs ¼ 0 ) R1i1 þ R2i1 þ R2i1 ¼ vs

Thus, the voltage across the nth resistor Rn is vn and can be obtained as
vn ¼ i1Rn ¼
vsRn
R1 þ R2 þ R3
For example, the voltage across resistor R2 is
v2 ¼
R2
R1 þ R2 þ R3
vs
Thus, the voltage across the series combination of resistors is divided up between the individual
resistors in a predictable way. This circuit demonstrates the principle of voltage division, and the circuit
is called a voltage divider.
In general, we may represent the voltage divider principle by the equation
vn ¼
Rn
R1 þ R2 þ    þ RN
vs
where vn is the voltage across the nth resistor of N resistors connected in series.
We can replace series resistors by an equivalent resistor. This is illustrated in Figure 3.3-2.
The series resistors R1, R2, and R3 in Figure 3.3-2a are replaced by a single, equivalent resistor
Rs in Figure 3.3-2b. Rs is said to be equivalent to the series resistors R1, R2, and R3 when replacing R1,
R2, and R3 by Rs does not change the current or voltage of any other element of the circuit. In this case,
there is only one other element in the circuit, the voltage source. We must choose the value of the
resistance Rs so that replacing R1, R2, and R3 by Rs will not change the current of the voltage source.
In Figure 3.3-2a, we have
is ¼
vs
R1 þ R2 þ R3
In Figure 3.3-2b, we have
is ¼ vs
Rs
Because the voltage source current must be the same in both circuits, we require that
Rs ¼ R1 þ R2 þ R3
In general, the series connection of N resistors having resistances R1, R2 . . . RN is equivalent to the
single resistor having resistance
Rs ¼ R1 þ R2 þ    þ RN
Replacing series resistors by an equivalent resistor does not change the current or voltage of any other
element of the circuit.

given by

Notice that the voltage vb in Figure 3.3-3b is the same voltage as the voltage v2 in Figure 3.3-3a, except for

As a check, noticing that the current i and voltage vb in Figure 3.3-3b do not adhere to the passive convention,
we write

Circuit elements, such as resistors, are connected in parallel when the voltage across each element is
identical. The resistors in Figure 3.4-1 are connected in parallel. Notice, for example, that resistors R1
and R2 are each connected to both node a and node b. Consequently, v1 ¼ v2, so both resistors have the
same voltage. A similar argument shows that resistors R2 and R3 are also connected in parallel. Noticing
that R2 is connected in parallel with both R1 and R3, we say that all three resistors are connected in
parallel. The order of parallel resistors is not important. For example, the voltages and currents of the
three resistors in Figure 3.4-1 will not change if we interchange the positions R2 and R3.
The deﬁning characteristic of parallel elements is that they have the same voltage. To identify a
pair of parallel elements, we look for two elements connected between the same pair of nodes.
Consider the circuit with two resistors and a current source shown in Figure 3.4-2. Note that

Figure 3.4-7b shows the circuit after the ideal voltmeter has been replaced by the equivalent open circuit, and a

Figure 3.4-7c shows the circuit after the parallel resistors have been replaced by the equivalent resistor. The
current in the equivalent resistor is 250 mA, directed upward. This current and the voltage vm do not adhere to the
passive convention. The current in the equivalent resistance can also be expressed as 250 mA, directed

The voltage vm in Figure 3.4-7b is equal to the voltage vm in Figure 3.4-7c. This is a consequence of
the equivalence of the 8-V resistor to the parallel combination of the 40-V and 10-V resistors. Looking at
Figure 3.4-7b, we see that the power absorbed by the resistors is

single, equivalent voltage source does not change the voltage or current of other elements of the
circuit.

source. The current of the equivalent current source is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents of
the parallel current sources.
We are not allowed to connect independent current sources in series. Series elements have
the same current. This restriction prevents series current sources from being independent.
Similarly, we are not allowed to connect independent voltage sources in parallel.

C i r c u i t A n a l y s i s
In this section, we consider the analysis of a circuit by replacing a set of resistors with an equivalent
resistance, thus reducing the network to a form easily analyzed.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.6-1. Note that it includes a set of resistors that is connected
in series and another set of resistors that is connected in parallel. It is desired to ﬁnd the output voltage
vo, so we wish to reduce the circuit to the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 3.6-2.
We note that the equivalent series resistance is
Rs ¼ R1 þ R2 þ R3
and the equivalent parallel resistance is
Rp ¼ 1
Gp
where
Gp ¼ G4 þ G5 þ G6
Then, using the voltage divider principle, with Figure 3.6-2, we have
vo ¼
Rp
Rs þ Rp
vs
Replacing the series resistors by the equivalent resistor Rs did not change the current or voltage of
any other circuit element. In particular, the voltage vo did not change. Also, the voltage vo across the
equivalent resistor Rp is equal to the voltage across each of the parallel resistors. Consequently, the
voltage vo in Figure 3.6-2 is equal to the voltage vo in Figure 3.6-1. We can analyze the simple circuit
in Figure 3.6-2 to ﬁnd the value of the voltage vo and know that the voltage vo in the more
complicated circuit shown in Figure 3.6-1 has the same value.
In general, we may ﬁnd the equivalent resistance for a portion of a circuit consisting only of
resistors and then replace that portion of the circuit with the equivalent resistance. For example,
consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.6-3. The resistive circuit in (a) is equivalent to the single 56 V
resistor in (b). Let’s denote the equivalent resistance as Req. We say that Req is “the equivalent resistance
seen looking into the circuit of Figure 3.6-3a from terminals a-b.” Figure 3.6-3c shows a notation used
to indicate the equivalent resistance. Equivalent resistance is an important concept that occurs in a
variety of situations and has a variety of names. “Input resistance,” “output resistance,” “Thevenin
resistance,” and “Norton resistance” are some names used for equivalent resistance.
These equations suggest that we replace the series voltage sources by a single 46-V source and replace the parallel
current sources by a single 1.5-A source. Figure 3.5-3d shows the result.
Notice that
v2  46 ¼ 0
is the KVL equation corresponding to the left mesh of the circuit in Figure 3.5-3d and
i1 ¼ 1:5
is the KCL equation corresponding to the right node of the 20 V to Figure 3.5-3d.

Figure 3.6-5c shows the circuit as it was before replacing the parallel 500- and 750-V resistors by an equivalent
resistor. Replacing these parallel resistors by an equivalent resistance did not change the current in the 200-V
resistor so the current in the 200-V in Figure 3.6-5d is labeled as i1. Also, the voltage across the equivalent
300-V resistor is equal to the voltage across the individual 500- and 750-V parallel resistors. Consequently,
the voltage labeled v2 in Figure 3.6-5c is equal to the voltage labeled v2 in Figure 3.6-5b.

Because the circuits are equivalent, the values of v1, v2, and i in Figure 3.6-7 are equal to the values of v1,
v2, and i in Figure 3.6-8. Use voltage and current division to determine the values of i3, v4, i5, and v6 in
Figure 3.6-7.
Step 1: Figure 3.6-9a shows the three resistors at the top of the circuit in Figure 3.6-7. We see that the 6-V
resistor is connected in series with the 18-V resistor. In Figure 3.6-9b, these series resistors have been replaced by
the equivalent 24-V resistor. Now the 24-V resistor is connected in parallel with the 12-V resistor. Replacing series
resistors by an equivalent resistance does not change the voltage or current in any other element of the circuit. In
particular, v1, the voltage across the 12-V resistor, does not change when the series resistors are replaced by the
equivalent resistor. In contrast, v4 is not an element voltage of the circuit shown in Figure 3.6-9b.
In Figure 3.6-9c, the parallel resistors have been replaced by the equivalent 8-V resistor. The voltage across
the equivalent resistor is equal to the voltage across each of the parallel resistors, v1 in this case. In summary, the
resistance R1 in Figure 3.6-8 is given by

FIGURE 3.7-2 The circuit from Figure 3.7-1 after labeling the
resistor voltages and currents.
Solution
Let’s label the resistor voltages and currents. In anticipation of using Ohm’s law, we will label the voltage and
current of each resistor to adhere to the passive convention. (Pick one of the variables—the resistor current or the
resistor voltage—and label the reference direction however you like. Label the reference direction of the other
variable to adhere to the passive convention with the ﬁrst variable.) Figure 3.7-2 shows the labeled circuit.
Next, we will use Kirchhoff’s laws. First, apply KCL to the node at which the current source and the 40-V,
48-V, and 80-V resistors are connected together to write
i2 þ i5 ¼ 0:5 þ i4
(3.7-1)
Next, apply KCL to the node at which the 48-V and 32-V resistors are connected together to write
i5 ¼ i6
(3.7-2)
Apply KVL to the loop consisting of the voltage source and the 40-V and 80-V resistors to write
12 ¼ v2 þ v4
(3.7-3)
Apply KVL to the loop consisting of the 48-V, 32-V, and 80-V resistors to write
v4 þ v5 þ v6 ¼ 0
(3.7-4)
Apply Ohm’s law to the resistors.
v2 ¼ 40 i2; v4 ¼ 80 i4; v5 ¼ 48 i5; v6 ¼ 32 i6
(3.7-5)
We can use the Ohm’s law equations to eliminate the variables representing resistor voltages. Doing so enables us
to rewrite Eq. 3.7-3 as:
12 ¼ 40 i2 þ 80 i4
(3.7-6)
Similarly, we can rewrite Eq. 3.7-4 as
80 i4 þ 48 i5 þ 32 i6 ¼ 0
(3.7-7)
Next, use Eq. 3.7-2 to eliminate i6 from Eq. 3.7-6 as follows
80 i4 þ 48 i5 þ 32 i5 ¼ 0
)
80 i4 þ 80 i5 ¼ 0

Use Eq. 3.7-8 to eliminate i5 from Eq. 3.7-1.
i2  i4 ¼ 0:5 þ i4

i2 ¼ 0:5 þ 2 i4

We can avoid some algebra if we are willing to solve simultaneous equations.
After applying Kirchhoff’s laws and then using the Ohm’s law equations to eliminate the variables
representing resistor voltages, we have Eqs. 3.7-1, 2, 6, and 7:
i2 þ i5 ¼ 0:5 þ i4; i5 ¼ i6; 12 ¼ 40 i2 þ 80 i4;
and

A circuit consisting of n elements has n currents and n voltages. A set of equations representing that
circuit could have as many as 2n unknowns. We can reduce the number of unknowns by labeling the
currents and voltages carefully. For example, suppose two of the circuit elements are connected in series.
We can choose the reference directions for the currents in those elements so that they are equal and use one
variable to represent both currents. Table 3.7-1 presents some guidelines that will help us reduce the
number of unknowns in the set of equations describing a given circuit.
This set of four simultaneous equations in i2, i4, i5, and i6 can be written as a single matrix equation.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct.
For example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the
speciﬁcations have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against
data-entry errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

How Can We Check Voltage and Current Values?
The circuit shown in Figure 3.8-1a was analyzed by writing and solving a set of simultaneous equations:
12 ¼ v2 þ 4i3; i4 ¼ v2
5 þ i3; v5 ¼ 4i3; and v5
2 ¼ i4 þ 5i4
The computer program Mathcad (Mathcad User’s Guide, 1991) was used to solve the equations as shown in
Figure 3.8-1b. It was determined that
v2 ¼ 60 V; i3 ¼ 18 A; i4 ¼ 6 A; and v5 ¼ 72 V:
How can we check that these currents and voltages are correct?

3. Resistive Circuits

Solution
The current i2 can be calculated from v2, i3, i4, and v5 in a couple of different ways. First, Ohm’s law gives
i2 ¼ v2
5 ¼ 60
5
¼ 12 A
Next, applying KCL at node b gives
i2 ¼ i3 þ i4 ¼ 18 þ 6 ¼ 24 A
Clearly, i2 cannot be both 12 and 24 A, so the values calculated for v2, i3, i4, and v5 cannot be correct. Checking
the equations used to calculate v2, i3, i4, and v5, we ﬁnd a sign error in the KCL equation corresponding to
node b. This equation should be
i4 ¼ v2
5  i3
After making this correction, v2, i3, i4, and v5 are calculated to be
v2 ¼ 7:5 V; i3 ¼ 1:125 A; i4 ¼ 0:375 A; v5 ¼ 4:5 V
Now
i2 ¼ v2
5 ¼ 7:5
5 ¼ 1:5 A
and
i2 ¼ i3 þ i4 ¼ 1:125 þ 0:375 ¼ 1:5 A
This checks as we expected.
As an additional check, consider v3. First, Ohm’s law gives
v3 ¼ 4i3 ¼ 4(1:125) ¼ 4:5 V
Next, applying KVL to the loop consisting of the voltage source and the 4-V and 5-V resistors gives
v3 ¼ 12  v2 ¼ 12  7:5 ¼ 4:5 V
Finally, applying KVL to the loop consisting of the 2-V and 4-V resistors gives
v3 ¼ v5 ¼ 4:5 V
The results of these calculations agree with each other, indicating that
v2 ¼ 7:5 V; i3 ¼ 1:125 A; i4 ¼ 0:375 A; v5 ¼ 4:5 V
are the correct values.

Adjustable Voltage Source
A circuit is required to provide an adjustable voltage. The speciﬁcations for this circuit are that:
1.
It should be possible to adjust the voltage to any value between 5 V and þ5 V. It should not be possible
accidentally to obtain a voltage outside this range.
2.
The load current will be negligible.
3.
The circuit should use as little power as possible.
The available components are:
1.
Potentiometers: resistance values of 10 kV, 20 kV, and 50 kV are in stock.
2.
A large assortment of standard 2 percent resistors having values between 10 V and 1 MV (see Appendix D).
3.
Two power supplies (voltage sources): one 12-V supply and one 12-V supply, both rated at 100 mA
(maximum).
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
Figure 3.9-1 shows the situation. The voltage v is the adjustable voltage. The circuit that uses the
output of the circuit being designed is frequently called the load. In this case, the load current is negligible,
so i ¼ 0.

State the Goal
A circuit providing the adjustable voltage
5V  v  þ5V
must be designed using the available components.
Generate a Plan
Make the following observations.
1.
The adjustability of a potentiometer can be used to obtain an adjustable voltage v.
2.
Both power supplies must be used so that the adjustable voltage can have both positive and negative
values.
3.
The terminals of the potentiometer cannot be connected directly to the power supplies because the voltage v is
not allowed to be as large as 12 V or 12 V.
These observations suggest the circuit shown in Figure 3.9-2a. The circuit in Figure 3.9-2b is obtained by using the
simplest model for each component in Figure 3.9-2a.

To complete the design, values need to be speciﬁed for R1, R2, and Rp. Then several results need to be checked
and adjustments made, if necessary.
1.
Can the voltage v be adjusted to any value in the range 5 V to þ5V?
2.
Are the voltage source currents less than 100 mA? This condition must be satisﬁed if the power supplies are to
be modeled as ideal voltage sources.
3.
Is it possible to reduce the power absorbed by R1, R2, and Rp?
Act on the Plan
It seems likely that R1 and R2 will have the same value, so let R1 ¼ R2 ¼ R. Then it is convenient to redraw Figure

Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum
of the currents entering a node is zero. Kirchhoff’s voltage
law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of the voltages
around a closed path (loop) is zero.
Simple electric circuits can be analyzed using only Kirchhoff’s
laws and the constitutive equations of the circuit elements.
Series resistors act like a “voltage divider,” and parallel
resistors act like a “current divider.” The ﬁrst two rows of
Table 3.10-1 summarize the relevant equations.
Series resistors are equivalent to a single “equivalent resis-
tor.” Similarly, parallel resistors are equivalent to a single
“equivalent resistor.” The ﬁrst two rows of Table 3.10-1

body. A person can be modeled as a network of resistances.
Consider the model circuit shown in Figure P 3.6-8. Determine
the voltage developed across the heart and the current ﬂowing
through the heart of the person when he or she ﬁrmly grasps one
end of a voltage source whose other end is connected to the

current ﬂow equal to Rf, and the person is standing barefoot on

I n t r o d u c t i o n
To analyze an electric circuit, we write and solve a set of equations. We apply Kirchhoff’s current and
voltage laws to get some of the equations. The constitutive equations of the circuit elements, such as
Ohm’s law, provide the remaining equations. The unknown variables are element currents and voltages.
Solving the equations provides the values of the element current and voltages.
This method works well for small circuits, but the set of equations can get quite large for even
moderate-sized circuits. A circuit with only 6 elements has 6 element currents and 6 element voltages.
We could have 12 equations in 12 unknowns. In this chapter, we consider two methods for writing a
smaller set of simultaneous equations:
 The node voltage method.
 The mesh current method.
The node voltage method uses a new type of variable called the node voltage. The “node voltage
equations” or, more simply, the “node equations,” are a set of simultaneous equations that represent a
given electric circuit. The unknown variables of the node voltage equations are the node voltages. After
solving the node voltage equations, we determine the values of the element currents and voltages from
the values of the node voltages.
It’s easier to write node voltage equations for some types of circuit than for others. Starting with
the easiest case, we will learn how to write node voltage equations for circuits that consist of:
 Resistors and independent current sources.
 Resistors and independent current and voltage sources.
 Resistors and independent and dependent voltage and current sources.
The mesh current method uses a new type of variable called the mesh current. The “mesh current
equations” or, more simply, the “mesh equations,” are a set of simultaneous equations that represent a
114

given electric circuit. The unknown variables of the mesh current equations are the mesh currents. After
solving the mesh current equations, we determine the values of the element currents and voltages from
the values of the mesh currents.

w i t h C u r r e n t S o u r c e s
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 4.2-1a. This circuit contains four elements: three resistors and a
current source. The nodes of a circuit are the places where the elements are connected together. The
circuit shown in Figure 4.2-1a has three nodes. It is customary to draw the elements horizontally or
vertically and to connect these elements by horizontal and vertical lines that represent wires. In other
words, nodes are drawn as points or are drawn using horizontal or vertical lines. Figure 4.2-1b shows
the same circuit, redrawn so that all three nodes are drawn as points rather than lines. In Figure 4.2-1b,
the nodes are labeled as node a, node b, and node c.
Analyzing a connected circuit containing n. nodes will require n  1 KCL equations. One way to
obtain these equations is to apply KCL at each node of the circuit except for one. The node at which
KCL is not applied is called the reference node. Any node of the circuit can be selected to be the
reference node. We will often choose the node at the bottom of the circuit to be the reference node.
(When the circuit contains a grounded power supply, the ground node of the power supply is usually
selected as the reference node.) In Figure 4.2-1b, node c is selected as the reference node and marked
with the symbol used to identify the reference node.
The voltage at any node of the circuit, relative to the reference node, is called a node voltage. In
Figure 4.2-1b, there are two node voltages: the voltage at node a with respect to the reference node, node
c, and the voltage at node b, again with respect to the reference node, node c. In Figure 4.2-1c,
voltmeters are added to measure the node voltages. To measure node voltage at node a, connect the red

probe of the voltmeter at node a and connect the black probe at the reference node, node c. To measure
node voltage at node b, connect the red probe of the voltmeter at node b and connect the black probe at
the reference node, node c.
The node voltages in Figure 4.2-1c can be represented as vac and vbc, but it is conventional to drop
the subscript c and refer to these as va and vb. Notice that the node voltage at the reference node is
vcc ¼ vc ¼ 0 V because a voltmeter measuring the node voltage at the reference node would have both
probes connected to the same point.
One of the standard methods for analyzing an electric circuit is to write and solve a set of simultaneous
equations called the node equations. The unknown variables in the node equations are the node voltages of
the circuit. We determine the values of the node voltages by solving the node equations.
To write a set of node equations, we do two things:
1.
Express element currents as functions of the node voltages.
2.
Apply Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) at each of the nodes of the circuit except for the
reference node.
Consider the problem of expressing element currents as functions of the node voltages. Although our
goal is to express element currents as functions of the node voltages, we begin by expressing element
voltages as functions of the node voltages. Figure 4.2-2 shows how this is done. The voltmeters in
Figure 4.2-2 measure the node voltages v1 and v2 at the nodes of the circuit element. The element voltage
has been labeled as va. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the loop shown in Figure 4.2-2 gives
va ¼ v1  v2
This equation expresses the element voltage va as a function of the node voltages v1 and v2. (There is
an easy way to remember this equation. Notice the reference polarity of the element voltage va. The
element voltage is equal to the node voltage at the node near the þ of the reference polarity minus the
node voltage at the node near the  of the reference polarity.)
Now consider Figure 4.2-3. In Figure 4.2-3a, we use what we have learned to express the voltage
of a circuit element as a function of node voltages. The circuit element in Figure 4.2-3a could be
anything: a resistor, a current source, a dependent voltage source, and so on. In Figures 4.2-3b and c,
we consider speciﬁc types of circuit element. In Figure 4.2-3b, the circuit element is a voltage source.
The element voltage has been represented twice, once as the voltage source voltage Vs and once as a
function of the node voltages v1  v2. Noticing that the reference polarities for Vs and v1  v2 are the
same (both þ on the left), we write
Vs ¼ v1  v2
This is an important result. Whenever we have a voltage source connected between two nodes of a
circuit, we can express the voltage source voltage Vs as a function of the node voltages v1 and v2.

4. Methods of Analysis of Resistive Circuits

Frequently, we know the value of the voltage source voltage. For example, suppose that
Vs ¼ 12 V. Then
12 ¼ v1  v2
This equation relates the values of two of the node voltages.
Next, consider Figure 4.2-3c. In Figure 4.2-3c, the circuit element is a resistor. We will use Ohm’s
law to express the resistor current i as a function of the node voltages. First, we express the resistor
voltage as a function of the node voltages v1  v2. Noticing that the resistor voltage v1  v2 and the
current i adhere to the passive convention, we use Ohm’s law to write
i ¼ v1  v2
R
Frequently, we know the value of the resistance. For example, when R ¼ 8 V, this equation becomes
i ¼ v1  v2
8
This equation expresses the resistor current i as a function of the node voltages v1 and v2.
Next, let’s write node equations to represent the circuit shown in Figure 4.2-4a. The input to this circuit
is the current source current is. To write node equations, we will ﬁrst express the resistor currents as functions
of the node voltages and then apply Kirchhoff’s current law at nodes a and b. The resistor voltages are
expressed as functions of the node voltages in Figure 4.2-4b, and then the resistor currents are expressed as
functions of the node voltages in Figure 4.2-4c.

Such a circuit is shown in Figure 4.3-1. We immediately note that the source is connected between
terminal a and ground and, therefore,
va ¼ vs
Thus, va is known and only vb is unknown. We write the KCL equation at node b to obtain
is ¼ vb

However, va ¼ vs. Therefore,
is ¼ vb
R3
þ vb  vs

Then, solving for the unknown node voltage vb, we get
vb ¼ R2R3is þ R3vs
R2 þ R3
Next, let us consider the circuit of Figure 4.3-2, which includes a voltage source between two nodes.
Because the source voltage is known, use KVL to obtain
va  vb ¼ vs
or
va  vs ¼ vb
To account for the fact that the source voltage is known, we consider both node a and node b as
part of one larger node represented by the shaded ellipse shown in Figure 4.3-2. We require a larger
node because va and vb are dependent. This larger node is often called a supernode or a generalized
node. KCL says that the algebraic sum of the currents entering a supernode is zero. That means that we
apply KCL to a supernode in the same way that we apply KCL to a node.
A supernode consists of two nodes connected by an independent or a dependent voltage source.
We then can write the KCL equation at the supernode as
va

However, because va ¼ vs þ vb, we have

Method 1: Assign a name to the voltage source current. Apply KCL at both of the voltage source nodes.

Applying KCL at both nodes of the voltage source.

In this and succeeding sections, we consider the analysis of circuits using Kirchhoff’s voltage law
(KVL) around a closed path. A closed path or a loop is drawn by starting at a node and tracing a path
such that we return to the original node without passing an intermediate node more than once.
A mesh is a special case of a loop.
A mesh is a loop that does not contain any other loops within it.
Mesh current analysis is applicable only to planar networks. A planar circuit is one that can be
drawn on a plane, without crossovers. An example of a nonplanar circuit is shown in Figure 4.5-1, in
which the crossover is identiﬁed and cannot be removed by redrawing the circuit. For planar networks, the
meshes in the network look like windows. There are four meshes in the circuit shown in Figure 4.5-2.
They are identiﬁed as Mi. Mesh 2 contains the elements R3, R4, and R5. Note that the resistor R3 is common
to both mesh 1 and mesh 2.
We deﬁne a mesh current as the current through the elements constituting the mesh. Figure 4.5-3a
shows a circuit having two meshes with the mesh currents labeled as i1 and i2. We will use the convention of
a mesh current in the clockwise direction as shown in Figure 4.5-3a. In Figure 4.5-3b, ammeters have been
inserted into the meshes to measure the mesh currents.
One of the standard methods for analyzing an electric circuit is to write and solve a set of
simultaneous equations called the mesh equations. The unknown variables in the mesh equations are the
mesh currents of the circuit. We determine the values of the mesh currents by solving the mesh
equations.

4. Methods of Analysis of Resistive Circuits

To write a set of mesh equations, we do two things:
1.
Express element voltages as functions of the mesh currents.
2.
Apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) to each of the meshes of the circuit.
Consider the problem of expressing element voltages as functions of the mesh currents. Although
our goal is to express element voltages as functions of the mesh currents, we begin by expressing element
currents as functions of the mesh currents. Figure 4.5-3b shows how this is done. The ammeters in
Figure 4.5-3b measure the mesh currents, i1 and i2. Elements C and E are in the right mesh but not in the
left mesh. Apply Kirchhoff’s current law at node c and then at node f to see that the currents in elements
C and E are equal to the mesh current of the right mesh, i2, as shown in Figure 4.5-3b. Similarly, elements
A and D are only in the left mesh. The currents in elements A and D are equal to the mesh current of the left
mesh, i1, as shown in Figure 4.5-3b.
Element B is in both meshes. The current of element B has been labeled as ib. Applying
Kirchhoff’s current law at node b in Figure 4.5-3b gives
ib ¼ i1  i2
This equation expresses the element current ib as a function of the mesh currents i1 and i2.

Mesh Current Analysis with Independent Voltage Sources
129

Figure 4.5-4a shows a circuit element that is in two meshes. The current of the circuit element
is expressed as a function of the mesh currents of the two meshes. The circuit element in Figure 4.5-4a
could be anything: a resistor, a current source, a dependent voltage source, and so on. In Figures 4.5-4b
and c, we consider speciﬁc types of circuit element. In Figure 4.5-4b, the circuit element is a current
source. The element current has been represented twice, once as the current source current 3 A and once
as a function of the mesh currents i1  i2. Noticing that the reference directions for 3 A and i1  i2 are
different (one points up, the other points down), we write
3 ¼ i1  i2
This equation relates the values of two of the mesh currents.
Next consider Figure 4.5-4c. In Figure 4.5-4c, the circuit element is a resistor. We will use Ohm’s
law to express the resistor voltage v as functions of the mesh currents. First, we express the resistor
current as a function of the mesh currents i1  i2. Noticing that the resistor current i1  i2 and the voltage
v adhere to the passive convention, we use Ohm’s law to write
v ¼ R i1  i2
ð
Þ
Frequently, we know the value of the resistance. For example, when R ¼ 8 V, this equation becomes
v ¼ 8 i1  i2
ð
Þ
This equation expresses the resistor voltage v as a function of the mesh currents i1 and i2.
Next, let’s write mesh equations to represent the circuit shown in Figure 4.5-5a. The input to this
circuit is the voltage source voltage vs. To write mesh equations, we will ﬁrst express the resistor
voltages as functions of the mesh currents and then apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the meshes. The
resistor currents are expressed as functions of the mesh currents in Figure 4.5-5b, and then the resistor
voltages are expressed as functions of the mesh currents in Figure 4.5-5c.
We may use Kirchhoff’s voltage law around each mesh. We will use the following convention for
obtaining the algebraic sum of voltages around a mesh. We will move around the mesh in the clockwise
direction. If we encounter the þ sign of the voltage reference polarity of an element voltage before the 
sign, we add that voltage. Conversely, if we encounter the – of the voltage reference polarity of an
element voltage before the þ sign, we subtract that voltage. Thus, for the circuit of Figure 4.5-5c,
we have
mesh 1: vs þ R1i1 þ R3 i1  i2
ð
Þ ¼ 0
ð4:5-1Þ
mesh 2: R3 i1  i2
ð
Þ þ R2i2 ¼ 0
ð4:5-2Þ
Note that the voltage across R3 in mesh 1 is determined from Ohm’s law, where
v ¼ R3ia ¼ R3 i1  i2
ð
Þ
where ia is the actual element current ﬂowing downward through R3.
Equations 4.5-1 and 4.5-2 will enable us to determine the two mesh currents i1 and i2. Rewriting
the two equations, we have

Thus, we have obtained two independent mesh current equations that are readily solved for the
two unknowns. If we have N meshes and write N mesh equations in terms of N mesh currents, we can
obtain N independent mesh equations. This set of N equations is independent and thus guarantees a
solution for the N mesh currents.
A circuit that contains only independent voltage sources and resistors results in a speciﬁc
format of equations that can readily be obtained. Consider a circuit with three meshes, as shown in
Figure 4.5-6. Assign the clockwise direction to all of the mesh currents. Using KVL, we obtain the three
mesh equations

Hence, we note that the coefﬁcient of the mesh current i1 for the ﬁrst mesh is the sum of
resistances in mesh 1, and the coefﬁcient of the second mesh current is the negative of the resistance
common to meshes 1 and 2. In general, we state that for mesh current in, the equation for the nth mesh
with independent voltage sources only is obtained as follows:

That is, for mesh n we multiply in by the sum of all resistances Rj around the mesh. Then we add
the terms due to the resistances in common with another mesh as the negative of the connecting
resistance Rk, multiplied by the mesh current in the adjacent mesh iq for all Q adjacent meshes.
Finally, the independent voltage sources around the loop appear on the right side of the equation as
the negative of the voltage sources encountered as we traverse the loop in the direction of the
mesh current. Remember that the preceding result is obtained assuming all mesh currents ﬂow
clockwise.
The general matrix equation for the mesh current analysis for independent voltage sources present
in a circuit is
R i ¼ vs
ð4:5-4Þ
where R is a symmetric matrix with a diagonal consisting of the sum of resistances in each mesh and the
off-diagonal elements are the negative of the sum of the resistances common to two meshes. The matrix

Heretofore, we have considered only circuits with independent voltage sources for analysis by the mesh
current method. If the circuit has an independent current source, as shown in Figure 4.6-1, we recognize
that the second mesh current is equal to the negative of the current source current. We can then write
i2 ¼ is
and we need only determine the ﬁrst mesh current i1. Writing KVL for the ﬁrst mesh, we obtain
R1 þ R2

We note that if we add Eqs. 4.6-3 and 4.6-4, we eliminate vab, obtaining
R1i1 þ R2 þ R3

Thus, we account for independent current sources by recording the relationship between the mesh
currents and the current source current. If the current source inﬂuences only one mesh current, we write the
equation that relates that mesh current to the current source current and write the KVL equations for the
remaining meshes. If the current source inﬂuences two mesh currents, we write the KVL equation for both
meshes, assuming a voltage vab across the terminals of the current source. Then, adding these two mesh
equations, we obtain an equation independent of vab.
Another technique for the mesh analysis method when a current source is common to two meshes
involves the concept of a supermesh. A supermesh is one mesh created from two meshes that have a
current source in common, as shown in Figure 4.6-4.

A supermesh is one larger mesh created from two meshes that have an independent or
dependent current source in common.
For example, consider the circuit of Figure 4.6-4. The 5-A current source is common to mesh 1
and mesh 2. The supermesh consists of the interior of mesh 1 and mesh 2. Writing KVL around the
periphery of the supermesh shown by the dashed lines, we obtain

Solution
We can write the ﬁrst mesh equation by considering the current source. The current source current is related to the
mesh currents by
i1  i2 ¼ 1:5
)
i1 ¼ i2 þ 1:5
To write the second mesh equation, we must decide what to do about the current source voltage. (Notice that there is
no easy way to express the current source voltage in terms of the mesh currents.) In this example, we illustrate two
methods of writing the second mesh equation.
Method 1: Assign a name to the current source voltage. Apply KVL to both of the meshes. Eliminate the
current source voltage from the KVL equations.
Figure 4.6-6 shows the circuit after labeling the current source voltage. The KVL equation for mesh 1 is
9i1 þ v  12 ¼ 0
The KVL equation for mesh 2 is
3i2 þ 6i2  v ¼ 0
Combining these two equations gives
9i1 þ 3i2 þ 6i2
ð
Þ  12 ¼ 0
)
9i1 þ 9i2 ¼ 12
Method 2: Apply KVL to the supermesh corresponding to the current source. Shown in Figure 4.6-7,
this supermesh is the perimeter of the two meshes that each contain the current source. Apply KVL to the
supermesh to get
9i1 þ 3i2 þ 6i2  12 ¼ 0
)
9i1 þ 9i2 ¼ 12
This is the same equation that was obtained using method 1. Applying KVL to the supermesh is a shortcut for doing
three things:
1.
Labeling the current source voltage as v.
2.
Applying KVL to both meshes that contain the current source.
3.
Eliminating v from the KVL equations.
In summary, the mesh equations are
i1 ¼ i2 þ 1:5

The analysis of a complex circuit can usually be accomplished by either the node voltage or the mesh
current method. The advantage of using these methods is the systematic procedures provided for
obtaining the simultaneous equations.
In some cases, one method is clearly preferred over another. For example, when the circuit contains
only voltage sources, it is probably easier to use the mesh current method. When the circuit contains only
current sources, it will usually be easier to use the node voltage method.

The Node Voltage Method and Mesh Current Method Compared

Solution
Figure 4.8-2a shows the circuit from Figure 4.8-1 after replacing the ammeter by an equivalent short circuit and
labeling the current measured by the ammeter. This circuit can be analyzed using mesh equations or using node
equations. To decide which will be easier, we ﬁrst count the nodes and meshes. This circuit has ﬁve nodes. Selecting a
reference node and then applying KCL at the other four nodes will produce a set of four node equations. The circuit has
three meshes. Applying KVL to these three meshes will produce a set of three mesh equations. Hence, analyzing this
circuit using mesh equations instead of node equations will produce a smaller set of equations. Further, notice that two
of the three mesh currents can be determined directly from the current source currents. This makes the mesh equations
easier to solve. We will analyze this circuit by writing and solving mesh equations.
Figure 4.8-2b shows the circuit after numbering the meshes. Let i1, i2, and i3 denote the mesh currents in
meshes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The mesh current i1 is equal to the current in the 1-A current source, so
i1 ¼ 1 A
The mesh current i2 is equal to the current in the 3-A current source, so
i2 ¼ 3 A
The mesh current i3 is equal to the current in the short circuit that replaced the ammeter, so

4. Methods of Analysis of Resistive Circuits

If a circuit has both current sources and voltage sources, it can be analyzed by either method. One
approach is to compare the number of equations required for each method. If the circuit has fewer nodes
than meshes, it may be wise to select the node voltage method. If the circuit has fewer meshes than
nodes, it may be easier to use the mesh current method.
Another point to consider when choosing between the two methods is what information is
required. If you need to know several currents, it may be wise to proceed directly with mesh current
analysis. Remember, mesh current analysis only works for planar networks.
It is often helpful to determine which method is more appropriate for the problem requirements
and to consider both methods.
Solution
Figure 4.8-4a shows the circuit from Figure 4.8-3 after replacing the voltmeter by an equivalent open circuit
and labeling the voltage measured by the voltmeter. This circuit can be analyzed using mesh equations or node
equations. To decide which will be easier, we ﬁrst count the nodes and meshes. This circuit has four nodes. Selecting a
reference node and then applying KCL at the other three nodes will produce a set of three node equations. The circuit
has three meshes. Applying KVL to these three meshes will produce a set of three mesh equations. Analyzing
this circuit using mesh equations requires the same number of equations that are required to analyze the circuit using
node equations. Notice that one of the three mesh currents can be determined directly from the current source current,
but two of the three node voltages can be determined directly from the voltage source voltages. This makes the node
equations easier to solve. We will analyze this circuit by writing and solving node equations.
Figure 4.8-4b shows the circuit after selecting a reference node and numbering the other nodes. Let v1, v2, and
v3 denote the node voltages at nodes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The voltage of the 16-V voltage source can be
expressed in terms of the node voltages as
16 ¼ v1  0

v1 ¼ 16 V
The voltage of the 18-V voltage source can be expressed in terms of the node voltages as

We have seen that circuits that contain resistors and independent or dependent sources can be analyzed
in the following way:
1.
Writing a set of node or mesh equations.
2.
Solving those equations simultaneously.
In this section, we will use the MATLAB computer program to solve the equations.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 4.9-1a. This circuit contains a potentiometer. In Figure
4.9-1b, the potentiometer has been replaced by a model of a potentiometer. Rp is the resistance of
the potentiometer. The parameter a varies from 0 to 1 as the wiper of the potentiometer is moved
from one end of the potentiometer to the other. The resistances R4 and R5 are described by the
equations
R4 ¼ aRp
ð4:9-1Þ
and
R5 ¼ 1  a
ð
ÞRp
ð4:9-2Þ
Our objective is to analyze this circuit to determine how the output voltage changes as the position of the
potentiometer wiper is changed.
The circuit in Figure 4.9-1b can be represented by mesh equations as

Solution
Figure 4.10-2 shows the result of drawing the circuit in the OrCAD workspace (see Appendix A) and performing a
Bias Point simulation. (Select PSpice\New Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD Capture menu bar; then choose
Bias Point from the Analysis Type drop-down list in the Simulation Settings dialog box to specify a Bias Point
simulation. Select PSpice\Run Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD Capture menu bar to run the simulation.)
PSpice labels the nodes with the values of the node voltages using white numbers shown on black backgrounds.
Comparing Figures 4.10-1 and 4.10-2, we see that the node voltages are
v1 ¼ 6:106 V; v2 ¼ 10:61 V; v3 ¼ 22:34 V; and v4 ¼ 7:660 V:
Figure 4.10-3 shows the circuit from Figure 4.10-2 after inserting a 0-V current source on the outside of each mesh.
The currents in these 0-V sources will be the mesh currents shown in Figure 4.10-1. In particular, source V2
measures mesh current i1, source V3 measures mesh current i2, source V4 measures mesh current i3, and source V5
measures mesh current i4.
After we rerun the simulation (Select PSpice\Run from the OrCAD Capture menu bar), OrCAD Capture will
open a Schematics window. Select View\Output File from the menu bar in the Schematics window. Scroll down

Noticing the small þ and  signs on the voltage source symbols in Figure 4.10-3, we see that the currents provided
by PSpice are directed form left to right in sources VI and V2 and are directed from right to left in sources V3, V4,

Using PSpice to Determine Node Voltages and Mesh Currents
145

An extra step is needed to use PSpice to determine the mesh currents. PSpice does not label the
values of the mesh currents, but it does provide the value of the current in each voltage source. Recall
that a 0-V voltage source is equivalent to a short circuit. Consequently, we can insert 0-V current
sources into the circuit without altering the values of the mesh currents. We will insert those sources into
the circuit in such a way that their currents are also the mesh currents. To determine the mesh currents of
a dc circuit using PSpice, we
1.
Draw the circuit in the OrCAD Capture workspace.
2.
Add 0-V voltage sources to measure the mesh currents.
3.
Specify a Bias Point simulation.
4.
Run the simulation.
PSpice will write the voltage source currents in the output ﬁle.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct.
For example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the
speciﬁcations have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against
data-entry errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able quickly to identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.
E X A M P L E 4 . 1 1 - 1
How Can We Check Node Voltages?
The circuit shown in Figure 4.11-1a was analyzed using PSpice. The PSpice output ﬁle, Figure 4.11-1b, includes
the node voltages of the circuit. How can we check that these node voltages are correct?
Solution
The node equation corresponding to node 2 is
V 2
ð Þ  V 1
ð Þ
100
þ V 2
ð Þ
200 þ V 2
ð Þ  V 3
ð Þ

¼ 0
where, for example, V(2) is the node voltage at node 2. When the node voltages from Figure 4.11-1b are substituted
into the left-hand side of this equation, the result is
7:2727  12
100
þ 7:2727
200
þ 7:2727  5:0909
100
¼ 0:011
The right-hand side of this equation should be 0 instead of 0.011. It looks like something is wrong. Is a current of
only 0.011 negligible? Probably not in this case. If the node voltages were correct, then the currents of the 100-V
resistors would be 0.047 A and 0.022 A, respectively. The current of 0.011 A does not seem negligible when
compared to currents of 0.047 A and 0.022 A.
146
4. Methods of Analysis of Resistive Circuits

How Can We Check . . . ?
147
Is it possible that PSpice would calculate the node voltages incorrectly? Probably not, but the PSpice
input ﬁle could easily contain errors. In this case, the value of the resistance connected between nodes 2 and 3
has been mistakenly speciﬁed to be 200 V. After changing this resistance to 100 V, PSpice calculates the node
voltages to be
V 1
ð Þ ¼ 12:0; V 2
ð Þ ¼ 7:0; V 3
ð Þ ¼ 5:5; V 4
ð Þ ¼ 8:0
Substituting these voltages into the node equation gives
7:0  12:0
100
þ 7:0

so these node voltages do satisfy the node equation corresponding to node 2.

How Can We Check Mesh Currents?
The circuit shown in Figure 4.11-2a was analyzed using PSpice. The PSpice output ﬁle, Figure 4.11-2b, includes
the mesh currents of the circuit. How can we check that these mesh currents are correct?
(The PSpice output ﬁle will include the currents through the voltage sources. Recall that PSpice uses the
passive convention, so the current in the 8-V source will be –i1 instead of i1. The two 0-V sources have been added
to include mesh currents i2 and i3 in the PSpice output ﬁle.)

Solution
The mesh equation corresponding to mesh 2 is
200 i2  i1
ð
Þ þ 500i2 þ 250 i2  i3
ð
Þ ¼ 0
When the mesh currents from Figure 4.11-2b are substituted into the left-hand side of this equation, the result is
200 0:004068 0:01763Þ þ 500 0:004068
ð
Þ þ 250 0:004068  0:001356
ð
Þ
ð
Þ ¼ 1:629
ð
The right-hand side of this equation should be 0 instead of 1.629. It looks like something is wrong. Most likely,
the PSpice input ﬁle contains an error. This is indeed the case. The nodes of both 0-V voltage sources
have been entered in the wrong order. Recall that the ﬁrst node should be the positive node of the voltage
source. After correcting this error, PSpice gives
i1 ¼ 0:01763;
i2 ¼ 0:004068;
i3 ¼ 0:001356
Using these values in the mesh equation gives
200 0:004068 0:01763Þ þ 500 0:004068

Potentiometer Angle Display
A circuit is needed to measure and display the angular position of a potentiometer shaft. The angular position, y,
will vary from 180 to 180.
Figure 4.12-1 illustrates a circuit that could do the job. The +15-V and –15-V power supplies, the
potentiometer, and resistors R1 and R2 are used to obtain a voltage, vi, that is proportional to y. The ampliﬁer
is used to change the constant of proportionality to obtain a simple relationship between y and the voltage, vo,
displayed by the voltmeter. In this example, the ampliﬁer will be used to obtain the relationship
vo ¼ k  y where k ¼ 0:1 volt
degree
ð4:12-1Þ
so that y can be determined by multiplying the meter reading by 10. For example, a meter reading of 7.32 V
indicates that y ¼ 73:2.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
The circuit diagram in Figure 4.12-2 is obtained by modeling the power supplies as ideal voltage sources, the
voltmeter as an open circuit, and the potentiometer by two resistors. The parameter a in the model of the
potentiometer varies from 0 to 1 as y varies from 180 to 180. That means

State the Goal
Specify values of resistors R1 and R2, the potentiometer resistance RP, and the ampliﬁer gain b that will cause the
meter voltage vo to be related to the angle y by Eq. 4.12-1.
Generate a Plan
Analyze the circuit shown in Figure 4.12-2 to determine the relationship between vi and y. Select values of R1,
R2, and Rp. Use these values to simplify the relationship between vi and y. If possible, calculate the value of b
that will cause the meter voltage vo to be related to the angle y by Eq. 4.12-1. If this isn’t possible, adjust the
values of R1, R2, and Rp and try again.
Act on the Plan
The circuit has been redrawn in Figure 4.12-3. A single node equation will provide the relationship between
between vi and y:
vi

R1 þ aRp

R2 þ 1  a
ð
ÞRp

	
þ 2 MV R1 þ R2 þ Rp

	
ð4:12-4Þ
This equation is quite complicated. Let’s put some restrictions on R1, R2, and Rp that will make it possible to
simplify this equation. First, let R1= R2= R. Second, require that both R and Rp be much smaller than 2 MV (for
example, R < 20 kV). Then,
R þ aRp

R þ 1  a

That is, the ﬁrst term in the denominator of the left side of Eq. 4.12-4 is negligible compared to the second term.

It is time to pick values for R and Rp. Let R ¼ 5 kV and Rp ¼ 10 kV; then

The ﬁnal circuit is shown in Figure 4.12-4.
Verify the Proposed Solution
As a check, suppose y ¼ 150. From Eq. 4.12-2, we see that
a ¼ 150
360 þ 1
2 ¼ 0:9167
Using Eq. 4.12-4, we calculate
vi ¼

Þ ¼ 6:24
Finally, Eq. 4.12-5 indicates that the meter voltage will be
vo  2:4  6:24 ¼ 14:98
This voltage will be interpreted to mean that the angle was
y ¼ 10  vo ¼ 149:8
which is correct to three signiﬁcant digits.

The node voltage method of circuit analysis identiﬁes the
nodes of a circuit where two or more elements are connected.
When the circuit consists of only resistors and current sources,
the following procedure is used to obtain the node equations.
1. We choose one node as the reference node. Label the
node voltages at the other nodes.
2. Express element currents as functions of the node volt-
ages. Figure 4.13-1a illustrates the relationship between
the current in a resistor and the voltages at the nodes of the
resistor.
3. Apply KCL at all nodes except for the reference node.
Solution of the simultaneous equations results in knowl-
edge of the node voltages. All the voltages and currents in
the circuit can be determined when the node voltages are
known.
When a circuit has voltage sources as well as current sources,
we can still use the node voltage method by using the concept
of a supernode. A supernode is a large node that includes two
nodes connected by a known voltage source. If the voltage
sourceisdirectlyconnectedbetweenanodeq andthereference
node, we may set vq = vs and write the KCL equations at the
remaining nodes.
If the circuit contains a dependent source, we ﬁrst express the
controlling voltage or current of the dependent source as a
function of the node voltages. Next, we express the controlled
voltage or current as a function of the node voltages. Finally,
we apply KCL to nodes and supernodes.
Mesh current analysis is accomplished by applying KVL to
the meshes of a planar circuit. When the circuit consists of
only resistors and voltage sources, the following procedure is
used to obtain the mesh equations.
1. Label the mesh currents.
2. Express element voltages as functions of the mesh cur-
rents. Figure 4.13-1b illustrates the relationship between
the voltage across a resistor and the currents of the meshes
that include the resistor.
3. Apply KVL to all meshes.
Solution of the simultaneous equations results in knowl-
edge of the mesh currents. All the voltages and currents in
the circuit can be determined when the mesh currents are
known.
If a current source is common to two adjoining meshes, we
deﬁne the interior of the two meshes as a supermesh. We then
write the mesh current equation around the periphery of the
supermesh. If a current source appears at the periphery of
only one mesh, we may deﬁne that mesh current as equal to
the current of the source, accounting for the direction of the
current source.
If the circuit contains a dependent source, we ﬁrst express the
controlling voltage or current of the dependent source as a
function of the mesh currents. Next, we express the controlled
voltage or current as a function of the mesh currents. Finally,
we apply KVL to meshes and supermeshes.
In general, either node voltage or mesh current analysis can
be used to obtain the currents or voltages in a circuit.
However, a circuit with fewer node equations than mesh
current equations may require that we select the node voltage
method. Conversely, mesh current analysis is readily appli-
cable for a circuit with fewer mesh current equations than
node voltage equations.
MATLAB greatly reduces the drudgery of solving node or
mesh equations.

P 4.7-5 Although scientists continue to debate exactly why
and how it works, the process of using electricity to aid in the
repair and growth of bones—which has been used mainly with
fractures—may soon be extended to an array of other problems,
ranging from osteoporosis and osteoarthritis to spinal fusions
and skin ulcers.
An electric current is applied to bone fractures that have
not healed in the normal period of time. The process seeks to
imitate natural electrical forces within the body. It takes only
a small amount of electric stimulation to accelerate bone
recovery. The direct current method uses an electrode that
is implanted at the bone. This method has a success rate
approaching 80 percent.
The implant is shown in Figure P 4.7-5a, and the circuit
model is shown in Figure P 4.7-5b. Find the energy delivered to
the cathode during a 24-hour period. The cathode is represented
by the dependent voltage source and the 100-kV resistor.

DP 4-1 An electronic instrument incorporates a 15-V power
supply. A digital display is added that requires a 5-V power
supply. Unfortunately, the project is over budget, and you are
instructed to use the existing power supply. Using a voltage
divider, as shown in Figure DP 4-1, you are able to obtain 5 V.
The speciﬁcation sheet for the digital display shows that the
display will operate properly over a supply voltage range of 4.8 V
to 5.4 V. Furthermore, the display will draw 300 mA (I) when the
display is active and 100 mA when quiescent (no activity).

In this chapter, we consider ﬁve circuit theorems:
 A source transformation allows us to replace a voltage source and series resistor by a current source
and parallel resistor. Doing so does not change the element current or voltage of any other element of
the circuit.
 Superposition says that the response of a linear circuit to several inputs working together is equal
to the sum of the responses to each of the inputs working separately.
 Thevenin’s theorem allows us to replace part of a circuit by a voltage source and series resistor.
Doing so does not change the element current or voltage of any element in the rest of the circuit.
 Norton’s theorem allows us to replace part of a circuit by a current source and parallel resistor.
Doing so does not change the element current or voltage of any element in the rest of the circuit.
 The maximum power transfer theorem describes the condition under which one circuit transfers as
much power as possible to another circuit.
Each of these circuit theorems can be thought of as a shortcut, a way to reduce the complexity of an
electric circuit so that it can be analyzed more easily. More important, these theorems provide insight
into the nature of linear electric circuits.
5.2
S o u r c e T r a n s f o r m a t i o n s
The ideal voltage source is the simplest model of a voltage source, but occasionally we need a more
accurate model. Figure 5.2-1a shows a more accurate but more complicated model of a voltage
source. The circuit shown in Figure 5.2-1 is sometimes called a nonideal voltage source.
(The voltage of a practical voltage source decreases as the voltage source supplies more power.
The nonideal voltage source models this behavior, whereas the ideal voltage source does not. The
nonideal voltage source is a more accurate model of a practical voltage source than the ideal voltage
source, but it is also more complicated. We will usually use ideal voltage sources to model practical
voltage sources but will occasionally need to use a nonideal voltage source.) Figure 5.2-1b shows a
nonideal current source. It is a more accurate but more complicated model of a practical current
source.
169

Under certain conditions (Rp ¼ Rs and vs ¼ Rsis), the nonideal voltage source and the nonideal
current source are equivalent to each other. Figure 5.2-1 illustrates the meaning of “equivalent.” In
Figure 5.2-1c, a nonideal voltage source is connected to circuit B. In Figure 5.2-1d, a nonideal
current source is connected to that same circuit B. Perhaps Figure 5.2-1d was obtained from Figure
5.2-1c, by replacing the nonideal voltage source with a nonideal current source. Replacing the
nonideal voltage source by the equivalent nonideal current source does not change the voltage or
current of any element in circuit B. That means that if you looked at a list of the values of the currents
and voltages of all the circuit elements in circuit B, you could not tell whether circuit B was
connected to a nonideal voltage source or to an equivalent nonideal current source. Similarly, we can
imagine that Figure 5.2-1c was obtained from Figure 5.2-1d by replacing the nonideal current source
with a nonideal voltage source. Replacing the nonideal current source by the equivalent nonideal
voltage source does not change the voltage or current of any element in circuit B. The process of
transforming Figure 5.2-1c into Figure 5.2-1d, or vice versa, is called a source transformation.
To see why the source transformation works, we will perform an experiment using the test circuit
shown in Figure 5.2-2. This test circuit contains a device called an “operational ampliﬁer.” We will
learn about operational ampliﬁers in Chapter 6, so we aren’t ready to analyze this circuit yet. Instead,
imagine building the circuit and making some measurements to learn how it works.
Consider the following experiment. We connect a resistor having resistance R to the terminals of
the test circuit as shown in Figure 5.2-2 and measure the resistor voltage v and resistor current i. Next,
we change the resistor and measure the new values of the resistor voltage and current. After some trial
and error, we collect the following data:

Two of these data points deserve special attention. The resistor acts like an open circuit when R = 1 so
we connect an open circuit across the terminals of the test circuit in this case. As expected, i = 0. The
resistor voltage is referred to as the “open circuit voltage,” denoted as voc. We have measured
voc = 24 V. The resistor acts like a short circuit when R = 0, so we connect a short circuit across the
terminals of the test circuit. As expected, v = 0. The resistor current is referred to as the “short-circuit
current,” denoted as isc. We have measured isc = 3 mA.

Figure 5.2-3 shows a plot of the data. All of the data points lie on the straight line segment that
connects the points (i sc,0) and (0,voc)! The slope of the straight line is
slope ¼  v oc

The test circuit in Figure 5.2-4 consists of a voltage source connected in series with a resistor.
The voltage of the voltage source in the second test circuit is equal to the open circuit voltage
of the ﬁrst test circuit. Also, the resistance of the resistor in the second test circuit is the parameter Rt
from the ﬁrst test circuit, given by Eq. 5.2-1.

the same equation! There’s more. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 5.2-5. The test circuit in
Figure 5.2-5 consists of a current source connected in parallel with a resistor. The current of the current
source in the third test circuit is equal to the short-circuit current of the ﬁrst test circuit. Also, the
resistance of the resistor in the third test circuit is the parameter Rt from the ﬁrst test circuit, again given
by Eq. 5.2-1.

Equations 5.2-2, 5.2-3, and 5.2-4 are identical. The three test circuits are each represented by the
equation that describes our data. Any one of them could have generated our data! It is in this sense that
we say that the second and third test circuits are equivalent to the ﬁrst test circuit.
The second and third test circuits have names. They are called the “Thevenin equivalent circuit”
and “Norton equivalent circuit” of the ﬁrst test circuit. Also, the parameter Rt given by Eq. 5.2-1 is
called the “Thevenin resistance” of the ﬁrst test circuit.
The Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are equivalent to each other. The source transfor-
mation, described earlier in this section and summarized in Figure 5.2-6, may be preformed by
replacing a Thevenin equivalent circuit with a Norton equivalent circuit or vice versa.

S u p e r p o s i t i o n
The output of a linear circuit can be expressed as a linear combination of its inputs. For example,
consider any circuit having the following three properties:
1.
The circuit consists entirely of resistors and dependent and independent sources.
2.
The circuit inputs are the voltages of all the independent voltage sources and the currents of all the
independent current sources.
3.
The output is the voltage or current of any element of the circuit.
Such a circuit is a linear circuit. Consequently, the circuit output can be expressed as a linear
combination of the circuit inputs. For example,
vo ¼ a1v1 þ a2v2 þ    þ anvn
ð5:3-1Þ
where v0 is the output of the circuit (it could be a current instead of a voltage) and v1; v2; : : : ; vn are the
inputs to the circuit (any or all the inputs could be currents instead of voltages). The coefﬁcients
a1; a2; : : : ; an of the linear combination are real constants called gains.
Next, consider what would happen if we set all but one input to zero. Let voi denote output when
all inputs except the ith input have been set to zero. For example, suppose we set v2; v3; : : : ; vn to zero.
Then
vo1 ¼ a1v1
ð5:3-2Þ
We can interpret vo1 ¼ a1v1 as the circuit output due to input v1acting separately. In contrast, the vo in
Eq 5.3-1 is the circuit output due to all the inputs working together. We now have the following
important interpretation of Eq. 5.3-1:
The output of a linear circuit due to several inputs working together is equal to the sum of the
outputs due to each input working separately.
The inputs to our circuit are voltages of independent voltage sources and the currents of
independent current sources. When we set all but one input to zero, the other inputs become 0-V

voltage sources and 0-A current sources. Because 0-V voltage sources are equivalent to short
circuits and 0-A current sources are equivalent to open circuits, we replace the sources
corresponding to the other inputs by short or open circuits.
Equation 5.3-2 suggests a method for determining the values of the coefﬁcients a1; a2; : : : ; an of
the linear combination. For example, to determine a1, set v2; v3; : : : ; vn to zero. Then, dividing both
sides of Eq. 5.5-2 by v1, we get
a1 ¼ vo1
v1
The other gains are determined similarly.
E X A M P L E 5 . 3 - 1
Superposition
The circuit shown in Figure 5.3-1 has one output, vo, and three inputs, v1, i2, and v3. (As expected, the inputs are
voltages of independent voltage sources and the currents of independent current sources.) Express the output as a
linear combination of the inputs.
Solution
Let’s analyze the circuit using node equations. Label the node voltage at the top node of the current source and
identify the supernode corresponding to the horizontal voltage source as shown in Figure 5.3-2.
Apply KCL to the supernode to get
v1  v3 þ vo

Multiply both sides of this equation by 40 to eliminate the fractions. Then we have

)
v1 þ 40i2  v3 ¼ 5vo
Dividing both sides by 5 expresses the output as a linear combination of the inputs:
vo ¼ v1

Also, the coefﬁcients of the linear combination can now be determined to be
a1 ¼ vo1

Solution
Independent sources provide the inputs to a circuit. The circuit in Figure 5.3-6a has two inputs: the voltage of
the independent voltage source and the current of the independent current source. The current, i, caused by the
two sources acting together is equal to the sum of the currents caused by each independent source acting separately.
Step 1: Figure 5.3-6b shows the circuit used to calculate the current caused by the independent voltage
source acting alone. The current source current is set to zero for this calculation. (A zero current source is equivalent
to an open circuit, so the current source has been replaced by an open circuit.) The current due to the voltage source
alone has been labeled as i1 in Figure 5.3-6b.

(Notice that we did not set the dependent source to zero. The inputs to a circuit are provided by the independent
sources, not by the dependent sources. When we ﬁnd the response to one input acting alone, we set the other
inputs to zero. Hence, we set the other independent sources to zero, but there is no reason to set the dependent
source to zero.)
Step 2: Figure 5.3-6c shows the circuit used to calculate the current caused by the current source acting alone.
The voltage of the independent voltage is set to zero for this calculation. (A zero voltage source is equivalent to a
short circuit, so the independent voltage source has been replaced by a short circuit.) The current due to the voltage
source alone has been labeled as i2 in Figure 5.3-6c.

In this section, we introduce the Thevenin equivalent circuit, based on a theorem developed by M. L.
Thevenin, a French engineer, who ﬁrst published the principle in 1883. Thevenin, who is credited with
the theorem, probably based his work on earlier work by Hermann von Helmholtz (see
Figure 5.4-1).
Figure 5.4-2 illustrates the use of the Thevenin equivalent circuit. In Figure 5.4-2a,
a circuit is partitioned into two parts—circuit A and circuit B—that are connected at a single
pair of terminals. (This is the only connection between circuits A and B. In particular, if
the overall circuit contains a dependent source, then either both parts of that dependent
source must be in circuit A or both parts must be in circuit B.) In Figure 5.4-2b, circuit A is
replacedbyitsTheveninequivalentcircuit,whichconsistsofanideal voltagesource inseries
with a resistor. Replacing circuit A by its Thevenin equivalent circuit does not change the
voltageorcurrentofanyelementincircuitB.Thismeansthatifyoulookedatalistofthevalues
of the currents and voltages of all the circuit elements in circuit B, you could not tell whether
circuit B was connected to circuit A or connected to its Thevenin equivalent circuit.
Finding the Thevenin equivalent circuit of circuit A involves three parameters: the
open-circuit voltage, voc, the short-circuit current, isc, and the Thevenin resistance, Rt.
Figure 5.4-3 illustrates the meaning of these three parameters. In Figure 5.4-3a, an open
circuit is connected across the terminals of circuit A. The voltage across that open circuit is
the open-circuit voltage, voc. In Figure 5.4-3b, a short circuit is connected across the
terminals of circuit A. The current in that short circuit is the short-circuit current, isc.
Figure 5.4-3c indicates that the Thevenin resistance, Rt, is the equivalent resistance of circuit A.
Circuit A is formed from circuit A by replacing all the independent voltage sources by short circuits
and replacing all the independent current sources by open circuits. (Dependent current and voltage
sources are not replaced with open circuits or short circuits.) Frequently, the Thevenin resistance, Rt,
can be determined by repeatedly replacing series or parallel resistors by equivalent resistors.
Sometimes, a more formal method is required. Figure 5.4-4 illustrates a formal method for determining
the value of the Thevenin resistance. A current source having current it is connected across the terminals
of circuit A. The voltage, vt, across the current source is calculated or measured. The Thevenin

circuit current.
In summary, the Thevenin equivalent circuit for circuit A consists of an ideal voltage source,
having voltage voc, in series with a resistor, having resistance Rt. Replacing circuit A by its Thevenin
equivalent circuit does not change the voltage or current of any element in circuit B.

First Solution
Referring to Figure 5.4-2, we see that we can draw a Thevenin equivalent circuit once we have found the open-
circuit voltage voc and Thevenin resistance, Rt. Figure 5.4-3 shows how to determine the open-circuit voltage, the
Thevenin resistance, and also the short-circuit current isc. After we determine the values of voc, Rt, and isc we will
use Eq. 5.4-2 to check that our values are correct.
To determine the open-circuit voltage of the circuit shown in Figure 5.4-5, we connect an open
circuit between terminals a and b as shown in Figure 5.4-6a. As the name suggests, the voltage across that
open circuit is the open-circuit voltage, voc. After taking node b in Figure 5.4-6a to be the reference node, we see
that the node voltage at node a is equal to voc. Applying KCL at node a, we obtain the node equation

To determine the short-circuit current of the circuit shown in Figure 5.4-5, we connect a short circuit between
terminals a and b as shown in Figure 5.4-6b. The current in that short circuit is isc. Due to the short circuit, the
voltage across the 200-V resistor is 0 V. By Ohm’s law, the current in the 200-V resistor is 0 A as shown in
Figure 5.4-6b. Applying KVL to the loop consisting of the voltage source, 50-V resistor, and short circuit, we see
that the voltage across the 50-V resistor is 125 V, also as shown in Figure 5.4-6b. Finally, apply KCL at node a in

voltage source is equivalent to a short circuit and a zero-amp current source is equivalent to an open circuit.) Rt is

5. Circuit Theorems

Second Solution
Often we can simplify a circuit using source transformations and equivalent circuits. In this solution we will
transform a circuit into an equivalent circuit repeatedly. We will start at the left side of the circuit in Figure 5.4-5,
away from terminals a-b. If it is possible to continue these transformations until the equivalent circuit consists of the
series connection of a voltage source and a resistor, connected between terminals a-b, then that series circuit is the
Thevenin equivalent circuit. Figure 5.4-7 illustrates this procedure.
The circuit in Figure 5.4-6 contains a voltage source connected in series with a 50-V resistor. Using a source
transformation, these circuit elements are replaced by the parallel connection of a 2.5-A current source and 50-V
resistor in Figure 5.4-7a. The circuit in Figure 5.4-7a contains both parallel current sources and parallel resistors. In
Figure 5.4-7b the parallel current sources are replaced by an equivalent current source and the parallel resistors are
replaced by an equivalent resistor. A ﬁnal source transformation converts the parallel connection of a current source
and resistor in Figure 5.4-7b to the series connection of a voltage source and resistor in Figure 5.4-7c. We recognize
Figure 5.4-7c as a Thevenin circuit that is equivalent to the circuit shown in Figure 5.4-5 and conclude that
Figure 5.4-7c is the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Figure 5.4-5.

Solution
The circuit shown in Figure 5.4-13 is an example of the situation shown in Figure 5.4-2a in which Circuit B is the
resistor R and Circuit A is the part of the circuit shown in Figure 5.4-13 that is connected to resistor R. Replacing
the part of the circuit that is connected to resistor R by its Thevenin equivalent circuit will not change the value
of the current in resistor R.
In Figure 5.4-14 source transformations and equivalent resistances are used to determine the Thevenin
equivalent of the part of the circuit that is connected to resistor R. That equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 5.4-14e.
In Figure 5.4-15 the part of the circuit that is connected to resistor R has been replaced by its Thevenin equivalent
circuit. We readily determine that
i ¼

in Figure 5.4-15. Replacing the part of the circuit that is connected to resistor R by its Thevenin equivalent circuit
did not change the current in resistor R. Consequently, Eq. 5.4-3 also describes the relationship between i and R in
Figure 5.4-13. We can now easily answer questions (a), (b) and (c).

When R ¼ 2 V the resistor current is i ¼ 48

(b)
To cause i = 5 A requires R ¼ 48

5  8 ¼ 1:6 V.
(c)
To cause i = 8 A requires R ¼ 48
i  8 ¼ 48
8  8 ¼ 2 V.
The answer in part (c) is probably not acceptable because we expect 0 < R < 1. Using Eq. 5.4-3 shows that when
0 < R < 1 the circuit in Figure 5.4-13 can only produce currents in the range 0 < i < 6 A. The current speciﬁed in
(c) is outside of this range and cannot be obtained using a positive resistance R.

5. Circuit Theorems

A laboratory procedure for determining the Thevenin equivalent of a black box circuit
(see Figure 5.4-16a) is to measure i and v for two or more values of vs and a ﬁxed value of R. For
the circuit of Figure 5.4-16b, we replace the test circuit with its Thevenin equivalent, obtaining
v ¼ voc þ iRt
ð5:4-4Þ
The procedure is to measure v and i for a ﬁxed R and several values of vs. For example, let R ¼ 10 V and
consider the two measurement results
(1)
vs ¼ 49 V: i ¼ 0:5 A; v ¼ 44 V
and
(2)
vs ¼ 76 V: i ¼ 2 A; v ¼ 56 V
Then we have two simultaneous equations (using Eq. 5.4-4):
44 ¼ voc þ 0:5Rt
56 ¼ voc þ 2Rt
Solving these simultaneous equations, we get Rt ¼ 8 V and voc ¼ 40 V, thus obtaining the Thevenin
equivalent of the black box circuit.

transformation converts a Thevenin equivalent circuit into a Norton equivalent circuit or
vice versa. Norton published his method in 1926, 43 years after Thevenin.
Norton’s theorem may be stated as follows: Given any linear circuit, divide it into two
circuits, A and B. If either A or B contains a dependent source, its controlling variable must be
in the same circuit. Consider circuit A and determine its short-circuit current isc at its terminals.
Then the equivalent circuit of A is a current source isc in parallel with a resistance Rn, where Rn
is the resistance looking into circuit A with all its independent sources deactivated.
We therefore have the Norton circuit for circuit A as shown in Figure 5.5-1. Finding
the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the circuit in Figure 5.5-1 shows that Rn ¼ Rt and voc ¼
Rtisc. The Norton equivalent is simply the source transformation of the Thevenin
equivalent.

We determined the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Figure 5.5-4 in Example 5.4-2. The procedure used
to determine the Norton equivalent of a circuit is very similar to the procedure used to determine the Thevenin
equivalent of that circuit. In particular the values of voc, Rt, and isc for the Norton equivalent are determined
in exactly the same way in which they were determined for the Thevenin equivalent in Example 5.4-2.
Referring to Example 5.4-2 we have
voc ¼ 96 V,
isc ¼ 1:1294 A
and
Rn ¼ Rt ¼ 85 V
Our values of voc, Rt, and isc satisfy Eq. 5.4-2, so we’re conﬁdent that they are correct. Finally, the Norton

We considered a similar problem in Example 5.4-3. In Example 5.4-3 we replaced the part of the circuit that is
connected to resistor R by its Thevenin equivalent circuit. In this example we will replace the part of the circuit that
is connected to resistor R by its Norton equivalent circuit. The Norton equivalent circuit can be obtained from the
Thevenin equivalent using a source transformation. Referring to Figure 5.4-15, we obtain Figure 5.5-7 in which the
part of the circuit that is connected to resistor R has been replaced by its Norton equivalent circuit.

in Figure 5.5-7. Replacing the part of the circuit that is connected to resistor R by its Norton equivalent circuit did
not change the current in resistor R. Consequently Eq. 5.5-1 describes the relationship between v and R in
Figure 5.5-6! We can now easily answer questions (a), (b) and (c).

The answer in part (c) is probably not acceptable because we expect 0 < R < 1. Using Eq. 5.5-1 shows that the
circuit in Figure 5.5-6 can only produce voltage in the range 0 < v < 48 V. The voltage speciﬁed in (c) is outside of
this range and cannot be obtained using a positive resistance R.

Many applications of circuits require the maximum power available from a source to be transferred to a load
resistor RL. Consider the circuit A shown in Figure 5.6-1, terminated with a load RL. As demonstrated in
Section 5.4, circuit A can be reduced to its Thevenin equivalent, as shown in Figure 5.6-2.
The general problem of power transfer can be discussed in terms of efﬁciency and effectiveness.
Power utility systems are designed to transport the power to the load with the greatest efﬁciency by
reducing the losses on the power lines. Thus, the effort is concentrated on reducing Rt, which would
represent the resistance of the source plus the line resistance. Clearly, the idea of using superconducting
lines that would exhibit no line resistance is exciting to power engineers.
In the case of signal transmission, as in the electronics and communications industries, the
problem is to attain the maximum signal strength at the load. Consider the signal received at the antenna
of an FM radio receiver from a distant station. It is the engineer’s goal to design a receiver circuit so that
the maximum power ultimately ends up at the output of the ampliﬁer circuit connected to the antenna of
your FM radio. Thus, we may represent the FM antenna and ampliﬁer by the Thevenin equivalent
circuit shown in Figure 5.6-2.
Let us consider the general circuit of Figure 5.6-2. We wish to ﬁnd the value of the load resistance
RL such that maximum power is delivered to it. First, we need to ﬁnd the power from
p ¼ i 2RL
Because the current i is
i ¼
vs
RL þ Rt
we find that the power is
p ¼

RL þ Rt

Assuming that vs and Rt are ﬁxed for a given source, the maximum power is a function of RL. To ﬁnd the
value of RL that maximizes the power, we use the differential calculus to ﬁnd where the derivative
dp=dRL equals zero. Taking the derivative, we obtain
dp

The derivative is zero when
(Rt þ RL)2  2(Rt þ RL)RL ¼ 0

or
(Rt þ RL)(Rt þ RL  2RL) ¼ 0

Solving Eq. 5.6-3, we obtain

Maximum Power Transfer
191

To conﬁrm that Eq. 5.6-4 corresponds to a maximum, it should be shown that d2p=dRL2 < 0. Therefore,
the maximum power is transferred to the load when RL is equal to the Thevenin equivalent resistance Rt.
The maximum power, when RL ¼ Rt, is then obtained by substituting RL ¼ Rt in Eq. 5.6-1 to yield
pmax ¼ vs2Rt
(2Rt)2 ¼ vs2
4Rt
The power delivered to the load will differ from the maximum attainable as the load resistance RL
departs from RL ¼ Rt. The power attained as RL varies from Rt is portrayed in Figure 5.6-3.
The maximum power transfer theorem states that the maximum power delivered to a load by
a source is attained when the load resistance, RL, is equal to the Thevenin resistance, Rt, of the
source.

MATLAB can be used to reduce the work required to determine the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit
such as the one shown in Figure 5.7-1a. First, connect a resistor, R, across the terminals of the network,
as shown in Figure 5.7-1b. Next, write node or mesh equations to describe the circuit with the resistor
connected across its terminals. In this case, the circuit in Figure 5.7-1b is represented by the mesh
equations

Solution
We will obtain the Thevenin equivalent circuit for the part of the circuit to the left of terminals a,b in Figure
5.6-7a. First, we ﬁnd voc as shown in Figure 5.6-7b. The KVL gives
6 þ 10i  2vab ¼ 0
Also, we note that vab ¼ voc ¼ 4i. Therefore,
10i  8i ¼ 6
or i ¼ 3 A. Therefore, voc ¼ 4i ¼ 12 V.
To determine the short-circuit current, we add a short circuit as shown in Figure 5.6-7c. The 4-V resistor is
short circuited and can be ignored. Writing KVL, we have
6 þ 6isc ¼ 0
Hence, isc ¼ 1 A.
Therefore, Rt ¼ voc=isc ¼ 12 V. The Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 5.6-7d with the load resistor.

We can use the computer program PSpice to ﬁnd the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit
for circuits even though they are quite complicated. Figure 5.8-1 illustrates this method. We
calculate the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Figure 5.8-1a by calculating its open-circuit
voltage voc and its short-circuit current isc. To do so, we connect a resistor across its terminals
as shown in Figure 5.8-1b. When the resistance of this resistor is inﬁnite, the resistor voltage will
be equal to the open-circuit voltage voc, as shown m Figure 5.8-1b. On the other hand, when
the resistance of this resistor is zero, the resistor current will be equal to the short-circuit current isc,
as shown in Figure 5.8-1c.
We can’t use either inﬁnite or zero resistances in PSpice, so we will approximate the inﬁnite
resistance by a resistance that is several orders of magnitude larger than the largest resistance in circuit
A. We can check whether our resistance is large enough by doubling it and rerunning the PSpice
simulation. If the computed value of voc does not change, our large resistance is effectively inﬁnite.
Similarly, we can approximate a zero resistance by a resistance that is several orders of magnitude
smaller than the smallest resistance in circuit A. Our small resistance is effectively zero when halving it
does not change the computed value of isc.

illustrates the correspondence between the VCVS and the PSpice “Part E.”
To determine the open circuit voltage, we set the resistance R to a very large value and perform a `Bias Point'
simulation (see Appendix A). Figure 5.8-6 shows the simulation results when R ¼ 20 MV. The voltage across the
resistor R is 33.6 V, so voc ¼ 33.6 V. (Doubling the value of R and rerunning the simulation did not change the value

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of

Strain Gauge Bridge
Strain gauges are transducers that measure mechanical strain. Electrically, the strain gauges are resistors. The strain
causes a change in resistance that is proportional to the strain.
Figure 5.10-1 shows four strain gauges connected in a conﬁguration called a bridge. Strain gauge bridges
measure force or pressure (Doebelin, 1966).

FIGURE 5.10-1 Design problem involving a strain gauge bridge.
The bridge output is usually a small voltage. In Figure 5.10-1, an ampliﬁer multiplies the bridge output, vi, by
a gain to obtain a larger voltage, vo, which is displayed by the voltmeter.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
A strain gauge bridge is used to measure force. The strain gauges have been positioned so that the force will
increase the resistance of two of the strain gauges while, at the same time, decreasing the resistance of the other two
strain gauges.
The strain gauges used in the bridge have nominal resistances of R ¼ 120 V. (The nominal resistance is the
resistance when the strain is zero.) This resistance is expected to increase or decrease by no more than 2 V due to
strain. This means that

Act on the Plan
We begin by ﬁnding the Thevenin equivalent of the strain gauge bridge. This requires two calculations: one to ﬁnd
the open-circuit voltage, vt, and the other to ﬁnd the Thevenin resistance Rt. Figure 5.10-2a shows the circuit used to
calculate vt. Begin by ﬁnding the currents i1 and i2.

Source transformations, summarized in Table 5.11-1, are used to
transform a circuit into an equivalent circuit. A voltage source voc
in series with a resistor Rt can be transformed into a current
source isc ¼ voc/Rt and a parallel resistor Rt. Conversely, a current
source isc in parallel with a resistor Rt can be transformed into a
voltage source voc ¼ Rtisc in series with a resistor Rt. The circuits
in Table 5.11-1 are equivalent in the sense that the voltage and
current of all circuit elements in circuit B are unchanged by the
source transformation.
The superposition theorem permits us to determine the
totalresponseof alinearcircuittoseveral independentsources
by ﬁnding the response to each independent source separately
and then adding the separate responses algebraically.
Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits, summarized in
Table 5.11-2, are used to transform a circuit into a smaller,
yet equivalent, circuit. First the circuit is separated into two
parts, circuit A and circuit B, in Table 5.11-2. Circuit A can
be replaced by either its Thevenin equivalent circuit or its
Norton equivalent circuit. The circuits in Table 5.11-2 are
equivalent in the sense that the voltage and current of all
circuit elements in circuit B are unchanged by replacing
circuit A with either its Thevenin equivalent circuit or its
Norton equivalent circuit.
Procedures for calculating the parameters voc, isc, and Rt of
the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are summarized
in Figures 5.4-3 and 5.4-4.
The goal of many electronic and communications circuits is
to deliver maximum power to a load resistor RL. Maximum
power is attained when RL is set equal to the Thevenin
resistance Rt of the circuit connected to RL. This results in
maximum power at the load when the series resistance Rt
cannot be reduced.
The computer programs MATLAB and SPICE can be used to
reduce the computational burden of calculating the parame-
ters voc, isc, and Rt of the Thevenin and Norton equivalent
circuits.

Is it possible to specify values of vs, R1, R2, and R3 that
cause the current i and the voltage v in Figure DP 5-1a to satisfy
the relationship described by the graph in Figure DP 5-3b?

described by the graph in Figure DP 5-4b.
First Hint: The equation representing the straight line in Figure

I n t r o d u c t i o n
This chapter introduces another circuit element, the operational ampliﬁer, or op amp. We will learn how
to analyze and design electric circuits that contain op amps. In particular, we will see that:
 Several models, of varying accuracy and complexity, are available for operational ampliﬁers. Simple
models are easy to use. Accurate models are more complicated. The simplest model of the
operational ampliﬁer is the ideal operational ampliﬁer.
 Circuits that contain ideal operational ampliﬁers are analyzed by writing and solving node equations.
 Operational ampliﬁers can be used to build circuits that perform mathematical operations. Many of
these circuits are widely used and have been named. Figure 6.5-1 provides a catalog of some useful
operational ampliﬁer circuits.
 Practical operational ampliﬁers have properties that are not included in the ideal operational
ampliﬁer. These include the input offset voltage, bias current, dc gain, input resistance, and output
resistance. More complicated models are needed to account for these properties.
6.2
T h e O p e r a t i o n a l A m p l i f i e r
The operational ampliﬁer is an electronic circuit element designed to be used with other circuit
elements to perform a speciﬁed signal-processing operation. The mA741 operational ampliﬁer is shown
in Figure 6.2-1a. It has eight pin connections, whose functions are indicated in Figure 6.2-1b.
The operational ampliﬁer shown in Figure 6.2-2 has ﬁve terminals. The names of these terminals
are shown in both Figure 6.2-1b and Figure 6.2-2. Notice the plus and minus signs in the triangular part
of the symbol of the operational ampliﬁer. The plus sign identiﬁes the noninverting input, and the minus
sign identiﬁes the inverting input.
The power supplies are used to bias the operational ampliﬁer. In other words, the power supplies
cause certain conditions that are required for the operational ampliﬁer to function properly. It is
219

inconvenient to include the power supplies in drawings of operational ampliﬁer circuits. These power
supplies tend to clutter drawings of operational ampliﬁer circuits, making them harder to read.
Consequently, the power supplies are frequently omitted from drawings that accompany explanations
of the function of operational ampliﬁer circuits, such as the drawings found in textbooks. It is
understood that power supplies are part of the circuit even though they are not shown. (Schematics, the
drawings used to describe how to assemble a circuit, are a different matter.) The power supply voltages
are shown in Figure 6.2-2, denoted as v+ and v.
Because the power supplies are frequently omitted from the drawing of an operational ampliﬁer
circuit, it is easy to overlook the power supply currents. This mistake is avoided by careful application
of Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL). As a general rule, it is not helpful to apply KCL in a way that involves
any power supply current. Two speciﬁc cases are of particular importance. First, the ground node in
Figure 6.2-2 is a terminal of both power supplies. Both power supply currents would be involved if
KCL were applied to the ground node. These currents must not be overlooked. It is best simply to
refrain from applying KCL at the ground node of an operational ampliﬁer circuit. Second, KCL requires
that the sum of all currents into the operational ampliﬁer be zero:
i1 þ i2 þ io þ iþ þ i ¼ 0
Both power supply currents are involved in this equation. Once again, these currents must not be
overlooked. It is best simply to refrain from applying KCL to sum the currents into an operational
ampliﬁer when the power supplies are omitted from the circuit diagram.

6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

6.3
T h e I d e a l O p e r a t i o n a l A m p l i f i e r
Operational ampliﬁers are complicated devices that exhibit both linear and nonlinear behavior.
The operational ampliﬁer output voltage and current, vo and io, must satisfy three conditions for an
operational ampliﬁer to be linear, that is:
jvoj  vsat
jioj  isat
dvo(t)
dt

  SR
ð6:3-1Þ
The saturation voltage vsat, the saturation current isat, and the slew rate limit SR are all parameters of an
operational ampliﬁer. For example, if a mA741 operational ampliﬁer is biased using þ15-V and 15-V
power supplies, then
vsat ¼ 14 V;
isat ¼ 2 mA;
and
SR ¼ 500,000 V
s
ð6:3-2Þ
These restrictions reﬂect the fact that operational ampliﬁers cannot produce arbitrarily large voltages or
arbitrarily large currents or change output voltage arbitrarily quickly.
Figure 6.3-1 describes the ideal operational ampliﬁer. The ideal operational ampliﬁer is a simple
model of an operational ampliﬁer that is linear. The ideal operational ampliﬁer is characterized by
restrictions on its input currents and voltages. The currents into the input terminals of an ideal
operational ampliﬁer are zero. Consequently, in Figure 6.3-1,
i1 ¼ 0
and
i2 ¼ 0
The node voltages at the input nodes of an ideal operational ampliﬁer are equal. Consequently, in
Figure 6.3-1,
v2 ¼ v1
The ideal operational ampliﬁer is a model of a linear operational ampliﬁer, so the operational ampliﬁer
output current and voltage must satisfy the restrictions in Eq. 6.3-1. If they do not, then the ideal
operational ampliﬁer is not an appropriate model of the real operational ampliﬁer. The output current
and voltage depend on the circuit in which the operational ampliﬁer is used. The ideal op amp
conditions are summarized in Table 6.3-1.

and (b) an equivalent

consequences of modeling

as an ideal operational

v2, and vo are node
voltages.
Solution
Figure 6.3-2b shows the circuit when the operational ampliﬁer of Figure 6.3-2a is modeled as an ideal operational
ampliﬁer.
1.
The inverting input node and output node of the operational ampliﬁer are connected by a short circuit, so the
node voltages at these nodes are equal:
v1 ¼ vo
2.
The voltages at the inverting and noninverting nodes of an ideal op amp are equal:
v2 ¼ v1 ¼ vo
3.
The currents into the inverting and noninverting nodes of an operational ampliﬁer are zero, so
i1 ¼ 0
and
i2 ¼ 0
4.
The current in resistor Rs is i2 ¼ 0, so the voltage across Rs is 0 V. The voltage across Rs is vs  v2 ¼ vs  vo;
hence,
vs  vo ¼ 0
or
vs ¼ vo
Does this solution satisfy the requirements of Eqs. 6.3-1 and 6.3-2? The output current of the operational ampliﬁer
must be calculated. Apply KCL at the output node of the operational ampliﬁer to get
i1 þ io þ vo

It is convenient to use node equations to analyze circuits containing ideal operational
ampliﬁers.
There are three things to remember.
1.
The node voltages at the input nodes of ideal operational ampliﬁers are equal. Thus, one of these
two node voltages can be eliminated from the node equations. For example, in Figure 6.4-1, the
voltages at the input nodes of the ideal operational ampliﬁer are v1 and v2. Because
v1 ¼ v2
v2 can be eliminated from the node equations.
Because i1 ¼ 0,
io ¼  vo

This is consistent with the use of the ideal operational ampliﬁer. On the other hand, when vs ¼ 10 V and
RL ¼ 2 kV, then
vs
RL
¼ 5 mA > 2 mA
so it is not appropriate to model the mA741 as an ideal operational ampliﬁer when vs ¼ 10 V and RL ¼ 2 kV.
When vs ¼ 10 V, we require RL > 5 kV to satisfy Eq. 6.3-1.

2.
The currents in the input leads of an ideal operational ampliﬁer are zero. These currents are involved
in the KCL equations at the input nodes of the operational ampliﬁer.
3.
The output current of the operational ampliﬁer is not zero. This current is involved in the KCL
equations at the output node of the operational ampliﬁer. Applying KCL at this node adds another
unknown to the node equations. If the output current of the operational ampliﬁer is not to be
determined, then it is not necessary to apply KCL at the output node of the operational ampliﬁer.

called a bridge is shown in Figure 6.4-2b. The operational ampliﬁer and resistors R5 and R6 are used to amplify the output
of the bridge. The operational ampliﬁer in Figure 6.4-2a has been modeled as an ideal operational ampliﬁer. As a

Solution
Here is an opportunity to use Thevenin’s theorem. Figure 6.4-2c shows the Thevenin equivalent of the bridge
circuit. Figure 6.4-2d shows the bridge ampliﬁer after the bridge has been replaced by its Thevenin equivalent.
Figure 6.4-2d is simpler than Figure 6.4-2a. It is easier to write and solve the node equations representing Figure
6.4-2d than it is to write and solve the node equations representing Figure 6.4-2a. Thevenin’s theorem assures us
that the voltage vo in Figure 6.4-2d is the same as the voltage vo in Figure 6.4-2a.
Let us write node equations representing the circuit in Figure 6.4-2d. First, notice that the node voltage va is

One of the early applications of operational ampliﬁers was to build circuits that performed mathematical
operations. Indeed, the operational ampliﬁer takes its name from this important application. Many of the
operational ampliﬁer circuits that perform mathematical operations are used so often that they have been
given names. These names are part of an electrical engineer’s vocabulary. Figure 6.5-1 shows several
standard operational ampliﬁer circuits. The next several examples show how to use Figure 6.5-1 to design

Preventing Loading Using
a Voltage Follower
This example illustrates the use of a voltage follower to prevent loading. The voltage follower is shown in Figure
6.5-1c. Loading can occur when two circuits are connected. Consider Figure 6.5-2. In Figure 6.5-2a, the output of
circuit 1 is the voltage va. In Figure 6.5-2b, circuit 2 is connected to circuit 1. The output of circuit 1 is used as the
input to circuit 2. Unfortunately, connecting circuit 2 to circuit 1 can change the output of circuit 1. This is called
loading. Referring again to Figure 6.5-2, circuit 2 is said to load circuit 1 if vb 6¼ va. The current ib is called the load
current. Circuit 1 is required to provide this current in Figure 6.5-2b but not in Figure 6.5-2a. This is the cause of the
loading. The load current can be eliminated using a voltage follower as shown in Figure 6.5-2c. The voltage follower
copies voltage va from the output of circuit 1 to the input of circuit 2 without disturbing circuit 1.

FIGURE 6.5-3 A voltage divider (a) before and (b) after a 30-kV resistor is added. (c) A voltage follower is added to prevent
loading.
Solution
As a speciﬁc example, consider Figure 6.5-3. The voltage divider shown in Figure 6.5-3a can be analyzed by
writing a node equation at node 1:
va  vin
20,000 þ
va
60,000 ¼ 0
Solving for va, we have
va ¼ 3
4 vin
In Figure 6.5-3b, a resistor is connected across the output of the voltage divider. This circuit can be analyzed
by writing a node equation at node 1:
vb  vin
20,000 þ
vb
60,000 þ
vb
30,000 ¼ 0
Solving for vb, we have
vb ¼ 1
2 vin
Because vb 6¼ va, connecting the resistor directly to the voltage divider loads the voltage divider. This loading is
caused by the current required by the 30-kV resistor. Without the voltage follower, the voltage divider must provide
this current.
In Figure 6.5-3c, a voltage follower is used to connect the 30-kV resistor to the output of the voltage divider.
Once again, the circuit can be analyzed by writing a node equation at node 1:
vc  vin
20,000 þ
vc
60,000 ¼ 0
Solving for vc, we have
vc ¼ 3
4 vin
Because vc ¼ va, loading is avoided when the voltage follower is used to connect the resistor to the
voltage divider. The voltage follower, not the voltage divider, provides the current required by the 30-kV
resistor.

6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

E X A M P L E 6 . 5 - 2
Ampliﬁer Design
A common application of operational ampliﬁers is to scale a voltage, that is, to multiply a voltage by a constant, K, so that
vo ¼ Kvin
This situation is illustrated in Figure 6.5-4a. The input voltage vin is provided by an ideal voltage source. The output
voltage vo is the element voltage of a 100-kV resistor.
Circuits that perform this operation are usually called ampliﬁers. The constant K is called the gain of the ampliﬁer.
The required value of the constant K will determine which of the circuits is selected from Figure 6.5-1. There
are four cases to consider: K < 0, K > 1, K ¼ 1, and 0 < K < 1.
Solution
Because resistor values are positive, the gain of the inverting ampliﬁer, shown in Figure 6.5-1a, is negative.
Accordingly, when K < 0 is required, an inverting ampliﬁer is used. For example, suppose we require K ¼ 5.
From Figure 6.5-1a,
5 ¼  Rf
R1
so
Rf ¼ 5R1
As a rule of thumb, it is a good idea to choose resistors in operational ampliﬁer circuits that have values between
5 kV and 500 kV when possible. Choosing
R1 ¼ 10 kV
gives
Rf ¼ 50 kV
The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 6.5-4b.
Next, suppose we require K ¼ 5. The noninverting ampliﬁer, shown in Figure 6.5-1b, is used to obtain gains
greater than 1. From Figure 6.5-1b

so
Rf ¼ 4R1
Choosing R1 ¼ 10 kV gives Rf ¼ 40 kV. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 6.5-4c.
Consider using the noninverting ampliﬁer of Figure 6.5-1b to obtain a gain K ¼ 1. From Figure 6.5-1b,
1 ¼ 1 þ Rf
R1
so
Rf
R1
¼ 0
This can be accomplished by replacing Rf by a short circuit (Rf ¼ 0) or by replacing R1 by an open circuit (R1 ¼ 1)
or both. Doing both converts a noninverting ampliﬁer into a voltage follower. The gain of the voltage follower is 1.
In Figure 6.5-4d, a voltage follower is used for the case K ¼ 1.
There is no ampliﬁer in Figure 6.5-1 that has a gain between 0 and 1. Such a circuit can be obtained using a
voltage divider together with a voltage follower. Suppose we require K ¼ 0:8. First, design a voltage divider to
have an attenuation equal to K:
0:8 ¼

so
R2 ¼ 4  R1
Choosing R1 ¼ 20 kV gives R2 ¼ 80 kV. Adding a voltage follower gives the circuit shown in Figure 6.5-4e.
E X A M P L E 6 . 5 - 3
Designing a Noninverting Summing Ampliﬁer
Design a circuit having one output, vo, and three inputs, v1, v2, and v3. The output must be related to the inputs by
vo ¼ 2v1 þ 3v2 þ 4v3
In addition, the inputs are restricted to having values between 1 V and 1 V, that is,
jvij  1 V
i ¼ 1; 2; 3
Consider using an operational ampliﬁer having isat ¼ 2 mA and vsat ¼ 15 V and design the circuit.
Solution
The required circuit must multiply each input by a separate positive number and add the results. The noninverting
summer shown in Figure 6.5-1e can do these operations. This circuit is represented by six parameters: K1, K2, K3,
K4, Ra, and Rb. Designing the noninverting summer amounts to choosing values for these six parameters. Notice
that K1 þ K2 þ K3 < 1 is required to ensure that all of the resistors have positive values. Pick K4 ¼ 10 (a convenient
value that is just a little larger than 2 þ 3 þ 4 ¼ 9). Then,
vo ¼ 2v1 þ 3v2 þ 4v3 ¼ 10 0:2v1 þ 0:3v2 þ 0:4v3
ð
Þ
That is, K4 ¼ 10, K1 ¼ 0.2, K2 ¼ 0.3, and K3 ¼ 0.4. Figure 6.5-1e does not provide much guidance in picking
values of Ra and Rb. Try Ra ¼ Rb ¼ 100 V.
Then, for example

This section describes a procedure for designing operational ampliﬁer circuits to implement linear
algebraic equations. Some of the node voltages of the operational ampliﬁer circuit will represent the
variables in the algebraic equation. For example, the equation
z ¼ 4x  5y þ 2
ð6:6-1Þ
will be represented by an operational ampliﬁer circuit that has node voltages vx, vy, and vz that are
related by the equation
vz ¼ 4vx  5vy þ 2

How large can the output voltage be? We know that

so

The operational ampliﬁer output voltage will always be less than vsat.
That’s good. Now what about the output current? Notice that

This produces the circuit shown in Figure 6.5-6. Increasing Ra and Rb does not change the operational ampliﬁer

vo ¼ 2v1 þ 3v2 þ 4v3
and
jvoj  2jv1j þ 3jv2j þ 4jv3j  9 V

Operational Amplifier Circuits and Linear Algebraic Equations

A voltage or current that is used to represent something is called a signal.
That “something” could be a temperature or a position or a force or something else. In this case, vx, vy,
and vz are signals representing the variables x, y, and z.
Equation 6.6-1 shows how the value of z can be obtained from values of x and y. Similarly, Eq.
6.6-2 shows how the value of vz can be obtained from values of vx and vy. The operational ampliﬁer
circuit will have one output, vz, and two inputs, vx and vy.
The design procedure has two steps. First, we represent the equation by a diagram called a block
diagram. Second, we implement each block of the block diagram as an operational ampliﬁer circuit.
We will start with the algebraic equation. Equation 6.6-1 indicates that the value of variable z can
be calculated from the values of the variables x and y using the operations of addition, subtraction, and
multiplication by a constant multiplier. Equation 6.6-1 can be rewritten as
z ¼ 4x þ 5
ð
Þy þ 2
ð6:6-3Þ
Equation 6.6-3 indicates that z can be obtained from x and y using only addition
and multiplication, though one of the multipliers is now negative.
Figure 6.6-1 shows symbolic representations of the operations of addition and
multiplication by a constant. In Figure 6.6-1a, the operation of multiplication by a
constant multiplier is represented by a rectangle together with two arrows, one
pointing toward and one pointing away from the rectangle. The arrow pointing
toward the rectangle is labeled by a variable representing the input to the operation,
that is, the variable that is to be multiplied by the constant. Similarly, the arrow
pointing away from the rectangle is labeled by a variable representing the output, or
result, of the operation. The rectangle itself is labeled with the value of the multiplier.
The symbol shown in Figure 6.6-1b represents the operation of addition. The
rectangle is labeled with a plus sign. The arrows that point toward the rectangle are
labeled by the variables that are to be added. There are as many of these arrows as
there are variables to be added. One arrow points away from the rectangle. This
arrow is labeled by the variable representing the sum.
The rectangles that represent addition and multiplication by a constant are
calledblocks.Adiagramcomposedofsuchblocksiscalledablockdiagram.Figure
6.6-2 represents Eq. 6.6-3 as a block diagram. Each block in the block diagram
corresponds to an operation in the equation. Notice, in particular, that the product
4x has two roles in Eq. 6.6-3. The product 4x is both the output of one operation,
multiplying x by the constant 4, and one of the inputs to another operation, adding
4x to 5y and 2 to obtain z. This observation is used to construct the block diagram.
Theproduct4xistheoutputofoneblockandtheinputtoanother.Indeed,thisobservationexplainswhythe
output of the block that multiplies x by 4 is connected to an input of the block that adds 4x to 5y and 2.
Next, consider designing an operational ampliﬁer circuit to implement the block diagram in Figure
6.6-2. The blocks representing multiplication by a constant multiplier can be implemented using either
invertingornoninvertingampliﬁers,dependingonthesignofthemultiplier.Todoso,designtheampliﬁer
to have a gain that is equal to the multiplier of the corresponding block. (Noninverting ampliﬁers can be
usedwhentheconstantisbothpositiveandgreaterthan1.Example6.5-2showsthatacircuitconsistingofa
voltage divider and voltage follower can be used when the constant is positive and less than 1.)
Figures 6.6-3b,d,f show operational ampliﬁer circuits that implement the blocks shown in Figures
6.6-3a,c,e, respectively. The block in Figure 6.6-3a requires multiplication by a positive constant, 4.
Figure 6.6-3b shows the corresponding operational ampliﬁer circuit, a noninverting ampliﬁer having a
gain equal to 4. This noninverting ampliﬁer is designed by referring to Figure 6.5-1b and setting

6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

R1 ¼ 20 kV
and
Rf ¼ 3R1 ¼ 60 kV
(A useful rule of thumb suggests selecting resistors for operational ampliﬁer circuits to have resistances
in the range 5 kV to 500 kV.)
In Figure 6.6-3b, the notation vx ¼ x indicates that vx is a voltage that represents x. A voltage or
current that is used to represent something else is called a signal, so vx is the signal representing x.
The block in Figure 6.6-3c requires multiplication by a negative constant, 5. Figure 6.6-3d
shows the corresponding operational ampliﬁer circuit, an inverting ampliﬁer having a gain equal to 5.
Design this inverting ampliﬁer by referring to Figure 6.5-1a and setting
R1 ¼ 20 kV
and
Rf ¼ 5 R1 ¼ 100 kV
The block in Figure 6.6-3e requires adding three terms. Figure
6.6-3f shows the corresponding operational ampliﬁer circuit, a non-
inverting summer. Design the noninverting summer by referring to
Figure 6.6-4 and setting
R1 ¼ 20 kV;
n ¼ 3;
and
nR ¼ 3 20,000
ð
Þ ¼ 60 kV
(The noninverting summer is a special case of the noninverting-
summing ampliﬁer shown in Figure 6.5-1e. Take K1 ¼ K2 ¼ K3 ¼ 1=
(n þ 1), K4 ¼ n, Rb ¼ R, and Ra ¼ R=(n þ 1) in Figure 6.5-1e to get
the circuit shown in Figure 6.6-4.)
Figure 6.6-5 shows the circuit obtained by replacing each block
in Figure 6.6-2 by the corresponding operational ampliﬁer circuit
from Figure 6.6-3. The circuit in Figure 6.6-5 does indeed implement
Eq. 6.6-3, but it’s possible to improve this circuit.
The constant input to the summer has been implemented using a 2-V voltage source. Although
correct, this may be more expensive than necessary. Voltage sources are relatively expensive
devices, considerably more expensive than resistors or operational ampliﬁers. We can reduce the cost
of this circuit by using a voltage source we already have instead of getting a new one. Recall that we
need power supplies to bias the operational ampliﬁer. Suppose that 15-V voltage sources are used
to bias the operational ampliﬁer. We can reduce costs by using the 15-V voltage source together

voltages of the power supplies used to bias the operational ampliﬁer. That is, vsat is approximately 15 V
when 15-V voltage sources are used to bias the operational ampliﬁer. In Figure 6.6.7, vz, 4vx, and
5vy are each output voltages of one of the operational ampliﬁers. Consequently,

and

ð6:6-4Þ
The simple encoding of x, y, and z by vx, vy, and vz is
vx ¼ x;
vy ¼ y;
and
vz ¼ z
ð6:6-5Þ
This is convenient because, for example, vz ¼ 4.5 V indicates that z ¼ 4.5. However, using Eq. 6.6-3 to
replace vx, vy, and vz in Eq. 6.6-4 with x, y, and z gives
jxj  3:75;
jyj  3:0;
and
jzj  15
Should these conditions be too restrictive, consider deﬁning the relationship between the signals vx, vy,
and vz and the variables x, y, and z differently. For example, suppose
vx ¼ x
10 ;
vy ¼ y
10 ;
and
vz ¼ z
10
ð6:6-6Þ
Now we need to multiply the value of vz by 10 to get the value of z. For example, vz ¼ 4.5 V indicates
that z ¼ 45. On the other hand, the circuit can accommodate larger values of x, y, and z. Equations 6.6-4
and 6.6-6 imply that

The ideal operational ampliﬁer is the simplest model of an operational ampliﬁer. This simplicity is obtained
by ignoring some imperfections of practical operational ampliﬁers. This section considers some of these
imperfections and provides alternate operational ampliﬁer models to account for these imperfections.
Consider the operational ampliﬁer shown in Figure 6.7-1a. If this operational ampliﬁer is
ideal, then
i1 ¼ 0;
i2 ¼ 0;
and
v1  v2 ¼ 0
ð6:7-1Þ
In contrast, the operational ampliﬁer model shown in Figure 6.7-1d accounts for several nonideal
parameters of practical operational ampliﬁers, namely:
 Nonzero bias currents.
 Nonzero input offset voltage.
 Finite input resistance.
 Nonzero output resistance.
 Finite voltage gain.
This model more accurately describes practical operational ampliﬁers than does the ideal operational
ampliﬁer. Unfortunately, the more accurate model of Figure 6.7-1d is much more complicated
and much more difﬁcult to use than the ideal operational ampliﬁer. The models in Figures 6.7-1b and
6.7-1c provide a compromise. These models are more accurate than the ideal operational ampliﬁer but
easier to use than the model in Figure 6.7-1d. It will be convenient to have names for these models.

6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

The model in Figure 6.7-1b will be called the offsets model of the operational ampliﬁer. Similarly, the
model in Figure 6.7-1c will be called the ﬁnite gain model of the operational ampliﬁer, and the model in
Figure 6.7-1d will be called the offsets and ﬁnite gain model of the operational ampliﬁer.
The operational ampliﬁer model shown in Figure 6.7-1b accounts for the nonzero bias current and
nonzero input offset voltage of practical operational ampliﬁers but not the ﬁnite input resistance, the
nonzero output resistance, or the ﬁnite voltage gain. This model consists of three independent sources
and an ideal operational ampliﬁer. In contrast to the ideal operational ampliﬁer, the operational
ampliﬁer model that accounts for offsets is represented by the equations
i1 ¼ ib1;
i2 ¼ ib2;
and
v1  v2 ¼ vos
ð6:7-2Þ
The voltage vos is a small, constant voltage called the input offset voltage. The currents ib1 and ib2 are
called the bias currents of the operational ampliﬁer. They are small, constant currents. The difference
between the bias currents is called the input offset current ios of the ampliﬁer:
ios ¼ ib1  ib2
Notice that when the bias currents and input offset voltage are all zero, Eq. 6.7-2 is the same as
Eq. 6.7-1. In other words, the offsets model reverts to the ideal operational ampliﬁer when the bias
currents and input offset voltage are zero.
Frequently, the bias currents and input offset voltage can be ignored because they are very small.
However, when the input signal to a circuit is itself small, the bias currents and input voltage can
become important.
Manufacturers specify a maximum value for the bias currents, the input offset current, and the
input offset voltage. For the mA741, the maximum bias current is speciﬁed to be 500 nA, the maximum
input offset current is speciﬁed to be 200 nA, and the maximum input offset voltage is speciﬁed to be
5 mV. These speciﬁcations guarantee that

Table 6.7-1 shows the bias currents, offset current, and input offset voltage typical of several types of
operational ampliﬁer.

Offset Voltage and Bias Currents
The inverting ampliﬁer shown in Figure 6.7-2a contains a mA741 operational ampliﬁer. This inverting ampliﬁer
designed in Example 6.5-2 has a gain of 5, that is,
vo ¼ 5  vin
The design of the inverting ampliﬁer is based on the ideal model of an operational ampliﬁer and so did not account
for the bias currents and input offset voltage of the mA741 operational ampliﬁer. In this example, the offsets model
of an operational ampliﬁer will be used to analyze the circuit. This analysis will tell us what effect the bias currents
and input offset voltage have on the performance of this circuit.

FIGURE 6.7-2 (a) An inverting ampliﬁer and (b) an equivalent circuit that accounts for the input offset voltage and bias currents of
the operational ampliﬁer. (c)–( f ) Analysis using superposition.
Solution
In Figure 6.7-2b, the operational ampliﬁer has been replaced by the offsets model of an operational ampliﬁer.
Notice that the operational ampliﬁer in Figure 6.7-2b is the ideal operational ampliﬁer that is part of the model of
the operational ampliﬁer used to account for the offsets. The circuit in Figure 6.7-2b contains four inputs that
correspond to the four independent sources vin, ib1, ib2, and vos. (The input vin is obtained by connecting a voltage
source to the circuit. In contrast, the “inputs” ib1, ib2, and vos are the results of imperfections of the operational
ampliﬁer. These inputs are part of the operational ampliﬁer model and do not need to be added to the circuit.)
Superposition can be used to good advantage in analyzing this circuit. Figures 6.7-2c–6.7-2f illustrate this process.
In each of these ﬁgures, all but one input has been set to zero, and the output due to that one input has been
calculated.
Figure 6.7-2c shows the circuit used to calculate the response to vin alone. The other inputs ib1, ib2, and
vos have all been set to zero. Recall that zero current sources act like open circuits and zero voltage sources
act like short circuits. Figure 6.7-2c is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current sources ib1, ib2
by open circuits and by replacing the voltage source vos by a short circuit. The operational ampliﬁer in

6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

Figure 6.7-2c is the ideal operational ampliﬁer that is part of the offsets model. Analysis of the inverting ampliﬁer in
Figure 6.7-2c gives
vo ¼ 5  vin
Next, consider Figure 6.7-2d. This circuit is used to calculate the response to vos alone. The other inputs vin,
ib1, and ib2 have all been set to zero. Figure 6.7-2d is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current sources
ib1 and ib2 by open circuits and by replacing the voltage source vin by a short circuit. Again, the operational ampliﬁer
is the ideal operational ampliﬁer from the offsets model. The circuit in Figure 6.7-2d is one we have seen before; it
is the noninverting ampliﬁer (Figure 6.5-1b). Analysis of this noninverting ampliﬁer gives
vo ¼
1 þ 50,000
10,000


 vos ¼ 6 vos
Next, consider Figure 6.7-2e. This circuit is used to calculate the response to ib1 alone. The other inputs vin,
vos, and ib2 have all been set to zero. Figure 6.7-2e is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current source ib2
by an open circuit and by replacing the voltage sources vin and vos by short circuits. Notice that the voltage across
the 10-kV resistor is zero because this resistor is connected between the input nodes of the ideal operational
ampliﬁer. Ohm’s law says that the current in the 10-kV resistor must be zero. The current in the
50-kV resistor is ib1. Finally, paying attention to the reference directions,
vo ¼ 50,000  ib1
Figure 6.7-2f is used to calculate the response to ib2 alone. The other inputs vin, vos, and ib1 have all been set to
zero. Figure 6.7-2f is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current source ib1 by an open circuit and by
replacing the voltage sources vin and vos by short circuits. Replacing vos by a short circuit inserts a short circuit
across the current source ib2. Again, the voltage across the 10-kV resistor is zero, so the current in the 10-kV
resistor must be zero. Kirchhoff’s current law shows that the current in the 50-kV resistor is also zero. Finally,
vo ¼ 0
The output caused by all four inputs working together is the sum of the outputs caused by each input working
alone. Therefore,
vo ¼ 5  vin þ 6  vos þ 50,000
ð
Þib1
When the input of the inverting ampliﬁer vin is zero, the output vo also should be zero. However, vo is nonzero when
we have a ﬁnite vos or ib1. Let
output offset voltage ¼ 6  vos þ 50,000
ð
Þib1
Then
vo ¼ 5  vin þ output offset voltage
Recall that when the operational ampliﬁer is modeled as an ideal operational ampliﬁer, analysis of this inverting
ampliﬁer gives
vo ¼ 5  vin
Comparing these last two equations shows that bias currents and input offset voltage cause the output offset
voltage. Modeling the operational ampliﬁer as an ideal operational ampliﬁer amounts to assuming that the output
offset voltage is not important and thus ignoring it. Using the operational ampliﬁer model that accounts for offsets
is more accurate but also more complicated.
How large is the output offset voltage of this inverting ampliﬁer? The input offset voltage of a mA741
operational ampliﬁer will be at most 5 mV, and the bias current will be at most 500 nA, so
output offset voltage  6 0:005
ð
Þ þ 50 103


500 109


¼ 55 mV
We note that we can ignore the effect of the offset voltage only when j5 vinj > 500 mV or jvinj > 100 mV. The
output offset error can be reduced by using a better operational ampliﬁer, that is, one that guarantees smaller bias
currents and input offset voltage.
Characteristics of Practical Operational Amplifiers
241

Now, let us turn our attention to different parameters of practical operational ampliﬁers. The
operational ampliﬁer model shown in Figure 6.7-1c accounts for the ﬁnite input resistance, the nonzero
output resistance, and the ﬁnite voltage gain of practical operational ampliﬁers but not the nonzero bias
current and nonzero input offset voltage. This model consists of two resistors and a VCVS.
The ﬁnite gain model reverts to an ideal operational ampliﬁer when the gain A becomes inﬁnite.
To see that this is so, notice that in Figure 6.7-1c
vo ¼ A v2  v1
ð
Þ þ Roio
so
v2  v1 ¼ vo  Roio
A
The models in Figure 6.7-1, as well as the model of the ideal operational ampliﬁer, are valid only when
vo and io satisfy Eq. 6.3-1. Therefore,
jvoj  vsat
and
jioj  isat
Then
jv2  v1j  vsat þ Roisat
A
Therefore;
lim
A!1 v2  v1
ð
Þ ¼ 0
Next, because
i1 ¼  v2  v1
Ri
and
i2 ¼ v2  v1
Ri
we conclude that
lim
A!1 i1 ¼ 0
and
lim
A!1 i2 ¼ 0
Thus, i1, i2, and v2  v1 satisfy Eq. 6.7-1. In other words, the ﬁnite gain model of the operational
ampliﬁer reverts to the ideal operational ampliﬁer as the gain becomes inﬁnite. The gain for practical
op amps ranges from 100,000 to 107.

What effects will the input resistance, output resistance, and ﬁnite voltage gain of a practical operational ampliﬁer
have on the performance of this circuit? To answer this question, replace the operational ampliﬁer by the
operational ampliﬁer model that accounts for ﬁnite voltage gain. This gives the circuit shown in Figure 6.7-3b.

6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

Solution
To be speciﬁc, suppose R1 ¼ 1 kV; RL ¼ 10 kV; and the parameters of the practical operational ampliﬁer are
Ri ¼ 100 kV, Ro ¼ 100V, and A ¼ 105V/V.
Suppose that vo ¼ 10 V. We can ﬁnd the current iL in the output resistor as
iL ¼ vo
RL
¼ 10
104 ¼ 103 A
Apply KCL at the top node of RL to get
i1 þ io þ iL ¼ 0
It will turn out that i1 will be much smaller than both io and iL. It is useful to make the approximation that i1 ¼ 0.
(We will check this assumption later in this example.) Then,
io ¼ iL
Next, apply KVL to the mesh consisting of the VCVS, Ro, and RL to get
A v2  v1
ð
Þ  ioRo þ iLRL ¼ 0
Combining the last two equations and solving for (v2  v1) gives
v2  v1 ¼ iL Ro þ RL
ð

i1 ¼ v1  v2
Ri
¼ 1:01  104 V
100,000
¼ 1:01  109 A
This justiﬁes our earlier assumption that i1 is negligible compared with io and iL.
Applying KVL to the outside loop gives
vs  i1R1  i1Ri þ vo ¼ 0
Now, let us do some algebra to determine vs:

Thus, the input resistance, output resistance, and voltage gain of the practical operational ampliﬁer have only a
small, essentially negligible, combined effect on the performance of the buffer ampliﬁer.
Characteristics of Practical Operational Amplifiers
243

Table 6.7-1 lists two other parameters of practical operational ampliﬁers that have not yet been
mentioned. They are the common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and the gain bandwidth product.
Consider ﬁrst the common mode rejection ratio. In the ﬁnite gain model, the voltage of the dependent
source is
A v2  v1
ð
Þ
In practice, we ﬁnd that dependent source voltage is more accurately expressed as
A v2  v1
ð



where
v2  v1 is called the differential input voltage;
v1 þ v2

is called the common mode input voltage;
and
Acm is called the common mode gain:
The gain A is sometimes called the differential gain to distinguish it from Acm. The common mode
rejection ratio is deﬁned to be the ratio of A to Acm
CMRR ¼ A

In most cases, negligible error is caused by ignoring the CMRR of the operational ampliﬁer. The CMRR
does not need to be considered unless accurate measurements of very small differential voltages must be
made in the presence of very large common mode voltages.
Next, we consider the gain bandwidth product of the operational ampliﬁer. The ﬁnite gain model
indicates that the gain A of the operational ampliﬁer is a constant. Suppose
v1 ¼ 0
and
v2 ¼ M sin ot
so that
v2  v1 ¼ M sin ot
The voltage of the dependent source in the ﬁnite gain model will be
A v2  v1
ð
Þ ¼ A  M sin ot
244
6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

The amplitude A  M of this sinusoidal voltage does not depend on the frequency o. Practical
operational ampliﬁers do not work this way. The gain of a practical ampliﬁer is a function of
frequency, say A(o). For many practical ampliﬁers, A(o) can be adequately represented as
A o
ð Þ ¼ B
jo
It is not necessary to know now how this function behaves. Functions of this sort will be discussed in
Chapter 13. For now, it is enough to realize that the parameter B is used to describe the dependence of
the operational ampliﬁer gain on frequency. The parameter B is called the gain bandwidth product of the
operational ampliﬁer.
EXERCISE 6.7-1
The input offset voltage of a typical mA741 operational ampliﬁer is 1 mV, and
the bias current is 80 nA. Suppose the operational ampliﬁer in Figure 6.7-2a is a typical mA741. Show
that the output offset voltage of the inverting ampliﬁer will be at most 10 mV.
EXERCISE 6.7-2
Suppose the 10-kV resistor in Figure 6.7-2a is changed to 2 kV and the 50-kV
resistor is changed to 10 kV. (These changes will not change the gain of the inverting ampliﬁer. It will
still be 5.) Show that the maximum output offset voltage is reduced to 35 mV. (Use ib ¼ 500 nA and
vos¼ 5 mV to calculate the maximum output offset voltage that could be caused by the mA741 ampliﬁer.)
EXERCISE 6.7-3
Suppose the mA741 operational ampliﬁer in Figure 6.7-2a is
replaced with a typical OPA101AM operational ampliﬁer. Show that the output offset
voltage of the inverting ampliﬁer will be at most 0.6 mV.

Suppose that R1 ¼ 2 kV, R2 ¼ 50 kV, and vs ¼ 4 cos

100 cos(2000 pt) V. This is not a practical answer. It’s likely
that the operational ampliﬁer saturates, and, therefore, the ideal
op amp is not an appropriate model of the operational ampliﬁer.

where vsat denotes the saturation voltage of the operational ampliﬁer. Equation 6.8-2 is a more accurate,
but more complicated, model of the inverting ampliﬁer than Eq. 6.8-1. Of course, we prefer the simpler
model, and we use the more complicated model only when we have reason to believe that answers based
on the simpler model are not accurate.

operational ampliﬁer model includes voltage saturation. Figure 6.8-2 shows the MATLAB input ﬁle, and

Consider an op amp circuit having one input, vi, and one output, vo. Let’s plot the output voltage as a
function of the input voltage using PSpice. We need to do the following:
1.
Draw the circuit in the OrCAD Capture workspace.
2.
Specify a DC Sweep simulation.
3.
Run the simulation.
4.
Plot the simulation results.
The DC Sweep simulation provides a way to vary the input of a circuit and then plot the output as
a function of the input.

Using PSpice to Analyze an Op Amp Circuit
The input to the circuit shown in Figure 6.9-1 is the voltage source voltage vi.
The response is the voltage vo. Use PSpice to plot the output voltage as a
function of the input voltage.
Solution
We begin by drawing the circuit in the OrCAD workspace as shown in
Figure 6.9-2 (see Appendix A). The op amp in Figure 6.9-2 is represented by
the PSpice part named OPAMP from the ANALOG library. The circuit output
is a node voltage. It’s convenient to give the output voltage a PSpice name. In
Figure 6.9-2, a PSpice part called an off-page connector is used to label the
output node as “o.” Labeling the output node in this way gives the circuit
output the PSpice name V(o).
We will perform a DC Sweep simulation. (Select PSpice\New Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD Capture menu
bar, then DC Sweep from the Analysis Type drop-down list. Specify the Sweep variable to be the input voltage by
selecting Voltage Source and identifying the voltage source as Vi. Specify a linear sweep and the desired range of input
voltages.) Select PSpice\Run Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD Capture menu bar to ran the simulation.
After a successful DC Sweep simulation, OrCAD Capture will automatically open a Schematics window.
Select Trace/Add Trace from the Schematics menus to pop up the Add Traces dialog box. Select V(o) from the

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problems discussed in this chapter.
Simulation Output Variables list. Close the Add Traces dialog box. Figure 6.9-3 shows the resulting plot after
removing the grid and labeling some points. The plot is a straight line. Consequently, the circuit output is related to
the circuit input by an equation of the form

where the values of the slope m and intercept b can be determined from the points labeled in Figure 6.9-3. In particular,

How Can We Check Op Amp Circuits?
The circuit in Figure 6.10-1a was analyzed by writing and solving the following set of simultaneous equations
v6
10 þ i5 ¼ 0
10i5 ¼ v4
248
6. The Operational Ampliﬁer

v4
10 þ i3 ¼ i2
3 ¼ 5i2 þ 10i3
20i3 ¼ v6
(These equations use units of volts, milliamps, and kohms.) A computer and the program Mathcad were used to
solve these equations as shown in Figure 6.10-1b. The solution of these equations indicates that
i2 ¼ 0:6 mA;
i3 ¼ 0:6 mA;
v4 ¼ 12 V;
i5 ¼ 1:2 mA;
and
v6 ¼ 12 V
How can we check that these voltage and current values are correct?
Solution
Consider the voltage v3. Using Ohm’s law,
v3 ¼ 20i3 ¼ 20 0:6
ð
Þ ¼ 12 V
Remember that resistances are in kV and currents in milliamps. Applying KVL to the mesh consisting of the
voltage source and the 5-kV and 20-kV resistors gives
v3 ¼ 3  5i2 ¼ 3  5 0:6
ð
Þ ¼ 6 V
Clearly, v3 cannot be both 12 and 6, so the values obtained for i2, i3, v4, i5, and v6 cannot all be correct. Checking the
simultaneous equations, we ﬁnd that a resistor value has been entered incorrectly. The KVL equation correspond-
ing to the mesh consisting of the voltage source and the 5-kV and 20-kV resistors should be
3 ¼ 5i2 þ 20i3
Note that 10i3 was incorrectly used in the fourth line of the Mathcad program of Figure 6.10-1. After making this
correction, i2, i3, v4, i5, and v6 are calculated to be
i2 ¼ 0:2 mA;
i3 ¼ 0:2 mA;
v4 ¼ 4 V;
i5 ¼ 0:4 mA;
and
v6 ¼ 4 V
Now
v3 ¼ 20i3 ¼ 20 0:2
ð
Þ ¼ 4
and
v3 ¼ 3  5i2 ¼ 3  5 0:2
ð
Þ ¼ 4
This agreement suggests that the new values of i2, i3, v4, i5, and v6 are correct. As an additional check, consider v5.
First, Ohm’s law gives
v5 ¼ 10i5 ¼ 10 0:4
ð
Þ ¼ 4
Next, applying KVL to the loop consisting of the two 10-kV resistors and the input of the operational ampliﬁer gives
v5 ¼ 0 þ v4 ¼ 0 þ 4
ð
Þ ¼ 4
This increases our conﬁdence that the new values of i2, i3, v4, i5, and v6 are correct.

Transducer Interface Circuit
A customer wants to automate a pressure measurement, which requires converting the output of the pressure
transducer to a computer input. This conversion can be done using a standard integrated circuit called an analog-to-
digital converter (ADC). The ADC requires an input voltage between 0 V and 10 V, whereas the pressure
transducer output varies between 250 mV and 250 mV. Design a circuit to interface the pressure transducer with
the ADC. That is, design a circuit that translates the range 250 mV to 250 mV to the range 0 V to 10 V.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
The situation is shown in Figure 6.11-1.

The speciﬁcations state that
250 mV  v1  250 mV

A simple relationship between v2 and v1 is needed so that information about the pressure is not obscured. Consider
v2 ¼ a  v1 þ b
The coefﬁcients, a and b, can be calculated by requiring that v2 ¼ 0 when v1 ¼ 250 mV and that v2 ¼ 10 V when
v1 ¼ 250 mV, that is,
0 V ¼ a 250 mV
ð

10 V ¼ a 250 mV

Solving these simultaneous equations gives a ¼ 20 V/V and b ¼ 5 V.
State the Goal
Design a circuit having input voltage v1 and output voltage v2. These voltages should be related by
v2 ¼ 20 v1 þ 5 V
ð6:11-1Þ
Generate a Plan
Figure 6.11-2 shows a plan (or a structure) for designing the interface circuit. The operational ampliﬁers are biased
using þ15-V and 15-V power supplies. The constant 5-V input is generated from the 15-V power supply by
multiplying by a gain of 1=3. The input voltage, v1, is multiplied by a gain of 20. The summer (adder) adds the
outputs of the two ampliﬁers to obtain v2.

Act on the Plan
Figure 6.11-3 shows one proposed interface circuit. Some adjustments have been made to the plan. The
summer is implemented using the inverting summing ampliﬁer from Figure 6.5-1d. The inputs to this
inverting summing ampliﬁer must be 20vi and 5 V instead of 20vi and 5 V. Consequently, an inverting
ampliﬁer is used to multiply v1 by 20. A voltage follower prevents the summing ampliﬁer from loading the
voltage divider. To make the signs work out correctly, the 15-V power supply provides the input to the
voltage divider.

The circuit shown in Figure 6.11-3 is not the only circuit that solves this design challenge. There are
several circuits that implement

We will be satisﬁed with having found one circuit that does the job.
Verify the Proposed Solution
The circuit shown in Figure 6.11-3 was simulated using PSpice. The result of this simulation is the plot of the v2
versus v1 shown in Figure 6.11-4. Because this plot shows a straight line, v2 is related to v1 by the equation of a
straight line
v2 ¼ mv1 þ b

Several models are available for operational ampliﬁers.
Simple models are easy to use. Accurate models are more
complicated. The simplest model of the operational ampliﬁer
is the ideal operational ampliﬁer.
The currents into the input terminals of an ideal operational
ampliﬁer are zero, and the voltages at the input nodes of an
ideal operational ampliﬁer are equal.
It is convenient to use node equations to analyze circuits that
contain ideal operational ampliﬁers.
Operational ampliﬁers are used to build circuits that perform
mathematical operations. Many of these circuits have been
used so often that they have been given names. The inverting
ampliﬁer gives a response of the form vo ¼ Kvi where K is a
positive constant. The noninverting ampliﬁer gives a re-
sponse of the form vo ¼ Kvi where K is a positive constant.
Another useful operational ampliﬁer circuit is the noninvert-
ing ampliﬁer with a gain of K ¼ 1, often called a voltage
follower or buffer. The output of the voltage follower
faithfully follows the input voltage. The voltage follower
reduces loading by isolating its output terminal from its input
terminal.
Figure 6.5-1 is a catalog of some frequently used operational
ampliﬁer circuits.
Practical operational ampliﬁers have properties that are not
included in the ideal operational ampliﬁer. These include the
input offset voltage, bias current, dc gain, input resistance,
and output resistance. More complicated models are needed
to account for these properties.
PSpice can be used to reduce the drudgery of analyzing
operational ampliﬁer circuits with complicated models.

been labeled to show that v2 ¼ 10.002 V when v1 ¼ 0.250 V and that v2 ¼ 0.0047506 V when v1 ¼ 0:250 V. The
slope m and intercept b can be calculated from these points. The slope is given by

This chapter introduces two more circuit elements, the capacitor and the inductor. The constitutive
equations for the devices involve either integration or differentiation. Consequently:
 Electric circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors are represented by differential equations.
Circuits that do not contain capacitors or inductors are represented by algebraic equations. We say
that circuits containing capacitors and/or inductors are dynamic circuits, whereas circuits that do not
contain capacitors or inductors are static circuits.
 Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors are able to store energy.
 Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors have memory. The voltages and currents at a
particular time depend not only on other voltages at currents at that same instant of time but also on
previous values of those currents and voltages.
In addition, we will see that:
 In the absence of unbounded currents or voltages, capacitor voltages and inductor currents are
continuous functions of time.
 In a dc circuit, capacitors act like open circuits, and inductors act like short circuits.
 Series or parallel capacitors can be reduced to an equivalent capacitor. Series or parallel inductors
can be reduced to an equivalent inductor. Doing so does not change the element current or voltage of
any other circuit element.
 An op amp and a capacitor can be used to make circuits that perform the mathematical operations of
integration or differentiation. Appropriately, these important circuits are called the integrator and the
differentiator.
 The element voltages and currents in a circuit containing capacitors and inductors can be
complicated functions of time. MATLAB is useful for plotting these functions.

7.2
C a p a c i t o r s
A capacitor is a circuit element that stores energy in an electric ﬁeld. A capacitor can
be constructed using two parallel conducting plates separated by distance d as shown
in Figure 7.2-1. Electric charge is stored on the plates, and a uniform electric ﬁeld
exists between the conducting plates whenever there is a voltage across the capacitor.
The space between the plates is ﬁlled with a dielectric material. Some capacitors use
impregnated paper for a dielectric, whereas others use mica sheets, ceramics, metal
ﬁlms, or just air. A property of the dielectric material, called the dielectric constant,
describes the relationship between the electric ﬁeld strength and the capacitor
voltage. Capacitors are represented by a parameter called the capacitance. The
capacitance of a capacitor is proportional to the dielectric constant and surface area of
the plates and is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates. In other
words, the capacitance C of a capacitor is given by
C ¼ 2 A
d
where 2 is the dielectric constant, A the area of the plates, and d the distance between
plates. The unit of capacitance is coulomb per volt and is called farad (F) in honor of
Michael Faraday.
A capacitor voltage v(t) deposits a charge þq(t) on one plate and a charge q(t) on the other plate.
We say that the charge q(t) is stored by the capacitor. The charge stored by a capacitor is proportional to
the capacitor voltage v(t). Thus, we write
q tð Þ ¼ Cv tð Þ
ð7:2-1Þ
where the constant of proportionality C is the capacitance of the capacitor.
Capacitance is a measure of the ability of a device to store energy in the form of a separated
charge or an electric ﬁeld.
In general, the capacitor voltage v(t) varies as a function of time. Consequently, q(t), the charge
stored by the capacitor, also varies as a function of time. The variation of the capacitor charge with
respect to time implies a capacitor current i(t), given by
i tð Þ ¼ d
dt q tð Þ
We differentiate Eq. 7.2-1 to obtain
i tð Þ ¼ C d
dt v tð Þ
ð7:2-2Þ
Equation 7.2-2 is the current–voltage relationship of a capacitor. The current and voltage in Eq. 7.7-2
adhere to the passive convention. Figure 7.2-2 shows two alternative symbols to represent capacitors in
circuit diagrams. In both Figure 7.2-2a and b, the capacitor current and voltage adhere to the passive
sign convention and are related by Eq. 7.2-2.
Now consider the waveform shown in Figure 7.2-3, in which the voltage changes from a constant
voltage of zero to another constant voltage of 1 over an increment of time, Dt. Using Eq. 7.2-2, we
obtain

Thus, we obtain a pulse of height equal to C=Dt. As Dt decreases, the current will increase.
Clearly, Dt cannot decline to zero or we would experience an inﬁnite current. An inﬁnite current is an
impossibility because it would require inﬁnite power. Thus, an instantaneous
Dt ¼ 0
ð
Þ change of
voltage across the capacitor is not possible. In other words, we cannot have a discontinuity in v(t).
The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously.
Now, let us ﬁnd the voltage v(t) in terms of the current i(t) by integrating both sides of Eq. 7.2-2.
We obtain
v tð Þ ¼ 1
C
Z t

ð7:2-3Þ
This equation says that the capacitor voltage v(t) can be found by integrating the capacitor current from
time 1 until time t. To do so requires that we know the value of the capacitor current from time
t ¼ 1 until time t ¼ t. Often, we don’t know the value of the current all the way back to t ¼ 1.
Instead, we break the integral up into two parts:
v tð Þ ¼ 1

This equation says that the capacitor voltage v(t) can be found by integrating the capacitor current
from some convenient time t ¼ t0 until time t ¼ t, provided that we also know the capacitor voltage
at time t0. Now we are required to know only the capacitor current from time t ¼ t0 until time t ¼ t.
The time t0 is called the initial time, and the capacitor voltage v(t0) is called the initial condition.
Frequently, it is convenient to select t0 ¼ 0 as the initial time.
Capacitors are commercially available in a variety of types and capacitance values. Capacitor
types are described in terms of the dielectric material and the construction technique. Miniature metal
ﬁlm capacitors are shown in Figure 7.2-4. Miniature hermetically sealed polycarbonate capacitors are
shown in Figure 7.2-5. Capacitance values typically range from picofarads (pF) to microfarads (mF).

7. Energy Storage Elements

Two pieces of insulated wire about an inch long when twisted together will have a capacitance of about
1 pF. On the other hand, a power supply capacitor about an inch in diameter and a few inches long may
have a capacitance of 0.01 F.
Actual capacitors have some resistance associated with them. Fortunately, it is easy to include
approximate resistive effects in the circuit models. In capacitors, the dielectric material between the
plates is not a perfect insulator and has some small conductivity. This can be represented by a very high
resistance in parallel with the capacitor. Ordinary capacitors can hold a charge for hours, and the parallel
resistance is then hundreds of megaohms. For this reason, the resistance associated with a capacitor is
usually ignored.

Consider a capacitor that has been connected to a battery of voltage v. A current ﬂows and a charge is
stored on the plates of the capacitor, as shown in Figure 7.3-1. Eventually, the voltage across the
capacitor is a constant, and the current through the capacitor is zero. The capacitor has stored energy by
virtue of the separation of charges between the capacitor plates. These charges have an electrical force
acting on them.
The forces acting on the charges stored in a capacitor are said to result from an electric ﬁeld. An
electric ﬁeld is deﬁned as the force acting on a unit positive charge in a speciﬁed region. Because the
charges have a force acting on them along a direction x, we recognize that the energy required originally
to separate the charges is now stored by the capacitor in the electric ﬁeld.

Because the capacitor was uncharged at t ¼ 1, set v 1
ð
Þ ¼ 0. Therefore,
wc tð Þ ¼ 1
2 Cv2 tð Þ J
ð7:3-1Þ
Therefore, as a capacitor is being charged and v(t) is changing, the energy stored, wc, is changing.
Note that wc tð Þ > 0 for all v(t), so the element is said to be passive.
Because q ¼ Cv, we may rewrite Eq. 7.3-1 as
wc ¼ 1
2C q2 tð Þ J
ð7:3-2Þ
The capacitor is a storage element that stores but does not dissipate energy. For example, consider a
100-mF capacitor that has a voltage of 100 V across it. The energy stored is
wc ¼ 1
2 Cv2 ¼ 1
2 0:1
ð
Þ 100
ð
Þ2 ¼ 500 J
As long as the capacitor is not connected to any other element, the energy of 500 J remains stored. Now
if we connect the capacitor to the terminals of a resistor, we expect a current to ﬂow until all the energy is
dissipated as heat by the resistor. After all the energy dissipates, the current is zero and the voltage
across the capacitor is zero.
As noted in the previous section, the requirement of conservation of charge implies that the
voltage on a capacitor is continuous. Thus, the voltage and charge on a capacitor cannot change
instantaneously. This statement is summarized by the equation
v 0þ
ð
Þ ¼ v 0
ð
Þ
where the time just prior to t ¼ 0 is called t ¼ 0 and the time immediately after t ¼ 0 is called t ¼ 0þ.
The time between t ¼ 0 and t ¼ 0þ is inﬁnitely small. Nevertheless, the voltage will not change
abruptly.
To illustrate the continuity of voltage for a capacitor, consider the circuit shown in Figure 7.3-1.
For the circuit shown in Figure 7.3-1a, the switch has been closed for a long time and the capacitor
voltage has become vc ¼ 10 V. At time t ¼ 0, we open the switch, as shown in Figure 7.3-1b. Because
the voltage on the capacitor is continuous,

A 10-mF capacitor is charged to 100 V, as shown in the circuit of Figure
7.3-2. Find the energy stored by the capacitor and the voltage of the
capacitor at t ¼ 0þ after the switch is opened.
Solution
The voltage of the capacitor is v ¼ 100 V at t ¼ 0. Because the voltage at
t ¼ 0þ cannot change from the voltage at t ¼ 0, we have

Power and Energy for a Capacitor
The voltage across a 5-mF capacitor varies as shown in
Figure 7.3-3. Determine and plot the capacitor current,
power, and energy.
Solution
The current is determined from ic ¼ C dv=dt and is shown
in Figure 7.3-4a. The power is v(t)i(t)—the product of the
current plot (Figure 7.3-4a) and the voltage plot (Figure
7.3-3)—and is shown in Figure 7.3-4b. The capacitor
receives energy during the ﬁrst two seconds and then
delivers energy for the period 2 < t < 3.
The energy is o ¼
R
p dt and can be found as the area under the p(t) plot. The plot for the energy is shown in
Figure 7.3-4c. Note that the capacitor increasingly stores energy from t ¼ 0 s to t ¼ 2 s, reaching a maximum
energy of 25 J. Then the capacitor delivers a total energy of 18.75 J to the external circuit from t ¼ 2 s to t ¼ 3 s.
Finally, the capacitor holds a constant energy of 6.25 J after t ¼ 3 s.

First, let us consider the parallel connection of N capacitors as shown in
Figure 7.4-1. We wish to determine the equivalent circuit for the N

An inductor is a circuit element that stores energy in a magnetic ﬁeld. An inductor can be constructed by
winding a coil of wire around a magnetic core as shown in Figure 7.5-1. Inductors are represented by a
parameter called the inductance. The inductance of an inductor depends on its size, materials, and
method of construction. For example, the inductance of the inductor shown in Figure 7.5-1 is given by
L ¼ mN2A
l
where N is the number of turns—that is, the number of times that the wire is wound around the
core—A is the cross-sectional area of the core in square meters; l the length of the winding in meters;
and m is a property of the magnetic core known as the permeability. The unit of inductance is called

henry (H) in honor of the American physicist Joseph Henry.
Practical inductors have inductances ranging from 1 mH to 10 H.
Inductors are wound in various forms, as shown in Figure 7.5-2.
Inductance is a measure of the ability of a device to
store energy in the form of a magnetic ﬁeld.
In Figure 7.5-1, a current source is used to cause a coil
current i(t). We ﬁnd that the voltage v(t) across the coil is
proportional to the rate of change of the coil current. That is,
v tð Þ ¼ L d
dt i tð Þ
ð7:5-1Þ
where the constant of proportionality is L, the inductance of the
inductor.
Integrating both sides of Eq. 7.5-1, we obtain
i tð Þ ¼ 1
L
Z t

v t
ð Þdt
ð7:5-2Þ
This equation says that the inductor current i(t) can be found by
integrating the inductor voltage from time 1 until time t. To do
so requires that we know the value of the inductor voltage from
time t ¼ 1 until time t ¼ t. Often, we don’t know the value of
the voltage all the way back to t ¼ 1. Instead, we break the
integral up into two parts:

ð7:5-3Þ
This equation says that the inductor current i(t) can be found by
integrating the inductor voltage from some convenient time t ¼ t0
until time t ¼ t, provided that we also know the inductor current at
timet0.Nowwearerequiredtoknowonlytheinductorvoltagefrom
timet ¼ t0 untiltimet ¼ t.Thetimet0iscalledtheinitialtime,and
the inductor current i(t0) is called the initial condition. Frequently,
it is convenient to select t0 ¼ 0 as the initial time.
Equations 7.5-1 and 7.5-3 describe the current–voltage
relationship of an inductor. The current and voltage in these
equations adhere to the passive convention. The circuit symbol for an inductor is shown in Figure 7.5-3.
The inductor current and voltage in Figure 7.5-3 adhere to the passive sign convention and are related
by Eqs. 7.5-1 and 7.5-3.
Consider the voltage of an inductor when the current changes at t ¼ 0 from zero to a constantly
increasing current and eventually levels off as shown in Figure 7.5-4. Let us determine the voltage of the
inductor. We may describe the current (in amperes) by

The resulting voltage pulse waveform is shown in Figure 7.5-5. Note that as t1 decreases, the
magnitude of the voltage increases. Clearly, we cannot let t1 ¼ 0 because the voltage required would
then become inﬁnite, and we would require inﬁnite power at the terminals of the inductor. Thus,
instantaneous changes in the current through an inductor are not possible.
The current in an inductance cannot change instantaneously.
An ideal inductor is a coil wound with resistanceless wire. Practical inductors include the actual
resistance of the copper wire used in the coil. For this reason, practical inductors are far from ideal
elements and are typically modeled by an ideal inductance in series with a small resistance.

A series and parallel connection of inductors can be reduced to an equivalent simple inductor. Consider

The circuit includes one or more switches that open or close at time t0. We denote the time
immediately before the switch opens or closes as t
0 and the time immediately after the switch opens
or closes as tþ
0 . Often, we will assume that t0 ¼ 0.
3.
The circuit includes at least one capacitor or inductor.
4.
We will assume that the switches in a circuit have been in position for a long time at t ¼ t0, the
switching time. We will say that such a circuit is at steady state immediately before the time of
switching. A circuit that contains only constant sources and is at steady state is called a dc circuit.
All the element currents and voltages in a dc circuit are constant functions of time.
We are particularly interested in the current and voltage of energy storage elements after the switch
opens or closes. (Recall from Section 2.9 that open switches act like open circuits and closed switches act
like short circuits.) In Table 7.8-1, we summarize the important characteristics of the behavior of an
inductor and a capacitor. In particular, notice that neither a capacitor voltage nor an inductor current can
change instantaneously. (Recall from Sections 7.2 and 7.5 that such changes would require inﬁnite power,
something that is not physically possible.) However, instantaneous changes to an inductor voltage or a
capacitor current are quite possible.
Suppose that a dc circuit contains an inductor. The inductor current, like every other voltage and
current in the dc circuit, will be a constant function of time. The inductor voltage is proportional to the
derivative of the inductor current, v ¼ L di=dt
ð
Þ, so the inductor voltage is zero. Consequently, the
inductor acts like a short circuit.
An inductor in a dc circuit behaves as a short circuit.
Similarly, the voltage of a capacitor in a dc circuit will be a constant function of time. The capacitor
current is proportional to the derivative of the capacitor voltage i ¼ C (dv=dt), so the capacitor current is
zero. Consequently, the capacitor acts like a open circuit.

Initial Conditions of Switched Circuits

A capacitor in a dc circuit behaves as an open circuit.
Our plan to analyze switched circuits has two steps:
1.
Analyze the dc circuit that exists before time t0 to determine the capacitor voltages and inductor
currents.Indoingthisanalysis,wewilltakeadvantageofthefactthatcapacitorsbehaveasopencircuits
and inductors behave as short circuits when they are in dc circuits.
2.
Recognize that capacitor voltages and inductor currents cannot change instantaneously, so
the capacitor voltages and inductor currents at time tþ
0 have the same values that they had at
time t
0 .
The following examples illustrate this plan.

Consider the circuit Figure 7.8-1. Prior to t ¼ 0, the switch has been closed for a long time. Determine the values of

the voltage source voltage, is constant. Also, before the switch opens, the circuit is at steady state. Because the
circuit is a dc circuit, the capacitor will act like an open circuit, and the inductor will act like a short circuit. In
Figure 7.8-2, we replace the capacitor by an open circuit having voltage vc 0

prevail at t ¼ 0.
Solution
First, we redraw the circuit for t ¼ 0 by replacing the inductor with a short
circuit and the capacitor with an open circuit, as shown in Figure
7.8-4. Then we note that
iL 0

This section describes a procedure for designing operational ampliﬁer circuits that implement linear
differential equations such as
2 d3
dt3 y tð Þ þ 5 d2
dt2 y tð Þ þ 4 d
dt y tð Þ þ 3y tð Þ ¼ 6x tð Þ
ð7:9-1Þ
The solution of this equation is a function y(t) that depends both on the function x(t) and on a set of
initial conditions. It is convenient to use the initial conditions:
d2
dt2 y tð Þ ¼ 0;
d
dt y tð Þ ¼ 0;
and
y tð Þ ¼ 0
ð7:9-2Þ
Having speciﬁed these initial conditions, we expect a unique function y(t) to correspond to any given
function x(t). Consequently, we will treat x(t) as the input to the differential equation and y(t) as the
output.
Section 6.6 introduced the notion of diagramming operations as blocks and equations as block
diagrams. Section 6.6 also introduced blocks to represent addition and multiplication by a constant.
Figure 7.9-1 illustrates two additional blocks, representing integration and differentiation.
Suppose that we were somehow to obtain d3
dt3 y tð Þ. We could then integrate three times to obtain
d2
dt2 y tð Þ, d
dt y tð Þ, and y(t), as illustrated in Figure 7.9-2.
Hence, we obtain

Similarly, to ﬁnd ic, we write KCL at node a to obtain

Thus, we found that at the switching time t ¼ 0, the current in the inductor and the voltage of the capacitor
remained constant. However, the inductor voltage did change instantaneously from vL 0
ð
Þ ¼ 0 to vL 0þ
ð

and we determined that diL 0þ

diagram of Eq. 7.9-1.
Our next task is to implement the block diagram as an operational ampliﬁer circuit. Figure 7.9-5
provides operational ampliﬁer circuits to implement both differentiation and integration. To see how the
integrator works, consider Figure 7.9-6. The nodes of the integrator in Figure 7.9-6 have been labeled in
anticipation of writing node equations. Let v1, v2, and v3 denote the node voltages at nodes 1, 2, and 3,

The input to the integrator is x(t), the node voltage at node 1. Thus, v1 ¼ x tð Þ. The output of the
integrator is y(t), the node voltage at node 3. Thus, v3 ¼ y tð Þ. The noninverting input of the ideal
operational ampliﬁer is attached to the reference node, and the inverting input is connected to node 2.
The node voltages at these two nodes must be equal, so v2 ¼ 0.
The voltage across the resistor is related to the node voltages at the resistor nodes by
vR tð Þ ¼ v1 tð Þ  v2 tð Þ ¼ x tð Þ  0 ¼ x tð Þ
The resistor current is calculated, using Ohm’s law, to be
iR tð Þ ¼ vR tð Þ
R

The value of the current ﬂowing into an input of an ideal operational ampliﬁer is zero, so applying KCL

Equation 7.9-5 indicates that the integrator does two things. First, the input is integrated. Second,
the integral is multiplied by a negative constant k. In Figure 7.9-5d, values of R and C have been selected
to make k ¼ 1. Multiplying a function by 1 reﬂects the graph of the function across the time axis.
This reﬂection is called an inversion, and the circuit is said to be an inverting circuit. Consequently, the
integrator shown in Figure 7.9-5d is sometimes called an inverting integrator. We will call this circuit an
integrator unless we want to call attention to the inversion, in which case, we will call the circuit an
inverting integrator.
Analysis of the summing integrator shown in Figure 7.9-7 is similar to the analysis of the
integrator. The inputs to the summing integrator are x1(t), the node voltage at node 1, and x2(t), the node

voltage at node 2. The output of the integrator is y(t), the node voltage at node 4. The ideal operational
ampliﬁer causes the voltage at node 3 to be zero. Hence,
v1 tð Þ ¼ x1 tð Þ;
v2 tð Þ ¼ x2 tð Þ;

Equation 7.9-7 indicates that the summing integrator does four things. First, each input is
multiplied by a separate constant: x1 is multiplied by k1, and x2 is multiplied by k2. Second, the products
are summed. Third, the sum is integrated. Fourth, the integral is multiplied by 1. (Like the inverting
integrator, this circuit inverts its output. It is sometimes called an inverting summing integrator.
Fortunately, we don’t need to use that long name very often.)
The summing ampliﬁer in Figure 7.9-7 accommodates two inputs. To accommodate additional
inputs, we add more input resistors, each connected between an input node and the inverting input node
of the operational ampliﬁer. (The operational ampliﬁer circuit that implements Eq. 7.9-1 will require a
four-input summing integrator.)
We will design an operational ampliﬁer circuit to implement Eq. 7.9-1 by replacing the blocks
in the block diagram of Eq. 7.9-1 by operational ampliﬁer circuits. This process will be easier if we
ﬁrst modify the block diagram to accommodate inverting integrators. Figures 7.9-8 and 7.9-9 show

modiﬁed versions of the block diagrams from Figures 7.9-2 and 7.9-3. Replace all the integrators in
Figure 7.9-2 by inverting integrators to get Figure 7.9-8. It’s necessary to set the input equal to
 d3
dt3 y tð Þ instead of d3
dt3 y tð Þ to cause the output to be equal to y(t) instead of y(t).
The block diagram in Figure 7.9-9 produces  d3
dt3 y tð Þ from d2
dt2 y tð Þ,  d
dt y tð Þ, and y(t). The block
diagrams in Figures 7.9-8 and 7.9-9 can be combined as shown in Figure 7.9-10 to obtain the block
diagram of Eq. 7.9-1.
A summing integrator can multiply each of its inputs by a separate constant, add the products, and
integrate the sum. The block diagram shown in Figure 7.9-11 emphasizes the blocks that can be
implemented by a single four-input summing integrator.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problems discussed in this chapter.

where the units of current are A, the units of voltage are V, and the units of time are s. How can we check this
homework solution to see whether it is correct?
Solution
The capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously. The capacitor voltage is given by
v tð Þ ¼ 2t  5
ð7:11-3Þ
when t < 2 s and by
v tð Þ ¼ t2
4 þ t  4
ð7:11-4Þ
when 2 < t < 6 s. Because the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, Eqs. 7.11-3 and 7.11-4 must both
give the same value for v(2), the capacitor voltage at time t ¼ 2 s. Solving Eq. 7.11-3 gives
v 2
ð Þ ¼ 2 2
ð Þ  5 ¼ 1 V
Also, solving Eq. 7.11-4 gives
v 2
ð Þ ¼ 22
4 þ 2  4 ¼ 1 V
300
7. Energy Storage Elements

These values agree, so we haven’t found an error. Next, let’s check v(6), the capacitor voltage at time t ¼ 6 s. The
capacitor voltage is given by
v tð Þ ¼  t2
2 þ 10t  21
ð7:11-5Þ
when 6 < t < 14 s. Equations 7.11-4 and 7.11-5 must both give the same value for v(6). Solving Eq. 7.11-4 gives
v 6
ð Þ ¼ 62
4 þ 6  4 ¼ 11 V
whereas solving Eq. 7.11-5 gives
v 6
ð Þ ¼  62
2 þ 10 6
ð Þ  21 ¼ 21 V
These values don’t agree. That means that v(t) changes instantaneously at t ¼ 6 s, so v(t) cannot be the voltage
across the capacitor. The homework solution is not correct.

Integrator and Switch
This design challenge involves an integrator and a voltage-controlled switch.
An integrator is a circuit that performs the mathematical operation of integration. The output of an integrator,
say, vo(t), is related to the input of the integrator, say, vs(t), by the equation
vo t2
ð Þ ¼ K 
Z t2
t1
vs tð Þdt þ vo t1
ð Þ
ð7:12-1Þ
The constant K is called the gain of the integrator.
Integrators have many applications. One application of an integrator is to measure an interval of time.
Suppose vs(t) is a constant voltage Vs. Then,
vo t2
ð Þ ¼ K  t2  t1
ð
Þ  Vs þ vo t1
ð Þ
ð7:12-2Þ
This equation indicates that the output of the integrator at time t2 is a measure of the time interval t2  t1.
Switches can be controlled electronically. Figure 7.12-1 illustrates an electronically controlled SPST
switch. The symbol shown in Figure 7.12-1a is sometimes used to emphasize that a switch is controlled
electronically. The node voltage vc(t) is called the control voltage. Figure 7.12-1b shows a typical control
voltage. This voltage-controlled switch is closed when vc tð Þ ¼ vH and open when vc tð Þ ¼ vL. The switch shown
in Figure 7.12-1 is open before time t1. It closes at time t1 and stays closed until time t2. The switch opens at time
t2 and remains open.
Consider Figure 7.12-2. The voltage vc(t) controls the switch. The integrator converts the time interval
t2  t1 to a voltage that is displayed using the voltmeter. The time interval to be measured could be as small as
5 ms or as large as 200 ms. The challenge is to design the integrator. The available components include:

 1-mF, 0.2-mF, and 0.1-mF capacitors.

It is convenient to set the integrator output to zero at time t1. The relationship between the integrator output voltage
and the time interval should be simple. Accordingly, let

Table 7.13-1 summarizes the element equations for capaci-
tors and inductors. (Notice that the voltage and current
referred to in these equations adhere to the passive conven-
tion.) Unlike the circuit elements we encountered in previous
chapters, the element equations for capacitors and inductors
involve derivatives and integrals.
Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors are able to
store energy. The energy stored in the electric ﬁeld of a
capacitor is equal to 1
2 Cv2 tð Þ, where v(t) is the voltage across
the capacitor. The energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld of a
inductor is equal to 1
2 Li2 tð Þ, where i(t) is the current in the
inductor.
Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors have mem-
ory. The voltages and currents in that circuit at a particular
time depend not only on other voltages and currents at that
same instant of time but also on previous values of
those currents and voltages. For example, the voltage across
a capacitor at time t1 depends on the voltage across that
capacitor at an earlier time t0 and on the value of the capacitor
current between t0 and t1.
A set of series or parallel capacitors can be reduced to an
equivalent capacitor. A set of series or parallel inductors can
readily be reduced to an equivalent inductor. Table 7.13-2
summarizes the equations required to do so.

In the absence of unbounded currents, the voltage across a
capacitor cannot change instantaneously. Similarly, in the
absence of unbounded voltages, the current in an inductor
cannot change instantaneously. In contrast, the current in a
capacitor and voltage across an inductor are both able to
change instantaneously.
We sometimes consider circuits that contain capacitors and
inductors and have only constant inputs. (The voltages of the
independent voltage sources and currents of the independent
current sources are all constant.) When such a circuit is at
steady state, all the currents and voltages in that circuit will
be constant. In particular, the voltage across any capacitor
will be constant. The current in that capacitor will be zero due
to the derivative in the equation for the capacitor current.
Similarly, the current through any inductor will be constant
and the voltage across any inductor will be zero. Conse-
quently, the capacitors will act like open circuits and the
inductors will act like short circuits. Notice that this situation
occurs only when all of the inputs to the circuit are constant.
An op amp and a capacitor can be used to make circuits that
perform the mathematical operations of integration and
differentiation. Appropriately, these important circuits are
called the integrator and the differentiator.
The element voltages and currents in a circuit containing
capacitors and inductors can be complicated functions of
time. MATLAB is useful for plotting these functions.

Section 7.5 Inductors
P 7.5-1 Nikola Tesla (1857–1943) was an American electrical
engineer who experimented with electric induction. Tesla
built a large coil with a very large inductance, shown in Figure
P 7.5-1. The coil was connected to a source current
is ¼ 100 sin 400t A
so that the inductor current iL ¼ is. Find the voltage across the
inductor and explain the discharge in the air shown in the
ﬁgure. Assume that L ¼ 200H and the average discharge
distance is 2 m. Note that the dielectric strength of air is
3  106 V/m.

induction coils discharge millions of volts with a roar audible 10
miles away (about 1910).

In this chapter, we consider the response of RL and RC circuits to abrupt changes. The abrupt change
might be a change to the circuit, as when a switch opens or closes. Alternately, the abrupt change might
be a change to the input to the circuit, as when the voltage of a voltage source is a discontinuous function
of time.
RL and RC circuits are called ﬁrst-order circuits. In this chapter, we will do the following:
 Develop vocabulary that will help us talk about the response of a ﬁrst-order circuit.
 Analyze ﬁrst-order circuits with inputs that are constant after some particular time, t0.
 Introduce the notion of a stable circuit and use it to identify stable ﬁrst-order circuits.
 Analyze ﬁrst-order circuits that experience more than one abrupt change.
 Introduce the step function and use it to determine the step response of a ﬁrst-order circuit.
 Analyze ﬁrst-order circuits with inputs that are not constant.
8.2
F i r s t - O r d e r C i r c u i t s
Circuits that contain capacitors and inductors can be represented by differential equations. The order
of the differential equation is usually equal to the number of capacitors plus the number of inductors in
the circuit.
Circuits that contain only one inductor and no capacitors or only one capacitor and no
inductors can be represented by a ﬁrst-order differential equation. These circuits are called
ﬁrst-order circuits.
322

Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits simplify the analysis of ﬁrst-order circuits by showing
that all ﬁrst-order circuits are equivalent to one of two simple ﬁrst-order circuits. Figure 8.2-1 shows
how this is accomplished. In Figure 8.2-1a, a ﬁrst-order circuit is partitioned into two parts. One part is
the single capacitor or inductor that we expect to ﬁnd in a ﬁrst-order circuit. The other part is the rest of
the circuit—everything except that capacitor or inductor. The next step, shown in Figure 8.2-1b,
depends on whether the energy storage element is a capacitor or an inductor. If it is a capacitor, then the
rest of the circuit is replaced by its Thevenin equivalent circuit. The result is a simple ﬁrst-order
circuit—a series circuit consisting of a voltage source, a resistor, and a capacitor. On the other hand, if
the energy storage element is an inductor, then the rest of the circuit is replaced by its Norton equivalent
circuit. The result is another simple ﬁrst-order circuit—a parallel circuit consisting of a current source, a
resistor, and an inductor. Indeed, all ﬁrst-order circuits are equivalent to one of these two simple ﬁrst-
order circuits.
Consider the ﬁrst-order circuit shown in Figure 8.2-2a. The input to this circuit is the voltage vs(t).
The output, or response, of this circuit is the voltage across the capacitor. This circuit is at steady state
before the switch is closed at time t ¼ 0. Closing the switch disturbs this circuit. Eventually, the
disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. The steady-state condition with the switch
closed will probably be different from the steady-state condition with the switch open. Figure 8.2-2b
shows a plot of the capacitor voltage versus time.

First-Order Circuits

When the input to a circuit is sinusoidal, the steady-state response is also sinusoidal. Furthermore,
the frequency of the response sinusoid must be the same as the frequency of the input sinusoid. The
circuit shown in Figure 8.2-2a is at steady state before the switch is closed. The steady-state capacitor
voltage will be
v tð Þ ¼ B cos 1000t þ f
ð
Þ; t < 0
ð8:2-1Þ
The switch closes at time t ¼ 0. The value of the capacitor voltage at the time the switch closes is
v 0
ð Þ ¼ B cos f
ð Þ; t ¼ 0
ð8:2-2Þ
After the switch closes, the response will consist of two parts: a transient part that eventually dies out
and a steady-state part. The steady-state part of the response will be sinusoidal and will have the
frequency of the input. For a ﬁrst-order circuit, the transient part of the response is exponential. Indeed,
we consider ﬁrst-order circuits separately to take advantage of the simple form of the transient response
of these circuits. After the switch is closed, the capacitor voltage is
v tð Þ ¼ Ket=t þ M cos 1000t þ d
ð
Þ
ð8:2-3Þ
Notice that Ket/t goes to zero as t becomes large. This is the transient part of the response, which dies
out, leaving the steady-state response, M cos(1000t þ d).
As a matter of vocabulary, the “transient part of the response” is frequently shortened to the
transient response, and the “steady-state part of the response” is shortened to the “steady-state
response.” The response, v(t), given by Eq. 8.2-3, is called the complete response to contrast it with the
transient and steady-state responses.
complete response ¼ transient response þ steady-state response
(The term transient response is used in two different ways by electrical engineers. Sometimes it
refers to the “transient part of the complete response,” and at other times, it refers to a complete
response, which includes a transient part. In particular, PSpice uses the term transient response to
refer to the complete response. This can be confusing, so the term transient response must be used
carefully.)
In general, the complete response of a ﬁrst-order circuit can be represented as the sum of two
parts, the natural response and the forced response:
complete response ¼ natural response þ forced response
The natural response is the general solution of the differential equation representing the ﬁrst-order
circuit, when the input is set to zero. The forced response is a particular solution of the differential
equation representing the circuit.
The complete response of a ﬁrst-order circuit will depend on an initial condition, usually a
capacitor voltage or an inductor current at a particular time. Let t0 denote the time at which the initial
condition is given. The natural response of a ﬁrst-order circuit will be of the form
natural response ¼ Ke tt0
ð
Þ=t
When t0 ¼ 0, then
natural response ¼ Ket=t
The constant K in the natural response depends on the initial condition, for example, the capacitor
voltage at time t0.
In this chapter, we will consider three cases. In these cases, the input to the circuit after the
disturbance will be (1) a constant, for example,
vs tð Þ ¼ V0
324
8. The Complete Response of RL and RC Circuits

or (2) an exponential, for example,
vs tð Þ ¼ V0et=t
or (3) a sinusoid, for example,
vs tð Þ ¼ V0 cos ot þ y
ð
Þ
These three cases are special because the forced response will have the same form as the input. For
example, in Figure 8.2-2, both the forced response and the input are sinusoidal, and the frequency of the
forced response is the same as the frequency of the input. For other inputs, the forced response may not
have the same form as the input. For example, when the input is a square wave, the forced response is
not a square wave.
When the input is a constant or a sinusoid, the forced response is also called the steady-state
response, and the natural response is called the transient response.
Here is our plan for ﬁnding the complete response of ﬁrst-order circuits:
Step 1: Find the forced response before the disturbance. Evaluate this response at time t ¼ t0 to obtain
the initial condition of the energy storage element.
Step 2: Find the forced response after the disturbance.
Step 3: Add the natural response ¼ Ket/t to the forced response to get the complete response. Use the
initial condition to evaluate the constant K.

In this section, we ﬁnd the complete response of a ﬁrst-order circuit when the input to the circuit is
constant after time t0. Figure 8.3-1 illustrates this situation. In Figure 8.3-1a, we ﬁnd a ﬁrst-order circuit
that contains a single capacitor and no inductors. This circuit is at steady state before the switch closes,
disturbing the steady state. The time at which steady state is disturbed is denoted as t0. In Figure 8.3-1a,
t0 ¼ 0. Closing the switch removes the resistor R1 from the circuit. (A closed switch is modeled by a
short circuit. A short circuit in parallel with a resistor is equivalent to a short circuit.) After the switch
closes, the circuit can be represented as shown in Figure 8.3-1b. In Figure 8.3-1b, the part of the circuit
that is connected to the capacitor has been replaced by its Thevenin equivalent circuit. Therefore,

The highest-order derivative in this equation is ﬁrst order, so this is a ﬁrst-order differential equation.
Next, let’s turn our attention to the circuit shown in Figure 8.3-2a. This circuit contains a single
inductor and no capacitors. This circuit is at steady state before the switch closes at time t0 ¼ 0,
disturbing the steady state. After the switch closes, the circuit can be represented as shown in Figure
8.3-2b. In Figure 8.3-2b, the part of the circuit that is connected to the inductor has been replaced by its

used to calculate the time constant from these values. Equivalently,
Figure 8.3-3 shows how to measure the time constant from a plot of x

First-Order Circuit with a Capacitor
Find the capacitor voltage after the switch opens in the circuit shown in Figure 8.3-4a. What is the value of the
capacitor voltage 50 ms after the switch opens?

The 2-volt voltage source forces the capacitor voltage to be 2 volts until the switch opens. Because the capacitor
voltage cannot change instantaneously, the capacitor voltage will be 2 volts immediately after the switch opens.
Therefore, the initial condition is

8. The Complete Response of RL and RC Circuits

The capacitor voltage is unknown, but the capacitor current is zero. In other words, the capacitor acts like an open
circuit when the input is constant and the circuit is at steady state. (By a similar argument, inductors act like short
circuits when the input is constant and the circuit is at steady state.)
Figure 8.3-6b shows the appropriate equivalent circuit while the switch is open. An open switch acts like an
open circuit; thus, the 10-kV and 30-kV resistors are in series. They have been replaced by an equivalent
40-kV resistor. The input to the circuit is a constant (12 volts), and the circuit is at steady state; therefore, the
capacitor acts like an open circuit. The voltage across this open circuit is the capacitor voltage. Because we
are interested in the initial condition, the capacitor voltage has been labeled as v(0). Analyzing the circuit in Figure
8.3-6b using voltage division gives

Solution
Figure 8.3-7b shows the appropriate equivalent circuit while the switch is open. The 100-V and 200-V resistors are
in series and have been replaced by an equivalent 300-V resistor. The input to the circuit is a constant (12 volts),
and the circuit is at steady state; therefore, the inductor acts like a short circuit. The current in this short circuit is the
inductor current. Because we are interested in the initial condition, the initial inductor current has been labeled as
i(0). This current can be calculated using Ohm’s law:
i 0
ð Þ ¼ 12
300 ¼ 40 mA
Figure 8.3-7c shows the appropriate equivalent circuit after the switch closes. Closing the switch shorts out the
100-V resistor, removing it from the circuit. The part of the circuit that is connected to the inductor has been
replaced by its Norton equivalent circuit. After the switch is closed,

Solution
The response or output of a circuit can be any element current or voltage. Frequently, the response is not the
capacitor voltage or inductor current. In Figure 8.3-8a, the response is the current i(t) in a resistor rather than
the capacitor voltage. In this case, two steps are required to solve the problem. First, ﬁnd the capacitor voltage using
the methods already described in this chapter. Once the capacitor voltage is known, write node or mesh equations to
express the response in terms of the input and the capacitor voltage.
First we ﬁnd the capacitor voltage. Before the switch opens, the capacitor voltage is equal to the voltage of the
2-volt source. The initial condition is
v 0
ð Þ ¼ 2 V
Figure 8.3-8b shows the circuit as it will be after the switch is opened. The part of the circuit connected to the

Now that the capacitor voltage is known, we return to the circuit in Figure 8.3-8b. Notice that the node

Find the capacitor voltage after the switch opens in the circuit shown in Figure 8.3-9a. What is the value of the
capacitor voltage 50 ms after the switch opens?
Solution
This example is similar to Example 8.3-1. The difference between the two examples is the time at which the switch
opens. The switch opens at time t ¼ 0 in Example 8.3-1 and at time t ¼ 50 ms ¼ 0.05 s in this example.
The 2-volt voltage source forces the capacitor voltage to be 2 volts until the switch opens. Consequently,

we see that

The time constant for this ﬁrst-order circuit containing a capacitor is

A plot of the capacitor voltage in this example will have the same shape as did the plot of the capacitor voltage in
Example 8.3-1, but the capacitor voltage in this example will be delayed by 50 ms because the switch opened 50 ms
later. To account for this delay, we replace t by t  50 ms in the equation that represents the capacitor voltage.
Consequently, the voltage of the capacitor in this example is given by

Solution

Often, circuits contain several switches that are not switched at the same time. For example, a circuit
may have two switches where the ﬁrst switch changes state at time t ¼ 0 and the second switch closes at
t ¼ 1 ms.
Sequential switching occurs when a circuit contains two or more switches that change state at
different instants.
Circuits with sequential switching can be solved using the methods described in the previous sections,
based on the fact that inductor currents and capacitor voltages do not change instantaneously.
As an example of sequential switching, consider the circuit shown in Figure 8.4-1a. This circuit
contains two switches—one that changes state at time t ¼ 0 and a second that closes at t ¼ 1 ms.
Suppose this circuit has reached steady state before the switch changes state at time t ¼ 0. Figure
8.4-1b shows the equivalent circuit that is appropriate for t < 0. Because the circuit is at steady state and
the input is constant, the inductor acts like a short circuit and the current in this short circuit is the

resistor is also zero. As a result, all of the source current ﬂows in the short circuit and

The inductor current will be 10 A immediately before the switch changes state at time t ¼ 0. We express

We have shown that the natural response of a ﬁrst-order circuit is
xn tð Þ ¼ Ket=t
and that the complete response is the sum of the natural and forced responses:
x tð Þ ¼ xn tð Þ þ xf tð Þ
When t > 0, the natural response vanishes as t ! 0, leaving the forced response. In this case, the circuit is
said to be stable. When t < 0, the natural response grows without bound as t ! 0. The forced response
becomes negligible, compared to the natural response. The circuit is said to be unstable. When a circuit is
stable, the forced response depends on the input to the circuit. That means that the forced response contains
information about the input. When the circuit is unstable, the forced response is negligible, and this
information is lost. In practice, the natural response of an unstable circuit is not unbounded. This response
will grow until something happens to change the circuit. Perhaps that change will be saturation of an
op amp or of a dependent source. Perhaps that change will be the destruction of a circuit element. In most
applications, the behavior of unstable circuits is undesirable and is to be avoided.
How can we design ﬁrst-order circuits to be stable? Recalling that t ¼ RtC or t ¼ L=Rt, we see that
Rt > 0 is required to make a ﬁrst-order circuit stable.
This condition will always be satisﬁed whenever the part of the circuit connected to the capacitor or
inductor consists of only resistors and independent sources. Such circuits are guaranteed to be stable. In
contrast, a ﬁrst-order circuit that contains op amps or dependent sources may be unstable.

The input to the circuit is a constant, so the capacitor acts like an open circuit at steady state. We calculate the initial

Therefore, i ¼ 0. Consequently, there is no voltage drop across the resistor, and

Next, we determine the Thevenin equivalent circuit for the part of the circuit connected to the capacitor. This
requires two calculations. First, calculate the open-circuit voltage, using the circuit in Figure 8.5-1c. Writing a KVL

The unit step function provides a convenient way to represent an
abrupt change in a voltage or current.
We deﬁne the unit step function as a function of time that is zero
for t < t0 and unity for t > t0. At t ¼ t0, the value changes from zero to
one. We represent the unit step function by u t  t0
ð
Þ, where
u t  t0

The value of u(t  t0) is not deﬁned at t ¼ t0, where it switches instantaneously from a value of zero to
one. The unit step function is shown in Figure 8.6-1. We will often consider t0 ¼ 0.
The unit step function is dimensionless. To represent a voltage that changes abruptly from one
constant value to another constant value at time t ¼ t0, we can write
v tð Þ ¼ A þ B u t  t0

The condition B < 3=2 is required to ensure that Rt is positive and
the circuit is stable.
To obtain a time constant of þ20 ms requires
Rt ¼ t

which in turn requires

Therefore B ¼ 1. This suggests that we can ﬁx the unstable circuit by decreasing the gain of the dependent source

occurring at t ¼ t1. Thus, the two-step sources of magnitude V0 shown in Figure 8.6-4 will
yield the desired pulse. We have v(t) ¼ V0u(t  t0)V0u(t  t1) to provide the pulse. Notice
how easy it is to use two-step function symbols to represent this pulse source. The pulse is said
to have a duration of (t1t0) s.
A pulse signal has a constant nonzero value for a time duration of Dt ¼ t1t0.
We recognize that the unit step function is an ideal model. No real element can switch
instantaneously. However, if the switching time is very short compared to the time constant of the
circuit, we can approximate the switching as instantaneous.

Solution
The value of the input is one constant, 4 V, before time t ¼ 0 and a different constant, 4 V, after time t ¼ 0. The

ð8:6-2Þ
where the values of the three constants A, B, and a are to be determined.
The values of A and B are determined from the steady-state responses of this circuit before and after the input
changes value. Figures 8.6-6a,b show the circuits used to calculate those steady-state responses. Figures
8.6-6a,b require some explanation.
Inductors act like short circuits when the input is constant and the circuit is at steady state. Consequently, the
inductor is replaced by a short circuit in Figure 8.6-6a and in Figure 8.6-6b.
The value of the inductor current at time t ¼ 0 will be equal to the steady-state inductor current before the
input changes. At time t ¼ 0, the output current is
io 0
ð Þ ¼ A þ Bea 0
ð Þ ¼ A þ B
Consequently, the inductor current is labeled as A þ B in Figure 8.6-6a.
The value of the inductor current at time t ¼ 1 will be equal to the steady-state inductor current after the
input changes. At time t ¼ 1, the output current is
io 1
ð

Consequently, the inductor current is labeled as A in Figure 8.6-6b.

Analysis of the circuit in Figure 8.6-6b gives

Therefore,

The value of the constant a in Eq. 8.6-2 is determined from the time constant, t, which in turn is calculated from the

Figure 8.6-8 shows a ﬁrst-order circuit. The input to the circuit is the
voltage of the voltage source, vs(t). The output is the voltage across
the capacitor, vo(t). Determine the output of this circuit when the input is
vs(t) ¼ 714u(t) V.
Solution
The value of the input is one constant, 7 V, before time t ¼ 0 and a

where the values of the three constants A, B, and a are to be determined.
The values of A and B are determined from the steady-state responses of this circuit before and after the input

require some explanation.
Capacitors act like open circuits when the input is constant and the circuit is at steady state. Consequently, the
capacitor is replaced by an open circuit in Figure 8.6-9a and in Figure 8.6-9b.
The value of the capacitor voltage at time t ¼ 0 will be equal to the steady-state capacitor voltage before the
input changes. At time t ¼ 0, the output voltage is
vo 0
ð Þ ¼ A þ Bea 0

Consequently, the capacitor voltage is labeled as A þ B in Figure 8.6-9a.

vo 1
ð

In the previous sections, we wisely used the fact that the forced response to a constant source will be a
constant itself. It now remains to determine what the response will be when the forcing function is not
a constant.
The differential equation described by an RL or RC circuit is represented by the general form
dx tð Þ

þ ax tð Þ ¼ y tð Þ
ð8:7-1Þ
where y(t) is a constant only when we have a constant-current or constant-voltage source and where
a ¼ 1=t is the reciprocal of the time constant.
In this section, we introduce the integrating factor method, which consists of multiplying Eq. 8.7-1
by a factor that makes the left-hand side a perfect derivative, and then integrating both sides.
Consider the derivative of a product of two terms such that
d

ð8:7-2Þ
The term within the parentheses on the right-hand side of Eq. 8.7-2 is exactly the form on the left-
hand side of Eq. 8.7-1.
Therefore, if we multiply both sides of Eq. 8.7-1 by eat, the left-hand side of the equation can be
represented by the perfect derivative, d(xeat)=dt. Carrying out these steps, we show that

When the source is a constant so that y(t) ¼ M, we have
x ¼ eatM
Z
eatdt þ Keat ¼ M
a þ Keat ¼ xf þ xn
where the natural response is xn ¼ Keat and the forced response is xf ¼ M=a, a constant.
Now consider the case in which y(t), the forcing function, is not a constant. Considering Eq. 8.7-3,
we see that the natural response remains xn ¼ Keat. However, the forced response is
xf ¼ eat
Z
y tð Þeat dt
Thus, the forced response will be dictated by the form of y(t). Let us consider the case in which y(t) is
an exponential function so that y(t) ¼ ebt. We assume that (a þ b) is not equal to zero. Then we have

Therefore, the forced response of an RL or RC circuit to an exponential forcing function is of the

response will be of the same form as the forcing function itself, and we try to obtain the relationship
that will be satisﬁed under those conditions.

The voltage source of Example 8.7-1 is a decaying exponential of the form
vs ¼ 10e2tu tð Þ V
This source is said to be aperiodic (nonperiodic). A periodic source is one that repeats itself exactly after a
ﬁxed length of time. Thus, the signal f(t) is periodic if there is a number T such that for all t
f t þ T
ð
Þ ¼ f tð Þ
ð8:7-5Þ
The smallest positive number T that satisﬁes Eq. 8.7-5 is called the period. The period deﬁnes the
duration of one complete cycle of f(t). Thus, any source for which there is no value of T satisfying Eq.
8.7-5 is said to be aperiodic. An example of a periodic source is 10 sin 2t, which we consider in Example
8.7-2. The period of this sinusoidal source is p s.
for t > 0. Substituting if ¼ Be2t, we have

Þe2t ¼ 10e2t
Hence, B ¼ 5 and

The natural response can be obtained by considering the circuit shown in Figure 8.7-1b. This is the equivalent

ð
Þt ¼ Ae4t
The complete response is

The constant A can be determined from the value of the inductor current at time t ¼ 0. The initial inductor current
i(0) can be obtained by considering the circuit shown in Figure 8.7-1c. This is the equivalent circuit that is appropriate
before the switch opens. Because vs(t) ¼ 0 for t < 0 and a zero voltage source is a short circuit, the voltage source
at the right side of the circuit has been replaced by a short circuit. Also, because the circuit is at steady state before
the switch opens and the only input is the constant 10-volt source, the inductor acts like a short circuit. The current
in the short circuit that replaces the inductor is the initial condition i(0). From Figure 8.7-1c,

for t > 0. We assume that vf will consist of the sinusoidal function sin 2t and its derivatives.
Examining Eq. 8.7-6, vf=4 plus 0.5 dvf=dt must equal 10 sin 2t. However, d(sin 2t)=dt ¼ 2 cos 2t. Therefore,
the trial vf needs to contain both sin 2t and cos 2t terms. Thus, we try the proposed solution
vf ¼ A sin 2t þ B cos 2t
The derivative of vf is then
dvf
dt ¼ 2A cos 2t  2B sin 2t
Substituting vf and dvf=dt into Eq. 8.7-6, we obtain

A special case for the forced response of a circuit may occur when the forcing function is a damped
exponential when we have y(t) ¼ ebt. Referring back to Eq. 8.7-4, we can show that
xf ¼ ebt
a  b
when y(t) ¼ ebt. Note that here we have ebt whereas we used ebt for Eq. 8.7-4. For the special case
when a ¼ b, we have a  b ¼ 0, and this form of the response is indeterminate. For the special case,
we must use xf ¼ tebt as the forced response. The solution xf for the forced response when a ¼ b
will satisfy the original differential Eq. (8.7-1). Thus, when the natural response already contains a
term of the same form as the forcing function, we need to multiply the assumed form of the forced
response by t.
The forced response to selected forcing functions is summarized in Table 8.7-1. We note that if
a circuit is linear, at steady state, and excited by a single sinusoidal source having frequency o, then
all the element currents and voltages are sinusoids having frequency o.

An operator is a symbol that represents a mathematical operation. We can deﬁne a differential
operator s such that
sx ¼ dx
dt
and
s2x ¼ d2x
dt2
Thus, the operator s denotes differentiation of the variable with respect to time. The utility of the
operator s is that it can be treated as an algebraic quantity. This permits the replacement of differential
equations with algebraic equations, which are easily handled.
Use of the s operator is particularly attractive when higher-order differential equations are
involved. Then we use the s operator, so that
snx ¼ dnx
dtn
for n  0
We assume that n ¼ 0 represents no differentiation, so that
s0 ¼ 1
which implies s0x ¼ x.
Because integration is the inverse of differentiation, we deﬁne

s x ¼

The operator 1=s must be shown to satisfy the usual rules of algebraic manipulations. Of these rules,
the commutative multiplication property presents the only difﬁculty. Thus, we require

only when x(1) ¼ 0. From a physical point of view, we require that all capacitor voltages and
inductor currents be zero at t ¼ 1. Then the operator 1=s can be said to satisfy Eq. 8.8-2 and can be
manipulated as an ordinary algebraic quantity.
Differential operators can be used to ﬁnd the natural solution of a differential equation. For
example, consider the ﬁrst-order differential equation
d
dt x tð Þ þ ax tð Þ ¼ by tð Þ
ð8:8-3Þ
The natural solution of this differential equation is
xn tð Þ ¼ Kest
ð8:8-4Þ
The homogeneous form of a differential equation is obtained by setting the forcing function equal to
zero. The forcing function in Eq. 8.8-3 is y(t). The homogeneous form of this equation is
d
dt x tð Þ þ ax tð Þ ¼ 0
ð8:8-5Þ
To see that xn(t) is a solution of the homogeneous form of the differential equation, we substitute
Eq. 8.8-4 into Eq. 8.8-5.
d
dt Kest
ð
Þ þ a Kest
ð
Þ ¼ sKest þ aKest ¼ 0
To obtain the parameter s in Eq. 8.8-4, replace d=dt in Eq. 8.8-5 by the differential operator s. This
results in
sx þ ax ¼ s þ a
ð
Þx ¼ 0
ð8:8-6Þ
This equation has two solutions: x ¼ 0 and s ¼ a. The solution x ¼ 0 isn’t useful, so we use the
solution s ¼ a. Substituting this solution into Eq. 8.8-4 gives
xn tð Þ ¼ Keat
This is the same expression for the natural response that we obtained earlier in this chapter by other
methods. That’s reassuring but not new. Differential operators will be quite useful when we analyze
circuits that are represented by second- and higher-order differential equations.

To use PSpice to analyze a ﬁrst-order circuit, we do the following:
1.
Draw the circuit in the OrCAD Capture workspace.
2.
Specify a Time Domain (Transient) simulation.
3.
Run the simulation.
4.
Plot the simulation results.
Time domain analysis is most interesting for circuits that contain capacitors or inductors or both.
PSpice provides parts representing capacitors and inductors in the ANALOG parts library. The part
name for the capacitor is C. The part properties that are of the most interest are the capacitance and the
initial condition, both of which are speciﬁed using the OrCAD Capture property editor. (The initial
condition of a capacitor is the value of the capacitor voltage at time t ¼ 0.) The part name for the inductor
is L. The inductance and the initial condition of the inductor are speciﬁed using the property editor.
(The initial condition of an inductor is the value of the inductor current at time t ¼ 0.)

The voltage and current sources that represent time-varying inputs are provided in the SOURCE
parts library. Table 8.9-1 summarizes these voltage sources. The voltage waveform describes the
shape of the voltage source voltage as a function of time. Each voltage waveform is described using a
series of parameters. For example, the voltage of an exponential source VEXP is described using vl,
v2, tdl, td2, tc1, and tc2. The parameters of the voltage sources in Table 8.9-1 are speciﬁed using the
property editor.

The input to the circuit shown in Figure 8.9-1a is the voltage source voltage, vi(t), shown in Figure 8.9-la. The

Solution
We begin by drawing the circuit in the OrCAD
workspace as shown in Figure 8.9-2 (see
Appendix A). The voltage source is a VPULSE
part (see the second row of Table 8.9-1). Figure
8.9-la shows vi(t) making the transition from
1 V to 4 V instantaneously. Zero is not an
acceptable value for the parameters tr or tf.
Choosing a very small value for tr and tf will
make the transitions appear to be instantaneous
when using a time scale that shows a period of
the input waveform. In this example, the period
of the input waveform is 10 ms, so 1 ns is a
reasonable choice for the values of tr and tf.
It’s convenient to set td, the delay before the periodic part of the waveform, to zero. Then the values of vl and
v2 are 1 and 4, respectively. The value of pw is the length of time that vi(t) = v2 = 4 V, so pw = 2 ms in this
example. The pulse input is a periodic function of time. The value of per is the period of the pulse function, 10 ms.
The circuit shown in Figure 8.9-1b does not have a ground node. PSpice requires that all circuits have a
ground node, so it is necessary to select a ground node. Figure 8.9-2 shows that the bottom node has been selected
to be the ground node.
We will perform a Time Domain (Transient) simulation. (Select PSpice\New Simulation Proﬁle from the
OrCAD Capture menu bar; then choose Time Domain (Transient) from the Analysis Type drop-down list. The
simulation starts at time zero and ends at the Run to Time. Specify the Run to Time as 20 ms to run the simulation
for two full periods of the input waveform. Select the Skip The Initial Transient Bias Point Calculation (SKJPBP)
check box.) Select PSpice\Run from the OrCAD Capture menu bar to run the simulation.
After a successful Time Domain (Transient) simulation, OrCAD Capture will automatically open a Schematics
window. Select Trace/Add Trace to pop up the Add Traces dialog box. Add the traces V(OUTPUT) and V(INPUT).
Figure 8.9-3 shows the resulting plot after removing the grid and labeling some points.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problems discussed in this chapter.

How Can We Check the Response of
a First-Order Circuit?
Consider the circuit and corresponding transient response shown in Figure 8.10-1. How can we check whether the
transient response is correct? Three things need to be veriﬁed: the initial voltage, vo(t0); the ﬁnal voltage, vo(1);
and the time constant, t.
Solution
Consider ﬁrst the initial voltage, vo(t0). (In this example, t0 ¼ 10 ms.) Before time t0 ¼ 10 ms, the switch is closed and
has been closed long enough for the circuit to reach steady state, that is, for any transients to have died out. To
calculate vo(t0), we simplify the circuit in two ways. First, replace the switch with a short circuit because the switch
is closed. Second, replace the inductor with a short circuit because inductors act like short circuits when all the
inputs are constants and the circuit is at steady state. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 8.10-2a. After
replacing the parallel 300-V and 600-V resistors by the equivalent 200-V resistor, the initial voltage is calculated
using voltage division as
vo t0

Next consider the ﬁnal voltage, vo(1). In this case, the switch is open and the circuit has reached steady state.
Again, the circuit is simpliﬁed in two ways. The switch is replaced with an open circuit because the switch is open.
The inductor is replaced by a short circuit because inductors act like short circuits when all the inputs are constants
and the circuit is at steady state. The simpliﬁed circuit is shown in Figure 8.10-2b. The ﬁnal voltage is calculated
using voltage division as
vo 1

Figure 8.10-3 shows how the initial voltage, ﬁnal voltage, and time constant can be determined from the plot of
the transient response. (Recall that a procedure for determining the time constant graphically was illustrated in Figure
8.3-3.) Because the values of vo(t0), vo(1), and t obtained from the transient response are the same as the values
obtained by analyzing the circuit, we conclude that the transient response is indeed correct.

How Can We Check the Response of
a First-Order Circuit?
Consider the circuit and corresponding tran-
sient response shown in Figure 8.10-4. How
can we check whether the transient response
is correct? Four things need to be veriﬁed:
the steady-state capacitor voltage when the
switch is open, the steady-state capacitor
voltage when the switch is closed, the time
constant when the switch is open, and the
time constant when the switch is closed.
Solution
Figure 8.10-5a shows the circuit used to calcu-
late the steady-state capacitor voltage when the
switch is open. The circuit has been simpliﬁed
in two ways.First, theswitch hasbeen replaced
with an open circuit. Second, the capacitor has

Figure 8.10-5c shows the circuit used to calculate the time constant when the switch is open. This circuit has

45 kV. The time constant is

Having done these calculations, we
expect the capacitor voltage to be 3 V until
the switch closes at t ¼ 20 ms. The capacitor
voltage will then increase exponentially
to 8 V, with a time constant equal to 10 ms.
The capacitor voltage will remain 8 V until
the switch opens at t ¼ 90 ms. The capacitor
voltage will then decrease exponentially to
3 V, with a time constant equal to 22.5 ms.
Figure 8.10-6 shows that the transient
response satisﬁes this description. We con-
clude that the transient response is correct.

A Computer and Printer
It is frequently necessary to connect two pieces of electronic equipment together so that the output from one
device can be used as the input to another device. For example, this situation occurs when a printer
is connected to a computer, as shown in Figure 8.11-1a. This situation is represented more generally by
the circuit shown in Figure 8.11-1b. The driver sends a signal through the cable to the receiver. Let us replace
the driver, cable, and receiver with simple models. Model the driver as a voltage source, the cable as an
RC circuit, and the receiver as an open circuit. The values of resistance and capacitance used to model
the cable will depend on the length of the cable. For example, when RG58 coaxial cable is used,
R ¼ r 	 ‘ where r ¼ 0:54 V
m
and
C ¼ c 	 ‘ where c ¼ 88 pF
m
and ‘ is the length of the cable in meters, Figure 8.11-1c shows the equivalent circuit.
Suppose that the circuits connected by the cable are digital circuits. The driver will send 1’s and 0’s to the
receiver. These 1’s and 0’s will be represented by voltages. The output of the driver will be one voltage, VOH, to
represent logic 1 and another voltage, VOL, to represent a logic 0. For example, one popular type of logic, called
TTL logic, uses VOH ¼ 2.4 V and VOL ¼ 0.4 V. (TTL stands for transistor–transistor logic.) The receiver uses
two different voltages, VIH and VIL, to represent 1’s and 0’s. (This is done to provide noise immunity, but that is
another story.) The receiver will interpret its input, vb, to be a logic 1 whenever vb > VIH and to be a logic 0
whenever vb < VIL. (Voltages between VIH and VIL will occur only during transitions between logic 1
and logic 0. These voltages will sometimes be interpreted as logic 1 and other times as logic 0.) TTL logic uses
VIH ¼ 2.0 V and VIL ¼ 0.8 V.

Figure 8.11-2 shows what happens when the driver output changes from logic 0 to logic 1. Before time t0,
va ¼ VOL
and
vb < VIL
for
t < t0
In words, a logic 0 is sent and received. The driver output switches to VOH at time t0. The receiver input vb makes
this transition more slowly. Not until time t1 does the receiver input become large enough to be interpreted as a
logic 1. That is,
vb > VIH
for
t > t1
The time that it takes for the receiver to recognize the transition from logic 0 to logic 1
Dt ¼ t1  t0
is called the delay. This delay is important because it puts a limit on how fast 1’s and 0’s can be sent from the driver
to the receiver. To ensure that the 1’s and 0’s are received reliably, each 1 and each 0 must last at least Dt. The rate at
which 1’s and 0’s are sent from the driver to the receiver is inversely proportional to the delay.
Suppose two TTL circuits are connected using RG58 coaxial cable. What restriction must be placed on the
length of the cable to ensure that the delay, Dt, is less than 2 ns?
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
The voltage vb(t) is the capacitor voltage of an RC circuit. The RC circuit is at steady state just before time t0.
The input to the RC circuit is va(t). Before time t0, va(t) ¼ VOL ¼ 0.4 V. At time t0, va(t) changes abruptly.
After time t0, va(t) ¼ VOH ¼ 2.4 V.
Before time t0, vb(t) ¼ VOL ¼ 0.4 V. After time t0, vb(t) increases exponentially. Eventually, vb(t) ¼
VOH ¼ 2.4 V.
The time constant of the RC circuit is
t ¼ R 	 C ¼ rc‘ 2 ¼ 47:52  102 	 ‘ 2
where ‘ is the cable length in meters.
State the Goal
Calculate the maximum value of the cable length ‘ for which vb > VIH ¼ 2.0 V by time t ¼ t0 þ Dt, where
Dt ¼ 2 ns.

Voltages and currents can be used to encode, store, and
process information. When a voltage or current is used to
represent information, that voltage or current is called a
signal. Electric circuits that process that information are
called signal-processing circuits.
Circuits that contain energy-storing elements, that is,
capacitors and inductors, are represented by differential
equations rather than by algebraic equations. Analysis of
these circuits requires the solution of differential equations.
In this chapter, we restricted our attention to ﬁrst-order
circuits. First-order circuits contain one energy storage ele-
ment and are represented by ﬁrst-order differential equations,
which are reasonably easy to solve. We solved ﬁrst-order
differential equations, using the method called separation of
variables.
The complete response of a circuit is the sum of the natural
response and the forced response. The natural response is the
general solution of the differential equation that represents
the circuit when the input is set to zero. The forced response
is the particular solution of the differential equation repre-
senting the circuit.
The complete response can be separated into the transient
response and the steady-state response. The transient re-
sponse
vanishes
with
time,
leaving
the
steady-state
response. When the input to the circuit is either a constant
or a sinusoid, the steady-state response can be used as the
forced response.
The term transient response sometimes refers to the
“transient part of the complete response” and other times
to a complete response that includes a transient part. In
particular, PSpice uses the term transient response to refer
to the complete response. Because this can be confusing, the
term must be used carefully.
The step response of a circuit is the response when the input
is equal to a unit step function and all the initial conditions of
the circuit are equal to zero.
We used Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits to reduce
the problem of analyzing any ﬁrst-order circuit to the prob-
lem of analyzing one of two simple ﬁrst-order circuits. One
of the simple ﬁrst-order circuits is a series circuit consisting
of a voltage source, a resistor, and a capacitor. The other is a
parallel circuit consisting of a current source, a resistor, and
an inductor. Table 8.12-1 summarizes the equations used
to determine the complete response of a ﬁrst-order circuit.
The parameter t in the ﬁrst-order differential equation
d
dt x tð Þ þ x tð Þ
t
¼ K is called the time constant. The time
constant t is the time for the response of a ﬁrst-order circuit
to complete 63 percent of the transition from initial value to
ﬁnal value.
Stability is a property of well-behaved circuits. It is easy to
tell whether a ﬁrst-order circuit is stable. A ﬁrst-order circuit
is stable if, and only if, its time constant is not negative, that
is, t  0.

I n t r o d u c t i o n
In this chapter, we consider second-order circuits. A second-order circuit is a circuit that is represented
by a second-order differential equation. As a rule of thumb, the order of the differential equation that
represents a circuit is equal to the number of capacitors in the circuit plus the number of inductors.
For example, a second-order circuit might contain one capacitor and one inductor, or it might contain
two capacitors and no inductors.
For example, a second-order circuit could be represented by the equation
d2
dt2 x tð Þ þ 2a d
dt x tð Þ þ o2
0 x tð Þ ¼ f tð Þ
where x(t) is the output of the circuit, and f ðtÞ is the input to the circuit. The output of the circuit, also
called the response of the circuit, can be the current or voltage of any device in the circuit. The output is
frequently chosen to be the current of an inductor or the voltage of a capacitor. The voltages of
independent voltage sources and/or currents of independent current sources provide the input to the
circuit. The coefﬁcients of this differential equation have names: a is called the damping coefﬁcient, and
o0 is called the resonant frequency.
To ﬁnd the response of the second-order circuit, we:
 Represent the circuit by a second-order differential equation.
 Find the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation. This solution is the natural
response xn(t). The natural response will contain two unknown constants that will be evaluated later.
378

 Find a particular solution of the differential equation. This solution is the forced response xf(t).
 Represent the response of the second-order circuit as x(t) ¼ xn(t) þ xf(t).
 Use the initial conditions, for example, the initial values of the currents in inductors and the voltages
across capacitors, to evaluate the unknown constants.

In Chapter 8, we considered circuits that contained only one energy storage element, and these could be
described by a ﬁrst-order differential equation. In this section, we consider the description of circuits with
two irreducible energy storage elements that are described by a second-order differential equation. Later, we
will consider circuits with three or more irreducible energy storage elements that are described by a third-
order (or higher) differential equation. We use the term irreducible to indicate that all parallel or series
connections or other reducible combinations of like storage elements have been
reduced to their irreducible form. Thus, for example, any parallel capacitors have
been reduced to an equivalent capacitor Cp.
In the following paragraphs, we use two methods to obtain the second-order
differential equation for circuits with two energy storage elements. Then, in the next
section, we obtain the solution to these second-order differential equations.
First, let us consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.2-1, which consists of a
parallel combination of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor. Writing the nodal
equation at the top node, we have
v
R þ i þ C dv
dt ¼ is
ð9:2-1Þ
Then we write the equation for the inductor as
v ¼ L di
dt
ð9:2-2Þ
Substitute Eq. 9.2-2 into Eq. 9.2-1, obtaining
L
R
di
dt þ i þ CL d2i
dt2 ¼ is
ð9:2-3Þ
which is the second-order differential equation we seek. Solve this equation for i(t). If v(t) is required,
use Eq. 9.2-2 to obtain it.
This method of obtaining the second-order differential equation may be called the direct method
and is summarized in Table 9.2-1.
In Table 9.2-1, the circuit variables are called x1 and x2. In any example, x1 and x2 will be speciﬁc
element currents or voltages. When we analyzed the circuit of Figure 9.2-1, we used x1 ¼ v and x2 ¼ i.
In contrast, to analyze the circuit of Figure 9.2-2, we will use x1 ¼ i and x2 ¼ v, where i is the inductor
current and v is the capacitor voltage.
Now let us consider the RLC series circuit shown in Figure 9.2-2 and use the direct method to
obtain the second-order differential equation. We chose x1 ¼ i and x2 ¼ v. First, we seek an equation for
dx1=dt ¼ di=dt. Writing KVL around the loop, we have
L di
dt þ v þ Ri ¼ vs
ð9:2-4Þ
where v is the capacitor voltage. This equation may be written as

Another method of obtaining the second-order differential equation describing a circuit is called
the operator method. First, we obtain differential equations describing node voltages or mesh currents
and use operators to obtain the differential equation for the circuit.
As a more complicated example of a circuit with two energy storage elements, consider the circuit
shown in Figure 9.2-3. This circuit has two inductors and can be described by the mesh currents as
shown in Figure 9.2-3. The mesh equations are

ð9:2-14Þ
It remains to obtain one second-order differential equation. This is done in the second step of the operator
method. The differential operator s, where s ¼ d=dt, is used to transform differential equations into
algebraic equations. Upon replacing d=dt by s, Eqs. 9.2-13 and 9.2-14 become
si1 þ i1  i2 ¼ vs

 i1 þ i2 þ 2si2 ¼ 0
These two equations may be rewritten as

The operator method for obtaining the second-order differential equation is summarized in

The natural response of a circuit xn will satisfy the equation

ð9:3-2Þ
Because xn and its derivatives must satisfy the equation, we postulate the exponential solution
xn ¼ Aest
ð9:3-3Þ
where A and s are to be determined. The exponential is the only function that is proportional to all of its
derivatives and integrals and, therefore, is the natural choice for the solution of a differential equation
with constant coefﬁcients. Substituting Eq. 9.3-3 in Eq. 9.3-2 and differentiating where required, we
have
a2As2est þ a1Asest þ a0Aest ¼ 0
ð9:3-4Þ
Because xn ¼ Aest, we may rewrite Eq. 9.3-4 as
a2s2xn þ a1sxn þ a0xn ¼ 0

xn ¼ 0
Because we do not accept the trivial solution, xn ¼ 0, it is required that

ð9:3-5Þ
This equation, in terms of s, is called a characteristic equation. It is readily obtained by replacing the
derivative by s and the second derivative by s2. Clearly, we have returned to the familiar operator
sn ¼ dn
dtn
The characteristic equation is derived from the governing differential equation for a circuit
by setting all independent sources to zero value and assuming an exponential solution.
Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925), shown in Figure 9.3-1, advanced the theory of operators for
the solution of differential equations.
The solution of the quadratic equation (9.3-5) has two roots, s1 and s2, where

where A1 and A2 are unknown constants that will be evaluated later. We will delay
considering the special case when s1 ¼ s2.
The roots of the characteristic equation contain all the information necessary for determining
the character of the natural response.

In this section, we consider the (unforced) natural response of the parallel RLC circuit shown
in Figure 9.4-1. We choose to examine the parallel RLC circuit to illustrate the three forms of
the natural response. An analogous discussion of the series RLC circuit could be presented,
but it is omitted because the purpose is not to obtain the solution to speciﬁc circuits but rather
to illustrate the general method.
A circuit that contains one capacitor and one inductor is represented by a second-order
differential equation,
d2
dt2 x tð Þ þ 2a d
dt x tð Þ þ o2
0 x tð Þ ¼ f tð Þ
where x(t) is the output of the circuit and f ðtÞ is the input to the circuit. The output of the circuit, also
called the response of the circuit, can be the current or voltage of any device in the circuit. The output is
frequently chosen to be the current of an inductor or the voltage of a capacitor. The voltages of
independent voltage sources and/or currents of independent current sources provide the input to the
circuit. The coefﬁcients of this differential equation have names: a is called the damping coefﬁcient, and
o0 is called the resonant frequency.
The circuit shown in Figure 9.4-1 does not contain any independent sources, so the input f ðtÞ is
zero. The differential equation with f ðtÞ ¼ 0 is called a homogeneous differential equation. We will take
the output to be the voltage v(t) at the top node of the circuit. Consequently, we will represent the circuit
in Figure 9.4-1 by a homogeneous differential equation of the form

When o0 > a, the roots of the characteristic equation are complex and can be expressed as

The roots of the characteristic equation assume three possible conditions:
1.
Two real and distinct roots when a2 > o2
0.
2.
Two real equal roots when a2 ¼ o2
0.
3.
Two complex roots when a2 < o2
0.
When the two roots are real and distinct, the circuit is said to be overdamped. When the roots
are both real and equal, the circuit is critically damped. When the two roots are complex
conjugates, the circuit is said to be underdamped.
Let us determine the natural response for the overdamped RLC circuit of Figure 9.4-1 when the
initial conditions are v(0) and i(0) for the capacitor and the inductor, respectively. Notice that because
the circuit in Figure 9.4-1 has no input, vn(0) and v(0) are both names for the same voltage. Then, at t ¼ 0
for Eq. 9.4-7, we have
vn 0
ð Þ ¼ A1 þ A2

Because A1 and A2 are both unknown, we need one more equation at t ¼ 0. Rewriting Eq. 9.4-1 at t ¼ 0,

Let us assume that s1 ¼ s2 and proceed to ﬁnd vn(t). We write the natural response as the sum of two

ð9:5-1Þ
where A3 ¼ A1 þ A2. Because the two roots are equal, we have only one undetermined constant, but we
still have two initial conditions to satisfy. Clearly, Eq. 9.5-1 is not the total solution for the natural

with some foreknowledge, we try the solution

Let us consider a parallel RLC circuit in which L ¼ 1 H, R ¼ 1 V, C ¼ 1/4 F, v(0) ¼ 5 V, and

Because vn(0) ¼ 5, we have at t ¼ 0

Find the forced response if of the circuit of Example 9.7-1 when is ¼ I0, where I0 is a constant.
Solution
Because the source is a constant applied at t ¼ 0, we expect the forced response to be a constant also. As a ﬁrst
method, we will use the differential equation to ﬁnd the forced response. Second, we will demonstrate the
alternative method that uses the steady-state behavior of the circuit to ﬁnd if.
The differential equation with the constant source is obtained from Eq. 9.7-6 as

Again, we assume that the forced response is if ¼ D, a constant. Because the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the
assumed forced response are zero, we have

Therefore;
if ¼ I0
Another approach is to determine the steady-state response if of the circuit of
Figure 9.7-1 by drawing the steady-state circuit model. The inductor acts like
a short circuit, and the capacitor acts like an open circuit, as shown in Figure
9.7-2. Clearly, because the steady-state model of the inductor is a short circuit,
all the source current ﬂows through the inductor at steady state, and

The two previous examples showed that it is relatively easy to obtain the response of the circuit to
a forcing function. However, we are sometimes confronted with a special case where the form of the
forcing function is the same as the form of one of the components of the natural response.
Again, consider the circuit of Examples 9.7-1 and 9.7-2 (Figure 9.7-1) when the differential
equation is

Thus, the natural response is

Then at ﬁrst, we, expect the forced response to be

ð9:7-11Þ
However, the forced response and one component of the natural response would then both have the
form De6t. Will this work? Let’s try substituting Eq. 9.7-11 into the differential equation (9.7-10). We
then obtain
36Be6t  42Be6t þ 6Be6t ¼ 18e6t
or
0 ¼ 18e6t
which is an impossible solution. Therefore, we need another form of the forced response when one of
the natural response terms has the same form as the forcing function.
Let us try the forced response

Adding these responses, we have the complete response with two unspeciﬁed constants. We will then

The state variables of a circuit are a set of variables associated with the energy of the energy storage
elements of the circuit. Thus, they describe the complete response of a circuit to a forcing function and
the circuit’s initial conditions. Here the word state means “condition,” as in state of the union. We will
choose as the state variables those variables that describe the energy storage of the circuit. Thus, we will
use the independent capacitor voltages and the independent inductor currents.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.9-1. The two
energy storage elements are C1 and C2, and the two capacitors
cannot be reduced to one. We expect the circuit to be described
by a second-order differential equation. However, let us ﬁrst
obtain the two ﬁrst-order differential equations that describe
the response for v1(t) and v2(t), which are the state variables
of the circuit. If we know the value of the state variables at one
time and the value of the input variables thereafter, we can ﬁnd
the value of any state variable for any subsequent time.

We now proceed to obtain the natural response
vln ¼ A1et þ A2e4t
and the forced response, which depends on the form of the forcing function. For example, if
va ¼ 10 V and vb ¼ 6 V, v1f will be a constant (see Table 9.7-1). We obtain v1f by substituting
into Eq. 9.9-8, obtaining
4vlf ¼ 3va þ vb
or
4vlf ¼ 30 þ 6 ¼ 36
Therefore;
vlf ¼ 9
Then
v1 ¼ vln þ vlf ¼ A1et þ A2e4t þ 9
ð9:9-9Þ
We will usually know the initial conditions of the energy storage elements. For example, if we know
that v1(0) ¼ 5 V and v2(0) ¼ 10 V, we ﬁrst use v1(0) ¼ 5 along with Eq. 9.9-9 to obtain
v1 0
ð Þ ¼ A1 þ A2 þ 9
and, therefore,
A1 þ A2 ¼ 4
ð9:9-10Þ
Now we need the value of dv1=dt at t ¼ 0. Referring back to Eq. 9.9-5, we have
dv1
dt ¼ va þ v2  2 v1
Therefore, at t ¼ 0, we have

Therefore;

As you encounter circuits with two or more energy storage elements, you should consider
using the state variable method of describing a set of ﬁrst-order differential equations.
The state variable method uses a ﬁrst-order differential equation for each state variable to
determine the complete response of a circuit.
A summary of the state variable method is given in Table 9.9-1. We will use this method in
Example 9.9-1.

R ¼ 3 V, L ¼ 1 H, C ¼ 1=2 F, and is ¼ 2e3t A. Assume steady

Solution
First, we identify the state variables as i and v. The initial
conditions at t ¼ 0 are obtained by considering the circuit with
the 10-V source connected for a long time at t ¼ 0. At t ¼ 0,
the voltage source is disconnected and the current source is
connected. Then v(0) ¼ 10 V and i(0) ¼ 0 A.
Consider the circuit after time t ¼ 0. The ﬁrst differential equation is obtained by using KVL around the RLC

9. The Complete Response of Circuits with Two Energy Storage Elements

We recognize that the state variable method is particularly powerful for
ﬁnding the response of energy storage elements in a circuit. This is also true
if we encounter higher-order circuits with three or more energy storage
elements. For example, consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.9-3. The state
variables are v1, v2, and i. Two ﬁrst-order differential equations are obtained
by writing the KCL equations at node a and node b. Then a third ﬁrst-order
differential equation is obtained by writing the KVL around the middle mesh
containing i. The solution for one or more of these variables can then
be obtained by proceeding with the state variable method summarized in
Table 9.9-1.

We have observed that the character of the natural response of a second-order system is determined by
the roots of the characteristic equation. Let us consider the roots of a parallel RLC circuit. The

In general, roots are located in the complex plane, the location being
deﬁned by coordinates measured along the real or -axis and the imagi-
nary or jo-axis. This is referred to as the s-plane or, because s has the units
of frequency, as the complex frequency plane. When the roots are real,
negative, and distinct, the response is the sum of two decaying expo-
nentials and is said to be overdamped. When the roots are complex
conjugates, the natural response is an exponentially decaying sinusoid
and is said to be underdamped or oscillatory.
Now, let us show the location of the roots of the characteristic equation
for the four conditions: (a) undamped, a ¼ 0; (b) underdamped, a < o0;
(c) critically damped, a ¼ o0; and (d) overdamped, a > o0. These four
conditions lead to root locations on the s-plane as shown in Figure 9.10-1.
When a ¼ 0, the two complex roots are jo0. When a <o0, the roots are
s¼ a  jod. When a ¼ o0, there are two roots at s ¼ a. Finally, when

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the
speciﬁcations have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against
data-entry errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

How Can We Check an Underdamped Response?
Figure 9.11-1b shows an RLC circuit. The voltage vs(t) of the voltage source is the square wave shown in Figure
9.11-1a. Figure 9.11-2 shows a plot of the inductor current i(t), which was obtained by simulating this circuit using
PSpice. How can we check that the plot of i(t) is correct?
Solution
Several features of the plot can be checked. The plot indicates that steady-state values of the inductor current are
i(1) ¼ 0 and i(1) ¼ 200 mA and that the circuit is underdamped. In addition, some points on the response have
How Can We Check . . . ?

been labeled to give the corresponding values of time and current. These values can be used to check the value of
the damped resonant frequency od.
If the voltage of the voltage source were a constant vs(t) ¼ Vs, then the steady-state inductor current
would be
i tð Þ ¼ Vs
100
Thus, we expect the steady-state inductor current to be i(1) ¼ 0 when Vs ¼ 0 V and to be i(1) ¼ 200 mA when
Vs ¼ 20 V. The plot in Figure 9.11-2 shows that the steady-state values of the inductor current are indeed i(1) ¼ 0 and
i(1) ¼ 200 mA.
The plot in Figure 9.11-2 shows an underdamped response. The RLC circuit will be underdamped if
105 ¼ L < 4R2C ¼ 4  1002  109
Because this inequality is satisﬁed, the circuit is indeed underdamped, as indicated by the plot.

Auto Airbag Igniter
Airbags are widely used for driver and passenger protection in automobiles. A pendulum is used to switch a
charged capacitor to the inﬂation ignition device, as shown in Figure 9.12-1. The automobile airbag is inﬂated
by an explosive device that is ignited by the energy absorbed by the resistive device represented by R. To inﬂate,
it is required that the energy dissipated in R be at least 1 J. It is required that the ignition device trigger within
0.1 s. Select the L and C that meet the speciﬁcations.

Select L and C so that an underdamped response is obtained with a period of less than or equal to 0.4 s (T 	 0.4 s).
2.
Solve for v(t) and i(t) for the resistor R.
Act on the Plan
We assume that the initial capacitor voltage is v(0) ¼ 12 V and iL(0) ¼ 0 because the switch is in position 1 for a
long time prior to t ¼ 0. The response of the parallel RLC circuit for an underdamped response is of the form
v tð Þ ¼ eat B1 cos odt þ B2 sin odt

ð9:12-1Þ
This natural response is obtained when a2 < o2
0 or L < 4R2C. We choose an underdamped response for our
design but recognize that an overdamped or critically damped response may satisfy the circuit’s design
objectives. Furthermore, we recognize that the parameter values selected below represent only one acceptable
solution.
Because we want a rapid response, we will select a ¼ 2 (a time constant of 1=2 s) where a ¼ 1= 2RC

Therefore, we have

Thus, we will use C ¼ 1=16 F and L ¼ 65 mH. We then ﬁnd that od ¼ 15.58 rad/s and, using Eq. 9.6-5, we have
v tð Þ ¼ e2t B1 cos odt þ B2 sin odt

The actual voltage and current for the resistor R are shown in Figure 9.12-2 for the ﬁrst 100 ms. If we sketch
the product of v and i for the ﬁrst 100 ms, we obtain a linear approximation declining from 36 W at t ¼ 0 to 0 W at

Second-order circuits are circuits that are represented by a
second-order differential equation, for example,
d2
dt2 x tð Þ þ 2a d
dt x tð Þ þ o2
0x tð Þ ¼ f tð Þ
where x(t) is the output current or voltage of the circuit and
f ðtÞ is the input to the circuit. The output of the circuit, also
called the response of the circuit, can be the current or
voltage of any device in the circuit. The output is frequently
chosen to be the current of an inductor or the voltage of a
capacitor. The input to the circuit is provided by the
voltages of independent voltage sources and/or currents
of independent current sources. The coefﬁcients of this
differential equation have names: a is called the damping
coefﬁcient, and o0 is called the resonant frequency.
Obtaining the differential equation to represent an arbitrary
circuit can be challenging. This chapter presents three
methods for obtaining that differential equation: the direct
method (Section 9.2), the operator method (Section 9.2),
and the state variable method (Section 9.10).
The characteristic equation of a second-order circuit is
s2 þ 2as þ o2
0 ¼ 0
This second-order equation has two solutions, s1 and s2.
These solutions are called the natural frequencies of the
second-order circuit.
Second-order circuits are characterized as overdamped, criti-
cally damped, or underdamped. A second-order circuit is
overdamped when s1 and s2 are real and unequal, or,
equivalently, a > o0. A second-order circuit is critically
damped when s1 and s2 are real and equal, or, equivalently,
a ¼ o0. A second-order circuit is underdamped when s1 and
s2 are real and equal, or, equivalently, a < o0.
Table 9.13-1 describes the natural frequencies of over-
damped, underdamped, and critically damped parallel and
series RLC circuits.
The complete response of a second-order circuit is the sum of
the natural response and the forced response
x ¼ xn þ xf
The form of the natural response depends on the natural
frequencies of the circuit as summarized in Table 9.13-2. The
form of the forced response depends on the input to the
circuit as summarized in Table 9.13-3.

P 9.3-4 German automaker Volkswagen, in its bid to make
more efﬁcient cars, has come up with an auto whose engine
saves energy by shutting itself off at stoplights. The stop–start
system springs from a campaign to develop cars in all its world
markets that use less fuel and pollute less than vehicles now on
the road. The stop–start transmission control has a mechanism
that senses when the car does not need fuel: coasting downhill
and idling at an intersection. The engine shuts off, but a small
starter ﬂywheel keeps turning so that power can be quickly
restored when the driver touches the accelerator.
A model of the stop–start circuit is shown in Figure
P 9.3-4. Determine the characteristic equation and the natural
frequencies for the circuit.

DP 9-9 A ﬂuorescent light uses cathodes (coiled tungsten
ﬁlaments coated with an electron-emitting substance) at each
end that send current through mercury vapors sealed in the tube.
Ultraviolet radiation is produced as electrons from the cathodes
knock mercury electrons out of their natural orbits. Some of the
displaced electrons settle back into orbit, throwing off the excess
energy absorbed in the collision. Almost all of this energy is in
the form of ultraviolet radiation. The ultraviolet rays, which are
invisible, strike a phosphor coating on the inside of the tube. The
rays energize the electrons in the phosphor atoms, and the atoms
emit white light. The conversion of one kind of light into another
is known as ﬂuorescence.
One form of a ﬂuorescent lamp is represented by the RLC
circuit shown in Figure DP 9-9. Select L so that the current i(t)
reaches a maximum at approximately t ¼ 0.5 s. Determine the

I n t r o d u c t i o n
Consider the experiment illustrated in Figure 10.1-1. Here, a function generator provides the input to a
linear circuit and the oscilloscope displays the output, or response, of the linear circuit. The linear circuit
itself consists of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and perhaps dependent sources and/or op amps. The
function generator allows us to choose from several types of input function. These input functions are
called waveforms or waves. A typical function generator will provide square waves, pulse waves,
triangular waves, and sinusoidal waves.
The output of the circuit will consist of two parts: a transient part that dies out as time increases
and a steady-state part that persists. Typically, the transient part dies out quickly, perhaps in a couple of
milliseconds. We expect that the oscilloscope in Figure 10.1-1 will display the steady-state response of
the linear circuit to the input provided by the function generator.
Suppose we select a sinusoidal input. The function generator permits us to adjust the
amplitude, phase angle, and frequency of the input. We notice that no matter what adjustments we
make, the (steady-state) response is always a sine wave at the same frequency as the input. The
amplitude and phase angle of the output differ from the input, but the frequency is always the
same.
Suppose we select a square wave input. The steady-state response is not a square wave. Similarly,
the steady-state responses to pulse waves and triangular waves do not have the same shape as the input.
Linear circuits with sinusoidal inputs that are at steady state are called ac circuits. The electric
power system that provides us with convenient electricity is a very large ac circuit. AC circuits are the
subject of this chapter. In particular, we will see that:
 It’s useful to associate a complex number with a sinusoid. Doing so allows us to deﬁne phasors
and impedances.
 Using phasors and impedances, we obtain a new representation of the linear circuit, called the
“frequency-domain representation.”
 We can analyze ac circuits in the frequency domain to determine their steady-state response.

10.2
S i n u s o i d a l S o u r c e s
In this chapter, we will begin to consider electric circuits in which the source voltage or source current is
sinusoidal. Such circuits play a prominent role in both communication systems and in power systems.
There are so many important applications of these circuits that it is difﬁcult to overstate their
importance.
Consider a circuit having sinusoidal inputs. The inputs to a circuit are the independent voltage
source voltages and the independent current source currents, so we are considering a circuit having
sinusoidal source voltages and source currents. For now, assume that all of the sinusoidal inputs have
the same frequency. Later we will consider the case where the inputs have different frequencies.
In Chapters 8 and 9, we’ve seen that the output or response of such a circuit consists of the sum of
the natural response and the forced response, for example,
v tð Þ ¼ v n tð Þ þ v f tð Þ
When all of the inputs to the circuit are sinusoids having the same frequency, the forced response vf(t) is
also a sinusoid having the same frequency as the inputs. As time goes on, the transient part of the
response dies out. The part of the response that is left is called the steady-state response. Once the
transient part of the response has died out, we say that the circuit is “at steady state.” In the case of
sinusoidal inputs having the same frequency, the steady-state response is equal to the forced response, a
sinusoid at the input frequency.
We can choose the output of our circuit to be any voltage or current that is of interest to us. We
conclude that when a circuit satisﬁes the two conditions that (1) all
of the inputs are sinusoidal and have the same frequency and
(2) the circuit is at steady state, then all of the currents and voltages
are sinusoidal and have the same frequency as the inputs. Tradi-
tionally, sinusoidal currents have been called alternating currents
(ac) and circuits that satisfy the above conditions are called ac
circuits.
To summarize, an ac circuit is a steady-state circuit in which
all of the inputs are sinusoidal and have the same frequency. All of
the currents and voltages of an ac circuit are sinusoidal at the input
frequency.

shown in Figure 10.2-1. The parameter A in Eq. 10.2-1 and also in Figure 10.2-1
is called the amplitude of the sinusoid. The sinusoid is a periodic function deﬁned
by the property
v t þ T
ð
Þ ¼ v tð Þ
ð10:2-2Þ
for all time. The constant T is called the “period of oscillation” or just the
“period.” The reciprocal of T deﬁnes the frequency or number of cycles per
second, denoted by f, where
f ¼ 1

ð10:2-3Þ
The units of frequency are hertz (Hz) in honor of the scientist Heinrich Hertz,
shown in Figure 10.2-2. The angular frequency of the sinusoidal function is
o ¼ 2pf ¼ 2p
T
ð10:2-4Þ
The units of angular frequency are radians per second.
Next, consider the effect of replacing t by t + ta where ta is some arbitrary
constant time. As shown in Figure 10.2-3, v(t + t a) is a sinusoid that is identical
to v(t) except that v(t + t a) is advanced from v(t) by time ta. We have

sinusoid A sin(ot + y). The phase angle in radians is related to
the time ta by
y ¼ ot a ¼ 2p
T t a ¼ 2p t a
T
ð10:2-5Þ
Similarly, replacing t by t – td produces a sinusoid that
is identical to v(t) except that v(t  td) is delayed from v(t) by
time td. We have

Notice that an advance or delay of a full period leaves a sinusoid unchanged, that is v(t  T) = v(t).
Consequently, an advance by time ta is equivalent to a delay by time T– ta. Similarly, a delay by time td
is equivalent to an advance by time T– td.

To compare the phase angles of v1(t) and v2(t) we need to express both using the same trigonometric function.

graphically. This problem is frequently encountered by
engineers and engineering students in the laboratory. Fre-
quently, an engineer will see a sinusoidal voltage displayed
on an oscilloscope and need to represent that voltage using
an equation. The analytic representation of the sinusoid is
obtained in three steps. The ﬁrst two are straightforward. The
third requires some attention. The procedure is illustrated in
Figure 10.2-5, which shows two sinusoidal voltages.

Measure the amplitude, A. The location of the time axis
may not be obvious when the sinusoidal voltage is
displayed on an oscilloscope, so it may be more conve-
nient to measure the peak-to-peak amplitude 2A as
shown in Figure 10.2-5.

P h a s o r s a n d S i n u s o i d s
A current or voltage in an ac circuit is a sinusoid at the input frequency. Such a current or voltage is
characterized by its amplitude and phase angle.
A phasor is a complex number that is used to represent the amplitude and phase angle of a
sinusoid. The relationship between the sinusoid and the phasor is described by
A cos ot þ y
ð
Þ
$
Aﬀy
ð10:3-1Þ
There are a couple of things that we should notice. First, the sinusoid is represented using the cosine
rather than the sine function. Second, the phasor is a complex number represented in polar form. The
magnitude of the phasor is equal to the amplitude of the sinusoid, and the angle of the phasor is equal to
the phase angle of the sinusoid.
Example 10.3-1 illustrates a convention that we will use to name the sinusoids and phasors
associated with currents and voltages in ac circuits. We will use lowercase i and v to indicate a
sinusoidal current or voltage, often with a subscript. Often, as in Example 10.3-1, we will explicitly
indicate that a sinusoid is function of time, but sometimes we will write i1 instead of i1(t). We will use
bold uppercase I and V to indicate the corresponding phasor current or voltage with the same subscript.
In general, the phasors are functions of the input frequency. In an ac circuit, the input frequency is ﬁxed
and we often shorten I1(o) to I1.
Figure 10.3-1a shows the phasor as a complex number V, represented by a point in the complex
plane. In Figure 10.3-1a, a line segment is drawn from the origin of the complex plane to the point
representing the phasor. The angle of this line segment y, measured counter-clockwise from the real
axis, is the angle of the phasor. The length of the line segment A is called the magnitude of the phasor.
The polar form represents the phasor in terms of its magnitude and angle. To indicate that A is the
magnitude of the phasor V and that y is the angle of V, we write
A ¼ V

10. Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis

Figure 10.3-1b shows an alternate representation of
the phasor V. As before, V is represented by a point in the
complex plane. In Figure 10.3-1b, the real numbers a and b
are identiﬁed by the projections of the point onto the real
and imaginary axis. Consequently, a is called the real part
of V and b is called the imaginary part of V. We write
a ¼ Re V
f g and b ¼ Im V
f g

and represent V as a complex number in rectangular form as
V ¼ a þ jb

Figure 10.3-2 shows a phasor V with Re{V} < 0. Notice that y, not f, is the angle of V.

Next, consider doing arithmetic with phasors. Suppose we have two phasors, V1 and V2, each
represented in both rectangular and polar forms. That is
V1 ¼ a þ jb ¼ Eﬀy and V2 ¼ c þ jd ¼ Fﬀf
where, for example, a and b, the real and imaginary parts of V1, can be calculated from E and y, the
magnitude and angle of V1, using Eq. 10.3-5. Phasors are added using the rectangular forms of the
phasors as follows:

10. Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis

Two phasors, V1 and V2, are equal to each other if and only if one of the following two conditions
is satisﬁed:
1.
Both Re{V1} = Re{V2} and Im{V1} = Im{V2}.
2.
Both |V1| = |V2| and ﬀV1 ¼ﬀV2.
(Conditions 1 and 2 are not independent. If V1 = V2, then both conditions are satisﬁed. If either
condition is satisﬁed, then V1 = V2 and the other condition is also satisﬁed.)
The use of phasors to represent sinusoids is based on Euler’s formula. Euler’s formula is
e j f ¼ cos f þ j sin f
ð10:3-12Þ
Consequently,
Ae j f ¼ A cos f þ jA sin f
Using Eqs. 10.3-4 and 10.3-5, we have
A cos f þ jA sin f ¼ Aﬀf
Consequently,
Ae j f ¼ Aﬀf
ð10:3-13Þ
Ae jf is called the exponential form of a phasor. The conversion between the polar and exponential
forms is immediate. In both, A is the amplitude of the sinusoid and f is the phase angle of the sinusoid.

Figure 10.4-6 shows the “frequency domain representation” of the
circuit from Figure 10.4-5. In contrast, Figure 10.4-5 shows the “time do-
main representation” of the circuit. Notice that in the time domain, voltage
and currents are represented as sinusoids, while in the frequency domain,
voltages and currents are represented as phasors. In the time domain, resistors,
capacitors, and inductors are represented by their resistance, capacitance, or
inductance, while in the frequency domain, resistors, capacitors, and inductors
are represented by their impedance.
Figure 10.4-6 summarizes the information used to solve Example 10.4-1.
First, we apply KVL to Figure 10.4-6 to obtain Eq. 10.4-10. Next, we apply
“Ohm’s law for ac circuits” in Figure 10.4-6 to obtain Eq. 10.4-11. Solving Eq. 10.4-11, using complex
arithmetic, produces the phasor corresponding to the current i(t).

INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.5-6a. The input
to the circuit is the voltage of the voltage source vs(t),
and the output is the voltage across the 4-V resistor,
vo(t). When the input is vs tð Þ ¼ 8:93 cos 2t þ 54

the corresponding output is vo tð Þ ¼ 3:83 cos 2tþ

Solution
The input voltage is a sinusoid. The output voltage is
also sinusoid and has the same frequency as the input
voltage. Apparently, the circuit has reached steady
state. Consequently, the circuit in Figure 10.5-6a can
be represented in the frequency domain, using phasors and impedances. Figure 10.5-6b shows the frequency-
domain representation of the circuit from Figure 10.5-6a. The voltages Vs(o), Va(o), and Vo(o) in Figure 10.5-6b
are the phasors corresponding to vs(t), va(t), and vo(t) from Figure 10.5-6a. The capacitor and the resistors are
represented as impedances in Figure 10.5-6b. The impedance of the capacitor is j1=oC ¼ j1=2C where 2 rad/s

We can analyze an ac circuit by writing and solving a set of simultaneous equations. Two methods, the
node equations and the mesh equations, are quite popular. Before writing either the node equations or
mesh equations, we represent the ac circuit in the frequency domain using phasors and impedances.
The node equations are a set of simultaneous equations in which the unknowns are the node
voltages. We write the node equations by
1.
Expressing the element voltages and currents (for example, the current and voltage of an
impedance) in terms of the node voltages.
2.
Applying KCL at the nodes of the ac circuit.
After writing and solving the node equations, we can determine all of the voltages and currents of the ac
circuit using Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws.

The voltages across the impedances are labeled as Va, Vb, Vc, Vd, Ve, and Vo in Figure 10.6-9. Each of these

In this section, we will determine the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits of an ac circuit.
Figure 10.7-1 illustrates the use of Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits. In Figure 10.7-1a, an
ac circuit is partitioned into two parts—circuit A and circuit B—that are connected at a single pair of
terminals. (This is the only connection between circuits A and B. In particular, if the overall circuit
contains a dependent source, then either both parts of that dependent source must be in circuit A or both
parts must be in circuit B.) In Figure 10.7-1b, circuit A is replaced by its Thevenin equivalent circuit,
which consists of a voltage source in series with an impedance. In Figure 10.7-1c, circuit A is replaced
by its Norton equivalent circuit, which consists of a current source in parallel with an impedance.
Replacing circuit A by its Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit does not change the voltage or current
of any element in circuit B. This means that if you looked at a list of the values of the currents and
voltages of all the circuit elements in circuit B, you could not tell whether circuit B was connected to
circuit A or connected to its Thevenin equivalent or connected to its Norton equivalent circuit.
Finding the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit of circuit A involves three parameters: the
open-circuit voltage Voc, the short-circuit current Isc, and the Thevenin impedance Zt. Figure 10.7-2

10. Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis

illustrates the meaning of these three parameters. In Figure 10.7-2a, an open circuit is connected across
the terminals of circuit A. The voltage across that open circuit is the open-circuit voltage Voc. In
Figure 10.7-2b, a short circuit is connected across the terminals of circuit A. The current in that short
circuit is the short-circuit current, Isc.
Figure 10.7-2c indicates that the Thevenin impedance, Zt, is the equivalent impedance of circuit
A*. Circuit A* is formed from circuit A by replacing all the independent voltage sources by short
circuits and replacing all the independent current sources by open circuits. (Dependent current and
voltage sources are not replaced with open circuits or short circuits.) Frequently, the Thevenin
impedance Zt can be determined by repeatedly replacing series or parallel impedances by equivalent
impedances.
The open-circuit voltage Voc, the short-circuit current Isc, and the Thevenin impedance Zt, are
related by the equation

We begin by representing the circuit from Figure 10.7-3 in the frequency domain, using phasors and impedance.
The result, shown in Figure 10.7-4, corresponds to circuit A in Figures 10.7-1 and 10.7-2.
Next, we determine the open-circuit voltage using the circuit shown in Figure 10.7-5a. In Figure 10.7-5a, an
open circuit is connected across the terminals of the circuit from Figure 10.7-3. The voltage across that open circuit

from the circuit in Figure 10.7-4 by setting the input to zero. In the present case, there is only one input, the voltage
of the independent voltage source. A zero voltage source is equivalent to a short circuit. Consequently, the voltage
source in Figure 10.7-4 is replaced by a short circuit in Figure 10.7-5b. Replacing series or parallel impedances by

The circuit in Figure 10.7-7 is already represented in the frequency domain. This circuit corresponds to circuit A in

Next, we determine the open-circuit voltage using the circuit shown in Figure 10.7-8.
In Figure 10.7-8, an open circuit is connected across the terminals of circuit. The voltage across that open

The circuits connected to Circuit B in Figure 10.7-11a and b are equivalent to each other. The
circuit in Figure 10.7-11b is the Norton equivalent of the circuit in Figure 10.7-11a, and the circuit in
Figure 10.7-11a is the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Figure 10.7-11b. Consequently, we can
replace a series combination of a voltage source and impedance by a parallel combination of a current
source and an impedance, or vice versa, without changing the value of any current or voltage in circuit
B. This equivalence is commonly referred to as a source transformation. The following example
illustrates the utility of source transformations.

10. Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis

10.8
S u p e r p o s i t i o n
Suppose we encounter a circuit that is at steady state and all of its inputs are sinusoidal but not all of the
input sinusoid have the same frequency. Such a circuit is not an ac circuit and the currents and voltages
will not be sinusoidal. We can analyze this circuit using the principle of superposition.
The principle of superposition says that the output of a linear circuit due to several inputs working
together is equal to the sum of the outputs working separately. The inputs to the circuit are the voltages
of the independent voltage sources and the currents of the independent current sources.
When we set all but one input to zero, the other inputs become 0-V voltage sources and 0-A
current sources. Because 0-V voltage sources are equivalent to short circuits and 0-A current sources are
equivalent to open circuits, we replace the sources corresponding to the other inputs by open or short
circuits. We are left with a steady-state circuit having a single sinusoidal input. Such a circuit is an ac
circuit and we analyze it using phasors and impedances.
Thus, we use superposition to replace a circuit involving several sinusoidal inputs at different
frequencies by several circuits each having a single sinusoidal input. We analyze each of the several ac
circuits using phasors and impedances to obtain its sinusoidal output. The sum of those several
sinusoidal outputs will be identical to the output of the original circuit. The following example
illustrates this procedure.

Solution
The voltage vo(t) is caused by two sinusoidal sources, one having a frequency of 50 rad/s and the other having a
frequency of 10 rad/s. Let vo1(t) be the part of vo(t) caused by the 50 rad/s source acting alone, and let vo2(t) be
the part of vo(t) caused by the 10 rad/s source acting alone. Figure 10.8-2a shows the circuit used to calculate vo1(t).
The 10 rad/s source has been replaced by a 0-V voltage source represented as a short circuit. Similarly,
Figure 10.8-2b shows the circuit used to calculate vo2(t). In Figure 10.8-2b it is the 50 rad/s source that has
been replaced by a 0-V voltage source represented as a short circuit.
Both of the circuits in Figure 10.8-2 are ac circuits since they are at steady state and have a single sinusoidal
input. Figures 10.8-3a and b show the frequency domain representations of these ac circuits. Notice, for example,
that the value of impedance of the 150 mH inductor is j 7.5 V in Figure 10.8-3a because the input frequency is
50 rad/s but it is j 1.5-V in Figure 10.8-3a because the input frequency is 10 rad/s.

The discussion in the prior sections considered the behavior of operational ampliﬁers and their
associated circuits in the time domain. In this section, we consider the behavior of operational ampliﬁers
and associated RLC circuits in the frequency domain, using phasors.
Figure 10.10-1 shows two frequently used operational ampliﬁer circuits, the inverting ampliﬁer
and the noninverting ampliﬁer. These circuits are represented using impedances and phasors. This
representation is appropriate when the input is sinusoidal and the circuit is at steady state. Vs is the
phasor corresponding to a sinusoidal input voltage, and Vo is the phasor representing the resulting
sinusoidal output voltage. Both circuits involve two impedances, Z1 and Z2.

Next, we consider circuits with sinusoidal inputs that are subject to abrupt changes, as when a switch
opens or closes. To ﬁnd the complete response of such circuits, we:
 Represent the circuit by a differential equation.
 Find the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation. This solution is the natural
response vn(t). The natural response will contain unknown constants that will be evaluated later.
 Find a particular solution of the differential equation. This solution is the forced response vf (t).
 Represent the response of the circuit as v tð Þ ¼ vn tð Þ þ vf tð Þ.
 Use the initial conditions, for example, the initial values of the currents in inductors and the voltages
across capacitors to evaluate the unknown constants.
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.11-1. Before time t ¼ 0, this circuit is at
steady state, so all its voltages and currents are sinusoidal with a frequency of 5 rad/s.
At time t ¼ 0, the switch closes, disturbing the circuit. Immediately after t ¼ 0, the
currents and voltages are not sinusoidal. Eventually, the disturbance dies out and
the circuit is again at steady state (most likely a different steady state). Once again, the
currents and voltages are all sinusoidal with a frequency of 5 rad/s.
Two different steady-state responses are used to ﬁnd the complete response
of this circuit. The steady-state response before the switch closes is used to determine
the initial condition. The steady-state response after the switch closes is used as
the particular solution of the differential equation representing the circuit.

Determine v(t), the voltage across the capacitor in Figure 10.11-1, both before and after the switch closes.
Solution
Step 1: For t < 0, the switch is open and the circuit is at steady state.
The open switch acts like an open circuit, so the two 2-V resistors are connected in series. Replacing the
series resistors with an equivalent resistor produces the circuit shown in Figure 10.11-2a. Next, we use impedances
and phasors to represent the circuit in the frequency domain as shown in Figure 10.11-2b.

The capacitor voltage is continuous, so the capacitor voltage immediately after the switch closes is the same as
immediately before the switch closes. That is,
v 0þ
ð
Þ ¼ v 0
ð
Þ ¼ 6 V
Step 2: For t > 0, the switch is closed. Eventually, the circuit will reach a new steady state.
The closed switch acts like a short circuit. A short circuit in parallel with a resistor is equivalent to a short
circuit, so we have the circuit shown in Figure 10.11-3a. The steady-state response of the circuit can be obtained by
representing the circuit in the frequency domain as shown in Figure 10.11-3b.

Step 3: Immediately after t ¼ 0, the switch is closed but the
circuit is not at steady state. We must ﬁnd the complete
response of a ﬁrst-order circuit.
In Figure 10.11-2a, the capacitor is connected to a series
voltage source and resistor, that is, a Thevenin equivalent
circuit. We can identify Rt and voc as shown in Figure 10.11-4.
Consequently, the time constant of the circuit is

Solution
In this example, we consider similar circuits in contrasting situations. In some cases, the circuit changes abruptly at
time t ¼ 0. Consequently, the circuit is not at steady state and we seek a complete response—consisting of both a
steady-state part and a transient part. In other cases, there is no abrupt change and so no transient part of the
response. We seek only the steady-state response. In one case, the input provides the inductor voltage directly, and
we can determine the response using the constitutive equation of the inductor.
Case 1: The circuit in Figure 10.11-6a will be at steady state until time t ¼ 0. Because the input is constant before time
t ¼ 0, all of the element voltages and currents will be constant. At time t ¼ 0, the input changes abruptly, disturbing the
steady state. Eventually the disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. All of the element voltages and
currents will again be constant, but they will have different constant values because the input has changed.
The three stages can be illustrated as shown
in Figure 10.11-7. Figure 10.11-7a represents the
circuit for t < 0. The source voltage is constant
and the circuit is at steady state, so the inductor
acts like a short circuit. The inductor current is

Figure 10.11-7b represents the circuit immediately after t ¼ 0. The input is constant but the circuit is not at
steady state, so the inductor does not act like a short circuit. The part of the circuit that is connected to the inductor
has the form of a Thevenin equivalent circuit, so we recognize that
Rt ¼ 6 V

The exponential part of i(t) has become negligible, so we recognize that the circuit is again at steady state and that

Figure 10.11-7c represents the circuit after the disturbance has died out and the circuit has reached steady
state, that is, when t > 5t. The source voltage is constant and the circuit is at steady state, so the inductor acts like a
short circuit. As expected, the inductor current is 2 A.
Case 2: The circuit in Figure 10.11-6b does not contain a switch and the input
does not change abruptly, so we expect the circuit to be at steady state. The input is
sinusoidal at a frequency of 5 rad/s, so all of the element currents and voltages will
be sinusoidal at a frequency of 5 rad/s. We can ﬁnd the steady-state response by
representing the circuit in the frequency domain, using impedances and phasors as
shown in Figure 10.11-8.

disturbing the steady state. Eventually the disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. All of the

Case 6: We expect that the circuit in Figure 10.11-6f will be at steady state before the switch opens. As before,
opening the switch will change the circuit and disturb the steady state. Eventually, the disturbance will die out and
the circuit will again be at steady state. We will see that the steady-state current is constant before the switch opens
and sinusoidal after the switch opens.
Figure 10.11-10a shows the circuit before the switch opens. Applying KVL gives

Analysis of steady-state linear circuits with sinusoidal inputs using phasors and impedances requires
complex arithmetic. MATLAB can be used to reduce the effort required to do this complex
arithmetic. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 10.12-1a. The input to this circuit, vs(t), is a

To use PSpice to analyze an ac circuit, we do the following:
1.
Draw the circuit in the OrCAD Capture workspace.
2.
Specify a AC Sweep\Noise simulation.
3.
Run the simulation.
4.
Open an output ﬁle to view the simulation results.
Table 10.13-1 shows some PSpice parts used to analyze ac circuits. When simulating ac
circuits, we will represent independent voltage and current sources using the PSpice parts VAC and
IAC, respectively. These PSpice parts each have properties named ACMAG and ACPHASE. We
will edit the value of these properties to specify the amplitude and phase angle of a sinusoid.
(Consequently, ACMAG and ACPHASE also represent the magnitude and phase angle of the phasor
corresponding to the sinusoid.)

We will add the PSpice parts VPRINT1, VPRINT2, and IPRINT from Table 10.13-1 to specify
those current and voltage values that PSpice is to print into the output ﬁle. Each of these PSpice parts has
properties named AC, REAL, IMAG, MAG, and PHASE. We will edit the value of each of these

Solution
We begin by drawing the circuit in the OrCAD workspace as shown in Figure 10.13-2 (see Appendix A). Notice
that we have used the PSpice parts VAC and IAC from Table 10.13-1 to represent the sources. Also, we have edited
the ACMAG and ACPHASE properties of these sources, setting ACMAG ¼12 and ACPHASE ¼ 15 for the
voltage source and ACMAG ¼ 1.5 and ACPHASE ¼ 135 for the current source.
Figure 10.13-2 also shows that we have added PSpice parts VPRINT1, IPRINT, and VPRINT2 to measure
v1, i2, and v3. These printers are connected to the circuit in the same way that ammeters and voltmeters would
be connected to measure v1, i2, and v3. Notice the minus sign on the VPRINT2 printer. It indicates the
terminal near the minus sign of the polarity of the measured voltage. Similarly, the current measured by
the IPRINT printer is the current directed toward the terminal marked by the minus sign. The minus sign
on the VPRINT1 printer can be ignored. This printer measures the node voltage at the node to which it is
connected.
We will perform a AC Sweep\Noise simulation. (Select Pspice\New Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD
Capture menu bar; then select AC Sweep\Noise from the Analysis Type drop-down list. Set both the Start

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.
After we run the simulation, OrCAD Capture will open a Schematics window. Select View\Output File from
the menu bar on the Schematics window. Scroll down through the output ﬁle to ﬁnd the printer voltage and

This output requires some interpretation. The labels VM, VP, VR, and VI indicate the magnitude, angle, real part,

imaginary part of a current. The labels N614, N256, and N761 are node numbers generated by PSpice. VM(N615)
refers to the voltage at a single node, that is, the node voltage v1. IM(V_PRINT2) refers to a current, that is, i2. VM

Because the right-hand side is not equal to the left-hand side, V1 and V2 do not satisfy the node equation. That
means that the selected order of v1(t) and v2(t) is not correct. Instead, use the reverse order so that
v1 tð Þ ¼ 4:39 cos 100t  37:88

Because the right-hand side is very close to equal to the left-hand side, V1 and V2 satisfy the ﬁrst node equation.
That means that v1(t) and v2(t) are probably correct. To be certain, we will also check the second node equation.
Substituting the phasors V1 and V2 into the left-hand side of the second node equation gives

Deﬁne the Situation and the Assumptions
The input and output sinusoids have different amplitudes and phase angles but the same frequency:
f ¼ 1000 Hz
or, equivalently,
o ¼ 2p1000 rad/s
We now know that this must be the case. When the input to a linear circuit is a sinusoid, the steady-state output will
also be a sinusoid having the same frequency.
In this case, the input sinusoid is
v1 tð Þ ¼ sin 2p1000t
ð
Þ ¼ cos 2p1000t  90
ð
Þ V
and the corresponding phasor is
V1 ¼ 1ej90 ¼ 1ﬀ90 V
The output sinusoid is
v2 tð Þ ¼ 2 sin 2p1000t þ 120
ð
Þ ¼ 2 cos 2p1000t þ 30

and the corresponding phasor is
V2 ¼ 2e j30 V
The ratio of these phasors is
V2

The magnitude of this ratio, called the gain G, of the circuit used to transform the input sinusoid into the output

The angle of this ratio is called the phase shift y of the required circuit:

Therefore, we need a circuit that has a gain of 2 and a phase shift of 120.
State the Goal
Determine whether it is possible to design the circuit shown in Figure 10.15-1b to have a gain of 2 and a phase shift
of 120. If it is possible, specify the appropriate values of R1, R2, and C.
Generate a Plan
Analyze the circuit shown in Figure 10.15-1b to determine the ratio of the output phasor to the input phasor, V2=V1.
Determine whether this circuit can have a gain of 2 and a phase shift of 120. If so, determine the required values of
R1, R2, and C.
Act on the Plan
The circuit in Figure 10.15-1b is a special case of the circuit shown in Figure 10.10-1. The impedance Z1 in Figure
10.10-1 corresponds to the resistor R1 in Figure 10.15-1b, and impedance Z2 corresponds to the parallel
combination of resistor R2 and capacitor C. That is,
Z1 ¼ R1

Z2 ¼ R2 1=joC

These equations can be used to design the circuit. First, pick a convenient, readily available, and inexpensive value

With the pervasive use of ac electric power in the home and
industry, it is important for engineers to analyze circuits with
sinusoidal independent sources.
The steady-state response of a linear circuit to a sinusoidal
input is itself a sinusoid having the same frequency as the
input signal.
Circuits that contain inductors and capacitors are represented
by differential equations. When the input to the circuit is
sinusoidal, the phasors and impedances can be used to repre-
sent the circuit in the frequency domain. In the frequency
domain, the circuit is represented by algebraic equations. The
original circuit, represented by a differential equation, is called
the time-domain representation of the circuit.
The steady-state response of a linear circuit with a sinusoidal
input is obtained as follows:
1. Transform the circuit into the frequency domain, using
phasors and impedances.
2. Represent the frequency-domain circuit by algebraic
equations, for example, mesh or node equations.
3. Solve the algebraic equations to obtain the response of
the circuit.
4. Transform the response into the time domain, using
phasors.
Table 10.16-1 summarizes the relationships used to trans-
form a circuit from the time domain to the frequency domain
or vice versa.
When a circuit contains several sinusoidal sources, we
distinguish two cases.
1. When all of the sinusoidal sources have the same
frequency, the response will be a sinusoid with that
frequency, and the problem can be solved in the same
way that it would be if there was only one source.
2. When the sinusoidal sources have different frequencies,
superposition is used to break the time-domain circuit up
into several circuits, each with sinusoidal inputs all at the
same frequency. Each of the separate circuits is analyzed
separatelyandtheresponsesaresummedinthetimedomain.
MATLAB greatly reduces the computational burden associ-
ated with solving mesh or node equations having complex
coefﬁcients.

A commercial airliner has sensing devices to
indicate to the cockpit crew that each door and baggage hatch is
closed. A device called a search coil magnetometer, also known
as a proximity sensor, provides a signal indicative of the
proximity of metal or other conducting material to an inductive
sense coil. The inductance of the sense coil changes as the
metal gets closer to the sense coil. The sense coil inductance is
compared to a reference coil inductance with a circuit called a

In this chapter, we continue our study of ac circuits. In particular, we will see the following:
 The power supplied or received by any element of an ac circuit can be conveniently calculated after
representing the circuit in the frequency domain.
Power in ac circuits is an important topic. Engineers have developed an extensive
vocabulary to describe power in an ac circuit. We’ll encounter average power, real and reactive
power, complex power, the power factor, rms values, and more.
 AC circuits that contain coupled inductors and/or ideal transformers can be conveniently analyzed in
the frequency domain.
Both coupled inductors and ideal transformers consist of magnetically coupled coils.
(Coils may be tightly coupled or loosely coupled. The coils of an ideal transformer are
perfectly coupled.) After representing coupled inductors and transformers in the frequency
domain, we will be able to analyze ac circuits containing these devices.
11.2
E l e c t r i c P o w e r
Human civilization’s progress has been enhanced by society’s ability to control and distribute energy.
Electricity serves as a carrier of energy to the user. Energy present in a fossil fuel or a nuclear fuel is
converted to electric power to transport and readily distribute it to customers. By means of transmission
lines, electric power is transmitted and distributed to essentially all the residences, industries, and
commercial buildings in the United States and Canada.
Electric power may be transported readily with low attendant losses, and improved methods for
safe handling of electric power have been developed over the past 90 years. Furthermore, methods of
converting fossil fuels to electric power are well developed, economical, and safe.
Means of converting solar and nuclear energy to electric power are currently in various stages of
development or of proven safety. Geothermal energy, tidal energy, and wind energy may also be
converted to electric power. The kinetic energy of falling water may readily be used to generate
hydroelectric power.
504

The necessity of transmitting electrical power over long distances fostered the development of
ac high-voltage power lines from power plant to end user. A modern transmission line is shown in
Figure 11.2-1.
Electric energy generation uses original sources such as hydropower, coal, and nuclear energy.
An example of a large hydroelectric power project is shown in Figure 11.2-2. A typical hydroelectric
power plant can generate 1000 MW. On the other hand, many regions are turning to small generators
such as the wind-power device shown in Figure 11.2-3. A typical wind-power machine may be capable
of generating 75 kW.
A unique element of the American power system is its interconnectedness. Although the power
system of the United States consists of many independent companies, it is interconnected by large
transmission facilities. An electric utility is often able to save money by buying electricity from another
utility and by transmitting the energy over the transmission lines of a third utility.
The power levels for selected electrical devices or phenomena are shown in Figure 11.2-4.

Electrical engineers talk about several types of power, for example, instantaneous power, average power,
andcomplexpower.Wewillstartwithanexaminationoftheinstantaneouspower,whichistheproductof
the time-domain voltage and current associated with one or more circuit elements. The instantaneous
power is likely to be a complicated function of time. This prompts us to look for a simpler measure of the
power generated and absorbed in a circuit element, such as the average power.
Consider the circuit element shown in Figure 11.3-1. Notice that the element voltage
v(t) and the element current i(t) adhere to the passive convention. The instantaneous power delivered
to this circuit element is the product of the voltage v(t) and the current i(t), so that
p tð Þ ¼ v tð Þ i tð Þ
ð11:3-1Þ
The unit of power is watts (W). We can always calculate the instantaneous power because no
restrictions have been placed on either v(t) or i(t). The instantaneous power can be a quite complicated
function of t when v(t) or i(t) is itself a complicated function of t.

Instantaneous Power and Average Power
505

Suppose that the voltage v(t) is a periodic function having period T. That is,
v tð Þ ¼ v t þ T
ð
Þ
because the voltage repeats every T seconds. Then, for a linear circuit, the current will also be a periodic
function having the same period, so
i tð Þ ¼ i t þ T
ð
Þ
Therefore, the instantaneous power is
p tð Þ ¼ v tð Þi tð Þ
¼ v t þ T
ð
Þi t þ T
ð
Þ
The average value of a periodic function is the integral of the time function over a complete period,
divided by the period. We use a capital P to denote average power and a lowercase p to denote
instantaneous power. Therefore, the average power P is given by
P ¼ 1

The voltage available from a wall plug in a residence is said to be 110 V. Of course, this is not the
average value of the sinusoidal voltage because we know that the average would be zero. It is also not
the instantaneous value or the maximum value, Vm, of the voltage v ¼ Vm cos ot.
The effective value of a voltage is a measure of its effectiveness in delivering power to a load
resistor. The concept of an effective value comes from a desire to have a sinusoidal voltage (or current)
deliver toaloadresistorthesame average power asanequivalent dcvoltage(orcurrent). The goal istoﬁnd
a dc Veff (or Ieff) that will deliver the same average power to the resistor as would be delivered by a
periodically varying source, as shown in Figure 11.4-1.

where Ieff is the dc current that will deliver the same power as the periodically varying current. That is,
Ieff is deﬁned as the steady (constant) current that is as effective in delivering power as the periodically

Why is the average power delivered to the inductor equal to zero? The angle of the element voltage is 90 larger

The angle of the inductor voltage will always be 90 larger than the angle of the inductor current. Therefore, the
average power delivered to any inductor is zero.

We see that Ieff is the square root of the mean of the squared value. Thus, the effective current Ieff is
commonly called the root-mean-square current Irms.
The effective value of a current is the steady current (dc) that transfers the same average power as
the given varying current.
Of course, the effective value of the voltage in a circuit is similarly found from the equation

because the integral of cos 2ot is zero over the period T. Remember that Eq. 11.4-4 is true only for
sinusoidal currents.
In practice, we must be careful to determine whether a sinusoidal voltage is expressed in terms of
its effective value or its maximum value Im. In the case of power transmission and use in the home, the
voltage is said to be 110 V or 220 V, and it is understood that these values refer to the rms or effective
values of the sinusoidal voltage.
In electronics or communications circuits, the voltage could be described as 10 V, and the person
is typically indicating the maximum or peak amplitude Vm. Henceforth, we will use Vm as the peak
value and Vrms as the rms value. Sometimes it is necessary to distinguish Vrms from Vm by the context in
which the voltage is given.

Suppose that alinear circuitwith asinusoidal input isat steadystate. All the element voltagesandcurrents
will be sinusoidal, with the same frequency as the input. Such a circuit can be analyzed in the frequency
domain, using phasors and impedances. Indeed, we can calculate the power generated or absorbed in a
circuit or in any element of a circuit, in the frequency domain, using phasors and impedances.
Figure 11.5-1 represents the voltage and current of an element in both the time domain
and the frequency domain. Notice that the element current and voltage adhere to the passive convention.
In a previous section, the instantaneous power and the average power were calculated from the time-
domain representations of the element current and voltage v(t) or i(t). In contrast, we now turn our
attention to the frequency-domain representations of the element current and voltage

P o w e r F a c t o r
In this section, as in the previous section, we consider a linear circuit with a sinusoidal input that is at
steady state. All the element voltages and currents will be sinusoidal and will have the same frequency
as the input. Such a circuit can be analyzed in the frequency domain, using phasors. In particular, we can
calculate the power generated or absorbed in a circuit or in any element of a circuit, in the frequency
domain, using phasors and impedances.
Recall that in Section 11.5 we showed that the average power absorbed by the element shown in
Figure 11.5-1 is
P ¼ VmIm
2
cos yV  yI
ð
Þ
and that the apparent power is
jSj ¼ VmIm
2
The ratio of the average power to the apparent power is called the power factor (pf ). The power factor
is calculated as
pf ¼ cos yV  yI
ð
Þ
The angle yV  yI
ð
Þ is often referred to as the power factor angle. The average power absorbed by the
element shown in Figure 11.5-1 can be expressed as
P ¼ VmIm
2
pf
ð11:6-1Þ
The cosine is an even function, that is, cos (y) ¼ cos (y). So
pf ¼ cos yV  yI
ð
Þ ¼ cos yI  yV
ð
Þ
This causes a small difﬁculty. We can’t calculate yV  yI from pf without some additional information.
For example, suppose pf ¼ 0:8. We calculate
36:87 ¼ cos1 0:8
ð
Þ
but that’s not enough to determine yV  yI uniquely. Because the cosine is even, both cos (36.87) ¼
0.8 and cos (36.87) ¼ 0.8, so either yV  yI ¼ 36:87 or yV  yI ¼ 36:87. This difﬁculty is
resolved by labeling the power factor as leading or lagging. When yV  yI > 0, the power factor is said
to be lagging, and when yV  yI < 0, the power factor is said to be leading. If the power factor is
speciﬁed to be 0.8 leading, then yV  yI ¼ 36:87. On the other hand, if the power factor is speciﬁed
to be 0.8 lagging, then yV  yI ¼ 36:87.
The signiﬁcance of the power factor is illustrated by the
circuit shown in Figure 11.6-1. This circuit models the transmis-
sion of electric power from a power utility company to a
customer. The customer’s load is connected to the power com-
pany’s power plant by a transmission line. Typically, the cus-
tomer requires power at a speciﬁed voltage. The power company
must supply both the power used by the customer and the power
absorbed by the transmission line. The power absorbed by the
transmission line is lost; it doesn’t do anybody any good, and we
want to minimize it.
The circuit in Figure 11.6-2 models the transmission of
electric power from a power utility company to a customer in the
frequency domain, using impedances and phasors. Our objective

is to ﬁnd a way to reduce the power absorbed
by the transmission line. In this situation, it is
likely that we cannot change the transmission
line, so we can’t change R1 or joL1. Similarly,
because the customer requires a speciﬁed
average power at a speciﬁed voltage, we
can’t change Vm or P. In the following analy-
sis, we leave R1, L1, Vm, and P as variables for
the sake of generality. We won’t need to repeat
the analysis later if we encounter a similar
situation with a different customer and a dif-
ferent transmission line. We will see that it is
possible to adjust the power factor by adding a
compensating impedance to the customer’s load. We will leave the power factor pf as a variable in our
analysis because we plan to vary the power factor to reduce the power absorbed by the load.
The impedance of the line is

Because the customer requires power at a speciﬁed voltage, we will treat the voltage across the load, Vm,
and the average power delivered to the load, P, as known quantities. Recall from Eq. 11.6-1 that
P ¼ VmIm
2
pf
Solving for Im gives
Im ¼
2P
Vm pf
so
PLINE ¼ 2

Increasing pf will reduce the power absorbed in the transmission line. The power factor is the cosine of
an angle, so its maximum value is 1. Notice that pf ¼ 1 occurs when yV ¼ yI, that is, when the load
appears to be resistive.
In Figure 11.6-3, a compensating impedance has been attached across the terminals of the
customer’s load. We plan to use this impedance to adjust the power factor of the customer’s load. Because
it is to the advantage of both the power
company and the user to keep the
power factor of a load as close to
unity as feasible, we say that we are
correcting the power factor of the
load. We will denote the corrected
power factor as pfc and the corre-
sponding phase angle as yC. That is,
pfc ¼ cos yC

ance of the load as

11. AC Steady-State Power

Similarly, we can represent the impedance of the compensating impedance as
ZC ¼ RC þ jXC
Because Z is connected to draw a current I, the power delivered to Z will remain P. The beneﬁt of the
parallel impedance is that the parallel combination appears as the load to the source, and IL is the current
that ﬂows through the transmission line. We want ZC to absorb no average power. Therefore, we choose
a reactive element so that
ZC ¼ jXC
The impedance of the parallel combination, ZP, is
ZP ¼
ZZC

The parallel impedance may be written as
ZP ¼ RP þ jXP ¼ ZPﬀyP

Parallel Loads
A customer’s plant has two parallel loads connected to the power utility’s distribution lines. The ﬁrst load consists
of 50 kW of heating and is resistive. The second load is a set of motors that operate at 0.86 lagging power factor.
The motors’ load is 100 kVA. Power is supplied to the plant at 10,000 volts rms. Determine the total current ﬂowing
from the utility’s lines into the plant and the plant’s overall power factor.
Solution
Figure 11.6-4a summarizes what is known about this power system.
First, consider the heating load. Because this load is resistive, the reactive power is zero. Therefore,
S1 ¼ P1 ¼ 50 kW
Next, consider the motors. The power factor is lagging, so y2 > 0:

The complex power absorbed by the motors is

Solution
The phase angle of the impedance is y ¼ 45, so the original load has a lagging power factor with
cos y ¼ cos 45 ¼ 0:707
First, we wish to correct the pf so that pfc ¼ 0.95 lagging. Then, we use Eq. 11.6-5 as follows:

Because the uncorrected power factor is lagging, we can alternatively use Eq. 11.6-7 to determine C. For

The power factor of the impedance of the series connection of the resistor and inductor can be calculated from
I(o) and the voltage across the impedance. That voltage is VR(o) þ Vo(o), which is calculated by applying

Average power is conserved. In this example, that means that the average power supplied by the voltage
source must be equal to the sum of the average powers received by the resistor and the inductor. This fact
provides a check on the accuracy of our calculations.

In this section, let us consider the case when the circuit contains two or more sources. For example,
consider the circuit shown in Figure 11.7-1a with two sinusoidal voltage sources. The principle of
superposition states that the response to both sources acting together is equal to the sum of the responses
to each voltage source acting alone. The application of the principle of superposition is illustrated in
Figure 11.7-1b, where i1 is the response to source 1 acting alone, and the response i2 is the response to
source 2 acting alone. The total response is

When Eq. 11.7-3 is satisﬁed, then Eq. 11.7-2 reduces to

This equation states that the average power delivered to the resistor by both sources acting together is
equal to the sum of the average power delivered to the resistor by each voltage source acting alone. This
is the principle of power superposition. Notice that the principle of power superposition is valid only
when Eq. 11.7-3 is satisﬁed.
Now let us determine under what conditions Eq. 11.7-3 is satisﬁed. Let the radian frequency for
the ﬁrst source be mo, and let the radian frequency for the second source be no. The currents can be

The Power Superposition Principle
527

Therefore, in summary, the superposition of average power states that the average power
delivered to a circuit by several sinusoidal sources, acting together, is equal to the sum of the average
power delivered to the circuit by each source acting alone, if, and only if, no two of the sources have the
same frequency. Similar arguments show that superposition can be used to calculate the reactive power
or the complex power delivered to a circuit by several sinusoidal sources, provided again that no two
sources have the same frequency.
If two or more sources are operating at the same frequency, the principle of power superposition is
not valid, but the principle of superposition remains valid. In this case, we use the principle of
superposition to ﬁnd each phasor current and then add the currents to obtain the total phasor current

response is i ¼ i1 þ i2. In Figure 11.7-2c, the circuits from Figure 11.7-2b are represented in the frequency domain,
using impedances and phasors.
Now consider the two cases.

Notice that both superposition and power superposition were used in this case. First, superposition was used to
calculate I1(o) and I2(o). Next, P1 was calculated using I1(o), and P2 was calculated using I2(o). Finally, power
superposition was used to calculate P from P1 and P2.
Case 2: Analysis of the circuits in Figure 11.7-2c gives
I1 o
ð Þ ¼ 1:2ﬀ53 A
and
I2 o

The average power absorbed by the resistor is

In Chapter 5, we proved that for a resistive network, maximum power is transferred from a source to a load
when the load resistance is set equal to the Thevenin resistance of the Thevenin equivalent source. Now let
us consider a circuit represented by a Thevenin equivalent circuit for a sinusoidal steady-state circuit, as
shown in Figure 11.8-1, when the load is ZL.

The value of RL that maximizes P is determined by taking the derivative dP/dRL and setting it

Consequently, we have

Thus, the maximum power transfer from a circuit with a Thevenin equivalent circuit with an

The concept of self-inductance was introduced in Chapter 7. We commonly use the term inductance for
self-inductance, and we are familiar with circuits that have inductors. In this section, we consider
coupled inductors, which are useful in circuits with sinusoidal steady-state (ac) voltages and currents
and are also widely used in electronic circuits.
Coupled inductors, or coupled coils, are magnetic devices that consist of two or more
multiturn coils wound on a common core.
Figure 11.9-1a shows two coils of wire wrapped around a magnetic core. These coils are said to
be magnetically coupled. A voltage applied to one coil, as shown in Figure 11.9-1a, causes a voltage
across the second coil. Here’s why. The input voltage v1(t) causes a current i1(t) in coil 1. The current
and voltage are related by
v1 ¼ L1
di1
dt
ð11:9-1Þ
where L1 is the self-inductance of coil 1. The current i1(t) causes a ﬂux in the magnetic core. This ﬂux is
related to the current by
f ¼ c1N1i1
ð11:9-2Þ
Then the maximum power transferred can be obtained by noting that
I ¼ 10ﬀ0

where c1 is a constant that depends on the magnetic properties and geometry of the core, and N1 is the
number of turns in coil 1. The number of turns in a coil indicates the number of times the wire is

ð11:9-5Þ
where cM is a constant that depends on the magnetic properties and geometry of the core, N2 is
the number of turns in the second coil, and M ¼ cMN1N2 is a positive number called the
mutual inductance. The unit of mutual inductance is the henry, H.
The polarity of the voltage v2, compared to the polarity of v1, depends on the way in which
the coils are wrapped on the core. There are two distinct cases, and they are shown in Figures
11.9-1a,b. The difference between these two ﬁgures is the direction in which coil 2 is wrapped
aroundthecore.A dotconventionisused toindicatetheway the coilshavebeen wrapped onthe
coil. Notice that one end of each coil is marked with a dot. When the reference direction of the
current of one coil enters the dotted end of that coil, the reference polarity of the induced voltage
is positive at the dotted end of the other coil. For example, in Figures 11.9-1a, b, the reference
direction of the current i1 enters the dotted end of the left coil. Consequently, in Figures 11.9-1a,
b, the + sign of the reference polarity of v2 is located at the dotted end of the right coil.
The circuit symbol that is used to represent coupled inductors is shown in Figure 11.9-2
with the dots shown and the mutual inductance identiﬁed as M. Two cases are shown in
Figure 11.9-2. In Figure 11.9-2a, both coil currents enter the dotted ends of the coils. In Figure
11.9-2b, one current, i1, enters the dotted end of a coil, but the other current, i2, enters the
undotted end on the coil. In both cases, the reference directions of the voltage and current of
each coil adhere to the passive convention.

11. AC Steady-State Power

Suppose both coil currents enter the dotted ends of the coils, as in Figure 11.9-1a, or both coil
currents enter the undotted ends of the coils. The voltage across the ﬁrst coil, v1, is related to the coil
currents by
v1 ¼ L1

ð11:9-6Þ
Similarly, the voltage across the second coil is related to the coil currents by
v2 ¼ L2

ð11:9-7Þ
In contrast, suppose one coil current enters the dotted end of a coil while the other coil current
enters the undotted end of a coil, as in Figure 11.9-2b. The voltage across the ﬁrst coil, v1, is related to
the coil currents by
v1 ¼ L1

ð11:9-8Þ
Similarly, the voltage across the second coil is related to the coil currents by

ð11:9-9Þ
Thus, the mutual inductance can be seen to induce a voltage in a coil due to the current in the other coil.
Coupled inductors can be modeled using inductors (without coupling) and dependent sources.
Figure 11.9-3 shows an equivalent circuit for coupled inductors.
The use of coupled inductors is usually limited to non-dc applications because coils behave as
short circuits for a steady current.
Suppose that coupled inductors are part of a linear circuit with a sinusoidal input and that the
circuit is at steady state. Such a circuit can be analyzed in the frequency domain, using phasors. The
coupled inductors shown in Figure 11.9-2a are represented by the phasor equations

and

than or equal to zero. The limiting quantity for M is obtained when w ¼ 0 in Eq. 11.9-17. Then we have

Therefore, the coupling coefﬁcient of passive coupled inductors can be no larger than 1. In
addition, the coupling coefﬁcient cannot be negative because L1, L2, and M are all nonnegative. When
k ¼ 0, no coupling exists. Therefore, the coupling coefﬁcient must satisfy

ð11:9-20Þ
Most power system transformers have a k that approaches 1, whereas k is low for radio circuits.

Figure 11.9-4a shows coupled inductors used as a transformer to connect a source to a load. The
coil connected to the source is called the primary coil, and the coil connected to the load is called the
secondary coil. Circuit 2 is connected to circuit 1 through the magnetic coupling of the transformer, but
there is no electrical connection between these two circuits. For example, there is no path for current to
ﬂow from circuit 1 to circuit 2. In addition, no circuit element is connected between a node of circuit 1
and a node of circuit 2.
Figure 11.9-4b shows a speciﬁc example of the situation shown in Figure 11.9-4a. The source is a
single sinusoidal voltage source, and the load is a single impedance. The circuit has been represented in
the frequency domain, using phasors and impedances. The circuit in Figure 11.9-4b can be analyzed by
writing mesh equations. The two mesh equations are

One major use of transformers is in ac power distribution. Transformers possess the ability to step up or
step down ac voltages or currents. Transformers are used by power utilities to raise (step up) the voltage
from 10 kV at a generating plant to 200 kV or higher for transmission over long distances. Then, at a
receiving plant, transformers are used to reduce (step down) the voltage to 220 or 110 V for use by the
customer (Coltman, 1988).
In addition to power systems, transformers are commonly used in electronic and communica-
tion circuits. They provide the ability to raise or reduce voltages and to isolate one circuit from
another.
One of the coils, typically drawn on the left of the diagram of a transformer, is designated as the
primary coil, and the other is called the secondary coil or winding. The primary coil is connected to the
energy source, and the secondary coil is connected to the load.

The Ideal Transformer
539

An ideal transformer is a model of a transformer with a coupling coefﬁcient equal to unity.
The symbol for the ideal transformer is shown in Figure 11.10-1, where N1 and N2 are the number of
turns in the primary and secondary coils. The time-domain representation of the transformer is shown in
Figure 11.10-1a. In the time domain, the two deﬁning equations for an ideal transformer are

v1 tð Þ
ð11:10-1Þ
and
i1 tð Þ ¼  N2
N1
i2 tð Þ
ð11:10-2Þ
where N2=N1 ¼ n is called the turns ratio of the transformer. The use of transformers is usually limited
to non-dc applications because the primary and secondary windings behave as short circuits for a steady
current.
The frequency-domain representation of the transformer is shown in Figure 11.10-1b. The
operation of the ideal transformer is the same in the time domain as in the frequency domain. In the
frequency domain, the two deﬁning equations for an ideal transformer are
V2 ¼ N2

11. AC Steady-State Power

Notice that the voltage and current of both coils of the transformer in Figure 11.10-1 adhere to
the passive convention. The instantaneous power absorbed by the ideal transformer is
p tð Þ ¼ v1 tð Þi1 tð Þ þ v2 tð Þi2 tð Þ ¼ v1 tð Þ ni2 tð Þ
ð
Þ þ nv1 tð Þ
ð
Þi2 tð Þ ¼ 0
ð11:10-5Þ
The ideal transformer is said to be lossless because instantaneous power absorbed by it is zero.
A similar argument shows that the ideal transformer absorbs zero complex power, zero
average power, and zero reactive power.
Figure 11.10-3 shows an ideal transformer that is used to connect a source to a load. The coil
connected to the source is called the primary coil, and the coil connected to the load is called the
secondary coil. Circuit 2 is connected to circuit 1 through the magnetic coupling of the transformer, but
there is no electrical connection between these two circuits. Because the ideal transformer is lossless, all
of the power delivered to the ideal transformer by circuit 1 is in turn delivered to circuit 2 by the ideal
transformer.
Let us consider the circuit of Figure 11.10-4, which has a load impedance Z2 magnetically
coupled to a voltage source, using an ideal transformer.
The input impedance of the circuit connected to the voltage source is
Z1 ¼ V1
I1
Z1 is called the impedance, seen at the primary of the transformer, or the impedance, seen by the
voltage source.
Using Eqs. 11.10-3 and 11.10-4, we can express Z1 as
Z 1 ¼
N1
N2 V2
 N2
N1 I 2
¼  N1
N2

2 V2

The current and voltage of the load impedance, V2 and I2, do not adhere to the passive
convention, so
V2 ¼ Z 2 I 2
Therefore, for Z1, we have
Z 1 ¼
N1
N2

2
Z 2
The source experiences the impedance Z1, which is equal to Z2 scaled by the factor (N 1/N 2)2. We
sometimes say that Z1 is the impedance Z2 reﬂected to the primary of the transformer.

The Ideal Transformer
541

Suppose we are going to connect a load impedance to a source. If we connect the load
impedance directly to the source, then the source sees the load impedance Z2. In contrast, if we
connect the load impedance to the source, using an ideal transformer, the source sees the impedance
Z1. In this context, we say that the transformer has changed the impedance seen by the source from
Z2 to Z1.
We can formalize this result as the circuit equivalence illustrated in Figure 11.10-5.
Figure 11.10-5a shows circuit 1 connected to the left-hand coil of an ideal transformer. An
impedance, Z(o), is connected in parallel with the right-hand coil of the ideal transformer. In
Figure 11.10-5b, the ideal transformer and impedance have been replaced by a single equivalent
impedance, Zeq(o). The equivalent impedance is related to the original impedance by

I(o) and V(o), are the same in Figure 11.10-5b as they are in Figure 11.10-5a. We can determine
the values of I(o) and V(o) in Figure 11.10-5a by calculating values of I(o) and V(o) in Figure

INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE
The input to the circuit shown in Figure 11.10-7 is the voltage of the voltage source vs(t). The output is the voltage
across the 9-H inductor, vo(t). Determine the output voltage vo(t).
Solution
The input voltage is a sinusoid. The output voltage is also a sinusoid and has the same frequency as the input
voltage. Apparently, the circuit is at steady state. Consequently, the circuit in Figure 11.10-7 can be represented in
the frequency domain, using phasors and impedances. Figure 11.10-8 shows the frequency-domain representation
of the circuit from Figure 11.10-7.
In Figure 11.10-8, the impedance of the inductor is connected in series with the impedance of the 30-V
resistor. This series impedance is connected in parallel with the right-hand coil of the transformer. Replace the
transformer and the series impedance with the equivalent impedance, as shown in Figure 11.10-9. The equivalent

In Figure 11.10-9, the impedance of the 8-V resistor is connected in series with the equivalent impedance
Zeq(o). The current I(o) is the current in this series impedance, and Vs(o) is the voltage across the series
impedance. Applying Ohm’s law gives

Because the circuits in Figures 11.10-8 and 11.10-9 are equivalent, the current I(o) in Figure 11.10-10 is also
given by Eq. 11.10-6. Figure 11.10-10 shows the circuit from Figure 11.10-8 redrawn with the current I(o) labeled.
Also, the current in the right-hand coil of the transformer has been labeled as I2(o). Because I(o) and I2(o)
are the currents in the coils of the ideal transformer, they are related by the equations describing the transformer:

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

How Can We Check Power
in AC Circuits?
The circuit shown in Figure 11.11-1a has been analyzed using a computer, and the results are tabulated in Figure
11.11-1b. The labels Xp and Xs refer to the primary and secondary coils of the transformer. The passive convention
is used for all elements, including the voltage sources, which means that

is the average power absorbed by the voltage source. The average power supplied by the voltage source is
þ18.00 W.
How can we check that the computer analysis of this circuit is indeed correct?
Solution
Several things can be easily checked.
(1)
The element current and voltage of each inductor should be 90 out of phase with each other so that the
average power delivered to each inductor is zero. The element current and voltage of both L1 and L2 satisfy
this condition.
(2)
An ideal transformer absorbs zero average power. The sum of the average power absorbed by the
transformer primary and the secondary is

(3)
All of the power delivered to the primary of the transformer is in turn delivered to the load. In this example,
the load consists of the inductor L2 and the resistor R2. Because the average power delivered to the inductor
is zero, all the power delivered to the transformer primary should be delivered by the secondary to the
resistor R2. The power delivered to the transformer primary is

There seems to be some roundoff error in the voltages and currents provided by the computer. Nonetheless, it
seems reasonable to conclude that all the power delivered to the transformer primary is delivered by the
secondary to the resistor R2.
(4)
The average power supplied by the voltage source should be equal to the average power absorbed by the
resistors. We have already calculated that the average power delivered by the voltage source is 18 W. The
average power absorbed by the resistors is

so this condition is satisﬁed.
Because these four conditions are satisﬁed, we are conﬁdent that the computer analysis of the circuit is correct.

Maximum Power Transfer
The matching network in Figure 11.12-1 is used to interface the source with the load, which means that the
matching network is used to connect the source to the load in a desirable way. In this case, the purpose of the
matching network is to transfer as much power as possible to the load. This problem occurs frequently enough that
it has been given a name, the maximum power transfer problem.
An important example of the application of maximum power transfer is the connection of a cellular phone or
wireless radio transmitter to the cell’s antenna. For example, the input impedance of a practical cellular telephone
antenna is Z ¼ (10 þ j6.28) V.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
The input voltage is a sinusoidal function of time. The circuit is at steady state. The matching network is to be
designed to deliver as much power as possible to the load.

For maximum power transfer, the impedance Zin, shown in Figure 11.12-2, must be the complex conjugate of Zs.
That is,
Zin ¼ Z*
s ¼ 1  j 0:628 V
Generate a Plan
Let us use a transformer for the matching network as shown in Figure 11.12-3. The impedance Zin will be a function
of n, the turns ratio of the transformer. We will set Zin equal to the complex conjugate of Zs and solve the resulting
equation to determine the turns ratio, n.

satisfy Eq. 11.12-2.

S U M M A R Y
With the adoption of ac power as the generally used conven-
tional power for industry and the home, engineers became
involved in analyzing ac power relationships.
The instantaneous power delivered to this circuit element is
the product of the element voltage and current. Let v(t) and
i(t) be the element voltage and current, chosen to adhere to
the passive convention. Then p(t) ¼ v(t) i(t) is the instanta-
neous power delivered to this circuit element. Instantaneous
power is calculated in the time domain.
The instantaneous power can be a quite complicated function
of t. When the element voltage and current are periodic
functions having the same period, T, it is convenient to
calculate the average power P ¼ 1

constant (dc) voltage that delivers the same average power as
the given varying voltage.
Consider a linear circuit with a sinusoidal input that has
reached steady state. All the element voltages and currents
will be sinusoidal, with the same frequency as the input. Such
a circuit can be analyzed in the frequency domain, using
phasors and impedances. Indeed, we can calculate the power
generated or absorbed in a circuit or in any element of a
circuit, in the frequency domain, using phasors. Table 11.5.1
summarizes the equations used to calculate average power,
complex power, or reactive power in the frequency domain.
BecauseitisimportanttokeepthecurrentIassmallaspossible
in the transmission lines, engineers strive to achieve a power
factor close to 1. The power factor is equal to cos y, where y is
the phase angle difference between the sinusoidal steady-state
load voltage and current. A purely reactive impedance in
parallel with the load is used to correct the power factor.
Finally, we considered the coupled coils and transformers.
Coupled inductors and transformers exhibit mutual inductance,
which relates the voltage in one coil to the change in current in
another coil. The equations that describe coupled coils and
transformers are collected in Tables 11.13-1 and 11.13-2.

makes contact with the circuit. Some types of test equipment,
however, are supplied by voltages that can be hazardous or
have dangerous voltage outputs. The standard power supply
used in the United States for power and lighting in laboratories
is the 120, grounded, 60-Hz sinusoidal supply. This supply

I n t r o d u c t i o n
In this chapter, we will begin to analyze three-phase circuits. These circuits consist of three parts:
a three-phase source, a three-phase load, and a transmission line. The three-phase source consists
of either three Y-connected sinusoidal voltage sources or three D-connected sinusoidal voltage
sources. Similarly, the circuit elements that comprise the load are connected to form either a Y or
a D. The transmission line is used to connect the source to the load and consists of either three or four
wires. These circuits are described using names that identify the way in which the source and the load
are connected. For example, the circuit shown in Figure 12.3-1 has a Y-connected three-phase source
and a Y-connected load. The circuit in Figure 12.3-1 is called a Y-to-Y circuit. The circuit in Figure
12.5-1 has a Y-connected three-phase source and a D-connected load. The circuit in Figure 12.5-1 is
called a Y-to-D circuit.
Notice that the Y-to-Y circuit in Figure 12.3-1 has been represented in the frequency domain,
using impedances and phasors. This is appropriate because the three voltage sources that comprise a
three-phase source are sinusoidal sources having the same frequency. Analysis of three-phase
circuits using phasors and impedances will determine the steady-state response of the three-phase
circuit.
Before beginning our analysis of three-phase circuits, it is helpful to recall why it is advantageous
to use phasors to ﬁnd the steady-state response of linear circuits to sinusoidal inputs. Circuits that
contain capacitors or inductors are represented by differential equations in the time domain. We can
solve these differential equations, but it is a lot of work. Impedances and phasors represent the circuit in
the frequency domain. Linear circuits are represented by algebraic equations in the frequency domain.
These algebraic equations involve complex numbers, but they are still easier to solve than the
differential equations. Solving these algebraic equations provides the phasor corresponding to the
output voltage or current. We know that the steady-state output voltage or current will be sinusoidal and
will have the same frequency as the input sinusoid. The magnitude and phase angle of the phasor
corresponding to the output voltage or current provide the magnitude and phase angle of the output
sinusoid.
We will be particularly interested in the power the three-phase source delivers to the three-
phase load. Table 12.1-1 summarizes the formulas that can be used to calculate the power delivered
to an element when the element voltage and current adhere to the passive convention. Table 12.1-1
also provides the equations for the sinusoidal element current and voltage. In the table, Im and Vm
568

are the magnitudes of the sinusoidal current and voltage, whereas Irms and Vrms are the
corresponding effective values of the current and voltage. Notice that the formulas for
power in terms of Irms and Vrms are simpler than the corresponding formulas in terms of Im and
Vm. In contrast, the equations giving the sinusoidal voltage and current are simpler when Im and Vm
are used. When engineers are interested primarily in power, they are likely to use Irms and Vrms.
On the other hand, when engineers are interested primarily in the sinusoidal currents and voltages,
they are likely to use Im and Vm. In this chapter, we are interested mainly in power and will use
effective values.

The generation and transmission of electrical power are more efﬁcient in polyphase systems
employing combinations of two, three, or more sinusoidal voltages. In addition, polyphase circuits
and machines possess some unique advantages. For example, the power transmitted in a three-phase
circuit is constant or independent of time rather than pulsating, as it is in a single-phase circuit. In
addition, three-phase motors start and run much better than do single-phase motors. The most
common form of polyphase system employs three balanced voltages, equal in magnitude and
differing in phase by 360=3 ¼ 120.
An elementary ac generator consists of a rotating magnet and a stationary winding. The turns
of the winding are spread along the periphery of the machine. The voltage generated in each turn of
the winding is slightly out of phase with the voltage generated in its neighbor because it is cut
by maximum magnetic ﬂux density an instant earlier or later. The voltage produced in the ﬁrst
winding is vaa0.
If the ﬁrst winding were continued around the machine, the voltage generated in the last turn
would be 180 out of phase with that in the ﬁrst, and they would cancel, producing no useful effect.
For this reason, one winding is commonly spread over no more than one-third of the periphery; the
other two-thirds of the periphery can hold two more windings used to generate two other similar
voltages. A simpliﬁed version of three windings around the periphery of a cylindrical drum is shown
in Figure 12.2-1a. The three sinusoids (sinusoids are obtained with a proper winding distribution
and magnet shape) generated by the three similar windings are shown in Figure 12.2-1b. Deﬁning vaa0
as the potential of terminal a with respect to terminal a0, we describe the voltages as

A three-phase circuit generates, distributes, and uses energy in the form of three
voltages equal in magnitude and symmetric in phase.
The three similar portions of a three-phase system are called phases. Because the
voltage in phase aa0 reaches its maximum ﬁrst, followed by that in phase bb0 and then by that
in phase cc0, we say the phase rotation is abc. This is an arbitrary convention; for any given
generator, the phase rotation may be reversed by reversing the direction of rotation. The six-
terminal ac generator is shown in Figure 12.2-2.
Using phasor notation, we may write Eq. 12.2-1 as
Vaa0 ¼ Vmﬀ0
Vbb0 ¼ Vmﬀ120
Vcc0 ¼ Vmﬀ240 ¼ Vmﬀ120
ð12:2-2Þ
The three voltages are said to be balanced voltages because they have identical amplitude
Vm and frequency o and are out of phase with each other by exactly 120. The phasor
diagram of the balanced three-phase voltages is shown in Figure 12.2-3. Examining
Figure 12.2-3, we ﬁnd
Vaa0 þ Vbb0 þ Vcc0 ¼ 0
ð12:2-3Þ
For notational ease, we henceforth use Vaa0 ¼ Va, Vbb0 ¼ Vb, and Vcc0 ¼ Vc as the three
voltages.
The positive phase sequence is abc, as shown in Figure 12.2-3. The sequence acb is
called the negative phase sequence, as shown in Figure 12.2-4.

12. Three-Phase Circuits

Often, the phase voltage in the Y connection is written as
Va ¼ Vmﬀ0
where Vm is the magnitude of the phase voltage.
Referring to the generator of Figure 12.2-2, there are six terminals and three voltages, va, vb,
and vc. We use phasor notation and assume that each phase winding provides a source voltage in
series with a negligible impedance. Under these assumptions, there are two ways of interconnecting
the three sources, as shown in Figure 12.2-5. The common terminal of the Y connection is called the
neutral terminal and is labeled n. The neutral terminal may or may not be available for connection.
Balanced loads result in no current in a neutral wire, and thus it is often not needed.
The connection shown in Figure 12.2-5a is called the Y connection, and the D connection is shown in
Figure 12.2-5b. The Y connection selects terminals a0, b0, and c0 and connects them together as neutral. Then
the line-to-line voltage Vab of the Y-connected sources is
Vab ¼ Va  Vb
ð12:2-4Þ
as is evident by examining Figure 12.2-5a. Because Va ¼ Vmﬀ0 and Vb ¼ Vmﬀ120, we have

Consider the Y-to-Y circuit shown in Figure 12.3-1. This three-phase circuit consists of three parts: a three-
phase source, a three-phase load, and a transmission line. The three-phase source consists of three Y-
connected sinusoidal voltage sources. The impedances that comprise the load are connected to form a Y. The
transmission line used to connect the source to the load consists of four wires, including a wire connecting the
neutralnodeofthesourcetotheneutralnodeoftheload.Figure12.3-2showsanotherY-to-Ycircuit.InFigure
12.3-2,thethree-phasesourceisconnectedtotheloadusingthreewires,withoutawireconnectingtheneutral
node of the source to the neutral node of the load. To distinguish between these circuits, the circuit in Figure
12.3-1 is called a four-wire Y-to-Y circuit, whereas the circuit in Figure 12.3-2 is called a three-wire Y-to-Y
circuit.
Analysis of the four-wire Y-to-Y circuit in Figure 12.3-1 is relatively easy. Each impedance of the
three-phase load is connected directly across a voltage source of the three-phase source. Therefore, the
voltage across the impedance is known, and the line currents are easily calculated as
IaA ¼ Va
ZA
;
IbB ¼ Vb
ZB

and
IcC ¼ Vc

ð12:3-2Þ
The average power delivered by the three-phase source to the three-phase load is calculated by
adding up the average power delivered to each impedance of the load.
P ¼ PA þ PB þ PC
ð12:3-3Þ
where, for example, PA is the average power absorbed by ZA. PA is easily calculated once IaA is known.
For convenience, let the phase voltages of the Y-connected source be
Va ¼ Vpﬀ0 V rms;
Vb ¼ Vpﬀ120 V rms;
and
Vc ¼ Vpﬀ120 V rms
Notice that we are using effective values because the units of Vp are V rms.
When ZA ¼ ZB ¼ ZC ¼ Z ¼ Zﬀy, the load is said to be a balanced load. In general, analysis of
balanced three-phase circuits is easier than analysis of unbalanced three-phase circuits. The line
currents in the balanced four-wire Y-to-Y circuit are given by

The line currents have equal magnitudes and differ in phase by 120. IbB and IcC can be calculated from
IaA by subtracting and adding 120 to the phase angle of IaA.

Because effective, or rms, values of the sinusoidal voltages and currents have been used instead of
peak values, the appropriate formulas for power are those given in the “rms values” column of Table
12.1-1. The average power delivered to the load is

where, for example, PA is the average power absorbed by ZA. Equal power is absorbed by each
impedance of the three-phase load ZA, ZB, and ZC. It is not necessary to calculate PA, PB, and PC
separately. The average power delivered to the load can be determined by calculating PA and
multiplying by 3.
Next, consider the three-wire Y-to-Y circuit shown in Figure 12.3-2. The phase voltages of
the Y-connected source are Va ¼ Vpﬀ0 V rms, Vb ¼ Vpﬀ120 V rms, and Vc ¼ Vpﬀ120 V rms.
The ﬁrst step in the analysis of this circuit is to calculate VNn, the voltage at the neutral node of the
three-phaseloadwithrespecttothevoltageattheneutralnodeofthethree-phasesource.(Thisstepwasn’t
needed when the four-wire Y-to-Y circuit was analyzed because the fourth wire forced VNn ¼ 0.) It is
convenient to select node n, the neutral node of the three-phase source, to be the reference node. Then Va,
Vb, Vc, and VNn are the node voltages of the circuit. Write a node equation at node N to get

The Y-to-Y Circuit

Analysis of the three-wire Y-to-Y circuit is much simpler when the circuit is balanced, that is,
when ZA ¼ ZB ¼ ZC ¼ Z ¼ Zﬀy. When the circuit is balanced, Eq. 12.3-8 becomes
VNn ¼ ðVPﬀ120ÞZZ þ ðVPﬀ120ÞZZ þ ðVPﬀ0ÞZZ
ZZ þ ZZ þ ZZ
¼ ½ðVPﬀ120Þ þ ðVPﬀ120Þ þ ðVPﬀ0Þ=3
VNn ¼ 0
ð12:3-10Þ
When a three-wire Y-to-Y circuit is balanced, it is not necessary to write and solve a node equation to ﬁnd
VNn because VNn is known to be zero. Recall that VNn ¼ 0 in the four-wire Y-to-Y circuit. The balanced
three-wire Y-to-Y circuit acts like the balanced four-wire Y-to-Y circuit. In particular, the line currents are
given by Eq. 12.3-4, and the average power delivered to the load is given by Eq. 12.3-6.
Ideally, the transmission line connecting the load to the source can be modeled using short
circuits. That’s what was done in both Figure 12.3-1 and Figure 12.3-2. Sometimes it is appropriate to
model the lines connecting the load to the source as impedances. For example, this is done when
comparing the power that is delivered to the load to the power that is absorbed by the transmission line.
Figure 12.3-3 shows a three-wire Y-to-Y circuit in which the transmission line is modeled by the line
impedances ZaA, ZbB, and ZcC. The line impedances do not signiﬁcantly complicate the analysis of the
circuit because each line impedance is connected in series with a load impedance. After replacing series
impedances by equivalent impedances, the analysis proceeds as before. If the circuit is not balanced, a
node equation is written and solved to determine VNn. Once VNn has been determined, the line currents
can be calculated. Both the power delivered to the load and the power absorbed by the line can be
calculated from the line currents and the load and line impedances.
Analysis of balanced Y-to-Y circuits is simpler than analysis of unbalanced Y-to-Y circuits in
several ways:
1.
VNn ¼ 0. It is not necessary to write and solve a node equation to determine VNn.
2.
The line currents have equal magnitudes and differ in phase by 120. IbB and IcC can be calculated
from IaA by subtracting and adding 120 to the phase angle of IaA.
3.
Equal power is absorbed by each impedance of the three-phase load ZA, ZB, and ZC. It is not
necessary to calculate PA, PB, and PC separately. The average power delivered to the load can be
determined by calculating PA and multiplying by 3.
The key to analysis of the balanced Y-to-Y circuit is calculation of the line current IaA. The per-phase
equivalent circuit provides the information needed to the line current IaA. This equivalent circuit consists of
the voltage source and impedances in one phase of the three phases of the three-phase circuit. Figure 12.3-4
shows the per-phase equivalent circuit corresponding to the three-phase circuit shown in Figure 12.3-3.

VNn ¼ 0 in a balanced Y-to-Y circuit. The per-phase equivalent circuit can be used to analyze either three-

Determine complex power delivered to the three-phase load of a three-wire Y-to-Y circuit such as the one shown in
Figure 12.3-2. The phase voltages of the Y-connected source are Va ¼ 110ﬀ0 V rms, Vb ¼ 110ﬀ120 V rms,
and Vc ¼ 110ﬀ120 V rms. The load impedances are ZA ¼ ZB ¼ ZC ¼ 50 þ j80 V.
Solution
This example is similar to Example 12.3-3. The important difference is that this three-phase circuit is balanced, so
VNn ¼ 0. It is not necessary to write and solve a node equation to determine VNn.
Balanced three-wire Y-to-Y circuits and balanced four-wire Y-to-Y circuits are analyzed in the same way.
We need to calculate only one line current, IaA, and the complex power Sa, delivered to only one of the load
impedances, ZA. The power delivered to the three-phase load is 3Sa.
The line current is calculated as
IaA ¼ Va
ZA

Figure 12.3-5a shows a balanced three-wire Y-to-Y circuit. Determine average power delivered by the three-phase
source, delivered to the three-phase load, and absorbed by the three-phase line.
Solution
The three-wire Y-to-Y circuit in Figure 12.3-5a looks different from the three-wire Y-to-Y circuit in Figure
12.3-2. One difference is cosmetic. The circuits are drawn differently, with all circuit elements drawn vertically or
horizontally in Figure 12.3-5a. A more important difference is that the circuit in Figure 12.3-2 is represented in the
frequency domain, using phasors and impedances, whereas the circuit in Figure 12.3-5a is represented in the time
domain. Because the circuit is represented in the time domain, the magnitude, rather than the effective value, of the
source voltage is given.
Because this three-phase circuit is balanced, it can be analyzed using a per-phase equivalent circuit. Figure
12.3-5b shows the appropriate per-phase equivalent circuit.

Reducing Line Losses
As noted in Example 12.3-5, 80 percent of the power supplied by the source is delivered to the load, and the other
20 percent is lost in the line. The loss in the line can be reduced by reducing the current in the line. Reducing the
current in the load would reduce the power delivered to the load. Transformers provide a way of reducing the line
current without reducing the load current.

12. Three-Phase Circuits

In this example, two three-phase transformers are added to the three-phase circuit considered in Example
12.3-5. A transformer at the source steps up the voltage and steps down the current. Conversely, a transformer at the
load steps down the voltage and steps up the current. Because the turns ratios of these transformers are reciprocals
of each other, the voltage and current at the load are unchanged. The current in the line will be reduced to reduce the
power lost in line. The line voltage will increase. The higher line voltage will require increased insulation and
increased attention to safety.
Figure 12.3-6a shows the per-phase equivalent circuit of the balanced three-wire Y-to-Y circuit that includes
the two transformers. Determine the average power delivered by the three-phase source, delivered to the three-
phase load, and absorbed by the three-phase line.
Solution
To analyze the per-phase equivalent circuit in Figure 12.3-6a, notice that
1.
The secondary voltage of the left-hand transformer is 10 times the primary voltage, that is, 1000 cos (377t).
2.
The impedance connected to the secondary of the right-hand transformer can be reﬂected to the primary of this
transformer by multiplying by 100. The result is a 4000-V resistor in series with a 4-H inductor.
These observations lead to the one-mesh circuit shown in Figure 12.3-6b. The mesh current in this circuit is the line
current of the three-phase circuit. This line current is calculated as

The D-connected source is shown in Figure 12.2-5b. This generator connection, however, is seldom
used in practice because any slight imbalance in magnitude or phase of the three-phase voltages will not
result in a zero sum. The result will be a large circulating current in the generator coils that will heat the
generator and depreciate the efﬁciency of the generator. For example, consider the condition
Vab ¼ 120ﬀ0
Vbc ¼ 120:1ﬀ121
Vca ¼ 120:2ﬀ121
ð12:4-1Þ
If the total resistance around the loop is 1 V, we can calculate the circulating current as

ð12:4-2Þ
which would be unacceptable.
Therefore, we will consider only a Y-connected source as practical at the source side and consider
both the D-connected load and the Y-connected load at the load side.
The D-to-Y and Y-to-D transformations convert D-connected loads to equivalent Y-connected
loads and vice versa. These transformations are summarized in Table 12.4-1. Given the impedances Z1,
Z2, Z3 of a D-connected load, Table 12.4-1 provides the formulas that are required to determine the
impedances ZA, ZB, ZC of the equivalent Y-connected load. These three-phase loads are said to
be equivalent because replacing the D-connected load by the Y-connected load will not change any of
the voltages or currents of the three-phase source or three-phase line.
The D-to-Y and Y-to-D transformations are signiﬁcantly simpler when the loads are balanced.
Suppose the D-connected load is balanced, that is, Z1 ¼ Z2 ¼ Z3 ¼ ZD. The equivalent Y-connected

Now, let us consider the Y-to-D circuit as shown in Figure 12.5-1. Applying KCL at the nodes of the
D-connected load shows that the relation between the line currents and phase currents is
IaA ¼ IAB  ICA
IbB ¼ IBC  IAB
and
IcC ¼ ICA  IBC
ð12:5-1Þ
The goal is to calculate the line and phase currents for the load.
The phase currents in the D-connected load can be calculated from the line-to-line voltages. These
line-to-line voltages appear directly across the impedances of the D-connected load. For example, VAB
appears across Z3, so

First, convert the Y-connected load to a D-connected load as shown in Figure 12.4-1b. Notice, for
example, that both of the D-connected loads in Figure 12.4-1b have an impedance connected
between terminals A and B. These impedances are in parallel and can be replaced by a single
equivalent impedance. Replace the parallel D-connected loads by a single equivalent D-connected load
as shown in Figure 12.4-1c. Finally, convert the D-connected load to a Y-connected load as shown in Figure

We have only two possible practical conﬁgurations for three-phase circuits, Y-to-Y and Y-to-D, and we
can convert the latter to a Y-to-Y form. Thus, a practical three-phase circuit can always be converted to
the Y-to-Y circuit.
Balanced circuits are easier to analyze than unbalanced circuits. Earlier, we saw that balanced
three-phase Y-to-Y circuits can be analyzed using a per-phase equivalent circuit.
The circuit shown in Figure 12.6-1a is a balanced Y-to-D circuit. Figure 12.6-1b shows the

Per-Phase Equivalent Circuit
Figure 12.6-1a shows a balanced Y-to-D three-phase circuit. The phase voltages of the Y-connected source are
Va ¼ 110ﬀ0 V rms, Vb ¼ 110ﬀ120 V rms, and Vc ¼ 110ﬀ120 V rms. The line impedances are each
ZL ¼ 10 þ j5 V. The impedances of the D-connected load are each ZD ¼ 75 þ j225 V. Determine the phase
currents in the D-connected load.

The line current IaA, calculated using the per-phase equivalent circuit, is also the line current IaA in the Y-to-

circuit have the same magnitude but differ in phase angle by 120. These line currents are

and

(To check the value of IbB, apply KVL to the loop in the Y-to-Y circuit that starts at node n, passes through nodes b,
B, N, and returns to node n. The resulting KVL equation is

The line currents of the Y-to-D circuit in Figure 12.6-1a are equal to the line currents of the Y-to-Y circuit in

12. Three-Phase Circuits

The instantaneous power delivered to a balanced three-phase load is a constant.
The total power delivered to a balanced three-phase load can be calculated using the per-phase
equivalent circuit. For example, we multiply the complex power delivered to a load in the per-phase
equivalent circuit by 3 to obtain the total complex power delivered to the corresponding balanced three-
phase load.
Consider, again, Figure 12.6-1. Figure 12.6-1a shows a balanced Y-to-D circuit. Figure
12.6-1b shows the equivalent Y-to-Y circuit, obtained using the D-to-Y transformation summarized
in Table 12.4-1. Figure 12.6-1c shows the per-phase equivalent circuit corresponding to the Y-to-Y
circuit. The voltage VAN ¼ VPﬀyAV and the current IaA ¼ ILﬀyAI are obtained using per-phase
equivalent circuit. The voltage VAN and the current IaA are the phase voltage and line current of the
Y-connected load in Figure 12.6-1b. The total average power delivered to the balanced Y-connected
load is given by

ð12:7-3Þ
where y is the angle between the phase voltage and the line current, cos y is the power factor, and VP and

In summary, the total average power delivered to the D-connected load in Figure 12.6-1a is equal
to the total average power delivered to the balanced Y-connected load in Figure 12.6-1b.
That’s appropriate because the two circuits are equivalent. Notice that the information required
to calculate the power delivered to a balanced load, Y or D, is obtained from the per-phase equivalent
circuit.

For many load conﬁgurations, for example, a three-phase motor, the phase current or voltage is
inaccessible. We may wish to measure power with a wattmeter connected to each phase. However,
because the phases are not available, we measure the line currents and the line-to-line voltages. A
wattmeter provides a reading of VLIL cos y where VL and IL are the rms magnitudes and y is the angle
between the line voltage V and the current I. We choose to measure VL and IL, the line voltage and
current, respectively. We will show that two wattmeters are sufﬁcient to read the power delivered to the
three-phase load, as shown in Figure 12.8-1. We use cc to denote current coil and vc to denote voltage
coil.

It’s worth noticing that the power supplied by the three-phase source does not depend on the unspeciﬁed angle f.
At this point, it may be convenient to specify that f ¼ 3:3 so that the Y-connected voltage sources will have phase
angles of 0, 120, and 120.

The power factor angle y of a balanced three-phase system may be determined from the reading of

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of

Solution
Because the three-phase circuit is balanced, it can be analyzed by using a per-phase equivalent circuit. The
appropriate per-phase equivalent circuit for this example is shown in Figure 12.9-2. This per-phase equivalent
circuit can be analyzed by writing a single-mesh equation:

These currents and voltages are the same as the values given in the computer analysis for the element currents and

Power Factor Correction
Figure 12.10-1 shows a three-phase circuit. The capacitors are added to improve the power factor of the load. We
need to determine the value of the capacitance C required to obtain a power factor of 0.9 lagging.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
1.
The circuit is excited by sinusoidal sources all having the same frequency, 60 Hz or 377 rad/s. The circuit is at
steady state. The circuit is a linear circuit. Phasors can be used to analyze this circuit.
2.
The circuit is a balanced three-phase circuit. A per-phase equivalent circuit can be used to analyze this circuit.
3.
The load consists of two parts. The part comprising resistors and inductors is connected as a Y.
The part comprising capacitors is connected as a D. A D-to-Y transformation can be used to simplify the load.
The per-phase equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 12.10-2.
State the Goal
Determine the value of C required to correct the power factor to 0.9 lagging.
Generate a Plan
Power factor correction was considered in Chapter 11. A formula was provided for calculating the reactance X1
needed to correct the power factor of a load
X1 ¼
R2 þ X2
R tan cos1 pfc
ð
Þ  X
where R and X are the real and imaginary parts of the load impedance before the power factor is corrected and pfc is
the corrected power factor. After this equation is used to calculate X1, the capacitance C can be calculated from X1.
Notice that X1 will be the reactance of the equivalent Y-connected capacitors. We will need to calculate the D-
connected capacitor equivalent of the Y-connected capacitor.

The generation and transmission of electrical power are more
efﬁcient in three-phase systems employing three voltages of
the same magnitude and frequency and differing in phase by
120 from each other.
The three-phase source consists of either three Y-connected
sinusoidal voltage sources or three D-connected sinusoidal
voltage sources. Similarly, the circuit elements that comprise
the load are connected to form either a Y or a D. The
transmission line connects the source to the load and consists
of either three or four wires.
Analysis of three-phase circuits using phasors and imped-
ances will determine the steady-state response of the three-
phase circuit. We are particularly interested in the power the
three-phase source delivers to the three-phase load. Table
12.1-1 summarizes the formulas that are used to calculate the
power delivered to an element when the element voltage and
current adhere to the passive convention.
ThecurrentintheneutralwireofabalancedY-to-Yconnectionis
zero; thus, the wire may be removed if desired. The key to the
analysisoftheY-to-Ycircuitisthecalculationofthelinecurrents.
When the circuit is not balanced, the ﬁrst step in the analysis of
this circuit is to calculate VNn, the voltage at the neutral node of
thethree-phaseloadwithrespecttothevoltageattheneutralnode
of the three-phase source. When the circuit is balanced, this step
isn’t needed because VNn ¼ 0. Once VNn is known, the line
currents can be calculated. The line current for a balanced Y-to-Y
connection is Va/Z for phase a, and the other two currents are
displaced by 120 from IA.
For a D load, we converted the D load to a Y-connected load
by using the relation D-to-Y transformation. Then we pro-
ceeded with the Y-to-Y analysis.
The line current for a balanced D load is
ﬃﬃﬃ
3
p
times the phase
current and is displaced 30 in phase. The line-to-line
voltage of a D load is equal to the phase voltage.
The power delivered to a balanced Y-connected load is PY ¼

and the phase current ðZY ¼ ZﬀyÞ.
The two-wattmeter method of measuring three-phase power
delivered to a load was described. Also, we considered the
usefulness of the two-wattmeter method for determining the
power factor angle of a three-phase system.
Act on the Plan
We note that Z ¼ R þ jX ¼ 20 þ j75:4 V. Therefore, the reactance X1 needed to correct the power factor is
X1 ¼
202 þ 75:42
20 tan cos1 0:9

Þ  75:4 ¼ 92:6
The Y-connected capacitor equivalent to the D-connected capacitor can be calculated from ZY ¼ ZD=3. Therefore,
the capacitance of the equivalent Y-connected capacitor is 3C.

I n t r o d u c t i o n
Consider the experiment illustrated in Figure 13.1-1. Here a function generator provides the input to a
linear circuit and the oscilloscope displays the output, or response, of the linear circuit. The linear circuit
itself consists of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and perhaps dependent sources and/or op amps. The
function generator allows us to choose from several types of input function.
Suppose we select a sinusoidal input. The function generator permits us to adjust the amplitude,
phase angle, and frequency of the input. First, we notice that no matter what adjustments we make, the
(steady-state) response is always a sine wave at the same frequency as the input. The amplitude and
phase angle of the output differ from the input, but the frequency is always the same as the frequency of
the input.
After a little more experimentation, we ﬁnd that at any ﬁxed frequency, the following are true:
 The ratio of the amplitude of the output sinusoid to the amplitude of the input sinusoid is a constant.
 The difference between the phase angle of the output sinusoid and the phase angle of the input
sinusoid is also constant.
The situation is not as simple when we vary the frequency of the input. Now the amplitude and
phase angle of the output change in a more complicated way.
In this chapter, we will develop analytical tools that enable us to predict how the amplitude and
phase angle of the output sinusoid will change as we vary the frequency of the input sinusoid.

Gain, phase shift, and the network function are properties of linear circuits that describe the effect a
circuit has on a sinusoidal input voltage or current. We expect that the behavior of circuits that contain
reactive elements, that is, capacitors or inductors, will depend on the frequency of the input sinusoid.
Thus, we expect that the gain, phase shift, and network function will all be functions of frequency.
Indeed, we will see that this is the case.
We begin by considering the circuit shown in Figure 13.2-1. The input to this circuit is the voltage
of the voltage source, and the output, or response, of the circuit is the voltage across the 10-kV resistor.
604

When the input is a sinusoidal voltage, the steady-state response will also be sinusoidal and will have
the same frequency as the input.
Suppose the voltages vin(t) and vout(t) are measured using an oscilloscope. Figure 13.2-2 shows
the waveforms that would be displayed on the screen of the oscilloscope. Notice that the scales are
shown, but the axes are not. It is customary to take the angle of the input signal to be 0, that is,
vin tð Þ ¼ A cos ot
Then,
vout tð Þ ¼ B cos ot þ y
ð
Þ
The gain of the circuit describes the relationship between the sizes of the input and output
sinusoids. In particular, the gain is the ratio of the amplitude of the output sinusoid to the
amplitude of the input sinusoid.

gain ¼ B

Gain, Phase Shift, and the Network Function

The phase shift of the circuit describes the relationship between the phase angles of the input
and output sinusoids. In particular, the phase shift is the difference between the phase angle of
the output sinusoid and the phase angle of the input sinusoid.
That is,
phase shift ¼ y  0 ¼ y
To be more speciﬁc, we need analytic representations of the sinusoids shown in Figure 13.2-2. The
input voltage is the smaller of the two sinusoids and can be represented as
vin tð Þ ¼ 1 cos 6283t V
The steady-state response is the larger of the two sinusoids and can be represented as
vout tð Þ ¼ 8:47 cos 6283t þ 148
ð
Þ V
The gain of this circuit at the frequency o ¼ 6283 rad/s is
gain ¼ output amplitude
input amplitude ¼ 8:47
1
¼ 8:47
This gain is unitless because both amplitudes have units of volts. Because the gain is greater than 1, the
output sinusoid is larger than the input sinusoid. This circuit is said to amplify its input. When the gain of
a circuit is less than 1, the output sinusoid is smaller than the input sinusoid. This circuit is said to
attenuate its input.
The phase shift of this circuit at the frequency o ¼ 6283 rad/s is
phase shift ¼ output phase angle  input phase angle ¼ 148  0 ¼ 148
The phase shift determines the amount of time the output is advanced or delayed with respect to the
input. Notice that

frequency is 6283 rad/s, a phase shift of 148or 2.58 rad causes a shift in time equal to
t0 ¼ y
o ¼ 2:58 rad
6283 rad/s ¼ 410 ms
In Figure 13.2-2, the positive peaks of the input sinusoid occur at 0 ms, 1 ms, 2 ms,
3 ms, . . . . Positive peaks of the output sinusoid occur at 0.59 ms, 1.59 ms, 2.59 ms,
606
13. Frequency Response

3.59 ms, . . . . Peaks of the output sinusoid occur 410 ms before the next peak of the input sinusoid.
The output is advanced by 410 ms with respect to the input.
Notice that
vout tð Þ ¼ 8:47 cos 6283t þ 148
ð
Þ ¼ 8:47 cos 6283t  212
ð
Þ
because a phase shift of 360 does not change the sinusoid. A phase shift of 212 or 3.70 rad causes
a shift in time of
t0 ¼ 3:70 rad
6283 rad/s ¼ 590 ms
Peaks of the output sinusoid occur 590 ms after the previous of the input sinusoid. The output is delayed
by 590 ms with respect to the input.
A phase shift that advances the output is called a phase lead. A phase shift that delays the
output is called a phase lag.
At the frequency o ¼ 6283 rad/s, this circuit ampliﬁes its input by a factor of 8.47 and advances it
by 410 ms or, equivalently, delays it by 590 ms. The circuit of Figure 13.2-1 has a phase lead of 148 or,
equivalently, a phase lag of 212.
Now let us consider this circuit when the frequency of the input is changed. When the input is
vin tð Þ ¼ 1 cos 3141:6t V
the steady-state response of this circuit can be found to be
vout tð Þ ¼ 9:54 cos 3141:6t þ 163
ð
Þ V
The gain and phase shift of this circuit at the frequency o ¼ 3141:6 rad/s are
gain ¼ output amplitude

¼ 9:54
and
phase shift ¼ output phase angle  input phase angle ¼ 163  0 ¼ 163
Changing the frequency of the input has changed the gain and phase shift of this circuit. Apparently,
the gain and the phase shift of this circuit are functions of the frequency of the input. Table 13.2-1 shows
the values of the gain and phase shift corresponding to several choices of the input frequency.
As expected, the gain and phase shift changed when the input frequency changed. The network

function describes the way the behavior of the circuit depends on the frequency of the input.
The network function is deﬁned in the frequency domain. It is the ratio of the phasor corresponding
to the response sinusoid to the phasor corresponding to the input. Let X(o) be the phasor corresponding
to the input to the circuit and Y(o) be the phasor corresponding to the steady-state response of the
network. Then,

Consider the problem of ﬁnding the network function of a given circuit. To solve such a
problem, we do two things. First, we represent the circuit in the frequency domain using impedances
and phasors. (We also represented the circuit in the frequency domain when we wanted to ﬁnd
the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. In that case, the frequency was represented as the
value of the frequency of the sinusoidal input, for example, 4 rad/s. When we ﬁnd the network
function, the frequency is represented by a variable, o). Second, we analyze the circuit to determine
the ratio of the phasor corresponding to the circuit output to the phasor corresponding to the circuit
input. This analysis might involve mesh equations or node equations or equivalent impedances and
voltage or current division. In any case, the analysis is performed in the frequency domain.
Let’s ﬁnd the network function for the circuit shown in Figure
13.2-1. The ﬁrst step is to represent this circuit in the frequency domain
using impedances and phasors. Figure 13.2-3 shows the frequency-
domain circuit corresponding to the circuit in Figure 13.2-1. In this
example, the phasor corresponding to the input is Vin(o), and the phasor
corresponding to the output is Vout(o). We seek to ﬁnd the network
function H(o) ¼ Vout=Vin. Write the node equation at the inverting input
node of the op amp and assume an ideal op amp. Then we have

Notice that the frequency of the input has been represented by a variable, o, rather than by
any particular value. As a result, the network function, gain, and phase shift describe the way in
which the behavior of the circuit depends on the input frequency. Earlier, we considered the case
when o ¼ 6283 rad/s. Substituting this frequency into the equations for the gain and phase shift
gives

These are the same results as were obtained earlier by examining the oscilloscope traces in Figure
13.2-2. Similarly, each line of Table 13.2-1 can be obtained by substituting the appropriate frequency
into the equations for the gain and phase shift.
Equations that represent the gain and phase shift as functions of frequency are called
the frequency response of the circuit. The same information can be represented by a table or
by graphs instead of equations. These tables or graphs are also called the frequency response of the
circuit.
To see that the network function really does represent the behavior of the circuit, suppose that
vin tð Þ ¼ 0:4 cos 5000t þ 45

Notice that the network function contained enough information to enable us to calculate the steady-
state response from the input sinusoid. The network function does indeed describe the behavior of
the circuit.

The circuit has been represented twice, by a circuit diagram and by the given network function. The unknown

Gain, Phase Shift, and the Network Function
613

The circuit shown in Figure 13.2-1 is an example of a circuit called a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter.
First-order low-pass ﬁlters have network functions of the form
H o
ð Þ ¼
H0
1 þ j o

ð13:2-12Þ
The gain and phase shift of the ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter are

and
phase shift ¼ﬀH0  tan1 o=o0
ð
Þ
ð13:2-14Þ
The network function of the ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter has two parameters, H0 and o0. At low
frequencies, that is, o  o0, the gain is jH0j, so jH0j is called the dc gain. (When o ¼ 0, A cos ot ¼ A, a
constant or dc voltage.)
The other parameter of the network function, o0, is called the half-power frequency. To explain
this terminology, suppose that the input to the ﬁrst-order ﬁlter in Figure 13.2-1 is
vin tð Þ ¼ A cos ot
ð

Suppose, for convenience, that H0 ¼ 1. Then the output of the ﬁrst-order ﬁlter in Figure 13.2-1 is

13. Frequency Response

In other words, suppose we hold the input amplitude constant while we vary the frequency o of
the input. We ﬁnd that the value of the output power when o ¼ o0 is one-half of the value of the output
power when o  o0.
Next, consider the problem of designing a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter. Suppose we are given the
following speciﬁcations:
dc gain ¼ 2
phase shift ¼ 120
when
o ¼ 1000 rad/s
Before designing a circuit to meet these speciﬁcations, we need to pay more attention to the phase shift.
Consider Eq. 13.2-14. Both o and o0 will be positive, so tan1(o=o0) will be between 0 and 90.
Also,ﬀH0 will be 0 when H0 is positive and 180 when H0 is negative. As a result, only phase shifts
between 90and 0or between 90and 180can be achieved using a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter. (Phase
shifts that cannot be obtained using a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter can be obtained using other types of
circuit. That’s a story for another day.) Table 13.2-2 shows two ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlters, one for
obtaining phase shifts between 90 and 180 and the other for obtaining phase shifts between 90and
0. Based on the phase shift, we select the circuit in the ﬁrst row of Table 13.2-2. The speciﬁcation on
the dc gain gives
2 ¼ jH0j ¼ R2
R1
The speciﬁcation on phase shift gives

Gain, Phase Shift, and the Network Function
615

This is a set of two equations in the three unknowns R1, R2, and C. The solution is not unique. We will
have to pick a value for one of the unknowns and then solve for values of the other two unknowns. Let’s
pick a convenient value for the capacitor, C ¼ 0:1mF, and calculate the resistances.

ð
Þ
1000  0:1  106 ¼ 17:32 kV
and
R1 ¼ R2
2 ¼ 8:66 kV
We conclude that the circuit shown in the ﬁrst row of Table 13.2-2 will have a dc gain ¼ 2 and a phase
shift ¼ 120 at o ¼ 1000 rad/s when R1 ¼ 8:66 kV, R2 ¼ 17:32 kV, and C ¼ 0:1mF.

It is common to use logarithmic plots of the frequency response instead of linear plots. The logarithmic
plots are called Bode plots in honor of H. W. Bode, who used them extensively in his work with
ampliﬁers at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1930s and 1940s. A Bode plot is a plot of log-gain and

phase angle values versus frequency, using a log-frequency horizontal axis. The use of logarithms
expands the range of frequencies portrayed on the horizontal axis.
The network function H can be written as
H ¼ Hﬀf ¼ He jf
ð13:3-1Þ
The logarithm of the magnitude is normally expressed in terms of the logarithm to the base 10, so we use
logarithmic gain ¼ 20 log10 H
ð13:3-2Þ
and the unit is decibel (dB). The logarithmic gain is also called the gain in dB. A decibel conversion
table is given in Table 13.3-1.
The unit decibel is derived from the unit bel. Suppose P1 and P2 are two values of power. Both
P1=P2 and log (P1=P2) are measures of the relative sizes of P1 and P2. The ratio P1=P2 is unitless,
whereas log(P1=P2) has the bel as its unit. The name bel honors Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of
the telephone.
The Bode plot is a chart of gain in decibels and phase in degrees versus the logarithm of
frequency.

compare the equation of the high-frequency asymptote to the more familiar standard form of the
equation of a straight line, y ¼ mx þ b. The slope of the high-frequency asymptote can be calculated
from two points on the straight line. This slope is given using units of dB/decade. In Figure 13.3-1b
the gain in dB is plotted versus log o, whereas in Figure 13.3-1c, the gain in dB is plotted versus o
using a log scale. It is more convenient to label the frequency axis when a log scale is used for o.
The equation used to calculate the slope from two points on the line is the same in Figure 13.3-1c as it
is in Figure 13.3-1b.
Consider two frequencies, o1 and o2, with o2 = 10xo1. We say that o2 is larger than o1 by
x decades. Alternately, o2 is larger than o1 by x ¼ log10(o2=o1) decades. For example, 1000 rad/s is
2 decades larger than 10 rad/s, and 316 rad/s is 1.5 decades larger than 10 rad/s.

The intersection of the low-frequency asymptote with the high-frequency asymptote occurs when

that is, when
o ¼ o0
The low- and high-frequency asymptotes form a corner where they intersect. Because the asymptotes
intersect at the frequency o ¼ o0, o0 is sometimes called the corner frequency.
Figure 13.3-2 shows the magnitude and phase Bode plots for this network function. The
asymptotic curve shown in Figure 13.3-2 is an approximation to the Bode plot. The asymptotic
Bode plot consists of the low-frequency asymptote for o < o0 and the high-frequency asymptote for
o > o0. The approximation used to obtain the asymptotic Bode plot is summarized by the following
equations:

results in a logarithmic drop of approximately

Of course, H may take on forms other than that of Eq. 13.3-3. For example, consider the
circuit shown in Figure 13.3-3. The network function of this circuit is

Let’s put this network function into the form
H ¼ k

This network function has three parameters: k, o1, and o2. All three parameters have names. The
frequencies o1 and o2 are corner frequencies. Corner frequencies that appear in the numerator of a
network function are called zeros, so o1 is a zero of the network function. Corner frequencies that
appear in the denominator of a network function are called poles, so o2 is a pole of the network
function. Because
k ¼ lim

the parameter k is called the low-frequency gain or the dc gain. The network function of this circuit can

These are the equations of the asymptotes of the Bode plot. When o < o1 and when o > o2, the
asymptotes are horizontal straight lines. The equations for these asymptotes don’t include a term
involving log10o, which means that the slope must be zero. When o1 < o < o2, the equation of the
asymptote does include a term involving log10 o. The coefﬁcient of log10o is 20, indicating a slope of
20 dB/decade.
The effect of the dc gain k is limited to the term 20 log10 k, which appears in the equation of each
of the three asymptotes. Changing the value of k will shift the Bode plot up (increasing k) or down
(decreasing k) but will not change the shape of the Bode plot. For this reason, we sometimes normalize
the network function by dividing by the dc gain. The asymptotes of the Bode plot of the normalized

The phase Bode plot and the asymptotic magnitude Bode plot are shown in Figure 13.3-4.
Notice that the slope of the asymptotic magnitude Bode plot changes as the frequency increases
past o1 and changes again as the frequency increases past o2. Zeros, like o1, cause the slope to
increase by 20 dB/decade. Poles, like o2, cause the slope to decrease by 20 dB/decade. The slope
of every asymptote will be an integer multiple of 20 dB/decade.

INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 13.3-6a. The input to the circuit is the voltage of the voltage source vi(t). The output

The corresponding magnitude Bode plot is shown in Figure 13.3-6b. Determine the values of the capacitances

Solution
The network function provides a connection between the circuit and the Bode plot. We can determine the network
function from the Bode plot, and we can also analyze the circuit to determine its network function. The values of the
capacitances are determined by equating the coefﬁcients of these two network functions.
Step 1: Let’s make some observations regarding the Bode plot shown in Figure 13.3-6b:
1.
There are two corner frequencies, at 80 and 500 rad/s. The corner frequency at 80 rad/s is a pole because the
slope of the Bode plot decreases at 80 rad/s. The corner frequency at 500 rad/s is a zero because the slope
increases at 500 rad/s.

FIGURE 13.3-8 The circuit and Bode plot considered in Example 13.3-3.
Solution
The network function provides a connection between the circuit and the Bode plot. We can determine the network
function from the Bode plot, and we can also analyze the circuit to determine its network function. The values of the
capacitances are determined by equating the coefﬁcients of these two network functions.
Step 1: First, we make some observations regarding the Bode plot shown in Figure 13.3-8b.
1.
There are two corner frequencies, at 40 and 160 rad/s. Both corner frequencies are poles because the slope of
the Bode plot decreases at both the corner frequencies.
2.
Between the corner frequencies, the gain is jH o
ð Þj ¼ 26 dB ¼ 1026/20 ¼ 20 V/V.
3.
At low frequencies—that is, at frequencies smaller than the smallest corner frequency—the slope is 1  20 dB/
decade, so the network function includes a factor ( jo)1.
Equating coefﬁcients gives

The asymptotic magnitude Bode plot is shown in Figure 13.3-10. The actual magnitude Bode plot and the actual

plot when o  o0 or o

As this equation and Figure 13.3-11 both show, the deviation between the actual and asymptotic Bode plot near

decreases by 40 dB/decade as the frequency increases past o ¼ o0. In terms of the asymptotic Bode plot, the
denominator of this network function acts like two poles at p ¼ o0. If this factor were to appear in the numerator of
a network function, it would act like two zeros at z ¼ o0. The slope of the asymptotic Bode plot would increase by
40 dB/decade as the frequency increased past o ¼ o0.

Designing a Circuit to Have
a Speciﬁed Bode Plot
Let’s design the circuit shown in Figure 13.3-3 to satisfy the following speciﬁcations.
1.
The low-frequency gain is 0.1.
2.
The high-frequency gain is 1.
3.
The corner frequencies lie in the range of 100 hertz to 2000 hertz.
Solution
We’re confronted with two problems. First, can these speciﬁcations be satisﬁed using this circuit? Second, if they
can, what values of R, Rs, and L are required?
Our earlier analysis of this circuit showed that the low-frequency gain is less than 1 and that the
high-frequency gain is equal to 1. This circuit can be used only to satisfy speciﬁcations that are consistent
with these facts. Fortunately, the given speciﬁcations are consistent with these facts. The ﬁrst speciﬁcation
requires
so the equation of the low-frequency asymptote is
20 log10jHj ¼ 20 log10 5  20 log10 o
The slope of the low-frequency asymptote is 20 dB/decade. Let’s ﬁnd a point on the low-frequency asymptote.
When o ¼ 1,
20 log10jHj ¼ 20 log10 5  20 log10 1 ¼ 14 dB
The low-frequency asymptote is a straight line with a slope of 20 dB/decade passing through the point
o ¼ 1 rad/s, jHj ¼ 14 dB.
The slope of the asymptotic Bode plot will change as o increases past each corner frequency. The slope
decreases by 20 dB/decade at o ¼ p ¼ 2 rad/s, then increases by 20 dB/decade at o ¼ 10 rad/s, and ﬁnally
decreases by 40 dB/decade at o ¼ 50 rad/s. The asymptotic magnitude Bode plot is shown in Figure 13.3-12.

R
R þ Rs
Because this circuit has a high-frequency gain equal to 1, the second speciﬁcation is satisﬁed.
Now let’s turn our attention to the speciﬁcations on the corner frequencies. The speciﬁed frequency range is
given using units of hertz, whereas the corner frequencies have units of radians/second. Because o1 > o2, the third
speciﬁcation requires that
2p
ð
Þ100 < R
L ¼ o1
and
2p
ð
Þ2000 > R þ Rs
L
¼ o2
Our job is to ﬁnd values of R, Rs, and L that satisfy these three requirements. We have no guarantee that appropriate
values exist. If an appropriate set of values does exist, it may well not be unique. Let’s try
R ¼ 100 V
The speciﬁcation on the low-frequency gain requires that
Rs ¼ 9R ¼ 900 V
The speciﬁcation on the zero will be satisﬁed if
L ¼
R
2p
ð
Þ100 ¼ 0:159 H
It remains to verify that these values of R, Rs, and L satisfy the speciﬁcation on the pole frequency. Because
R þ Rs
L
¼ 6289 < 12; 566 ¼ 2p
ð
Þ2000
the speciﬁcation is satisﬁed.
In summary, when
R ¼ 100 V;
Rs ¼ 900 V;
and
L ¼ 0:159 H
the circuit shown in Figure 13.3-3 satisﬁes the speciﬁcations given above.
This solution is not unique. Indeed, when R ¼ 100 and Rs ¼ 900, any inductance in the range
0.0796 < L < 0.159 H can be used to satisfy these speciﬁcations.

Design a circuit that has the asymptotic magnitude Bode plot shown in Figure 13.3-13a.
Solution
The slope of this Bode plot is 20 dB/decade for low frequencies, that is, o < 500 rad/s, so H(o) must have a jo
factor in its numerator. The slope decreases by 20 dB/decade (from 20 dB/decade to zero) as o increases past
o ¼ 500 rad/s, so H(o) must have a pole at o ¼ 500 rad/s. Based on these observations

Figure 13.4-1b shows some data that were obtained by applying an input with an amplitude of 2 mA and
a frequency that was varied. Row 1 of this table describes the performance of this circuit when
o ¼ 200 rad/s. At this frequency, the impedance of the circuit is
Z ¼ 6:6ﬀ48
0:002
¼ 3300ﬀ48 V
Let’s convert this impedance from polar to rectangular form:
Z ¼ 2208 þ j2452 V
This looks like the equivalent impedance of a series resistor and inductor. The resistance would be
2208 V. Because the frequency is o ¼ 200 rad/s, the inductance would be 12.26 H. Recall that in
rectangular form impedances are represented as
Z ¼ R þ jX
where R is called the resistance and X is called the reactance. When o ¼ 200 rad/s, we say that the
reactance of this circuit is inductive because the reactance is positive and therefore could have been
caused by a single inductor.

The last row of the table describes the performance of this circuit when o ¼ 300 rad/s. Now
Z ¼ 7:4ﬀ43
0:002
¼ 3700ﬀ43 ¼ 2706  j 2523 V
Because the reactance is negative, it couldn’t have been caused by a single inductor. This impedance
looks like the equivalent impedance of a single resistor connected in series with a single capacitor:
R  j 1
oC ¼ 2706  j 2523 V
Equating the real parts shows that the resistance is 2706 V. Equating imaginary parts shows that the
capacitance is 1.32 mF.
The reactance of this circuit is inductive at some frequencies and capacitive at other frequencies.
We can tell when the reactance will be inductive and when it will be capacitive by looking at the last
column of the table. When y is positive, the reactance is inductive and when y is negative, the reactance
is capacitive. The frequency o ¼ 250 rad/s is special. When the input frequency is less than 250 rad/s,
the reactance is inductive, but when the input frequency is greater than 250 rad/s, the reactance is
capacitive. This special frequency is called the resonant frequency and is denoted as o0. From the third
row of the table, we see that when o ¼ o0 ¼ 250 rad/s
Z ¼ 10ﬀ0
0:002 ¼ 5000ﬀ0 ¼ 5000  j 0 V
The reactance is zero. At the resonant frequency, the impedance is purely resistive. Indeed, this fact can
be used to identify the resonant frequency.
Another observation can be made from Figure 13.4-1. The magnitude of the impedance is
maximum when o ¼ o0 ¼ 250 rad/s. When the frequency is reduced from o0 or increased from o0,
the magnitude of the impedance is decreased.
Next, consider the circuit shown in Figure 13.4-2. This circuit is called the parallel resonant
circuit. The equivalent impedance of the parallel resistor, inductor, and capacitor is

At o ¼ o0, Z ¼ R. The magnitude of Z decreases as o is either increased or decreased from o0. The
angle of Z is positive when o < o0 and negative when o > o0, so the reactance is inductive when
o < o0 and capacitive when o > o0.

The parameters k, Q, and o0 characterize the resonant circuit. The resonant frequency o0 is the
frequency at which the reactance is zero and where the magnitude of the impedance is maximum. The
parameter k is the value of the impedance when o ¼ o0, so k is the maximum value of the impedance. Q
is called the quality factor of the resonant circuit. The magnitude of the impedance will decrease as o is
reduced from o0 or increased from o0. The quality factor controls how rapidly jZj decreases. Figure
13.4-3 illustrates the importance of Q. Both k and o0 have been set equal to 1 in Figure 13.4-3 to
emphasize the relationship between Q and jZj.
Figure 13.4-3 shows that the larger the value of Q, the more sharply peaked is the frequency
response plot. We can quantify this observation by introducing the bandwidth of the resonant circuit. To
that end, let o1 and o2 denote the frequencies where

Designing Resonant Circuits
Figure 13.4-5 shows the magnitude frequency response plot of a resonant circuit. Design a circuit that has this
frequency response.
Solution
We have already solved this problem. Three things must be done to design the required circuit. First, the parameters
k, Q, and o0 must be determined from the frequency response. We did that in Example 13.4-2. Second, we notice
that the given resonant frequency response is an impedance rather than an admittance, and we choose the parallel
resonant circuit from Table 13.4-1. Third, the element values R, L, and C must be calculated from the values of k, Q,
and o0. We did that in Example 13.4-3.

The gain of an op amp is not inﬁnite; rather, it is ﬁnite and decreases with frequency. The gain A(o) of
the operational ampliﬁer is a function of o given by
A o
ð Þ ¼

where Ao is the dc gain and o1 is the corner frequency. The dc gain is normally greater than 104 and o1
is less than 100 rad/s. A circuit model of a frequency-dependent nonideal op amp is shown in Figure
13.5-1. This model is more accurate, but also more complicated, than the ideal op amp model.

Figure 13.6-1 shows a MATLAB input ﬁle that can be used to obtain the Bode plot corresponding to
this network function. This MATLAB ﬁle consists of four parts.
In the ﬁrst part, the MATLAB command log space is used to specify the frequency range for the
Bode plot. The command log space also provides a list of frequencies that are evenly spaced (on a log
scale) over this frequency range.
The given network has four parameters—the gain, K; the zero, z; and two poles, p1 and p2. The
second part of the MATLAB input ﬁle speciﬁes values for these four parameters.
The third part of the MATLAB input ﬁle is a “for loop” that evaluates H(o), jH(o)j, andﬀH o
ð Þ at
each frequency in the list of frequencies produced by the command log space.
The fourth part of the MATLAB input ﬁle does the plotting. The command
semilogx

does several things. The command semilogx indicates that the plot is to be made using a logarithmic scale
for the ﬁrst variable and a linear scale for the second variable. The ﬁrst variable, frequency, is divided by 2p
to convert to Hz. The second variable, jH(o)j, is converted to dB.
The Bode plots produced using this MATLAB input ﬁle are shown in Figure 13.6-2.
The second and third parts of the MATLAB input ﬁle can be modiﬁed to plot the Bode plots for a
different network function.

To use PSpice to plot the frequency response of a circuit, we do the following:
1.
Draw the circuit in the OrCAD Capture workspace.
2.
Specify an AC Sweep\Noise simulation.
3.
Run the simulation.
4.
Plot the simulation results.
The frequency axis of a frequency response plot can be either a linear axis or a logarithmic axis.
When a logarithmic axis is used for the frequency variable, the plots are referred to as Bode diagrams or
Bode plots. We encounter the terms octave and decade when working with logarithmic scales. The
frequency doubles in an octave and increases by a factor of ten in a decade. (The log of the frequency
increases by 1 as the frequency increases by a decade.)
Let Aﬀy be the phasor of the node voltage at node 2 of a circuit. PSpice uses the notation:
V 2
ð ÞﬀVp(2) ¼ Aﬀy
That is, V(2) denotes the magnitude of the phasor and Vp(2) denotes the angle of the phasor. PSpice
gives the angle in degrees. Similarly, V(R2) represents the magnitude of the voltage across resistor R2,
whereas Vp(R2) denotes the angle. PSpice indicates that the units are decibels by inserting “dB” into the
name of a signal just before the parenthesis. For example, VdB(2) denotes the magnitude of the node
voltage phasor in dB.

Using PSpice to Plot
a Frequency Response
The input to the circuit shown in Figure 13.7-1 is the voltage source voltage vs(t). The response is the voltage vo(t)
across the 20-kV resistor. Use PSpice to plot the frequency response of this circuit.
Solution
We begin by drawing the circuit in the OrCAD workspace as shown in Figure 13.7-2 (see Appendix A). Two nodes
of this circuit have been named using a PSpice part called an off-page connector. The particular off-page connector
used in Figure 13.7-1 is called an OFFPAGELEFT-R part and is found in the part library named CAPSYM.

To label a node, select Place/Off-Page Connector . . . from the OrCAD capture menus to pop up the Place
Off-Page Connector dialog box. Select the library CAPSYM from the list of libraries and then choose
OFFPAGELEFT-R. The new connector will be labeled OFFPAGELEFT-R. Use the property editor to
change this name to something descriptive, such as Vo. Wire the connector to the appropriate node of the circuit
to name that node Vo.
We will perform an AC Sweep\Noise simulation. (Select PSpice\New Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD
Capture menu bar; then select AC Sweep\Noise from the Analysis Type drop-down list. Set the Start Frequency to
1 and End Frequency to 1000. Select a Logrithmic Sweep and set the Points/Decade to 100.) Select PSpice\Run
Simulation Proﬁle from the OrCAD Capture menu bar to run the simulation.
After a successful ACSweep\Noise simulation, OrCAD Capture will automatically open a Schematics
window. Select Plot/Add plot from the Schematics menus to add a second plot. Two empty plots will appear, one
above the other. Select the top plot by clicking the top plot.
Select Trace=Add Trace from the Schematics menus to pop up the Add Traces dialog box. Select ﬁrst
V(Vo) and then V(Vs) from the list of Simulation Output Variables. The Trace Expression, near the bottom of the
dialog box, will be V(Vo)V(Vs). Edit the trace expression to be Vdb(Vo)  Vdb(Vs). Vdb(Vo)  Vdb(Vs) is the
gain in decibels. Close the Add Traces dialog box.
Select the bottom plot by clicking the bottom plot. Select Trace/Add Trace to pop up the Add Traces dialog
box. Select ﬁrst V(Vo) and then V(Vs) from the list of Simulation Output Variables. The Trace Expression, near
the bottom of the dialog box, will be be V(Vo)V(Vs). Edit the trace expression to be Vp(Vo)  Vp(Vs). Vp(Vo) 
Vp(Vs) is the phase shift in degrees. Close the Add Traces dialog box.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the
speciﬁcations have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against
data-entry errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

How Can We Check Bode Plots?
Figure 13.8.1a shows a laboratory setup for measuring the frequency response of a circuit. A sinusoidal input is
connected to the input of a circuit having the network function H(o). An oscilloscope is used to measure the input
and output sinusoids. The input voltage is used to trigger the oscilloscope so the phase angle of the input is zero.
Frequency response data are collected by varying the input frequency and measuring the amplitude of the input
voltage and the amplitude and phase of the output voltage.
In this example, the desired frequency response is speciﬁed by the Bode plot shown in Figure 13.8.1b. Figure
13.8.1c shows frequency response data from laboratory measurements. In this example, the amplitude, but not the
phase angle, of the output voltage was measured. How can we check that the circuit does indeed have the speciﬁed
Bode plot?

Solution
The Bode plot has three features that we can look for in the frequency response data.
1.
The dc gain is 14 dB.
2.
The slope of the Bode plot is 20 dB/decade when o 
 200 rad/s.
3.
The corner frequency is 200 rad/s.
The lowest frequency at which frequency response data was taken is 20 rad/sec. At this frequency, the gain
was measured to be
jH 20
ð
Þj ¼ B
A ¼ 5
1 ¼ 14 dB
which is equal to the dc gain speciﬁed by the Bode plot.
To identify the corner frequency from the frequency response data, we look for the frequency at which the
gain is

How Can We Check
Frequency Response?
An old lab report from a couple of years ago includes the following data about a particular circuit:
1.
The magnitude and phase frequency responses are as shown in Figure 13.8-3.
2.
When the input to the circuit was
vin ¼ 4 cos 2p1200t
ð
Þ V
the steady-state response was
vout ¼ 6:25 cos 2p1200t þ 110
ð
Þ V
How can we check whether these data are consistent?
Solution
Three things need to be checked: the frequencies, the amplitudes, and the phase angles. The frequencies of both
sinusoids are the same, which is good because the circuit must be linear if it is to be represented by a frequency
response, and the steady-state response of a linear circuit to a sinusoidal input is a sinusoid at the same frequency as
the input. The frequency of the input and output sinusoids is
o ¼ 2  p  1200 rad/s
or
f ¼ 1200 Hz
Fortunately, the gain and phase shift at 1200 Hz have been labeled on the frequency response plots shown in
Figure 13.8-3. The gain at 1200 Hz is labeled as 3.9 dB, which means that
jVoutj
jVinj ¼ 3:9 dB ¼ 1:57
where Vin and Vout are the phasors corresponding to vin(t) and vout(t). Let us check this against the data about the
input and output sinusoids. Because the magnitudes of the phasors are equal to the amplitudes of the corresponding
sinusoids,
jVoutj
jVinj ¼ 6:25
4
¼ 1:56
This is very good agreement for experimental work.
648
13. Frequency Response

Next, consider the phase shift. The frequency response indicates that the phase shift at 1200 Hz is 110,
which means
ﬀVout ﬀVin ¼ 110
Let us check this against the data about the input and output sinusoids. Because the angles of the phasors are equal
to the phase angles of the corresponding sinusoids,
ﬀVout ﬀVin ¼ 110  0 ¼ 110
The signs of the phase angles do not match. At a frequency of 1200 Hz, a phase angle of 110 indicates that the
peaks of the output sinusoid will follow the peaks of the input sinusoid by
t0 ¼ 110
360 
1
1200 ¼ 0:255 ms
whereas a phase angle of 110 indicates that the peaks of the output sinusoid will precede the peaks of the input
sinusoid by 0.255 ms. It is likely that the angle of the output sinusoid was entered incorrectly in the lab data.
We have found an error in the old lab report and proposed an explanation for the error.

State the Goal
The goal is to design a circuit consisting of resistors, capacitors, and op amps that has a
gain equal to 1 at 1000 kHz and equal to zero at 700 and 1400 kHz.
Generate a Plan
The tuner will be based on a resonant circuit having o0 ¼ 2p106 ¼ 6:283  106 rad/s and
Q ¼ 15. Figure 13.9-2 shows an op amp circuit called a simulated inductor. This circuit acts like a grounded

13. Frequency Response

Figure 13.9-3 shows how a parallel resonant circuit can be used to design the tuner. A parallel resonant circuit is
shown in Figure 13.9-3a. The parallel resonant circuit must be modiﬁed if it is to be used for the tuner. The input to
the tuner is a voltage, but the input to the parallel resonant circuit is a current. A source transformation is used to
obtain a circuit that has a voltage input, shown in Figure 13.9-3b. Next, the inductor is replaced by the simulated
inductor to produce the circuit shown in Figure 13.9-3c. This is the circuit that will be used as the tuner.
The design will be completed in two steps. First, values of L, R, and C will be calculated so that the parallel
resonant circuit has o0 ¼ 6:283  106 rad/s and Q ¼ 15. Next, the capacitor and resistors of the simulated inductor
will be selected to satisfy Eq. 13.9-3.
Act on the Plan
First, design the resonant circuit to have o0 ¼ 6:283  106 rad/s and Q ¼ 15. Pick a convenient value for the
capacitance, C ¼ 0:001mF. Then,

Gain, phase shift, and the network function are properties of
linear circuits that describe the effect that a circuit has on a
sinusoidal input voltage or current.
The gain of the circuit describes the relationship between the
sizes of the input and output sinusoids. The gain is the ratio of
the amplitude of the output sinusoid to the amplitude of the
input sinusoid.
The phase shift of the circuit describes the relationship
between the phase angles of the input and output sinusoids.
The phase shift is the difference between the phase angle
of the output sinusoid and the phase angle of the input
sinusoid.
The network function describes the way the behavior of the
circuit depends on the frequency of the input. The network
function is deﬁned in the frequency domain. It is the ratio of
the phasor corresponding to the response sinusoid to the
phasor corresponding to the input.
Table 13.3-2 tabulates the network functions of several
common op amp circuits.
The frequency response describes the way the gain and phase
shift of a circuit depend on frequency. Equations, tables, or
plots are each used to express the frequency response.
Bode plots represent the frequency response as plots of the
gain in decibels and the phase using a logarithmic scale for
frequency. Asymptotic magnitude Bode plots are approxi-
mate Bode plots that are easy to draw. The terms corner
frequency and break frequency are routinely used to describe
linear circuits. These terms describe features of the asymp-
totic Bode plot.
Some linear circuits exhibit a phenomenon called resonance.
These circuits contain reactive elements but act as if they
were purely resistive at a particular frequency, called the
resonant frequency. Resonant circuits are described using
the resonant frequency, quality factor, and bandwidth.

Figure 13.9-4 shows the results of a PSpice simulation of the tuner. The input to the circuit is vi(t) described by
Eq. 13.9-1. This signal is not sinusoidal. The output of the ﬁlter is a sinusoid with an amplitude of approximately
1 and a frequency of 1000 kHz, as required by Eq. 13.9-2. Thus, the design speciﬁcations are satisﬁed.

Table 13.4-1 summarizes the properties of series and parallel
resonant circuits.
The gain of operational ampliﬁers depends on the frequency
of the input. Using an op amp model that includes a
frequency-dependent gain makes our analysis more accurate
but also more complicated. We use the more complicated
model when we need the additional accuracy, and we use the
simpler model when we don’t.
PSpice can be used to analyze a circuit and display its
frequency response.
MATLAB can be used to display the frequency response of a
network function.

P 13.3-17 The cochlear implant is intended for patients with
deafness due to malfunction of the sensory cells of the
cochlea in the inner ear (Loeb, 1985). These devices use a
microphone for picking up sound and a processor for con-
verting it to electrical signals, and they transmit these signals
to the nervous system. A cochlear implant relies on the
fact that many of the auditory nerve ﬁbers remain intact in
patients with this form of hearing loss. The overall transmis-
sion from microphone to nerve cells is represented by the gain

DP 13-3 British Rail has constructed an instrumented railcar
that can be pulled over its tracks at speeds up to 180 km/hr and
will measure the track-grade geometry. Using such a railcar,
British Rail can monitor and track gradual degradation of the rail
grade, especially the banking of curves, and permit preventive
maintenance to be scheduled as needed well in advance of track-
grade failure.
The instrumented railcar has numerous sensors, such as
angular-rate sensors (devices that output a signal proportional to
rate of rotation) and accelerometers (devices that output a signal
proportional to acceleration), whose signals are ﬁltered and
combined in a fashion to create a composite sensor called a
compensated accelerometer (Lewis, 1988). A component of this
composite sensor signal is obtained by integrating and high-pass
ﬁltering an accelerometer signal. A ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter will
approximate an integrator at frequencies well above the break
frequency. This can be seen by computing the phase shift of the
ﬁlter-transfer function at various frequencies. At sufﬁciently
high frequencies, the phase shift will approach 90, the phase
characteristic of an integrator.
A circuit has been proposed to ﬁlter the accelerometer
signal, as shown in Figure DP 13-3. The circuit is composed of
three sections, labeled A, B, and C. For each section, ﬁnd an
expression for and name the function performed by that section.
Then ﬁnd an expression for the gain function of the entire circuit
Vo =Vs. For the component values, evaluate the magnitude and
phase of the circuit response at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 Hz. Draw a Bode diagram. At what frequency
is the phase response approximately equal to 0? What is the
signiﬁcance of this frequency?

DP 13-5 Strain-sensing instruments can be used to measure
orientation and magnitude of strains running in more than one
direction. The search for a way to predict earthquakes focuses on
identifying precursors, or changes, in the ground that reliably
warn of an impending event. Because so few earthquakes have
occurred precisely at instrumented locations, it has been a slow
and frustrating quest. Laboratory studies show that before rock
actually ruptures—precipitating an earthquake—its rate of inter-
nal strain increases. The material starts to fail before it actually
breaks. This prelude to outright fracture is called “tertiary creep”
(Brown, 1989).
The frequency of strain signals varies from 0.1 to 100

frequencies. The network function of the band-pass ﬁlter is

I n t r o d u c t i o n
Circuits that have no capacitors or inductors can be represented by algebraic equations.
 Chapters 1–6 described circuits without capacitors or inductors. We learned many things about such
circuits, including how to represent them by mesh current equations or node voltage equations.
 Capacitors and inductors are described in Chapter 7.
Circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors are represented by differential equations. In general,
the order of the differential equation is equal to the number of capacitors plus the number of inductors in
the circuit. Writing and solving these differential equations can be challenging.
 In Chapter 8, we analyzed ﬁrst-order circuits.
 In Chapter 9, we analyzed second-order circuits.
The response of a circuit containing capacitors and/or inductors can be separated into two parts: the
steady-state response and the transient part of the response.
 In Chapters 10–13, we studied the steady-state response of circuits with sinusoidal inputs. We found
that we could analyze such circuits by representing them in the frequency domain. We did not restrict
our attention to ﬁrst- or second-order circuits.
 In this chapter, we ﬁnd the complete response, transient part plus steady-state part, of circuits with
capacitors and/or inductors. We will not restrict our attention to ﬁrst- or second-order circuits or to
circuits with sinusoidal inputs.
In this chapter, we introduce a very powerful tool for the analysis of circuits. The Laplace
transform enables the circuit analyst to transform the set of differential equations describing a circuit
to the complex frequency domain, where they become a set of linear algebraic equations. Then, using
straightforward algebraic manipulation, we solve for the variables of interest. Finally, we use the
inverse Laplace transform to go back to the time domain and express the desired response in terms of
time. This is a powerful tool indeed!
670

Next, we learn how to represent the circuit itself in the complex frequency domain. After doing
so, we can analyze the circuit by writing and solving a set of algebraic equations, for example, mesh
current equations or node voltage equations. In other words, using the complex frequency domain
eliminates the need to write the differential equation that represents the circuit.
Finally, we learn how to represent a linear circuit by its transfer function, step response, or
impulse response.
14.2
L a p l a c e T r a n s f o r m
As we have seen in earlier chapters, it is useful to transform the equations describing a circuit from the
time domain into the frequency domain, then perform an analysis and, ﬁnally, transform the problem’s
solution back to the time domain. You will recall that in Chapter 10 we deﬁned the phasor as a
mathematical transformation to simplify ﬁnding the steady-state response of a circuit to a sinusoidal
input. Using the phasor transformation, we solved algebraic equations having complex coefﬁcients
instead of solving differential equations, albeit with real coefﬁcients. The transform method is
summarized in Figure 14.2-1.
In this chapter, we will use the Laplace transform, rather than the phasor transformation, to
transform differential equations to algebraic equations. This will enable us to determine the complete
response to a variety of input functions instead of the steady-state response to sinusoidal inputs.
(The complete response consists of the steady-state response together with the transient part of the
response. We will have more to say about this later.) Pierre-Simon Laplace, who is shown in Figure
14.2-2, is credited with the transform that bears his name.

The exponent st of e in Eq. 14.2-1 must be dimensionless. Consequently, s has units of
frequency. It is customary to refer to s as complex frequency. The lower limit of the integral in
Eq. 14.2-1 is 0, a time just before t ¼ 0. As a result, the Laplace transform includes the effects
of any discontinuity in f tð Þ occurring at time t ¼ 0. In contrast, the Laplace transform does not
include the effect of that part of f tð Þ occurring for time t < 0.
The notation l f tð Þ
½
 indicates taking the Laplace transform of f tð Þ. The result, F sð Þ,
is called the Laplace transform of f tð Þ. The function f tð Þ is said to exist in the time domain,
whereas the function F sð Þ is said to exist in the complex-frequency domain or the s-domain.
(Occasionally, the complex-frequency domain is referred to casually as the frequency
domain when the context makes it clear that frequency domain is short for complex-frequency
domain.)
The inverse Laplace transform is deﬁned by the complex inversion integral

The integral in Eq. 14.2-3 is a contour integration in the complex plane. Evaluation of this integral
requires complex analysis and is beyond the scope of this book. Instead of evaluating the integral in
Eq. 14.2-3, we rely on the fact that the inverse Laplace transform is indeed the inverse of the Laplace
transform. That is, if F sð Þ ¼ l f tð Þ
½
, then also f tð Þ ¼ l1 F sð Þ
½
. We say that f tð Þ and F sð Þ comprise a
Laplace transform pair and denote this fact as
f tð Þ $ F sð Þ
ð14:2-4Þ
Recalling that the part of f tð Þ occurring for time t < 0 had no effect on F sð Þ, we see that l1 F sð Þ
½

provides f tð Þ only for t > 0. (Sometimes the uncertainty about f tð Þ for t < 0 is resolved by requiring
that f tð Þ ¼ 0 for t < 0 for all time domain functions.)

In this example, f tð Þ 6¼ g tð Þ when t < 0, but f tð Þ ¼ g tð Þ when t > 0. Consequently, F sð Þ ¼ G sð Þ. The inverse
Laplace transform of F sð Þ ¼ G sð Þ only provides f tð Þ or g tð Þ for t > 0. We can summarize the results of this
example by the Laplace transform pair:

14. The Laplace Transform

We should stop and ask under what conditions the integral of Eq. 14.2-1 converges to a ﬁnite
value. It can be shown that the integral converges when
Z 1
0
f tð Þ
j
jes1tdt < 1
for some real positive s1. If the magnitude of f tð Þ is f tð Þ
j
j < Meat for all positive t, the integral will
converge for s1 > a. The region of convergence is therefore given by 1 > s1 > a, and s1 is known as
the abscissa of absolute convergence. Functions of time, f tð Þ, that are physically possible always have a
Laplace transform.
Linearity is an important property of the Laplace transform. Consider
f tð Þ ¼ a1 f 1 tð Þ þ a2 f 2 tð Þ
for arbitrary constants a1 and a2. Using Eq. 14.2-1, we have
F sð Þ ¼ l f tð Þ

Thus, the Laplace transform of the derivative of a function is s times the Laplace transform of the
function minus the initial condition.
Thus, we use the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform given in Eq. 14.2-1 to obtain both
Laplace transform pairs and properties of the Laplace transform. Table 14.2-1 provides a
collection of important Laplace transform pairs. Table 14.2-2 lists important properties of the Laplace

We see that de tð Þ is the pulse function shown in Figure 14.3-1c. Notice that for any value of e, the area
under the pulse is given by
Z þ1

de tð Þdt ¼
Z e

1
e dt ¼ 1
Now; let
d tð Þ ¼ lim
e!0 de tð Þ
This deﬁnition of d tð Þ is consistent with the deﬁnition given in Eq. 14.3-2. We see that d tð Þ is a
pulse having inﬁnite magnitude, inﬁnitesimal duration, and area equal to 1. We can’t readily
draw such a pulse, so we represent d tð Þ by an arrow as shown in Figure 14.3-1d, The height of
the arrow is equal to the area of the impulse function. (The area of the impulse function is sometimes
called the strength of the impulse. Also, the impulse function is sometimes called the delta function.)
An important property of the impulse function is

Next, we consider some techniques that are useful for ﬁnding Laplace transforms of other pulse
functions. We can delay a function f tð Þ by time t by replacing each occurrence of t by t  t.
Consider the function
f tð Þ ¼ mt þ b

single occurrence of t, so we replace it by t  t to obtain

14. The Laplace Transform

This function, shown in Figure 14.3-2c, is identical to f tð Þ when t > 0 but g tð Þ ¼ 0 when t < 0.
Suppose we wish to delay g tð Þ by t seconds. The function g tð Þ contains two occurrences of t, and we
must replace each occurrence of t by t  t.

Figure 14.3-3 shows how these techniques can be used to represent pulse functions. Starting with
f tð Þ ¼ 1:5 t, a straight line that passes through the origin in Figure 14.3-3a, we multiply by a step
function so that the product is 0 for time t < 0. The function f tð Þu tð Þ, together with a delayed copy,

where the coefﬁcients of the polynomials are real numbers. The function F sð Þ is said to be a rational
function of s because it is the ratio of two polynomials in s. Usually, we have n > m, in which case, F sð Þ
is called a proper rational function.
The roots of the denominator polynomial D sð Þ are the roots of the equation D sð Þ ¼ 0 and are
called the poles of F sð Þ. Factoring D sð Þ, we obtain
D sð Þ ¼ sn þ an1sn1 þ    þ a1s þ a0 ¼ s  p1
ð
Þ s  p2
ð
Þ    s  pn
ð

The poles, pi, may be either real or complex. Complex poles appear in complex conjugate pairs;
that is, if p1 ¼ a þ jb is a pole of F sð Þ, then F sð Þ will also have a pole, pi ¼ p
1 ¼ a  jb. A pole pi of
F sð Þ is said to be a simple pole of F sð Þ if none of the other poles of F sð Þ are equal to pi. In contrast, pi is a
repeated pole of F sð Þ if at least one of the other poles of F sð Þ is equal to pi. The multiplicity of a repeated
pole pi is the number of equal poles, including pi itself. The roots of the numerator polynomial N sð Þ are
called the zeros of F sð Þ.
We will ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform of a proper rational function F sð Þ in three steps. First,
we perform a partial fraction expansion to express F sð Þ as a sum of simpler functions, Fi sð Þ.
F sð Þ ¼ F1 sð Þ þ F2 sð Þ þ    þ Fi sð Þ þ    þ Fn sð Þ
Next, we use the transform pairs in Table 14.2-1 and properties in Table 14.2-2 to ﬁnd the inverse
Laplace transform of each Fi sð Þ. Finally, using linearity, we sum the inverse transforms of the Fi sð Þ to
obtain the inverse Laplace transform of F sð Þ.
When all of the poles of a proper rational function, F sð Þ, are simple poles, the partial fraction
expansion of F sð Þ is
F sð Þ ¼ N sð Þ

The partial fraction expansion has one term corresponding to each simple pole of F sð Þ. The coefﬁcients
Ri are called residues. Each residue, Ri, corresponds to the pole, pi, in the same term of Eq. 14.4-2. The
residue corresponding to a real pole is a real number. The residues corresponding to complex conjugate
poles are themselves complex conjugates. The values of the residues of simple poles are calulated as

Solution
Determining the inverse Laplace transform of V sð Þ requires a partial fraction expansion. Before we do that work,
let’s use the initial- and ﬁnal value theorems to see whether it is possible that V sð Þ, given in Eq. 14.5-3, can be the
Laplace transform v tð Þ shown in Figure 14.5-1.
From Figure 14.5-1, we see that the initial and ﬁnal values are

Because these initial and ﬁnal values agree, it is possible that V sð Þ, given in Eq. 14.5-3, can be the Laplace
transform of v tð Þ shown in Figure 14.5-1. It is now appropriate to determine the inverse Laplace transform of V sð Þ.
We can express V sð Þ as

We can solve a set of differential equations describing an electric circuit, using the Laplace transform of
a variable and its derivatives. Here’s the procedure:
1.
Use Kirchhoff’s laws and the element equations to represent the circuit by a differential equation or
set of differential equations.
2.
Transform each differential equation into an algebraic equation by taking the Laplace transform of
both sides of the equation.
3.
Solve the algebraic equations to obtain the Laplace transform of the output of the circuit.
4.
Take the inverse Laplace transform to obtain the circuit output itself.
The following example illustrates this procedure.

We have seen that we can represent a circuit in the time domain by differential equations and then use
the Laplace transform to transform the differential equations into algebraic equations. In this section, we
will see that we can represent a circuit in the frequency domain, using the Laplace transform, and then
analyze it using algebraic equations. This method will eliminate the need to write differential equations
to represent the circuit.

14. The Laplace Transform

Figure 14.7.1 shows the representation of the resistor in (a) the time domain and (b) the
complex frequency domain, using the Laplace transform. As the above equations suggest, the
time- and complex frequency-domain representations of the resistor are very similar.
The impedance of an element is deﬁned to be
Z sð Þ ¼ V sð Þ
I sð Þ
ð14:7-3Þ
provided all initial conditions are zero. Notice that the impedance is deﬁned in the complex
frequency domain, not in the time domain.
In the case of the resistor, there is no initial condition to set to zero. Comparing
Eqs. 14.7-1 and 14.7-2 shows that the impedance of the resistor is equal to the resistance.

To determine the impedance of the capacitor, set the initial condition v(0) to zero. Then, using

as the impedance of the capacitor.
Equation 14.7-5 is used to represent the capacitor in the complex frequency domain, as shown in
Figure 14.7-2b. The series connection of elements in Figure 14.7-2b corresponds to the sum of voltages
in Eq. 14.7-5. The current through the impedance in Figure 14.7-2b produces the ﬁrst voltage on the
right side of Eq. 14.7-5, whereas the voltage source in Figure 14.7-2b supplies the second voltage on the
right side of Eq. 14.7-5.

right side of Eq. 14.7-6. Notice that the reference direction for the current source in Figure 14.7-2b
was chosen to correspond to the minus sign in Eq. 14.7-6.

To determine the impedance of the inductor, set the initial condition i(0) to zero. Then, using
Eq. 14.7-3, we obtain
ZL sð Þ ¼ Ls
as the impedance of the inductor.
Equation 14.7-8 represents the inductor in the complex frequency domain, as shown in Figure
14.7-3b. The series connection of elements in Figure 14.7-3b corresponds to the sum of voltages in
Eq. 14.7-8.

Equation 14.7-9 represents the inductor in the complex frequency domain, as shown in Figure

in Eq. 14.7-9.
Table 14.7-1 tabulates the time- and frequency-domain representation of circuit elements. In
addition to resistors, capacitors, and inductors, Table 14.7-1 shows the frequency-domain representa-
tions of independent and dependent sources and of op amps. Independent sources are speciﬁed by
functions of time, i(t) and v(t), in the time domain and by the corresponding Laplace transforms, I(s) and
V(s), in the complex frequency domain. Dependent sources and op amps operate the same way in the
frequency domain as they do in the time domain.
To represent a circuit in the complex frequency domain, we replace the time-domain represen-
tation of each circuit element by its complex frequency-domain representation.
To ﬁnd the complete response of a linear circuit, we ﬁrst represent the circuit in the complex
frequency domain, using the Laplace transform. Next, we analyze the circuit, perhaps by writing
mesh or node equations. Finally, we use the inverse Laplace transform to represent the response in
the time domain.

INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 14.7-4. The input to the circuit is the voltage of the voltage source 24 V.
The output of this circuit, the voltage across the capacitor, is given by
vo tð Þ ¼ 16  12e0:6t V
when t > 0
ð14:7-10Þ
Determine the value of the capacitance C.
Solution
Before the switch closes, the circuit will be at steady state. Because the only input to this circuit is the constant
voltage of the voltage source, all of the element currents and voltages, including the capacitor voltage, will have
constant values. Closing the switch disturbs the circuit by shorting out the 18-V resistor. Eventually, the
disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. All the element currents and voltages will again
have constant values but, probably, different constant values than they had before the switch closed.
During the disturbance, the element voltages and currents are not constant. For example, Eq. 14.7-10
describes the capacitor voltage after the switch closes. Notice that there are two parts to the capacitor voltage. One
part, 12 e0.6t, dies out as the value of t increases. That part is called the transient part of the response, or just the
transient response. The other part, 16, does not die out and is the steady-state response. The sum of the transient
response and the steady-state response is called the complete response. The output voltage described by
Eq. 14.7-10 is a complete response of this circuit.
Figure 14.7-5 shows a plot of the capacitor voltage given by Eq. 14.7-10. Notice that the capacitor voltage is
continuous. This is expected because, in the absence of unbounded currents, the voltage of a capacitor must be
continuous. In particular, the value of the capacitor voltage immediately after the switch is closed is equal to the
value immediately before the switch is closed. From Figure 14.7-5, we see that at time t ¼ 0, when the switch
closes, the value of the capacitor voltage is vo 0
ð Þ ¼ 4 V.
How does the value of the capacitance C affect the capacitor voltage? To answer this question, we must
analyze the circuit. Because we want to determine the complete response, we will analyze the circuit using Laplace
transforms. Figure 14.7-6 shows the frequency-domain representation of the circuit. The closed switch is
represented by a short circuit. That short circuit is connected in parallel with the 18-V resistor. A short circuit
in parallel with a resistor is equivalent to a short circuit, so the closed switch and 18-V resistor have been replaced
by a single short circuit. The frequency-domain model of the capacitor consists of two parts, an impedance and a

INTERACTIVE EXAMPLE
Consider the circuit shown in Figure 14.7-7. The input to the circuit is
the voltage of the voltage source, 24 V. The output of this circuit, the
voltage across the 6-V resistor, is given by
vo tð Þ ¼ 12  6 e0:35t V
when t > 0
ð14:7-15Þ
Determine the value of the inductance L and of the resistances
R1 and R2.
Solution
Before the switch closes, the circuit will be at steady state. Because the only input to this circuit is the
constant voltage of the voltage source, all of the element currents and voltages, including the inductor
current, will have constant values. Closing the switch disturbs the circuit by shorting out the resistor R1.
Eventually, the disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. All the element currents and
voltages will again have constant values but, probably, different constant values than they had before the switch
closed.
Equation 14.7-15 describes the output voltage after the switch closes. Notice that there are two parts to this
voltage. One part, 6 e0.35t, dies out as the value of t increases. That part is called the transient part of the
response, or just the transient response. The other part, 12, does not die out and is the steady-state response. The
sum of the transient response and the steady-state response is called the complete response. The output voltage
described by Eq. 14.7-15 is the complete response of this circuit.
How do the values of the circuit parameters L, R1, and R2 affect the output voltage? To answer this question,
we must analyze the circuit. Because we want to determine the complete response, we will analyze using Laplace
transforms. The frequency-domain model of the inductor consists of two parts, an impedance and a voltage or
current source. The value of the voltage source voltage or current source current depends on the initial condition of
the inductor, that is, the inductor current at time t ¼ 0. We need to ﬁnd the initial inductor current before we can
represent the circuit, using Laplace transforms.

In the absence of unbounded voltages, the current in any inductor is continuous. Consequently, the value of the
inductor current immediately before t ¼ 0 is equal to the value immediately after t ¼ 0. To ﬁnd the initial inductor
current, we set t ¼ 0 in Eq. 14.7-16 to get i 0
ð Þ ¼ 1 A.
Figure 14.7-8 shows the frequency-domain representation of the

How can we ﬁnd R1? Resistor R1 is removed from the circuit
by closing the switch, but R1 was part of the circuit before the switch
closed. The initial inductor current depends on the value of the
resistance R1. The only input to the circuit in Figure 14.7-9 is a
constant, 24 V. Consequently, when the circuit is at steady state, the
inductor will act like a short circuit. Figure 14.7-9 shows the steady-
state circuit when the switch is open. The open switch is modeled as
an open circuit. The inductor is modeled as short circuit. Writing and

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 14.7-10a. The input to the circuit is the voltage of the voltage source 12 V.
The output of this circuit is the current in the inductor iL(t). Determine the current in the inductor iL(t), for t > 0.
Solution
Let’s write and solve mesh equations. The series circuits that represent the capacitor and inductor in the frequency
domain contain voltage sources rather than current sources. It’s easier to account for voltage sources than current
sources when writing mesh equations, so we choose the series representation for both the capacitor and inductor.
From Figure 14.7-10b, the initial conditions are vc 0
ð Þ ¼ 8 V and iL(0) ¼ 4 A. Figure 14.7-11b shows the

The transfer function of a circuit is deﬁned as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the
response of the circuit to the Laplace transform of the input to the circuit when the initial
conditions are zero.
For the circuit in Figure 14.8-1a, the input is the voltage source voltage v1(t), and the response is the
resistor voltage vo(t). The transfer function of this circuit, denoted by H(s), is then expressed as

14. The Laplace Transform

We can write Eq. 14.8-1 as
Vo sð Þ ¼ H sð ÞV1 sð Þ
ð14:8-2Þ
which says that the Laplace transform of the response is equal to the transfer function times the Laplace
transform of the input, provided all initial conditions are equal to zero. We are going to get tired of
saying “provided all initial conditions are equal to zero.” A response subject to the requirement that all
initial conditions be zero is called a zero-state response. With this terminology, we can read Eq. 14.8-1
as “the transfer function is the ratio of the Laplace transform of the zero-state response to the Laplace
transform of the input.” Similarly, we can read Eq. 14.8-2 as “the Laplace transform of the zero-state
response is the product of the transfer function and the Laplace transform of the input.”
Two special cases are very signiﬁcant. When the input is a unit step function, then
V1 sð Þ ¼ l u tð Þ
½
 ¼ 1
s
and Eq. 14.8-2 becomes
Vo sð Þ ¼ H sð Þ
s
In this case, the zero-state response is called the step response, that is,
step response ¼ l1 H sð Þ
s
	

ð14:8-3Þ
When the input is an impulse function, then
V1 sð Þ ¼ l d tð Þ
½
 ¼ 1
and Eq. 14.8-2 becomes
Vo sð Þ ¼ H sð Þ
In this case, the zero-state response is called the impulse response, that is,
impulse response ¼ l1 H sð Þ
½

ð14:8-4Þ
It is important to notice that both the step response and the impulse response are zero-state responses;
that is, all initial conditions are set to zero.
Both the input to a circuit and the response of the circuit can be either a current or a voltage. When
the input is a current and the response is a voltage, the transfer function is called an impedance.
Similarly, when the input is a voltage and the response is a current, the transfer function is called an
admittance. This terminology is consistent with our previous use of the term impedance. For example,
consider the row of Table 14.7-1 corresponding to the capacitor. Consider the frequency-domain
representation of the capacitor that contains a voltage source. The restriction that the initial condition be
zero, v 0
ð Þ ¼ 0, causes the voltage source to be a zero voltage source, that is, a short circuit. The
frequency-domain representation of the capacitor is reduced to a single element. When capacitor current
is the input and the capacitor voltage is the response, then the impedance of the capacitor is
ZC sð Þ ¼ V sð Þ
I sð Þ ¼ 1
Cs
ð14:8-5Þ
Next, consider the frequency-domain representation of the capacitor that contains a current source. The
restrictionthat theinitial condition bezero, v 0
ð Þ ¼ 0, causes the current source to bea zero current source, that
is, an open circuit. The frequency-domain representation of the capacitor is again reduced to a single element.
Once again, the impedance of the capacitor is given by Eq. 14.8-5.
A similar argument shows that setting the initial conditions to zero simpliﬁes the frequency-
domain representation of the inductor to the single impedance,

Instead of calculating the step response directly, we can ﬁrst determine the transfer function of the circuit in

function, represent the circuit in the complex frequency domain as shown in Figure 14.8-4. (The circuit in
Figure 14.8-4 is similar to the circuit in Figure 14.8-3. The input voltages are labeled differently because we

We’ll attempt to solve this problem by ﬁnding the transfer function twice, once from the circuit and once from the
step response. Next, we’ll compare the two transfer functions and try to choose values for R, L, C, R1, and R2 that
cause the two transfer functions to be equal to each other.
We’ll begin by determining the transfer function of the circuit from Figure 14.8-5a. Since all the initial
conditions are set to zero when determining the transfer function, we represent the circuit from Figure 14.8-5a in

In this section, we consider the problem of determining the response of a
linear, time-invariant circuit to an arbitrary input, x tð Þ. This situation is
illustrated in Figure 14.9-1, in which x tð Þ is the input to the circuit, y tð Þ is the
output of the circuit, and h tð Þ is the impulse response of the circuit. We will
assume that x tð Þ ¼ 0 when t < 0 because t ¼ 0 is the time at which the input
is ﬁrst applied to the circuit and that h tð Þ ¼ 0 when t < 0 because the impulse
response cannot precede the impulse that caused it.
It’s important to us that the circuit is both linear and time-invariant. To see why, let’s use the
notation
x tð Þ ! y tð Þ
to indicate that the input x tð Þ causes the output y tð Þ. Let k be any constant. Because the circuit is linear,
k x tð Þ ! k y tð Þ
(Suppose k ¼ 2. The input 2x tð Þ is twice as large as the input x tð Þ, and it causes an output twice as large as the
output caused by x tð Þ.) Next, let t any constant. Because the circuit is time-invariant,
x t  t
ð
Þ ! y t  t
ð
Þ
(Suppose t ¼ 4 s. The input x t  4
ð
Þ is delayed by 4 s with respect to x tð Þ and causes an output that is
delayed by 4 s with respect to y tð Þ.) Because the circuit is both linear and time-invariant, we have
k x t  t
ð
Þ ! k y t  t
ð
Þ
Next, we use the fact that h tð Þ is the impulse response of the circuit. Consequently, when the input to the
circuit is x tð Þ ¼ d tð Þ, the output is y tð Þ ¼ h tð Þ. That is,
y(t)
h(t)
x(t)

Consider the arbitrary input waveform x tð Þ shown in Figure 14.9-2(a). This waveform can be
approximated by a series of pulses as shown in Figure 14.9-2(b). The times, t1; t2; t3; . . . are uniformly
spaced, that is,
tiþ1 ¼ ti þ Dt for i ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . .
where the increment Dt is independent of the index i. The error in the approximation is small when the
increment Dt is chosen to be small.
Figure 14.9-3(a) shows one of the pulses from the approximation of the input waveform. Notice
that the area of the pulse is x ti
ð ÞDt. When the time increment Dt is chosen to be small, this pulse can be
approximated by the impulse function having the same area, x ti
ð ÞDtd t  ti
ð
Þ. That impulse function is
illustrated in Figure 14.9-3(b).

Equation 14.9-5 indicates that the output of the linear circuit in Figure 14.9-1 can be obtained as the
convolution of the input and the impulse response.
MATLAB provides a function called conv that performs convolution. The next example uses this
MATLAB function to obtain a plot of the output of a linear, time-invariant circuit.

Solution
Figure 14-9.5 shows a MATLAB script that produces the required plot.
The comments included in the MATLAB script indicate that the problem is
solved in four steps:
1.
Obtain a list of equally spaced instants of time.
2.
Obtain the input x tð Þ and the impulse response h tð Þ.
3.
Perform the convolution.
4.
Plot the output y tð Þ.

14. The Laplace Transform

This equation is implemented by an “if-then-else” block in the MATLAB script. For any time, ti, this equation
produces the corresponding value x ti
ð Þ. From Eq. 14.9-2, we see that the strengths of the impulse inputs are x ti
ð ÞDt
rather than x ti
ð Þ. It is necessary to multiply the values x ti
ð Þ by the time increment, and that is accomplished by the
line “x = xdt” in the MATLAB script.

A circuit is said to be stable when the response to a bounded input signal is a bounded output
signal. A circuit that is not stable is said to be unstable.
Producing a bounded response to a bounded input is pretty reasonable behavior. As a general rule of
thumb, stable circuits are potentially useful, and unstable circuits are potentially dangerous. When we
analyze a circuit to see whether it is stable, we are probably trying to do one of two things. First, we may
be checking a circuit to see whether it is useful. We will reject the circuit if it is unstable. Second, we
may be trying to specify values of the circuit parameters in such a way as to make the circuit stable.
Consider a circuit represented by the transfer function H(s). Factoring the denominator of the
transfer function gives
H sð Þ ¼
N sð Þ
s  p1
ð
Þ s  p2
ð
Þ    s  pN
ð
Þ
The pi are the poles of the transfer function, also called the poles of the circuit. The poles may have real
values or complex values. Complex poles appear in complex conjugate pairs; for example, if 2 þ j3 is
a pole, then 2  j3 must also be a pole.
A circuit is stable if, and only if, all of its poles have negative real parts.
Next, the MATLAB plot function requires two lists of values, t and y, in our case. These lists are required to
have the same number of values, but in our case, y is longer than t. The MATLAB expression “(1:length(t))”
truncates the list y, so that truncated list is the same length as t.
Finally, the plot produced by the MATLAB script is shown in Figure 14.9-6.

14. The Laplace Transform

(Real poles must have negative values.) Another way of saying the same thing is that a circuit is stable
if, and only if, all of its poles lie in the left half of the s-plane.
We can also use the impulse response h(t) to determine whether a circuit is stable. A circuit is
stable if, and only if, its impulse response satisﬁes
lim
t!1 jh tð Þj ¼ 0
Let’s check that our two tests for stability, one in terms of H(s) and the other in terms of h(t), are
equivalent. For convenience, suppose that all of the poles of H(s) have real values. The corresponding
impulse response is given by
h tð Þ ¼ l1 H sð Þ

If the circuit is unstable, then at least one of the poles has a positive value, for example, p4 ¼ 6.
Consequently, the impulse response includes the term A4e6t and
A4e6t

 ! 1 as t ! 1, so
lim
t!1 jh tð Þj ¼ 1. On the other hand, if the circuit is stable, all of the poles have negative values.
Each jAie pitj ! 0 as t ! 1, so lim
t!1 jh tð Þj ¼ 0.
The network function H(o) of a stable circuit can be obtained from its transfer function H(s) by
letting s ¼ jo.

MATLAB provides a function called residue that performs the partial fraction expansion of a transfer
function. Consider a transfer function
H sð Þ ¼ b3s3 þ b2s2 þ b1s1 þ b0s0
a3s3 þ a2s2 þ a1s1 þ a0s0
ð14:11-1Þ
In Eq. 14.11-1, the transfer function is represented as a ratio of two polynomials in s. In MATLAB, the
transfer function given in Eq. 14.11-1 can be represented by two lists. One list speciﬁes the coefﬁcients
of the numerator polynomial, and the other list speciﬁes the coefﬁcients of the denominator polynomial.
For example,
num ¼ b3
b2
b1
b0
½

and
den ¼ a3
a2
a1
a0
½

(In this case, both polynomials are third-order polynomials, but the order of these polynomials could be
changed.)
Partial fraction expansion can represent H(s) as
H sð Þ ¼
R1
s  p1
þ
R2
s  p2
þ
R3
s  p3
þ k sð Þ
ð14:11-2Þ
R1, R2, and R3 are called residues, and p1, p2, and p3 are the poles. In general, both the residues and poles
can be complex numbers. The term k(s) will, in general, be a polynomial in s. MATLAB represents this
form of the transfer function by three lists:
R ¼ R1
R2
R3
½

is a list of the residues,
p ¼ p1
p2
p3
½

is a list of the poles, and
k ¼ c2
c1
c0
½

is a list of the coefﬁcients of the polynomial k(s).
The MATLAB command
R, p, k
½
 ¼ residue
num, den
ð
Þ
performs the partial fraction expansion, calculating the poles and residues from the coefﬁcients of the
numerator and denominator polynomials. The MATLAB command
n, d
½
 ¼ residue R, p, k
ð
Þ
performs the reverse operation, calculating the coefﬁcients of the numerator and denominator
polynomials from the poles and residues.

Next, we will use MATLAB to do the partial fraction expansion. First, enter the numerator and denominator
polynomials as vectors listing the coefﬁcients in order of decreasing power of s:
>>num = [12 78 ];
>>den = [1 8 52 ];
Now the command
>>[r, p ] = residue(num, den)
tells MATLAB to do the partial fraction expansion return p, a list of the poles of V sð Þ, and r, a list of the
corresponding residues. In the present case, MATLAB returns
r =
6.0000  2.5000i
6.0000 þ 2.5000i
p =
4.0000 þ 6.0000i

ð
Þ þ

s  4  j6
ð
Þ
Notice that the ﬁrst residue corresponds to the ﬁrst pole and the second residue corresponds to the second pole.
(Also, we expect complex poles to occur in pairs of complex conjugates and for the residues corresponding to
complex conjugate poles to themselves be complex conjugates.) Taking the inverse Laplace transform, we get

This expression, containing as it does complex numbers, isn’t very convenient. Fortunately, we can use Euler’s
identity to obtain an equivalent expression that does not contain complex numbers. Because complex poles occur
quite frequently, it’s worthwhile to consider the general case:

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of

State the Goal
Determine a value of L so that the time period for the current i1(t) to attain a value of 0.1 A is less than 3 s.
Generate a Plan

Determine the initial conditions for the two inductor currents and the capacitor voltage.
2.
Designate two mesh currents and write the two mesh KVL equations, using the Laplace transform of the
variables and the impedance of each element.
3.
Select a trial value of L and solve for I1(s).
4.
Determine i1(t).
5.
Sketch i1(t) and determine the time instant t1 when i1(t1) ¼ 0.1 A.
6.
Check whether t1 < 3 s, and, if not, return to step 3 and select another value of L.

Second, redraw the circuit for t > 0 as shown in Figure 14.13-3 and designate the two mesh currents i1 and i2 as
shown.
Recall that the impedance is Ls for an inductor and 1=Cs for a capacitor. We must account for the initial

The third step requires the selection of the value of L and then solving for I1(s). Examine Figure 14.13-3; the two

14. The Laplace Transform

14.14
S U M M A R Y
Pierre-Simon Laplace is credited with a transform that bears
his name. The Laplace transform is deﬁned as
l f tð Þ
½
 ¼
Z 1
0
f tð Þest dt
The Laplace transform transforms the differential equation
describing a circuit in the time domain into an algebraic
equation in the complex frequency domain. After solving the
algebraic equation, we use the inverse Laplace transform to
obtain the circuit response in the time domain. Figure14.2-1
illustrates this process.
Tables 14.2-1 tabulates frequently used Laplace transform
pairs. Table 14.2-2 tabulates some properties of the Laplace
transform.
The inverse Laplace transform is obtained using partial
fraction expansion.
Table 14.7-1 shows that circuits can be represented in the
frequency domain in a manner that accounts for the initial
conditions of capacitors and inductors.
To ﬁnd the complete response of a linear circuit, we ﬁrst
represent the circuit in the frequency domain using the Laplace
transform. Next, we analyze the circuit, perhaps by writing mesh
or node equations. Finally, we use the inverse Laplace transform
to represent the response in the time domain.
The transfer function H(s) of a circuit is deﬁned as the ratio of
the response Y(s) of the circuit to an excitation X(s) expressed
in the complex frequency domain.
H sð Þ ¼ Y sð Þ
X sð Þ
This ratio is obtained assuming all initial conditions are
equal to zero.
The step response is the response of a circuit to a step input
when all initial conditions are zero. Then step response is
related to the transfer function by
step response ¼ l1 H sð Þ
s
	

The impulse response is the response of a circuit to an
impulse input when all initial conditions are zero. The
impulse response is related to the transfer function by
impulse response ¼ l1 H sð Þ
½

A circuit is said to be stable when the response to a bounded
input signal is a bounded output signal. All the poles of the
transfer function of a stable circuit lie in the left-half s-plane.
MATLAB performs partial fraction expansion.
Therefore, using the inverse Laplace transform for each term, we obtain
i1 tð Þ ¼ 1=8  1=8
ð
Þe4t  1=2
ð
Þte2t A
t  0
Verify the Proposed Solution
The sketch of i1(t) is shown in Figure 14.13-4. It is clear that i1(t) has essentially reached a steady-state value of
0.125 A by t ¼ 4 seconds.
To ﬁnd t1 when
i1 t1
ð Þ ¼ 0:1 A
we estimate that t1 is approximately 2 seconds. After evaluating i1(t) for a few selected values of t near 2 seconds,
we ﬁnd that t1 ¼ 1.8 seconds. Therefore, the design requirements are satisﬁed for L ¼ 1 H. Of course, other suitable
values of L can be determined that will satisfy the design requirements.

P 14.7-19 All new homes are required to install a device
called a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) that will
provide protection from shock. By monitoring the current
going to and returning from a receptacle, a GFCI senses
when normal ﬂow is interrupted and switches off the power
in 1=40 second. This is particularly important if you are
holding an appliance shorted through your body to ground.
A circuit model of the GFCI acting to interrupt a short is shown
in Figure P 14.7-19. Find the current ﬂowing through the
person and the appliance, i(t), for t  0 when the short is
initiated at t ¼ 0. Assume v ¼ 160 cos 400t and the capacitor

P 14.8-11 Engineers had avoided inductance in long-
distance circuits because it slows transmission. Oliver Heavi-
side proved that the addition of inductance to a circuit could
enable it to transmit without distortion. George A. Campbell of
the Bell Telephone Company designed the ﬁrst practical induc-
tanceloadingcoils,inwhichtheinducedﬁeldofeachwindingof
wire reinforced that of its neighbors so that the coil supplied
proportionally more inductance than resistance. Each one of
Campbell’s 300 test coils added 0.11 H and 12 V at regular
intervals along 35 miles of telephone wire (Nahin, 1990). The
loading coil balanced the effect of the leakage between the
telephone wires represented by R and C in Figure P 14.8-11.

This chapter introduces the Fourier series and the Fourier transform. The Fourier series represents a
nonsinusoidal periodic waveform as a sum of sinusoidal waveforms. The Fourier series is useful to
us in two ways:
 The Fourier series shows that a periodic waveform consists of sinusoidal components at different
frequencies. That allows us to think about the way in which the waveform is distributed in frequency.
For example, we can give meaning to such expressions as “the high-frequency part of a square wave.”
 We can use superposition to ﬁnd the steady-state response of a circuit to an input represented by a
Fourier series and, thus, determine the steady-state response of the circuit to the periodic waveform.
We obtain the Fourier transform as a generalization of the Fourier series, taking the limit as the period of a
periodic wave becomes inﬁnite. The Fourier transform is useful to us in two ways:
 The Fourier transform represents an aperiodic waveform in the frequency domain. That allows us to
think about the way in which the waveform is distributed in frequency. For example, we can give
meaning to such expressions as “the high-frequency part of a pulse.”
 We can represent both the input to a circuit and the circuit itself in the frequency domain: the input
represented by its Fourier transform and the circuit represented by its network function. The
frequency-domain representation of circuit output is obtained as the product of the Fourier transform
of the input and the network function of the circuit.
15.2
T h e F o u r i e r S e r i e s
Baron Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier proposed in 1807 that any periodic function could be expressed
as an inﬁnite sum of simple sinusoids. This surprising claim predicts that even discontinuous
741

periodic waveforms, such as square waves, can be represented using only sinusoids. In 1807,
Fourier’s claim was controversial. Such famous mathematicians as Pierre Simon de Laplace and
Joseph Louis Lagrange doubted the validity of Fourier’s representation of periodic functions. In
1828, Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet presented a set of conditions sufﬁcient to guarantee the
convergence of Fourier’s series. Today, the Fourier series is a standard tool for scientists and
engineers.
Let’s consider periodic functions. The function f (t) is periodic if there exists a delay t such that
f tð Þ ¼ f t  t
ð
Þ
ð15:2-1Þ
for every value of t. This value of t not unique. In particular, if t satisﬁes Eq. 15.2-1, then every
integer multiple of t also satisﬁes Eq. 15.2-1. In other words, if t satisﬁes Eq 15.2-1 and k is any
integer, then
f tð Þ ¼ f t  kt
ð
Þ
for every value of t. To uniquely deﬁne the period T of the periodic function f (t), we let T be the
smallest positive value of t that satisﬁes Eq. 15.2-1.
Next, we use the period T to deﬁne the fundamental frequency o0 of the periodic function f (t),
o0 ¼ 2p
T
ð15:2-2Þ
The fundamental frequency has units of rad/s. Integer multiples of the fundamental frequency are called
harmonic frequencies.
A periodic function f (t) can be represented by an inﬁnite series of harmonically related sinusoids,
called the (trigonometric) Fourier series, as follows:
f tð Þ ¼ a0 þ
X
1
n¼1
an cos n o0t þ
X
1
n¼1
bn sin n o0t
ð15:2-3Þ
where o0 is the fundamental frequency and the (real) coefﬁcients, and a0, an, and bn are called the Fourier
trigonometric coefﬁcients. The Fourier trigonometric coefﬁcients can be calculated using

The conditions presented by Dirichlet are sufﬁcient to guarantee the convergence of the trigono-
metric Fourier series given in Eq. 15.2-3. The Dirichlet conditions require that the periodic function
f (t) satisﬁes the following mathematical properties:
1.
f (t) is a single-valued function except at possibly a ﬁnite number of points.
2.
f (t) is absolutely integrable, that is,
Z t0þT

15. Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

3.
f (t) has a ﬁnite number of discontinuities within the period T.
4.
f (t) has a ﬁnite number of maxima and minima within the period T.
For our purposes, f (t) will represent a voltage or current waveform, and any voltage or current
waveform that we can actually produce will certainly satisfy the Dirichlet conditions. We shall assume
that the Dirichlet conditions previously listed are always satisﬁed for periodic voltage or current
waveforms.
A Fourier series is an accurate representation of a periodic signal and consists of the sum of
sinusoids at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies.
Given a periodic voltage or current waveform, we can obtain the Fourier representation of that
voltage or current in four steps:
Step 1
Determine the period T and the fundamental frequency o0.
Step2
Represent the voltage or current waveform as a function of t over one complete period.
Step 3
Use Eqs. 15.2-4, 5 and 6 to determine the Fourier trigonometric coefﬁcients a0, an,
and bn.
Step 4
Substitute the coefﬁcients a0, an, and bn obtained in Step 3 into Eq. 15.2-3.
The following example illustrates this four-step procedure.

Fourier Series of a Full-wave
Rectiﬁed Cosine
Figure 15.2-1 shows a full-wave rectiﬁer having a cosine input. The output of a full-wave input is the absolute value
of its input, shown in Figure 15.2-2. A full-wave rectiﬁer is an electronic circuit often used as a component of such
diverse products as power supplies and AM radio receivers. Determine the Fourier series of the periodic waveform
shown in Figure 15.2-2.

Step 2: Equations 15.2-4, 5, and 6 require integration over one full period of vo(t). We are free to choose the starting
point of that period, to, to make the integration as easy as possible. Often, we choose to integrate either from 0 to T
or from T=2 to T=2. In this example, the periodic waveform can be represented as

Equation 15.2-8 represents the rectiﬁed cosine by its Fourier series, but this equation is complicated enough to
make us wonder what we have accomplished. How can we be sure that Eq. 15.2-8 actually represents a rectiﬁed
cosine? Figure 15.2-3 shows a MATLAB script that plots the Fourier series given in Eq. 15.2-8. In particular, notice
how the coefﬁcients a0, an, and bn determined in step 3 are used in the MATLAB script. The plot produced by this
MATLAB script is shown in Figure 15.2-4. The waveform in Figure 15.2-4 is indeed a rectiﬁed cosine having the
correct amplitude, 5 volts, and correct period,
p
20 ﬃ0:16 seconds. Thus, we see that Eq. 15.2-8 does indeed
represent the rectiﬁed cosine.

To distinguish between the two forms of the trigonometric Fourier series, we will refer to the series
given in Eq. 15.2-3 as the sine-cosine Fourier series and to the series given in Eq. 15.2-13 as the
amplitude-phase Fourier series.
In general, it is easier to calculate an and bn than it is to calculate the coefﬁcients cn and yn. We will
see in Section 15.3 that this is particularly true when f (t) is symmetric. On the other hand, the Fourier
series involving cn is more convenient for calculating the steady-state response of a linear circuit to a
periodic input.

Four types of symmetry can be readily recognized and then used to simplify the task of calculating
the Fourier coefﬁcients. They are the following:
1.
Even-function symmetry.
2.
Odd-function symmetry.
3.
Half-wave symmetry.
4.
Quarter-wave symmetry.
A function is even when f tð Þ ¼ f t
ð
Þ, and a function is odd when f tð Þ ¼ f t
ð
Þ. The function
shown in Figure 15.2-2 is an even function. For even functions, all bn ¼ 0 and
an ¼ 4

Z T=2

For odd functions, all an ¼ 0 and
bn ¼ 4
T
Z T=2

f tð Þ sin no0t dt
An example of an odd function is sin o0t. Another odd function is shown in Figure 15.3-1.
Half-wave symmetry for a function f (t) is obtained when
f tð Þ ¼ f
t  T



ð15:3-1Þ
In these half-wave symmetric waveforms, the second half of each period looks like the ﬁrst half turned
upside down. The function shown in Figure 15.3-2 has half-wave symmetry. If a function has half-wave
750
15. Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

symmetry, then both an and bn are zero for even values of n. We see that a0 ¼ 0 for half-wave symmetry
because the average value of the function over one period is zero.
Quarter-wave symmetry describes a function that has half-wave symmetry and, in addition, has
symmetry about the midpoint of the positive and negative half-cycles. An example of an odd function
with quarter-wave symmetry is shown in Figure 15.3-1. If a function is odd and has quarter-wave
symmetry, then a0 ¼ 0; an ¼ 0 for all n, bn ¼ 0 for even n. For odd n, bn is given by
bn ¼ 8

The calculation of the Fourier coefﬁcients and the associated effects of symmetry of the
waveform f (t) are summarized in Table 15.3-1. Often, the calculation of the Fourier series can be
simpliﬁed by judicious selection of the origin (t ¼ 0) because the analyst usually has the choice to select
this point arbitrarily.

Symmetry and the Fourier Series
Determine the Fourier series for the triangular waveform v(t) shown

The fundamental frequency is

Step 2: If we don’t take advantage of the symmetry of the triangle waveform, determining the Fourier coefﬁcients
a0, an, and bn will require integration over a full period—either from 0 to T or from T=2 to T=2. Accordingly, we
can represent v(t) from time T=2 to T, that is, from p=8 to p=2 seconds. By writing equations for the various

If we take advantage of symmetry, we will need to integrate only from 0 to T=2, that is, from 0 to p=8 seconds. If we
need to represent v(t) only from 0 to p=8 seconds, we don’t have to write equations for so many straight-line
segments. In this case, we need to write the equation only for one straight line to represent v(t) as

Table 15.4-1 provides the trigonometric Fourier series for several frequently encountered waveforms.
Each of the waveforms in Table 15.4-1 is represented using two parameters: A is the amplitude of the
waveform, and T is the period of the waveform.
Figure 15.4-1 shows a voltage waveform that is similar to, but not exactly the same as, a
waveform in Table 15.4-1. To obtain a Fourier series for the voltage waveform, we select the Fourier
series of the similar waveform from Table 15.4-1 and then do four things:
1.
Set the value of A equal to the amplitude of the voltage waveform.
2.
Add a constant to the Fourier series of the voltage waveform to adjust its average value.

Using Euler’s identity, we can derive the exponential form of the Fourier series from the trigono-

Þ=2 ¼ 0:5 V. We change the constant term of the Fourier series from 2.5 to 0.5 to
adjust its average value. This is equivalent to subtracting 2 from the Fourier series, corresponding to shifting the

15. Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

MATLAB has a built-in function called FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) that can be used to
calculate the coefﬁcients of the exponential Fourier series. Figure 15.5-4 shows a MATLAB function
called EFS (for Exponential Fourier Series) that uses FFT to calculate the coefﬁcients of the exponential
Fourier series of a periodic function. (EFS follows closely the discussion of Fourier series in Chapter 22
of Hanselman and Littleﬁeld, 2005.) Notice that EFS does not include a description of the periodic
function. Instead, EFS calls a MATLAB function named my_periodic_function. We describe our
periodic function f (t) in the MATLAB function my_periodic_function. As a result, EFS can be used,
unchanged, to ﬁnd the Fourier series coefﬁcients of a variety of periodic functions when we make
appropriate changes to my_periodic_function.
The word function is being used in two different ways. First, we have the mathematical function,
for instance, f (t) as a function of t. Second, we have the MATLAB function, a type of computer
program. Although different, these two types of function can be related. In the present case, the
MATLAB function my_periodic_function implements the mathematical function f (t) by providing the
value of f corresponding to any particular value of t.
The following examples show how to use the MATLAB function EFS to ﬁnd the exponential
Fourier series of periodic functions.
Solution
The average value of v(t) is zero, so C0 = 0. Then, using Eq. 15.5-9, with t0 ¼ T=2, we obtain

Using MATLAB
Determine the exponential Fourier series for the function f (t) shown in Figure 15.5-1, using MATLAB.
Solution
We need to write the MATLAB function, my_periodic_function, shown in Figure 15.5-5. The inputs to this
function are t, a list of times distributed evenly over one period, and T, the period. Let t(k) denote the kth time in the
list t and let f(k) denote the value of the periodic function at time t(k). The output of my_periodic_function is a list f
of the k values f(k). The for-loop in Figure 15.5-5 indexes through the k times, t(k), and the if-block determines the
value of f(k) corresponding to each t(k).

Similarly, the phase spectrum appears as a series of equally spaced lines with heights proportional to

Using MATLAB to Plot the Fourier Spectrum
Use MATLAB to plot the amplitude spectrum for the pulse waveform v(t) in Figure 15.6-1 when A ¼ 8 V, T ¼ 20
seconds, and d ¼ T=10.
Solution
We can use the MATLAB program shown in Figure 15.6-3 to plot the spectrum after doing the following three things:
1.
Specify the values of T and N in the second and third lines. T is the period in seconds and N determines
the number of harmonic frequencies used when plotting the spectrum. The n in no0 varies from N to N.
The values given in Figure 15.6-3 do not need to be changed.

It is often desired to determine the response of a circuit excited by a periodic input signal vs(t). We can
represent vs(t) by a Fourier series and then ﬁnd the response of the circuit to the fundamental and each
harmonic. Assuming the circuit is linear and the principle of superposition holds, we can consider that
the total response is the sum of the response to the dc term, the fundamental, and each harmonic.
2.
Provide a MATLAB function named my_periodic_function that describes the pulse train shown in Figure
15.6-1. Figure 15.6-4 provides the required MATLAB function. The inputs to this function are t, a list of time
distributed evenly over one period, and T, the period. Let t(k) denote the kth time in the list t and let f(k) denote
the value of the periodic function at time t(k). The output of my_periodic_function is a list f of the k values f(k).
The for-loop indexes through the k times t(k), and the if-block determines the value of f(k) corresponding to
each t(k). (When f (t) is discontinuous at time t, we will take f t
ð Þ to be the average of the limits of f (t) as t
approaches t from above and from below.)
3.
Make any desired changes to the plotting statements at the end of the program. The statement
stem N : N; abs Cn

plots the amplitude spectrum. Change abs(Cn) to angle(Cn) to plot the angle spectrum. Also, the plot labels can
be changed as desired. In this case, no changes are required.

We will ﬁnd the steady-state response vo(t) using superposition. It is helpful to let vsn(t) denote the term of vs(t)
corresponding to n. In this example, vs(t) has four terms, corresponding to n ¼ 0, 1, 3, and 5. Then,
vs tð Þ ¼ vs0 tð Þ þ vs1 tð Þ þ vs3 tð Þ þ vs5 tð Þ
where
vs0 tð Þ ¼ 1
2 ; vs1 tð Þ ¼ 2
p cos 2t;
vs3 tð Þ ¼  2
3p cos 6t;
and
vs5 tð Þ ¼ 2
5p cos 10t
Figure 15.7-2 illustrates the way superposition is used in this example. First, because the series connection of
the voltage sources with voltages vs0(t), vs1(t), vs3(t), and vs5(t) is equivalent to a single voltage source having
voltage vs(t) ¼ vs0(t) þ vs1(t) þ vs3(t) þ vs5(t), the circuit shown in Figure 15.7-2b is equivalent to the circuit shown
in Figure 15.7-2a.
Next, the principle of superposition is invoked to break the problem up into four simpler problems, as
shown in Figure 15.7-2c. Each circuit in Figure 15.7-2c is used to calculate the steady-state response to a
single one of the voltage sources from Figure 15.7-2b. (When calculating the response to one voltage source,
the other voltage sources are set to zero; that is, they are replaced by short circuits.) For example, the voltage
vo3(t) is the steady-state response to vs3(t) alone. Superposition tells us that the response to all four voltage
sources working together is the sum of the responses to the four voltage sources working separately, that is,
vo tð Þ ¼ vo0 tð Þ þ vo1 tð Þ þ vo3 tð Þ þ vo5 tð Þ

15. Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

The advantage of breaking the problem up into four simpler problems is that the input to each of the four
circuits in Figure 15.7-2c is a sinusoid. The problem of ﬁnding the steady-state response to a periodic input has been
reduced to the simpler problem of ﬁnding the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. The steady-state response
of a linear circuit to a sinusoidal input can be found using phasors. In Figure 15.7-2d, the four circuits from Figure
15.7-2c have been redrawn using phasors and impedances. The impedance of the capacitor is
Zc ¼
1
jno0C
for n ¼ 0; 1; 3; 5
Each of the four circuits corresponds to a different value of n, so the impedance of the capacitor is different in each
of the circuits. (The frequency of the input sinusoid is no0, so each of the circuits corresponds to a different
frequency.) Notice that when n ¼ 0, Zc ¼ 1 and, therefore, the capacitor acts like an open circuit. The four circuits
shown in Figure 15.7-2d are very similar. In each case, voltage division can be used to write
Von ¼
1= jno0C
ð
Þ
R þ 1= jno0C
ð

for n ¼ 0; 1; 3; 5
where Vsn is the phasor corresponding to vsn(t) and Von is the phasor corresponding to von(t). So,

The circuit simulation program PSpice (Perry, 1998) provides built-in procedures that make it easy to
ﬁnd the Fourier series of any periodic voltage or current in a simulated circuit. To ﬁnd a Fourier series
using PSpice, we will need to do ﬁve things:
Next, the steady-state response can be written as

for n ¼ 1; 3; 5
ﬀVsn ¼ 0
for n ¼ 0; 1; 5
and ﬀVsn ¼ 180
for n ¼ 3
Therefore;

vo3 tð Þ ¼ 0:018 cos 6t þ 95
ð

Finally, the steady-state response of the original circuit vo(t) is found by adding up the partial responses,

ð

It is important to notice that superposition justiﬁes adding the functions of time vo0(t), vo1(t), vo3(t), and vo5(t) to get
vo(t). The phasors Vo0, Vo1, Vo3, and Vo5 each correspond to a different frequency. A sum of these phasors has no
meaning.

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 15.8-1a. The input to this circuit is the voltage of the voltage source vi(t). The
output of the circuit is the voltage vo(t) across the 10-kV resistor. The input vi(t) is the periodic voltage shown in
Figure 15.8-1b. The output vo(t) will also be a periodic voltage. Use PSpice to represent both vi(t) and vo(t) by
Fourier series.

Step 1: Represent the circuit and its input in the PSpice workspace.
PSpice refers to circuit elements as parts. Open a new project in PSpice. Place the parts in the PSpice
workspace, adjust the resistance and capacitance values, and wire the parts together (Svoboda, 2007). The resulting
PSpice circuit is shown in Figure 15.8-2. The voltage source in Figure 15.8-1a corresponds to a PSpice part called
Using PSpice to Determine the Fourier Series

VPULSE. Figure 15.8-3 shows the symbol for this part together with the voltage waveform that it produces. A
VPULSE part is speciﬁed by providing values for the parameters v1, v2, td, tr, tf, pw, and per. The meaning of each
parameter is seen by examining Figure 15.8-3b. The pulse waveform will simulate the triangle wave when pw is
speciﬁed to make the time that voltage remains equal to v2 negligibly small, and per is speciﬁed to make the time
that voltage remains equal to v1 negligibly small. An appropriate set of parameter values to simulate the input
voltage vi(t) is
v1 ¼ 2 V; v2 ¼ 6 V; td ¼ 2 ms; tr ¼ 8 ms; tf ¼ 8 ms; pw ¼ 1 ns; and per ¼ 16 ms:
(PSpice requires pw > 0 so we cannot use pw = 0. Instead, a value much smaller than both tr and tf is used.)

Step 2: Specify a time domain simulation having a duration that is long enough to include one full period after all

Select PSpice/New Simulation Proﬁle from the PSpice menus to pop up the New Simulation dialog box.
Specify a simulation name and then select Create to pop up the Simulation Settings dialog box as shown in Figure

click OK to close the Simulation Settings dialog box and return to the PSpice workspace.
Step 4: Simulate the circuit.
Select PSpice/Run from the PSpice menus to run the simulation.
Step 5: Interpret the PSpice output.
After a successful Time Domain(Transient) simulation, Probe, the graphical post-processor for PSpice, will
open automatically in a Schematics window. Select View/Output File from the Schematics menus. Scroll through
the output ﬁle to ﬁnd the Fourier coefﬁcients of the input voltage shown in Figure 15.8-6. (PSpice changed the
name of the input voltage. We used the name V(V1:+) in the Output Variables text box in the Transient Output File
Options dialog box in Figure 15.8-5. Nonetheless, PSpice used the name V(N00230) in Figure 15.8-6.) The table in
Figure 15.8-6 has six columns and eight rows. The eight rows correspond to the eight coefﬁcients c1, c2, c3, . . . c8.
(There are eight rows because N ¼ 8 was the number entered in the Number of Harmonics text box in the Transient
Output File Options dialog box in Figure 15.8-5.) The ﬁrst column labels the rows with the subscripts, n, of these
coefﬁcients. The second column lists the frequencies, no0, using units of Hertz. The third column lists the
coefﬁcients c1, c2, c3, . . . c8. The fourth column lists the normalized coefﬁcients c1=c1 ¼ 1; c2=c1,
c3=c1; . . . c8=c1. The ﬁfth column lists the phase angles y1; y2; y3; . . . y8. The sixth column lists the normalized
coefﬁcients y1  y1 ¼ 0; y2  y1; y3  y1; . . . y8  y1.
We expect the even coefﬁcients, c2, c4, c6, . . . c8, to be zero. They are much smaller than the odd
coefﬁcients, so we will interpret them to be zero. The coefﬁcient c0 is the dc component of the Fourier series and is
written above the table in Figure 15.8-5. Finally, PSpice represents the Fourier series, using sine instead of cosine,
so the coefﬁcients in Figure 15.8-6 indicate that vi(t) is represented by the Fourier series

The Fourier transform is closely related to the Fourier series and the Laplace transform. Recall that a
periodic waveform f (t) possesses a Fourier series. As we increase the period T, the fundamental
frequency o0 becomes smaller because
o0 ¼ 2p
T
The difference between two consecutive harmonic frequencies is Do ¼ (n þ 1)o0  no0 ¼ o0 ¼ 2p/T.
Therefore, as T approaches inﬁnity, Do approaches do, an inﬁnitesimal frequency increment.
Furthermore, the number of frequencies in any given frequency interval increases as Do decreases.
Thus, in the limit, no0 approaches the continuous variable o.
We can represent the series, using cosine, by subtracting 90 from each phase angle. Then,

Find the Fourier transform of the gated cosine waveform f (t) ¼ f1(t) cos o0t, where f1(t) is the rectangular pulse

The spectrum, also called the spectral density, of a signal f (t) is its Fourier transform F(o). We
can plot F(o) as a function of o to show the spectrum. For example, for a rectangular pulse
signal of Figure 15.9-1, we found that
F o
ð Þ ¼ ADSa oD=2
ð
Þ
which is plotted in Figure 15.9-2. The spectrum of the rectangular pulse is real.
The Fourier transform of an impulse d(t) is (entry 2 of Table 15.10-2)
F o
ð Þ ¼ 1
Thus, the spectrum of an impulse contains all frequencies, and a plot of the spectrum of the
impulse is shown in Figure 15.11-1.
The Fourier transform of a constant dc signal of magnitude A is

ð Þ ¼ 2pAd o

which has a spectrum as shown in Figure 15.11-2. The integral of the impulse d(o) has value
unity. The symbol for the impulse is a vertical line with an arrowhead.

The table of Laplace transforms, Table 14.2-1, developed in Chapter 14, can be used to obtain the
Fourier transform of a function f (t). Of course, the Fourier transform formally exists only when the
Fourier integral, Eq. 15.9-4, converges. The Fourier integral will converge when all the poles of F(s) lie
in the left-hand s-plane, not on the jo-axis or at the origin.
If f (t) is zero for t  0 and
R 1
0 f tð Þ dt < 1, we can obtain the Fourier transform from the Laplace
transform of f (t) by replacing s by jo. Then
F o

For example, if (entry 3 of Table 15.10-2)
f tð Þ ¼ Aeatu tð Þ
then, from Table 14.2-1,
F sð Þ ¼

s þ a
Therefore, with s ¼ jo we obtain the Fourier transform:
F o
ð Þ ¼
A

If f (t) is a real function with a nonzero value for negative time only, then we can reﬂect f (t) to
positive time, ﬁnd the Laplace transform, and then ﬁnd F(o) by setting s ¼ jo. Therefore, when f (t) ¼
0 for t  0 and f (t) exists only for negative time, we have

15. Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

Functions that are nonzero over all time can be divided into positive time and negative time
functions. We then use Eqs. 15.13-1 and 15.13-2 to obtain the Fourier transform of each part. The
Fourier transform of f (t) is the sum of the Fourier transforms of the two parts.
For example, consider the function f (t) with a nonzero value over all time where
f tð Þ ¼ Aeajtj
which is entry 4 in Table 15.10-2. The positive time portion of the function will be called f +(t), and the
negative time portion will be called f (t). Then,
f tð Þ ¼ f þ tð Þ þ f  tð Þ

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

Solution
The output voltage vo(t) will be a clipped sinusoid. We need to verify that Eq. 15.14-1 does indeed represent a
clipped sinusoid. A straightforward, but tedious, way to do this is to plot vo(t) versus t directly from Eq. 15.14-1.
Several computer programs, such as spreadsheets and equation solvers, are available to reduce the work required to
produce this plot. Mathcad is one of these programs. In Figure 15.14-2, Mathcad is used to plot vo(t) versus t. This
plot veriﬁes that the Fourier series in Eq. 15.14-1 does indeed represent a clipped sinusoid.

DC Power Supply
A laboratory power supply uses a nonlinear circuit called a rectiﬁer to convert a sinusoidal voltage input into a dc
voltage. The sinusoidal input
vac tð Þ ¼ A sin o0t
comes from the wall plug. In this example, A ¼ 160 V and o0 ¼ 377 rad/s (f0 ¼ 60 Hz).
Figure 15.15-1 shows the structure of the power supply. The output of the rectiﬁer is the absolute value of its input,
that is,
vs tð Þ ¼ jA sin o0tj
The purpose of the rectiﬁer is to convert a signal that has an average value equal to zero into a signal that has an
average value that is not zero. The average value of vs(t) will be used to produce the dc output voltage of the power
supply.
The rectiﬁer output is not a sinusoid but a periodic signal with fundamental frequency equal to 2o0. Periodic
signals can be represented by Fourier series. The Fourier series of vs(t) will contain a constant, or dc, term and some
sinusoidal terms. The purpose of the ﬁlter shown in Figure 15.15-1 is to pass the dc term and attenuate the sinusoidal
terms. The output of the ﬁlter, vo(t), will be a periodic signal and can be represented by a Fourier series. Because we are
designing a dc power supply, the sinusoidal terms in the Fourier series of vo(t) are undesirable. The sum of these
undesirable terms is called the ripple of vo(t).
The challenge is to design a simple ﬁlter so that the dc term of vo(t) is at least 90 V and the size of the ripple is
no larger than 5 percent of the size of the dc term.

Figure 15.15-2 shows a simple ﬁlter. The resistance Rs models the output resistance of the rectiﬁer. We have
assumed that the input resistance of the regulator is large enough to be ignored. (The input resistance of the
regulator will be in parallel with R and will probably be much larger than R. In this case, the equivalent
resistance of the parallel combination will be approximately equal to R.)

For ease of calculation, we replace Eq. 15.15-1 with the simpler condition

That is, the amplitude vo1(t) must be less than 4 percent of the dc term of the output (vo0 ¼ dc term of the
output).

this response. By voltage division,

Figure 15.15-3b shows the details of the output voltage. This plot indicates that the average value of the output
voltage is greater than 90 V and that the ripple is no greater than

Periodic waveforms arise in many circuits. For example, the
form of the load current waveforms for selected loads is
shown in Figure15.16-1. Whereas the load current for motors
and incandescent lamps is of the same form as that of the
source voltage, it is signiﬁcantly altered for the power
supplies, dimmers, and variable-speed drives as shown in
Figures 15.16-1b,c. Electrical engineers have long been
interested in developing the tools required to analyze circuits
incorporating periodic waveforms.

incandescent lights, (b) switch-mode power supplies, and (c)

and the horizontal axis is time. Source: Lamarre, 1991.
The brilliant mathematician-engineer Jean-Baptiste-Joseph
Fourier proposed in 1807 that a periodic waveform could be
represented by a series consisting of cosine and sine terms
with the appropriate coefﬁcients. The integer multiple fre-
quencies of the fundamental are called the harmonic fre-
quencies (or harmonics).
The trigonometric form of the Fourier series is
f tð Þ ¼ a0 þ

The Fourier coefﬁcients of some common periodic signals
are tabulated in 15.4-1.

coefﬁcients.

The line spectra consisting of the amplitude and phase of the
complex coefﬁcients of the Fourier series when plotted
against frequency are useful for portraying the frequencies
that represent a waveform.
The practical representation of a periodic waveform consists
of a ﬁnite number of sinusoidal terms of the Fourier series.
The ﬁnite Fourier series exhibits the Gibbs phenomenon; that
is, although convergence occurs as n grows large, there
always remains an error at the points of discontinuity of
the waveform.
To determine the response of a circuit excited by a periodic
input signal vs(t), we represent vs(t) by a Fourier series and
then ﬁnd the response of the circuit to the fundamental and
each harmonic. Assuming the circuit is linear and the princi-
ple of superposition holds, we can consider that the total
response is the sum of the response to the dc term, the
fundamental, and each harmonic.
The Fourier transform provides a frequency-domain descrip-
tion of an aperiodic time-domain function.
A circuit with an impulse response h(t) and an input f (t) has a
response y(t) that may be determined from the convolution
integral.
The table of Laplace transforms, Table 14.2-1, developed in
Chapter 14, can be used to obtain the Fourier transform of a
function f (t).

Transfer functions are used to characterize linear circuits. In a previous chapter, we learned how to
analyze a circuit so that we could determine its transfer function. In this chapter, we learn how to design
a circuit to have a speciﬁed transfer function. This design problem does not have a unique solution.
There are many ways to obtain a circuit from a speciﬁed transfer function. A popular strategy is to
design the circuit to be a cascade connection of second-order ﬁlter stages. This is the strategy we will
use in this chapter.
The problem of designing a circuit that will have a speciﬁed transfer function is called ﬁlter
design. In this chapter we will learn the vocabulary of ﬁlter design and describe second-order ﬁlter
stages. Finally, we will learn how to connect these ﬁlter stages to obtain a circuit that has a speciﬁed
transfer function.

T h e E l e c t r i c F i l t e r
The concept of a ﬁlter was conceived early in human history. A paper ﬁlter was used to remove dirt and
unwanted substances from water and wine. A porous material, such as paper, can serve as a mechanical
ﬁlter. Mechanical ﬁlters are used to remove unwanted constituents, such as suspended particles, from a
liquid. In a similar manner, an electric ﬁlter can be used to eliminate unwanted constituents, such as
electrical noise, from an electrical signal.
The electrical ﬁlter was independently invented in 1915 by George Campbell in the United States
and K. W. Wagner in Germany. With the rise of radio between 1910 and 1920, a need emerged to
reduce the effect of static noise at the radio receiver. As regular radio broadcasting emerged in
the 1920s, Campbell and others developed the RLC ﬁlter, using inductors, capacitors, and resistors.
These ﬁlters are called passive ﬁlters because they consist of passive elements. The theory required
to design passive ﬁlters was developed in the 1930s by S. Darlington, S. Butterworth, and
E. A. Guillemin. The Butterworth low-pass ﬁlter was reported in Wireless Engineering in 1930
(Butterworth, 1930).
When active devices, typically op amps, are incorporated into an electric ﬁlter, the ﬁlter is
called an active ﬁlter. Because inductors are relatively large and heavy, active ﬁlters are usually
constructed without inductors—using, for example, only op amps, resistors, and capacitors. The ﬁrst
practical active-RC ﬁlters were developed during World War II and were documented in a classic paper
by R. P. Sallen and E. L. Key (Sallen and Key, 1955).

16.3
F i l t e r s
We begin by considering an ideal ﬁlter. For convenience, suppose that both the input and output of this
ﬁlter are voltages. This ideal ﬁlter separates its input voltage into two parts. One part is passed,
unchanged, to the output; the other part is eliminated. In other words, the output of an ideal ﬁlter is an
exact copy of part of the ﬁlter input.
This is a familiar use of the word ﬁlter. For example, we expect an automotive oil ﬁlter to separate
a mixture of oil and dirt into two parts: oil and dirt. Ideally, the oil ﬁlter passes one part of its input, the
oil, to its output without changing it in any way. The other part of the input, the dirt, should be
completely eliminated. The oil ﬁlter stops the dirt from getting to the output.
To understand how an electric ﬁlter works, consider an input voltage:
vi tð Þ ¼ cos o1t þ cos o2t þ cos o3t
This input consists of a sum of sinusoids, each at a different frequency. (For example, periodic voltages
can be represented in this way using the Fourier series.) The ﬁlter separates the input voltage into two
parts, using frequency as the basis for separation. There are several ways of separating this input into
two parts and, correspondingly, several types of ideal ﬁlter. Table 16.3-1 illustrates the common ﬁlter
types. Consider the ideal low-pass ﬁlter, shown in row 1 of the table. The network function of the ideal
low-pass ﬁlter is

that have frequencies in the pass-band experience unity gain and zero phase shift. These terms are passed,
unchanged, to the output of the ﬁlter. Components of the input that have frequencies in the stop-band
experience a gain equal to zero. These terms are eliminated or stopped. An ideal ﬁlter separates its input into

twoparts:thosetermsthathavefrequenciesinthepass-bandandthosetermsthathavefrequenciesinthestop-
band. The output of the ﬁlter consists of those terms with frequencies in the pass-band.
Unfortunately, ideal ﬁlter circuits don’t exist. (This fact can be proved by calculating the impulse
response of the ideal ﬁlter by taking the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function. The impulse
response of an ideal ﬁlter would have to exist before the impulse itself. That is, the response would have to
occur before the input that caused the response. Because that can’t happen, ideal ﬁlter circuits don’t exist.)
Filters are circuits that approximate ideal ﬁlters. Filters divide their inputs into two parts, the terms in the
pass-band and the terms in the stop-band. The terms in the pass-band experience a gain that is
approximately 1 and experience some phase shift. These terms are passed to the output, but they are
changed a little. The terms in the stop-band experience a small gain that isn’t quite zero. Because these
terms aren’t eliminated entirely, some small residue of these terms shows up in the ﬁlter output.
Butterworth transfer functions have magnitude frequency responses that approximate the
frequency response of an ideal ﬁlter. Butterworth low-pass transfer functions are given by
HL sð Þ ¼ 1
D sð Þ
ð16:3-2Þ
We can choose either þ1 or 1 for the numerator of HL(s). The polynomial D(s) depends on the cutoff
frequency and on the order of the ﬁlter. These polynomials, called Butterworth polynomials, are
tabulated in Table 16.3-2 for oc ¼ 1 rad/s. There is a trade-off involving the order of the ﬁlter. The
higher the order, the more accurately the ﬁlter frequency response approximates the frequency response
of an ideal ﬁlter; that’s good. The higher the ﬁlter order, the more complicated the circuit required to
build the ﬁlter; that’s not good.

Figure 16.3-1 shows the magnitude frequency
response plots for these two ﬁlters. Both fre-
quency responses show unity gain when o  1
and a gain of zero when o  1. Thus, both
ﬁlters approximate an ideal low-pass ﬁlter with
oc ¼ 1 rad/s. The eighth-order ﬁlter makes the
transition from the pass-band to the stop-band
more quickly, providing a better approximation
to the ideal low-pass ﬁlter.
The transfer function of the fourth-order
ﬁlter has been expressed as the product of two
second-order transfer functions, whereas the
transfer function of the eighth-order ﬁlter has
been expressed as the product of four second-
order transfer functions. Each of these second-
order transfer functions will be implemented by
a second-order circuit. Because all of these
second-order circuits will be quite similar, it
is reasonable to expect that the eighth-order
circuit will be about twice as large as the
fourth-order ﬁlter. That means twice as many parts, twice the power consumption, twice the assembly cost, twice
the space, and so on.
The eighth-order ﬁlter performs better, but it costs more. In some applications, the improved performance of
the eighth-order ﬁlter justiﬁes the additional cost, whereas in other applications, it does not.

Second-order ﬁlters are important for two reasons. First, they provide an inexpensive approximation to
ideal ﬁlters. Second, they are used as building blocks for more expensive ﬁlters that provide more
accurate approximations to ideal ﬁlters.
The frequency response of second-order ﬁlters is characterized by three ﬁlter parameters: the gain
k, the corner frequency o0, and the quality factor Q. Filter circuits are designed by choosing the values
of the circuit elements in such a way as to obtain the required values of k, o0, and Q.
A second-order low-pass ﬁlter is a circuit that has a transfer function of the form

This transfer function is characterized by three parameters: the dc gain k, the corner frequency o0, and

When k ¼ 1, this frequency response approximates the frequency response of an ideal low-pass
ﬁlter with a cutoff frequency of oc ¼ o0. When k 6¼ 1, the low-pass ﬁlter approximates an ideal low-
pass ﬁlter together with an ampliﬁer having gain equal to k. The quality factor Q controls the shape of
the frequency response during the transition from pass-band to stop-band. Figure 16.4-1 shows the
frequency response of a second-order low-pass ﬁlter (k ¼ 1 and oc ¼ o0 ¼ 1) for several choices of Q.
A Butterworth approximation to the ideal low-pass ﬁlter is obtained by choosing Q ¼ 0:707.

The third design equation indicates that k ¼ 1. This last design equation does not constrain the values of R, L, and

convenient value for one circuit element, say C ¼ 0:1 mF, and then calculate the resulting values of the other circuit

If we are satisﬁed with this solution, the ﬁlter design is complete. Otherwise, we adjust our choice of the value of C
and recalculate L and R. For example, if the inductance is too large, say L ¼ 1000 H, or the resistance is too small,
say R ¼ 0:03 V, it will be hard to obtain the parts to build these circuits. Because there is no such problem in this
example, we conclude that the circuit shown in the ﬁrst row of Table 16.4-1 with C ¼ 0:1 mF, L ¼ 0:253 H, and
R ¼ 2251 V is the required low-pass ﬁlter.

and the Tow-Thomas ﬁlter functions as a band-pass ﬁlter. Design a Butterworth Tow-Thomas low-pass ﬁlter with a

Solution
Because the Tow-Thomas ﬁlter will be used as a low-pass ﬁlter, the transfer function is given by Eq. 16.4-3. Design
equations are obtained by comparing this transfer function to the standard form of the second-order low-pass
transfer function given in Eq. 16.4-1. First, compare the constant terms (that is, the coefﬁcients of s0) in the

In this section, we turn our attention to ﬁlters that have an order greater than 2. These ﬁlters are called
high-order ﬁlters. A popular strategy for designing high-order ﬁlters uses a cascade connection of
second-order ﬁlters. The cascade connection is shown in Figure 16.5-1. In this ﬁgure, the transfer
functions H1(s), H2(s), . . . , Hn(s) represent second-order ﬁlters that are connected together to build a
high-order ﬁlter. We refer to the second-order ﬁlter as ﬁlter stages to distinguish them from the high-
order ﬁlter. That is, the high-order ﬁlter is a cascade connection of second-order ﬁlter stages. (When the
order of the high-order ﬁlter is odd, a ﬁrst-order ﬁlter stage is needed. Nonetheless, we talk about
designing high-order ﬁlters as a cascade of second-order stages.)
The cascade connection is characterized by the fact that the output of one ﬁlter stage is used as the
input to the next stage. Unfortunately, the behavior of a stage will sometimes change when another
stage is connected to it. We call this phenomenon loading, and we say that the second stage loaded the
ﬁrst. Generally, loading is undesirable, and we try to avoid it. Figure 16.5-2 shows a model of a ﬁlter

Tow-Thomas High-Pass Filter
Use the Tow-Thomas circuit to design a Butterworth high-pass ﬁlter with a high-frequency gain of 5 and a cutoff

Solution
The Tow-Thomas circuit does not implement the high-pass ﬁlter, but it does implement the low-pass ﬁlter and the
band-pass ﬁlter. The transfer functions of the second-order high-pass, band-pass, and low-pass ﬁlters are related by

A high-pass ﬁlter can be constructed using a Tow-Thomas ﬁlter and a summing ampliﬁer. Both the band-pass
and low-pass outputs of the Tow-Thomas ﬁlter are used. Equation 16.4-8 indicates that the band-pass and low-pass
ﬁlters must have the same values of k, Q, and o0 as the high-pass ﬁlter. Thus, we require a Tow-Thomas ﬁlter
having k ¼ 5, Q ¼ 0:707, and o0 ¼ 7854 rad/s. Such a ﬁlter was designed in Example 16.4-4. The high-pass ﬁlter
is obtained by adding a summing ampliﬁer as shown in Figure 16.4-5.

stage that is appropriate for investigating loading. This model includes the input and output impedance
of the ﬁlter stage as well as the transfer function.
Figure 16.5-3 shows a high-order ﬁlter consisting of the cascade connection of two ﬁlter stages.
Let’s calculate the transfer function of the high-order ﬁlter. Starting at the output of the high-order ﬁlter,
notice that there is no current in the output impedance Zo2(s) of the second stage. Consequently, there is
no voltage across Zo2(s), so
V3 sð Þ ¼ H2 sð ÞV2 sð Þ
ð16:5-1Þ
Next, we use voltage division to ﬁnd V2(s).
V2 sð Þ ¼
Zi2
Zo1 þ Zi2
H1 sð ÞV1 sð Þ
ð16:5-2Þ
Connecting the second ﬁlter stage to the ﬁrst stage has changed the output of the ﬁrst stage. Without the
second stage, there would be no current in Zo1(s). Consequently, there would be no voltage across
Zo1(s), and the output of the ﬁrst stage would be V2(s) ¼ H1(s)V1(s). The second stage is said to load the
ﬁrst stage. This loading can be eliminated by making the input impedance of the second stage inﬁnite,
Zi2(s) ¼ 1, or the output impedance of the ﬁrst stage zero, Zo1(s) ¼ 0.
Combining Eqs. 16.5-1 and 16.5-2 gives
V3 sð Þ ¼ H2 sð Þ
Zi2
Zo1 þ Zi2
H1 sð ÞV1 sð Þ
Finally, the transfer function of the high-order ﬁlter is
H sð Þ ¼ V3 sð Þ
V1 sð Þ ¼ H2 sð Þ
Zi2
Zo1 þ Zi2
H1 sð Þ
ð16:5-3Þ
This equation simpliﬁes to
H sð Þ ¼ H2 sð ÞH1 sð Þ
ð16:5-4Þ
when either the input impedance of the second stage is inﬁnite, Zi2(s) ¼ 1, or the output impedance of
the ﬁrst stage is zero, Zo1(s) ¼ 0. In other words, Eq. 16.5-4 can be used when the second stage does not
load the ﬁrst stage, but Eq. 16.5-3 must be used when the second stage does load the ﬁrst stage. We will
prove that the Sallen-Key ﬁlters have output impedances equal to zero. Therefore, there is no loading
when Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages are cascaded. The transfer function of the high-order ﬁlter is the product of
the transfer functions of the individual Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages. In contrast, the ﬁlters based on the series
RLC circuit shown in Table 16.4-1 do not have output impedances that are equal to zero or input
impedances that are inﬁnite. If these ﬁlter stages were cascaded, the transfer function of the high-order
ﬁlter would not be equal to the product of the transfer functions of the individual ﬁlter stages. Thus, we can
use cascaded Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages to design high-order ﬁlters without introducing loading.

Next, consider calculating the output impedance of a Sallen-Key band-pass ﬁlter. Table 16.5-1
shows how the parameters of the model of a ﬁlter stage can be calculated or measured. The second row of
this table indicates that to calculate the output impedance, a short circuit should be connected to the ﬁlter
input, and a current source should be connected to the ﬁlter output. The voltage across the current source is
calculated, and the ratio of this voltage to the current of the current source is the output impedance. Figure
16.5-4 shows a Sallen-Key ﬁlter with a short circuit across its input and a current source connected to its
output. This circuit can be analyzed by writing node equations at nodes 1, 2, and T:

ÞCs ¼ 0
 V1  V2

A  1
ð
ÞR ¼ 0
Solving these node equations for VT gives
½ RCs
ð
Þ2 þ 3  A
ð
ÞRCs þ 1 VT ¼ 0
Because the factor in brackets is not zero, this equation indicates that VT ¼ 0. The output impedance of
the Sallen-Key band-pass ﬁlter is
Zo ¼ VT
IT
¼ 0
IT
¼ 0
Similarly, each of the Sallen-Key ﬁlters shown in Table 16.4-2 has an output impedance equal to zero.
High-order ﬁlters can be designed as a cascade connection of second-order ﬁlter stages. Filter
stages that have an output impedance equal to zero are used so that the transfer function of the high-
order ﬁlter will be the product of the transfer functions of the cascaded ﬁlter stages.

This transfer function can be expressed as

A Sallen-Key low-pass ﬁlter can be designed to implement the second-order low-pass transfer function H1(s).
Table 16.5-2 provides circuits and design equations for ﬁrst-order ﬁlter stages. The circuit shown in the ﬁrst row of
this table can be used to implement H2(s). The ﬁrst-order ﬁlter stages in Table 16.5-2 have output impedances equal
to zero. Cascading these ﬁlter stages will not cause loading. Cascading the Sallen-Key ﬁlter with the ﬁrst-order ﬁlter
stage will produce a third-order ﬁlter with the transfer function H(s).
First, let’s design the Sallen-Key ﬁlter with transfer function
H1 sð Þ ¼
250,000
s2 þ 500s þ 250,000
Values of the ﬁlter parameters k, o0, and Q are determined by comparing H1(s) with the standard form of the
second-order low-pass transfer function given in Eq. 16.4-1. From the constant term in the denominator,
o0
2 ¼ 250,000
Next, from the coefﬁcient of s in the denominator,
o0
Q ¼ 500
Finally, from the numerator,
k 
 o02 ¼ 250,000
So o0 ¼ 500 rad/s, Q ¼ 1, and k ¼ 1. The Sallen-Key low-pass ﬁlter is shown in row 1 of Table 16.4-2. Designing
this ﬁlter requires ﬁnding values of R, C, and A. The design equations given in row 1 of the table indicate that

but Eq. 16.5-8 gives

Apparently, we can select A to get the correct value of Q, or we can select A to get the correct value of k, but not
both. The dc gain is easy to adjust later, so we pick A ¼ 2 to make Q ¼ 1 and settle for k ¼ 2. Equation 16.5-6 is

PSpice provides a convenient way to verify that a ﬁlter circuit does indeed have the correct transfer
function. Figure 16.6-1 illustrates a method of testing a ﬁlter design. The ﬁlter that is being tested here is
a fourth-order notch ﬁlter consisting of two Sallen-Key notch ﬁlter stages and an inverting ampliﬁer.

The voltage source voltage vi(t) is used as the input to two separate circuits. One of these circuits is the
ﬁlter circuit consisting of the Sallen-Key stages and the inverting ampliﬁer. The response of this circuit
is the node voltage vo1(t). The other “circuit” implements H(s) directly using a feature of PSpice. The
response of this circuit is vo2(t). A single PSpice simulation produces the frequency responses
corresponding to the transfer functions of both of these circuits; Vo1(s)=Vi(s) and Vo2(s)=Vi(s).
Next, we use Probe, the graphical post processor included with PSpice, to display both frequency
responses on the same axis. If these frequency responses are identical, we know that the ﬁlter circuit
does indeed implement the transfer function H(s).
Figure 16.6-2 shows the PSpice input ﬁle corresponding to Figure 16.6-1. Two aspects of this
ﬁle require some explanation. First, notice that parameters are used in the subcircuit that represents
the Sallen-Key ﬁlter stage. The line

marks the beginning of the subcircuit named sk_n. (PSpice allows us to name, rather than number, nodes.
The nodes “in” and “out” will connect this subcircuit to the rest of the circuit.) Three parameters are
deﬁned: C, w0, and Q. All are given default values, as required by PSpice. Expressions involving these
parameters replace the values of some of the devices that comprise the subcircuit; for example, the line
R1 in 2 {1/C/w0}
indicates that resistor R1 is connected to nodes “in” and 2 and that the resistance of R1 is given by 1/C/w0.
The values of parameters like C and w0 are given when the subcircuit is used. Consider the line
XSK2 2 3 sk_n params : C =.1uf w0 = 250 Q = 1
which indicates that device XSK2 is a subcircuit sk_n. This line provides values for C, w0, and Q.
These values will be used to calculate the resistance R1 that is used when sk_n implements XSK2.
Different values of C, w0, and Q can be used each time the subcircuit sk_n is used to implement a
different device. Table 16.6-1 provides PSpice subcircuits for the four Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages.

using a transfer function. The controlling voltage of the VCVS is identiﬁed inside the ﬁrst set of braces. The
transfer function is given inside the second set of braces. The transfer function was too long to ﬁt on the line
describing the VCVS. The þ sign at the beginning of the fourth line indicates that this line is a continuation
of the previous line. Table 16.6-2 provides subcircuits describing second-order transfer functions.

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following examples illustrate techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

How Can We Check Filter
Frequency Response?
Figure 16.7-1 shows the frequency response
of a band-pass ﬁlter obtained using PSpice.
Such a ﬁlter can be represented by
Vo o

Vin o
ð Þ ¼ H o
ð Þ ¼

o

 o0
o


where Vin(o) and Vo(o) are the input and
output of the ﬁlter. This ﬁlter was designed
to satisfy the speciﬁcations
o0 ¼ 2p1000 rad/s;
Q ¼ 10;
H0 ¼ 10
How can we check that the speciﬁcations
are satisﬁed?
Solution
The frequency response was obtained by analyzing the ﬁlter using PSpice. The vertical axis of Figure 16.7-1 gives
the magnitude of H(o) in decibels. The horizontal axis gives the frequency in hertz. Three points on the frequency
response have been labeled, giving the frequency and magnitude at each point. We want to use this information
from the frequency response to check the ﬁlter to see whether it has the correct values of o0, Q, and H0.
The three labeled points on the frequency response have been carefully selected. One of these labels indicates
that the magnitude of H(o) and frequency at the peak of the frequency response are 20 dB and 1000 Hz. This peak
occurs at the resonant frequency, so
o0 ¼ 2p1000 rad/s
The magnitude at the resonant frequency is H0, so
20 log10H0 ¼ 20
or
H0 ¼ 10
The other two labeled points were chosen so that the magnitudes are 3 dB less than the magnitude at the peak. The
frequencies at these points are 951 Hz and 1051 Hz. The difference of these two frequencies is the bandwidth BW of
the frequency response. Finally, Q is calculated from the resonant frequency o0 and the bandwidth BW:
Q ¼ o0
BW ¼
2p1000
2p 1051  951
ð
Þ ¼ 10
In this example, three points on the frequency response were used to verify that the band-pass ﬁlter satisﬁed
the speciﬁcations for its resonant frequency, gain, and quality factor.

How Can We Check Filter Transfer Function?
ELab is a circuit analysis program that can be used to calculate the transfer function of a ﬁlter circuit (Svoboda,
1997). Figure 16.7-2 shows the result of using ELab to analyze the Sallen-Key band-pass ﬁlter shown in Figure
16.4-2. This Sallen-Key ﬁlter was designed in Example 16.4-2 to have o0 ¼ 3142 rad/s, Q ¼ 5, and k ¼ 14. How
can we check that the ﬁlter does indeed have the required values of o0, Q, and k?

FIGURE 16.7-2 Using ELab to determine the transfer function of a band-pass ﬁlter.
Solution
The coefﬁcients of the transfer function of the ﬁlter are given in the upper left-hand portion of Figure 16.7-2. The
coefﬁcients indicate that the transfer function of this ﬁlter is
H sð Þ ¼
8800s
s2 þ 629s þ 9:87  106

The general form transfer function of the second-order band-pass ﬁlter is
H sð Þ ¼
k o0
Q s
s2 þ o0
Q s þ o2
0
ð16:7-2Þ
Notice that the coefﬁcient of s2 in the denominator polynomial is 1 in both of these transfer functions. Values of o0,
Q, and k are determined by comparing the coefﬁcients of the transfer functions in Eqs. 16.7-1 and 16.7-2.
The square root of the constant term of the denominator polynomial is equal to o0. Therefore,
o0 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
9:87  106
p
¼ 3142 rad/s
Next, the coefﬁcient of s in the denominator polynomial is equal to o0/Q. Therefore,
Q ¼ o0
629 ¼ 3142
629 ¼ 5
Finally, the ratio of the coefﬁcient of s in the numerator polynomial to the coefﬁcient of s in the denominator
polynomial is equal to k. Therefore,
k ¼ 8880
629 ¼ 14
The Sallen-Key band-pass ﬁlter shown in Figure 16.4-2 does indeed have the required values of o0, Q, and k.

Anti-Aliasing Filter
Digital signal processing (DSP) frequently involves sampling a voltage and converting the samples to digital
signals. After the digital signals are processed, the output signal is converted back into an analog voltage.
Unfortunately, a phenomenon called aliasing can cause errors to occur during digital signal processing. Aliasing is
a possibility whenever the input voltage contains components at frequencies greater than one-half of the sampling
frequency. Aliasing occurs when these components are mistakenly interpreted to be components at a lower
frequency. Anti-aliasing ﬁlters are used to avoid these errors by eliminating those components of the input voltage
that have frequencies greater than one-half of the sampling frequency.
An anti-aliasing ﬁlter is needed for a DSP application. The ﬁlter is speciﬁed to be a fourth-order Butterworth
low-pass ﬁlter having a cutoff frequency of 500 hertz and a dc gain equal to 1. This ﬁlter is to be implemented as an
RC op amp circuit.
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
The anti-aliasing ﬁlter will be designed as a cascade circuit consisting of two Sallen-Key low-pass ﬁlters and
perhaps an ampliﬁer. The ampliﬁer will be included if it is necessary to adjust the dc gain of the anti-aliasing ﬁlter.
The operational ampliﬁers in the Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages will be modeled as ideal operational ampliﬁers.
Resistances will be restricted to the range of 2 kV to 500 kV, and capacitances will be restricted to the range of 1 nF
to 10 mF.
State the Goal
The transfer function of a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass ﬁlter having a cutoff frequency of 500 hertz and a dc
gain equal to 1 can be obtained in two steps. First, the transfer function of a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass ﬁlter
is given by Eq. 16.3-2 and Table 16.3-2 to be
Hn sð Þ ¼
1
s2 þ 0:765s þ 1
ð
Þ s2 þ 1:848s þ 1
ð
Þ
ð16:8-1Þ
Hn(s) is the transfer function of a ﬁlter having a cutoff frequency equal to 1 rad/s. Next, frequency scaling can be
used to adjust the cutoff frequency to 500 hertz ¼ 3142 rad/s. Frequency scaling can be accomplished by replacing

The goal is to design a ﬁlter circuit that has this transfer function.
Generate a Plan
We will express H(s) as the product of two second-order low-pass transfer functions. For each of these second-
order transfer functions, we will do the following:
1.
Determine the values of the ﬁlter parameters k, o0, and Q.
2.
Design a Sallen-Key low-pass ﬁlter to have the required values of o0 and Q.
It’s likely that the Sallen-Key ﬁlters won’t have the desired values of the dc gain, so an ampliﬁer will be required to
adjust the dc gain. The anti-aliasing ﬁlter will consist of a cascade connection of the Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages and the
ampliﬁer.
828
16. Filter Circuits

Act on the Plan
Consider the ﬁrst factor of the denominator of H(s). From the constant term,
o2
0 ¼ 31422
So o0 ¼ 3142 rad/s. Next, from the coefﬁcient of s in the denominator,
o0
Q ¼ 2403:6
so
Q ¼ 3142
2403:6 ¼ 1:31
Next, design a Sallen-Key low-pass ﬁlter with o0 ¼ 3142 rad/s and Q ¼ 1:31. The design equations given in row 1
of Table 16.4-2 indicate that
o0 ¼ 1
RC
and
Q ¼
1
3  A
Pick C ¼ 0:1 mF. Then,
R ¼
1
o0C ¼
1
3142 
 107 ¼ 3183 V
Also;
A ¼ 3  1
Q ¼ 3 
1
1:31 ¼ 2:24
The dc gain of this ﬁlter stage is k ¼ A ¼ 2:24, so the transfer function of this stage is
H1 sð Þ ¼
2:24 
 31422
s2 þ 2403:6s þ 31422
Next, consider the second factor in the denominator of H(s). Once again, the constant term indicates that
o0 ¼ 3142 rad/s. Now Q can be calculated from the coefﬁcient of s to be
Q ¼ 3142
5806:4 ¼ 0:541
We require a Sallen-Key low-pass ﬁlter with o0 ¼ 3142 rad/s and Q ¼ 0:541. Pick C ¼ 0:1 mF. Then,
R ¼
1
o0C ¼
1
3142 
 107 ¼ 3183 V
and
A ¼ 3  1
Q ¼ 3 
1
0:541 ¼ 1:15
The dc gain of this ﬁlter stage is k ¼ A ¼ 1:15, so the transfer function of this stage is
H2 sð Þ ¼
1:15 
 31422
s2 þ 5806:4s þ 31422
The product of the gains of the ﬁlter stages is
H1 sð Þ 
 H2 sð Þ ¼ 2:576 
 H sð Þ
so
H sð Þ ¼ 0:388 
 H1 sð Þ 
 H2 sð Þ
The third stage of the anti-aliasing ﬁlter is an inverting ampliﬁer having gain equal to 0.388. The anti-aliasing ﬁlter
is shown in Figure 16.8-1.
Verify the Proposed Solution
Section 16.14 describes a procedure for verifying that a circuit has a speciﬁed transfer function. This procedure
consists of using PSpice to plot the frequency response of both the circuit and the transfer function. These two
frequency responses are compared. If they are the same, the transfer function of the circuit is indeed the speciﬁed
transfer function.

FIGURE 16.8-3 The frequency response of the circuit shown in Figure 16.8-1 and frequency response corresponding to the transfer
function given in Eq. 16.8-2 are identical.
Figure 16.8-2 shows the PSpice input ﬁle used to plot the frequency responses of both the circuit shown in
Figure 16.8-1 and the transfer function given in Eq. 16.8-2. These frequency responses are shown in Figure 16.8-3.
These frequency responses overlap exactly so that the two plots appear to be a single plot. Therefore, the ﬁlter does
indeed have the required transfer function.

An ideal ﬁlter separates its input into two parts. One part is
passed, unchanged, to the output; the other part is eliminated.
In other words, the output of an ideal ﬁlter is an exact copy of
part of the ﬁlter input.
There are several ways of separating the ﬁlter input into two
parts and, correspondingly, several types of ideal ﬁlter.
Table16.3-1 illustrates the common ﬁlter types.
Unfortunately, ideal ﬁlter circuits don’t exist. Filters are
circuits that approximate ideal ﬁlters.
Butterworth transfer functions have magnitude frequency
responses that approximate the frequency response of an
ideal ﬁlter.
The frequency response of second-order ﬁlters is character-
ized by three ﬁlter parameters: a gain k, the corner frequency
o0, and the quality factor Q. Filter circuits are designed by
choosing the values of the circuit elements in such a way as
to obtain the required values of k, o0, and Q.
1. Table 16.4-1 provides the information required to design
second-order RLC ﬁlters.
2. Table 16.4-2 provides the information required to design
Sallen-Key ﬁlters.
High-order ﬁlters are ﬁlters that have an order greater than 2.
A popular strategy for designing high-order ﬁlters uses a
cascade connection of second-order ﬁlters.
PSpice provides a convenient way to verify that a ﬁlter
circuit does indeed have the correct transfer function.
PSpice subcircuits reduce the complexity of simulations of
high-order ﬁlters. Table 16.6-1 provides PSpice subcircuits
for the four Sallen-Key ﬁlter stages.

A band-pass ﬁlter has two cutoff frequencies, oa

oa < ob=10. Let HL(s) be a low-pass transfer function having a
cutoff frequency equal to ob and HH(s) be a high-pass transfer
function having a cutoff frequency equal to oa. A band-pass
transfer function can be obtained as a product of low-pass and
high-pass transfer functions, HB(s) ¼ HL(s) 
 HH(s). The order
of the band-pass ﬁlter is equal to the sum of the orders of the
low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters. We usually make the orders
of the low-pass and high-pass ﬁlter equal, in which case the
order of the band-pass is even. The pass-band gain of the band-
pass ﬁlter is the product of pass-band gains of the low-pass and

We have seen that transfer functions can be
frequency scaled by replacing s by s=kf each time that it occurs.
Alternately, circuits can also be frequency scaled by dividing
each capacitance and each inductance by the frequency scaling
factor kf. Either way, the effect is the same. The frequency
response is shifted to the right by kf. In particular, all cutoff,
corner, and resonant frequencies are multiplied by kf. Suppose
that we want to change the cutoff frequency of a ﬁlter circuit
from oold to onew. We set the frequency scale factor to
kf ¼ onew
oold
and then divide each capacitance and each inductance by kf.
Use frequency scaling to change the cutoff frequency of the
circuit in Figure P 16.4-7 to 250 rad/s.

Impedance scaling is used to adjust the imped-
ances of a circuit. Let km denote the impedance scaling factor.
Impedance scaling is accomplished by multiplying each im-

by km. Transfer functions of the form H sð Þ ¼ Vo sð Þ

SP 16-9 Frequently, audio systems contain two or more loud-
speakers that are intended to handle different parts of the audio-
frequency spectrum. In a three-way setup, one speaker, called a
woofer, handles low frequencies. A second, the tweeter, handles
high frequencies, and a third, the midrange, handles the middle
range of the audio spectrum.
A three-way ﬁlter, called a crossover network, splits the
audio signal into the three bands of frequencies suitable for each
speaker. There are many and varied designs. A simple one is based
on series LR, CR, and resonant RLC circuits as shown in Figure
SP 16-9. All speaker impedances are assumed resistive. The
conditions are (1) woofer, at the crossover frequency: XL1 ¼ RW;
(2) tweeter, at the crossover frequency: XC3 ¼ RT; and (3) midrange,
with components C2, L2, and RMR forming a series resonant circuit
with upper and lower cutoff frequencies fu and fL, respectively.
The resonant frequency ¼ (fu fL)1/2.
When all the speaker resistances are 8 V, determine the
frequency response and the cutoff frequencies. Plot the Bode
diagram for the three speakers. Determine the bandwidth of
the midrange speaker section.

I n t r o d u c t i o n
Many practical circuits have just two ports of access, that is, two places where signals may be input or
output. For example, a coaxial cable between Boston and San Francisco has two ports, one at each of
those cities. The object here is to analyze such networks in terms of their terminal characteristics
without particular regard to the internal composition of the network. To this end, the network will be
described by relationships between the port voltages and currents.
We study two-port networks and the parameters that describe them for a number of reasons.
Most circuits or systems have at least two ports. We may put an input signal into one port and obtain
an output signal from the other. The parameters of the two-port network completely describe its
behavior in terms of the voltage and current at each port. Thus, knowing the parameters of a two-port
network permits us to describe its operation when it is connected into a larger network. Two-port
networks are also important in modeling electronic devices and system components. For example, in
electronics, two-port networks are employed to model transistors, op amps, transformers, and
transmission lines.
A two-port network is represented by the network shown in Figure 17.1-1. A four-terminal
network is called a two-port network when the current entering one terminal of a pair exits the other
terminal in the pair. For example, I1 enters terminal a and exits terminal b of the input terminal pair
ab. It will be assumed in our discussion that there are no independent sources or nonzero initial
conditions within the linear two-port network. Two-port networks may or may not be purely resistive
and can in general be formulated in terms of the s-variable or the jo-variable.
A two-port network has two access points appearing as terminal pairs. The current entering
one terminal of a pair exits the other terminal in the pair.

Two networks that occur frequently in circuit analysis are the T and P networks, as shown in Figure
17.2-1. When redrawn, they can appear as the Y or delta (D) networks of Figure 17.2-2.
If a network has mirror-image symmetry with respect to some centerline, that is, if a line can be
found to divide the network into two symmetrical halves, the network is a symmetrical network. The T
network is symmetrical when Z1 ¼ Z2, and the P network is symmetrical when ZA ¼ ZB. Furthermore,
if all the impedances in either the T or P network are equal, then the T or P network is completely
symmetrical.
Note that the networks shown in Figure 17.2-1 and Figure 17.2-2 have two access ports and three
terminals. For example, one port is obtained for the terminal pair a–c and the other port is b–c.
We can obtain equations for direct transformation or conversion from a T network to a P
network, or from a P network to a T network, by considering that, for equivalence, the two networks
must have the same impedance when measured between the same pair of terminals. For example, at port
1 (at a–c) for the two networks of Figure 17.2-2, we require
Z1 þ Z3 ¼ ZA ZB þ ZC
ð
Þ
ZA þ ZB þ ZC
To convert a P network to a T network, relationships for Z1, Z2, and Z3 must be obtained in terms of the
impedances ZA, ZB, and ZC. With some algebraic effort, we can show that

Each T impedance equals the product of the two adjacent legs of the P network divided by the
sum of the three legs of the P network. On the other hand, each leg of the P network equals the sum of
the possible products of the T impedances divided by the opposite T impedance.

Let us consider the two-port network of Figure 17.1-1. By convention, I1 and I2 are assumed to be
ﬂowing into the network as shown. The variables are V1, V2, I1, and I2. Within the two-port network,
two variables are independent and two are dependent, and we may select a set of two independent
variables from the six possible sets: (V1, V2), (I1, I2), (V1, I2), (I1, V2), (V1, I1), and (V2, I2). We will also
assume linear elements.
The possibilities for independent (input) variables and the associated dependent variables are
summarized in Table 17.3-1. The names of the associated six sets of circuit parameters are also identiﬁed
in Table 17.3-1. For the case of phasor transforms or Laplace transforms with the circuit of Figure 17.1-1, we

Therefore, the equivalent T network is as shown in Figure 17.2-5 for the value

It is appropriate, if preferred, to use lowercase letters z and y for the coefﬁcients of Eqs. 17.3-1 through
17.3-4. The equations for the six sets of two-port parameters are summarized in Table 17.3-2.
For linear elements and no dependent sources or op amps within the two-port network, we can
show by the theorem of reciprocity that Z12 ¼ Z21 and Y21 ¼ Y12. One possible arrangement of a
passive circuit as a T circuit is shown in Figure 17.3-1. Writing the two mesh equations for Figure
17.3-1, we can readily obtain Eqs. 17.3-1 and 17.3-2. Therefore, the circuit of Figure 17.3-1 can
represent the impedance parameters. A possible arrangement of the admittance parameters as a P circuit
is shown in Figure 17.3-2.
Examining Eq. 17.3-1, we see that we can measure Z11 by obtaining
Z11 ¼ V1

Of course, I2 ¼ 0 implies that the output terminals are open-circuited. Thus, the Z parameters are often

When a circuit incorporates a dependent source, it is easy to use the methods of Table 17.3-3 or Table
17.3-4 to determine the Z or Y parameters. When a dependent source is within the circuit, Z21 6¼ Z12 and
Y12 6¼ Y21.
Now, let us ﬁnd the impedance parameters. We have
Z11 ¼ V1

The output terminals are open-circuited, so we have the circuit of Figure 17.3-3. Then,
Z11 ¼ 24 þ 8 ¼ 32 V

Determine the Z parameters of the circuit of Figure 17.4-1 when

We determine the Z parameters using the method of Table 17.3-3.
Connect a voltage source V1 and open-circuit the output terminals as
shown in Figure 17.4-2a.
KCL at node a leads to
I1  mV2  I ¼ 0
ð17:4-1Þ
KVL around the outer loop is
V1 ¼ 4I1 þ 5I
ð17:4-2Þ
Furthermore, V2 ¼ 3I, so I ¼ V2=3. Substituting I ¼ V2=3 into Eq. 17.4-1, we have
I1 ¼ mV2 þ V2

ð

Therefore;

To obtain Z22 and Z12, we connect a voltage source V2 to the output terminals and open-circuit the input terminals,
as shown in Figure 17.4-2b. We can write two mesh equations for the assumed current directions, shown as
V1 þ 5I4  3I2 ¼ 0
ð17:4-5Þ
and
V2 þ 3I4  3I2 ¼ 0

Furthermore, I4 ¼ mV2, so substituting into Eq. 17.4-6, we have

If all the two-port parameters for a circuit exist, it is possible to relate one set of parameters to another
because the variables V1, I1, V2, and I2 are interrelated by the parameters. First, let us consider the

Substituting for I from Eq. 17.6-2 into Eq. 17.6-1, we obtain
V ¼ ZYV
or
Z ¼ Y1
ð17:6-3Þ
Thus, we can obtain the matrix Z by inverting the Y matrix. Of course, we can likewise obtain the Y
matrix if we invert a known Z matrix. It is possible that a two-port network has a Y matrix or a Z matrix
but not both. In other words, Z1 or Y1 may not exist for some networks.
If we have a known Y matrix, we obtain the Z matrix by ﬁnding the determinant of the Y matrix as
DY and the adjoint of the Y matrix as
adj Y ¼

Similarly, at the output port V2 is the output voltage of both two-port networks. The deﬁning
matrix equation for network Na is
Ia ¼ YaVa
ð17:7-1Þ
and, for network Nb, we have
Ib ¼ YbVb
ð17:7-2Þ
In addition, we have the total current I as
I ¼ Ia þ Ib
Furthermore, because Va ¼ Vb ¼ V
I ¼ YaV þ YbV ¼ Ya þ Yb
ð
ÞY ¼ YV
Therefore, the Y parameters for the total network of two parallel two-ports are described by
the matrix equation
Y ¼ Ya þ Yb
ð17:7-3Þ
For example,
Y11 ¼ Y11a þ Y11b
Hence, to determine the Y parameters for the total network, we add the Y parameters of each network. In
general, the Y-parameter matrix of the parallel connection is the sum of the Y-parameter matrices of the
individual two-ports connected in parallel.
The series interconnection of two two-port networks is shown in Figure 17.7-2. We will use the Z
parameters to describe each two-port and the series combination. The two networks are described by the
matrix equations
Va ¼ ZaIa
ð17:7-4Þ
and
Vb ¼ ZbIb
ð17:7-5Þ
The terminal currents are
I ¼ Ia ¼ Ib
Therefore, because V ¼ Va þ Vb, we have
V ¼ ZaIa þ ZbIb
¼
Za þ Zb
ð
ÞI ¼ ZI
or
Z ¼ Za þ Zb
ð17:7-6Þ
Therefore, the Z parameters for the total network are equal to the
sum of the Z parameters for the networks.
When the output of one network is connected to the input port
of the following network, as shown in Figure 17.7-3, the networks
are said to be cascaded. Because the output variables of the ﬁrst
network become the input variables of the second network, the
transmission parameters are used. The ﬁrst two-port, Na, is repre-
sented by the matrix equation

Hence, the transmission parameters for the overall network are derived by matrix multiplication,

Engineers are frequently called upon to check that a solution to a problem is indeed correct. For
example, proposed solutions to design problems must be checked to conﬁrm that all of the speciﬁca-
tions have been satisﬁed. In addition, computer output must be reviewed to guard against data-entry
errors, and claims made by vendors must be examined critically.
Engineering students are also asked to check the correctness of their work. For example,
occasionally just a little time remains at the end of an exam. It is useful to be able to quickly identify
those solutions that need more work.
The following example illustrates techniques useful for checking the solutions of the sort of
problem discussed in this chapter.

Transistor Ampliﬁer
Figure 17.9-1 shows the small signal equivalent circuit of a transistor ampliﬁer. The data
sheet for the transistor describes the transistor by specifying its h parameters to be
hie ¼ 1250 V;
hoe ¼ 0;
hfe ¼ 100;
and
hre ¼ 0
The value of the resistance Rc must be between 300 V and 5000 V to ensure that the
transistor will be biased correctly. The small signal gain is deﬁned to be
Av ¼ vo
vin
The challenge is to design the ampliﬁer so that
Av ¼ 20
(There is no guarantee that these speciﬁcations can be satisﬁed. Part of the problem is to decide whether it is
possible to design this ampliﬁer so that Av ¼ 20.)
Describe the Situation and the Assumptions
1.
Rc must be between 300 V and 5000 V.
2.
The transistor is represented by h parameters. Figure 17.9-2a shows that the transistor can be conﬁgured to be a
two-port network and represented by h parameters. Figure 17.9-2b shows an equivalent circuit for the
transistor. This equivalent circuit is based on the h parameters. For this particular transistor, the values of the h
parameters are
hie ¼ 1000 V;
hoe ¼ 0;
hfe ¼ 100;
and
hre ¼ 0

the resistor at the right side of the equivalent circuit is an open circuit. Because
hre ¼ 0
the dependent voltage source is a short circuit. Figure 17.9-2c shows the equivalent circuit after these
simpliﬁcations are made.
3.
The voltage gain must be Av ¼ 20.
State the Goal
Select Rc so that Av ¼ 20.
Generate a Plan
Replace the transistor in Figure 17.9.1 by the equivalent circuit in Figure 17.9-2c. Analyze the resulting circuit to
obtain a formula for the voltage gain Av. This formula will involve Rc. Determine the value of Rc that will make
Av ¼ 20. If this value of Rc is between 300 V and 5000 V, the ampliﬁer design is complete. On the other hand, if
this value of Rc is not between 300 V and 5000 V, the speciﬁcations cannot be satisﬁed.
Act on the Plan
Figure 17.9-3 shows the ampliﬁer after the transistor has been replaced by the equivalent circuit. Applying Ohm’s
law to Rc gives
vo ¼ Rc100ib
where the minus sign is due to reference directions. Next, apply KVL to the left mesh to get
vin ¼ 23,000ib þ 1000ib
Then
Av ¼ vo
vin
¼ 100Rc
24,000
Finally, set Av ¼ 20, obtaining
20 ¼ 100Rc
24,000
Now solve for Rc to determine
Rc ¼ 4800 V
Verify the Proposed Solution
First, the resistance Rc ¼ 4800 V is indeed between 300 V and 5000 V. Second, the gain of the circuit shown in
Figure 17.9-3 is
vo
vin

Rb þ hie

Therefore, both speciﬁcations have been satisﬁed.

17. Two-Port and Three-Port Networks

17.10
S U M M A R Y
A port is a pair of terminals together with the restriction that
the current directed into one terminal be equal to the current
directed out of the other terminal.
Two-port models of circuits or devices are useful for
describing the performance of the circuit or device in terms
of the currents and voltages at its ports. The internal details of
the circuit or device are not included in the two-port model,
so the two-port model of a circuit may be considerably
simpler than the circuit itself.
The two-port model involves four signals—the current and
voltage at each port. Two of these signals are treated as
inputs, and the other two are treated as outputs. There are six
ways of separating the four signals into input and output
signals, and so there are six sets of two-port parameters. The
six sets of two-port parameters are called the impedance,
admittance, hybrid, inverse hybrid, transmission, and inverse
transmission parameters. Table 17.3-2 summarizes the six
sets of two-port parameters.
Table 17.6-1 summarizes the equations used to convert one
set of two-port parameters into another, for example, to
convert impedance parameters into hybrid parameters.
We may use two-port parameters to describe the performance
of the parallel, series, or cascade connection of two or more
circuits.

APPENDIX A
Getting Started
with PSpice
A.1
P S p i c e
SPICE, an acronym for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis, is a computer program
used for numerical analysis of electric circuits. Developed in the early 1970s at the University of
California at Berkeley, it is generally regarded as the most widely used circuit simulation program
(Perry, 1998). PSpice is a version of SPICE, designed for personal computers, developed by MicroSim
Corporation in 1984 (Tuinenga, 88). SPICE was a text-based program that required the user to describe
the circuit using only text, and the simulation results were displayed as text. MicroSim provided a
graphical postprocessor, Probe, to plot the results of SPICE simulations. Later, MicroSim also provided
a graphical interface called Schematics that allowed users to describe circuits graphically. The name of
the simulation program was changed from PSpice to PSpice A/D when it became possible to simulate
circuits that contained both analog and digital devices. MicroSim was acquired by ORCAD1, which
was in turn acquired by Cadence1. ORCAD improved Schematics and renamed it Capture. “Using
PSpice” loosely refers to using ORCAD Capture, PSpice A/D, and Probe to analyze an electric circuit
numerically.
A.2
G e t t i n g S t a r t e d
Begin by starting the ORCAD Capture program. Figure A.1 shows the opening screen of ORCAD
Capture. (If necessary, maximize the Session Log window.) The top line of the screen shows the title of
the program, ORCAD Capture CIS – Demo Edition. A menu bar providing menus called File, View,
Edit, Options, Window, and Help is located under the title line. A row of buttons is located under the
menu bar, and a ruler is located below the row of buttons. A workspace is located beneath the ruler. The
circuit to be simulated is described by drawing it in this workspace. A line containing two message
ﬁelds is located under the workspace. The left message ﬁeld is of particular interest because it provides
information about the Capture screen. For example, move the cursor to one of the buttons. The left
message ﬁeld describes the function of the button. Save Active Document is the function of the third
button from the left.
Select File/New/Project from the Capture menus, as shown in Figure A.2. The New Project dialog
box, shown in Figure A.3, will pop up. Select Analog Or Mixed A/D, as shown. The New Project
dialog box requires a project name and a location. The location is the name of the directory or
folder in which Capture should store the project ﬁle. The name will be the ﬁle name of the project ﬁle.
ORCAD Capture uses OPJ as a sufﬁx for project ﬁles, so choosing Name to be ExampleCircuit
and Location to be c:\PSpiceCircuits causes ORCAD to store a ﬁle named ExampleCircuit.opj in the
c:\PSpiceCircuits folder. Notice that long ﬁle names are supported, making it easier to give descriptive
names to projects.
Click OK in the New Project dialog box to close the New Project dialog box and pop up the
Create PSpice Project dialog box shown in Figure A.4. Select Create a blank project and then click OK
to return to the ORCAD Capture screen. The Capture screen has changed: Place, Macro, PSpice, and
Accessories have been added to the menu bar; there are more buttons; and there is a grid on the
workspace.

We are ready to begin our ﬁrst PSpice simulation. In that ﬁrst simulation, we will simulate the
circuit shown in Figure A.5 to determine its node voltages. We start by drawing the circuit in the
ORCAD Capture workspace.

Drawing a circuit in the ORCAD workspace requires three activites:
1.
Placing the circuit elements in the ORCAD Capture workspace.
2.
Adjusting the values of the circuit element parameters, for example the resistances of the
resistors.
3.
Wiring the circuit to connect the circuit elements.
To begin, select Part/Place from the Capture menus to pop up the Place Part dialog box shown
in Figure A.6. To obtain a resistor, select ANALOG from the list of libraries and R from the list of
parts. Click OK to close the Place Part dialog box and return to the Capture screen. Upon returning to
the Capture screen, the cursor will be dragging the symbol for a resistor. Place the resistor, as desired,
with a click. The cursor will now be dragging a second resistor symbol. A right-click produces the
menu shown in Figure A.7. Selections from this menu will ﬂip or rotate the resistor. Select End Mode
to stop placing resistors. (If ANALOG is not listed among the available libraries in the Place Part
dialog box, click the Add Library button. ORCAD Capture provides several libraries containing parts
for circuits. File names of parts libraries use the sufﬁx OLB. Select the analog.olb and source.olb
libraries.)
SPICE requires every circuit to include a ground node. Select Part/Ground from the Capture
menus to pop up the Place Ground dialog box. The ground node is a PSpice part called 0 that is

to pop up a Browse File dialog box. The library ﬁle is called source.olb and resides in the PSpice folder.
Select the source.olb library; then click Open to make this library available and to return to the Place
Ground dialog box.) Place the ground node in the Capture workspace. Figure A.8 shows the Capture
screen after the parts have been placed.

The resistances of the resistors each has its default value 1k. Click the 1k of the vertical
resistor to select it; then right-click anywhere in the Capture workspace to obtain the menu shown
in Figure A.9. Choose Edit Properties to pop up the Display properties dialog box shown in
Figure A.10. Change the value from 1k to 3. Figure A.11 shows the Capture workspace after the
parameter values of the parts have been adjusted.
FIGURE A.9 The value 1k is shown highlighted. Right-clicking anywhere in the Capture workspace pops up
this menu.

Select Parts/Wire to wire the parts together. In Figure A.11, notice that the terminals of each
part are marked with small squares. To wire two terminals together, click and hold one terminal, drag
the mouse to the other terminal, and then release the mouse. The path of the wire will generally
follow the path of the mouse, but wires will be drawn using straight horizontal and vertical lines.
Wires can also connect part terminals to wires or connect wires to wires. To stop wiring, right-click
and then select End Mode from the menu that appears. Figure A.12 shows the circuit after it has
been wired.

APPENDIX B
MATLAB,
Matrices, and
Complex
Arithmetic
It has become commonplace for engineers to use the MATLAB1 computer program to perform
a variety of technical calculations. MATLAB, short for MATrix LABoratory, is produced and
supported by the company named The Math Works, which provides demos and application notes
at its Web site, www.mathworks.com. In addition, MATLAB has extensive built-in help, as shown
in Figure B.1.
In this appendix, we will ﬁrst use MATLAB as a powerful calculator, then use it to solve
equations involving matrices or complex numbers and, ﬁnally, use it to plot functions.
B.1
U s i n g M A T L A B a s a C a l c u l a t o r
Consider the equation
C  D ¼ 4 A þ B ) D ¼ 4 A þ B
C
Let’s use MATLAB to evaluate D when A ¼ 4; B ¼ 7, and C ¼ 6. To do so, we write the
equations representing A, B, C, and D in the MATLAB workspace, using the arithmetic operations
and functions available in MATLAB. Tables B.1 and B.2 list the arithmetic operations and some of the
functions available in MATLAB.
FIGURE B.1 MATLAB Help is accessed by clicking Help on the MATLAB menu bar.
873

Figure B.2 shows the MATLAB workspace.
The symbol  is the MATLAB cursor. To
indicate that A ¼ 4, we type
A = 4;<Enter>
after the cursor. (<Enter> indicates the Enter key. If we omit the semicolon, MATLAB will tell us
the value of A. Because we already know the value of A, we include the semicolon to save space.)
MATLAB responds to <Enter> by providing another cursor. We type the equations for B, C, and
then D similarly. (MATLAB uses the usual order of precedence for the arithmetic operations.

Consequently, parentheses are used in the equation representing D to ensure that the addition is
performed before the division.) Notice that the semicolon was omitted from the equation
representing D, so MATLAB responded to <Enter> by providing the value of D.

is known as a matrix. The numbers aij are called elements of the matrix, with the subscript i denoting the
row and the subscript j denoting the column.
A matrix with m rows and n columns is said to be a matrix of order m  n or, alternatively, an
m  n matrix. (We read “m  n” as “m by n.”) When the number of the columns equals the number of
rows, m ¼ n, the matrix is called a square matrix of order n. It is common to use boldface capital letters
to denote an m  n matrix.
A matrix consisting of only one column, that is, an m  1 matrix, is known as a column matrix or,
more commonly, a column vector. We represent a column vector with boldface lowercase letters as

Trigonometric Functions
Evaluate
y ¼ sin 1 cos (72
ð
Þ)
Solution
The trigonometric functions sin, cos, and tan expect an angle in radians, and the inverse trigonometric functions
asin, acos, and atan produce an angle in radians. Because we were given an angle in degrees, let’s determine the
value of y in degrees. The MATLAB command
>> theta = (180/pi) * asin(cos(72*pi/180))
produces the result
theta = 18.0000
The multipliers pi/180 and 180/pi convert units of angles from degrees to radians and vice versa. As a check, the
MATLAB command
>> phi = (180/pi) * acos(sin(theta*pi/180))
produces the result
phi = 72
Matrices, Determinants, and Simultaneous Equations
875

The addition of two matrices is possible for matrices of the same order. The sum of two
matrices is obtained by adding the corresponding elements. Thus, if the elements of A are aij and the
elements of B are bij, and if
C ¼ A þ B
then the elements of C are obtained as
cij ¼ aij þ bij
Matrix addition is commutative, that is,
A þ B ¼ B þ A
Also, the addition operation is associative, so that
A þ B
ð
Þ þ C ¼ A þ B þ C
ð
Þ
To perform the operation of multiplying matrix A by a constant a, every element of the matrix is
multiplied by the constant. Therefore, we can write
aA ¼

Matrix multiplication is deﬁned in such a way as to assist in the solution of simultaneous linear
equations. The multiplication of two matrices AB requires the number of columns of A to be equal to
the number of rows of B. Thus, if A is of order m  n and B is of order n  q, the product is a matrix of
order m  q. The elements of a product
C ¼ AB
are found by multiplying the ith row of A and the jth column of B and summing these products to give
the element cij. That is,
cij ¼ ai1b1j þ ai2b2j þ    þ aiqbqj ¼
X
q
k¼1
aikbkj
Thus we obtain c11, the ﬁrst element of C, by multiplying the ﬁrst row of A by the ﬁrst column of B and
summing the products of the elements. We should note that, in general, matrix multiplication is not
commutative, that is,
AB 6¼ BA

Frequently, we will want to solve a set of simultaneous equations such as Equation B-1. In other words,
given the values of the coefﬁcients aij and bi, we will want to determine the values of the variables xi.
Using MATLAB, we express the equation in matrix form as shown in Equation B-2, entering matrices
A and b and then giving the MATLAB command
>> x = A\b
MATLAB will respond with the value of the matrix x.
Solution
Figure B.3 shows how to do these calculations, using MATLAB. First,
two matrix variables

are deﬁned. Figure B.3 shows two ways of deﬁning a matrix variable in
MATLAB. The command
>>A = [2 1; 4 2]
uses a space to separate the elements in each row of the matrix and a
semicolon to separate the rows of the matrix. The command
>> B = [6 1
2 1]
uses a space to separate the elements in a row of the matrix and an
<Enter> to separate the rows of the matrix. (After the <Enter>, spaces
are used to line up the columns of matrix B.) Both commands use the
bracket symbols, [ and ],
to indicate the beginning and end of the
matrix.
Figure B.3 shows that operations listed in Table B.1 can be used
to perform matrix arithmetic. We see that

We can also solve simultaneous equations using Cramer’s rule, which involves determinants,

In general, we are able to determine the determinant D in terms of cofactors and minors. The
determinant of a submatrix of A obtained by deleting from A the ith row and the jth column is called the
minor of the element aij and denoted as mij.
The cofactor cij is a minor with an associated sign, so that
cij ¼ 1
ð
Þ iþj
ð
Þmij
The rule for evaluating the determinant D using the ith row of an n  n matrix is
D ¼

j¼1
aijcij
for a selected value of i. Alternatively, we can obtain D by using the jth column and, thus,
D ¼
X
n
j¼1
aijcij
for a selected value of j.
Cramer’s rule states that the solution for the unknown, xk, of the simultaneous equations of
Equation B-1 is
xk ¼ Dk

where D is the determinant of A and Dk is the determinant formed by replacing the kth column of A by
the column vector b.

We can represent the complex number c as

p
. It’s useful to associate this complex number with a point
in the complex plane as shown in Figure B.5a. Figure B.5a shows that the real numbers a and b in
Equation B-3 are the projections of the point unto the real and imaginary axes. Consequently, a is called
the real part of c, and b is called the imaginary part of c. We write
a ¼ Refcg and b ¼ Imfcg
Figure B.5b illustrates an alternate representation of the complex number c, in which a line segment
is drawn from the origin of the complex plane to the point representing the complex number. The
angle of this line segment, y, measured counterclockwise from the real axis, is called the angle of
the complex number. The length of the line segment, r, is called the magnitude of the complex number.

The polar form represents the complex number in terms of its
magnitude and angle. We write
c ¼ rﬀy
To indicate that r is the magnitude of the complex number c
and that y is the angle of c, we write
r ¼ cj j and y ¼ﬀc
Figure B.6 shows a complex number c with Refcg < 0. Notice that y, not f, is the angle of c.
Because a complex number can be expressed in both rectangular and polar forms, we write
a þ j b ¼ c ¼ rﬀy

between the rectangular and polar forms of complex numbers.

Consequently;
r e jy ¼ r cos y þ j r sin y
Similarly, when we convert from polar to rectangular form,
rﬀy ¼ r cos y þ j r sin y
Noticing that the right-hand sides of the two previous equations are identical establishes the equivalence
between the exponential and polar forms of a complex number.
r e jy ¼ rﬀy
The conversion between the polar and exponential forms is immediate. When using MATLAB, we will
represent a polar form complex number by the equivalent exponential form complex number.

B. MATLAB, Matrices, and Complex Arithmetic

To obtain a list of equally spaced values of the variable x, we issue a MATLAB command of
the form
>> x = [xs : dx : xf]
where xs is the starting value of x, dx is the increment of x, and xf is the ﬁnal value of x. For example,
the MATLAB command
>> x = [-5 : 4 : 15]
produces the list
>> x =
-5
-1
3
7
11
15
To obtain the list of the corresponding values of the variable y, we issue the MATLAB command
>> y=0.2*x.^2+1.6
which produces the list
>> y =
0.6
1.4
2.2
3.0
3.8
4.6
(Notice the operation “.^” in this command. The operation ^ is the power operation from Table B.1, and
x is a matrix. The . before the ^ tells MATLAB to apply the power operation to each element of x rather
than to the matrix x itself.)

Plotting Functions Using MATLAB
Use MATLAB to verify that
5:61 cos (100 t)  13:96 sin (100 t) ¼ 15 cos (100 t þ 68:1)
Solution
The MATLAB commands
>> t = [0 : 0.001 : 0.12];
>> v1 = 5.61*cos(100*t) - 16.96*sin(100*t);
>> v2 = 15*cos(100*t +68.1*pi/180);
>> plot(t,v1,t,v2)
Produce the plot shown in Figure B.9. The MATLAB command
>> plot(t,v1,t,v2)
tells MATLAB to plot both v1 versus t and v2 versus t on the same axis. Because these plots overlap exactly,
we conclude that v1 and v2 are identical functions of t.

APPENDIX D
Standard
Resistor Color
Code
Low-power resistors have a standard set of values. Color-band codes indicate the resistance value as
well as a tolerance. The most common types of resistors are the carbon composition and carbon ﬁlm
resistors.
The color code for the resistor value uses two digits and a multiplier digit, in that order, as shown
in Figure D.1. A fourth band designates the tolerance. Standard values for the ﬁrst two digits are listed in
Table D.1.
The resistance of a resistor with the four bands of color may be written as
R ¼ (a  10 þ b)m  tolerance
where a and b are the values of the ﬁrst and second bands, respectively, and m is a multiplier. These
resistance values are for 2 percent and 5 percent tolerance resistors, as listed in Table D.1. The color
code is listed in Table D.2. The multiplier and tolerance color codes are listed in Tables D.3 and D.4,
respectively. Consider a resistor with the four bands, yellow, violet, orange, and gold. We write the
resistance as
R ¼ (4  10 þ 7) kV  5%
¼ 47 kV  5%
