Dedication
I dedicate this book to do-it-yourselfers and especially do-it-yourself
investors everywhere, and to those who recognize the value of knowing what
questions to ask even if they don’t do it all themselves. And,  it would be
impossible to do a project like this without recognizing the master himself,
Warren Buffett, who has so clearly demonstrated that successful investing is
a matter of wisdom, not just information or knowledge, and most certainly
not guesswork. 
— Peter Sander 
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Many individuals and life experiences have taught me to recognize not just
the cost or benefit but the value of something I might choose, be it a pur-
chase, a place to live, or an investment. I’d especially like to thank my par-
ents, Betty and Jerry Sander, for instilling this perspective from an early age.
And no book can happen without the professional guidance and assistance of
an editorial team, and I’d like to recognize and thank Stacy Kennedy for her
overall supervision of this project and Tracy Brown Collins for her adroit 
editorial guidance throughout. 
— Peter Sander

Introduction
M
arkets go up; markets go down. It doesn’t matter whether you measure
it statistically or look at a chart. You can see it easily. We’ve seen more
volatility during the past 10 years than ever before. And our hearts jump into
our throats every time we hear about one of those 200-point sell-offs. Right?
You lived through the Asian market crisis of the late 1990s. You lived through
the post-2000 dot-com bust. Heck, if you’re old enough, you lived through the
famous October 19, 1987 “Black Monday” debacle. It’s all part of investing.
Right? 
Sure, like most other investors, you probably lost some money during these
events — on paper, anyway. Sour markets have a way of putting a damper on
everything. But do all stock prices drop? Especially in the long term? Hardly.
Average stock investing performance, over the long haul, achieves roughly 
an 11 percent return per year. 
Some investments do a lot better than that. And some will even take you
through the down cycles with little to no heartache. 
And what investments are those? They are investments in truly good busi-
nesses with enduring and growing value. Starbucks isn’t just about coffee; it
continues to change the market for an informal business and pleasure “hang-
out” and is now shifting focus to overseas expansion. Procter & Gamble 
continues to dominate the grocery shelf. A lesser known used car retailer
called CarMax threatens, with an excellent brand and business model, to
dominate the used car space, though today its market share is less than 2
percent.
Bottom line: The best businesses that have the best brands, best assets, 
best business models, best management teams, and best business strategies
continue to earn, earn, and earn some more. And if you, as an investor, (1)
recognize the value and (2) buy them cheap, you’re setting yourself up for
better returns than the market average. And that, as we’ll see, is a very, very
good thing. 
Which leads us to where this book is headed. Value Investing For Dummies,
second edition, takes you on a journey back to the tried-and-true principles
of valuing a stock as one would value a business. (After all, how can one 
disconnect the two, as a share of stock is a share of a business. Right?) When

the price, or value, of a stock matches the value of a business, the value
investor considers buying it. When the price of a stock is less than the value 
of the business, the value investor warms and may get excited about buying
it. It may be a true buying opportunity. And when the price of the stock 
skyrockets beyond the value of the company, yes, the value investor sells it
or avoids it altogether. 
It’s good old-fashioned investing. Believe it or not, markets do undervalue
businesses, and do it frequently. For a variety of reasons, markets are far
from perfect in valuing companies. And furthermore, because there is no one
secret or magic formula for valuing a business, the true value of a stock is a
matter of difference of opinion anyway. All of which serves to make investing
more fun — and profitable — for the prudent and diligent investor who sorts
through available information to best understand a company’s value.
A value investor who applies the principles brought forth in this book is
essentially betting with the house. The odds, especially in the long term, are
in your favor. Value investing is an approach to investing, an investing disci-
pline, a thought process; it is not a specific formula or set of technologies
applied to investing. It is art and science. It is patience and discipline. Done
right, it increases the odds but doesn’t guarantee victory. For you active
traders, it’s a slower ride. But the value approach lets you share in the
growth of the American (and world) economy, while also letting you sleep 
at night.
How to Use This Book
This book presents the principles and practices of value investing. As with all
investing books, you probably shouldn’t follow this material to the letter, but
rather incorporate it into your own personal investing style. Even if you don’t
adopt most of the principles and techniques described here, your awareness
of them will most likely make you a better investor.
This value investing reference visits tools that all but the most inexperienced
investors have heard of: annual reports, income statements, balance sheets,
P/E ratios, and the like. Value Investing For Dummies, second edition, uses
these tools to create a complete, holistic investing approach. You’ll learn why
annual reports and information contained therein are important, and how 
to use that information to improve your investing. And it’s hardly just annual
reports. Other information sources, both online and offline, can greatly
enhance your knowledge of a company’s prospects and your proficiency as 
a value investor.

Value Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

What Is Assumed About You
Value Investing For Dummies, second edition, assumes some level of familiarity
and experience with investments and investing. The book assumes you under-
stand what stocks are and how markets work, and have already bought and
sold some stocks. If you’re starting completely from scratch, you may want to
refer to Eric Tyson’s Investing For Dummies or a similar introductory treatment
of the investing world. Not that what’s presented here is that “hard” or scary,
it will just flow more smoothly with a base level of knowledge.
How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies books, this book is a reference, not a tutorial, which
means that the topics covered are organized in self-contained chapters. So
you don’t have to read the book from cover to cover if you don’t want to. Just
pick out the topics that interest you from the Table of Contents or Index and
go from there. What follows is a breakdown of what the book covers.
Part I: The What and Why 
of Value Investing
Part I explains what value investing is (and what it isn’t) to give a clear 
picture to the reader and provide a framework for the rest of the book. Value
investing is put in context with a discussion of markets, market history, and
overall performance. We explore the history of the value investing approach
and the fantastic success of some who practice it, notably the master himself,
Warren Buffett. 
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists
Part II opens the value investor toolbox by explaining some basic investing
math principles and how understanding that math can make you a better
investor. Next is a discussion of key information and information sources for
the value investor. Then comes the detail, with a tour of the financial state-
ment landscape, including balance sheets, income, and cash flow statements.
Ratios and ratio analysis are explored as a way to make more sense of the
financials. Finally, you’ll get a few tips on how to detect hidden agendas that
may lie in financial figures and statements.

Introduction

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business?
Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Next come the “meat and potatoes” of
how to assess or appraise the value of a company and relate that value to the
stock price. Proven business value assessment methods including intrinsic
value, discounted cash flow analysis, and the strategic profit formula are
examined. Next, on the principle that investors shouldn’t live by numbers
alone, is a discussion of strategic intangibles — so-called “soft” factors that
serve as leading indicators for the ‘hard” numbers. To bring these tools 
and techniques together into a system, we’ll look at the example set by the
master, Warren Buffett. With these principles in mind, the next step is to look
at price, to see whether a company really is a good value for the price. 
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor
This part takes a practical look at investment products — mutual funds,
closed ended funds, REITs, and exchange traded funds (ETFs) — and how the
value investor may use these products. Then, the focus shifts to setting goals
and developing your own value investing style. We examine different value
investing themes and then suggest practical approaches to implementing the
value investing thought process, not only for buying but also during owner-
ship and, eventually, the selling decision. At the end of the day, it’s all about
figuring out what works best for you. 
Part V: The Part of Tens
For your use and enjoyment you’ll find some favorite top-ten lists in this 
section: Ten characteristics of a good business and stock value, ten indica-
tions of an overvalued business, and ten habits of “highly successful” value
investors.

N
o doubt, if you’re reading Value Investing For Dummies, somewhere
during your investing career you heard something about value invest-
ing. You heard about it from your retired next-door neighbor. You heard about
it as “what Warren Buffett does.” You saw a mutual fund describe itself as a
“value-oriented” fund. 
You have a pretty good idea what the word “value” means in ordinary
English. It’s not an altogether precise concept; the Random House Dictionary
of the English Language defines it as the “relative worth, merit, or impor-
tance” of something. Okay, fine. But how does that apply to investing? What 
is value investing, anyway? 
This chapter answers that question. The rest of this book gives you the 
background, tools, and thought processes to do it. 
Definitions? No Two Are Alike
Perhaps you’ve asked around — to friends, experienced investors, investing
professionals — for definitions of “value investing.” You probably got a lot of
different answers. Those answers perhaps included phrases like “conserva-
tive,” “long-term oriented,” “the opposite of growth,” “the Buffett approach,”
“buying stocks with a low P/E,” “buying stuff that’s cheap,” or “buying stocks
that nobody wants.” 

None of these is “it” entirely, but it turns out they are all part of it. 
All, except the “opposite of growth,” that is — and we’ll get to that.
Value investing is an investing approach and style blending many principles
of business and financial analysis to arrive at good investing decisions. 
This, too, is an imprecise definition, but it lays the groundwork for the more
precise principles and style points that follow. 
What Is Value Investing?
Toward a definition, here’s one you may have read in the first edition of Value
Investing For Dummies. It still works: 
Value investing is buying shares of a business as though you were buying the
business itself. Value investors emphasize the intrinsic value of assets and
current and future profits, and pay a price equal to or less than that value.
You’ll quickly note key phrases: “buying a business,” “intrinsic value,” and
“pay a price equal to or less than that value.” These are explicit tenets of the
value investing approach, and underlying them all is the notion of conscious
appraisal — that is, the idea of a rigorous and deliberate attempt to measure
business value. 
You’ll also notice that “price” enters the appraisal, but not until the end. Value
investors only go to the stock market to buy their shares of the business.
Value investors don’t look at the market as an indicator of whether to invest. 
With this definition of value investing as an appetizer, here’s a “main course”
of value investing principles. 
Buying a business
If you take nothing else away from reading this book, take away the thought
process that investing in stocks is really (or should be) like buying a 
business. 
That concept shouldn’t really be that hard to grasp — after all, when you buy
shares, you are buying a portion of a business, albeit in most cases a small
one. This isn’t to say you have to buy a larger share of the business to think
of your investment as buying a business — this principle applies even if
you’re buying a single share. 
Put differently, whether it’s an espresso cart or 1,000 shares of Starbucks you
want to buy, the purchase is analyzed the same way. Treat the investment as
10
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

if you were buying the business — the whole business. By buying shares,
you’re committing capital to that enterprise in exchange for an eventual
healthy and appropriate return on that investment. 
Now, some of you who got caught in the tech boom and bust may think 
you did exactly that. You followed a company and its story. The products
were “killer apps” and everything the company did made headlines.
Everybody wanted to own its products or work for the company. So you
bought shares. 
But did you look at business fundamentals? Intrinsic value of assets and
future profit prospects? Did you understand their strategy and competitive
advantages? Did you do your homework to assess whether the stock price
was at or below your appraisal? Likely not. That’s the difference between
value investing and most other forms of investing. 
Making a conscious appraisal
If you were interested in buying a business for yourself and thought the
corner hardware store looked attractive, how much would you be willing to
pay for it? You would likely be influenced by the sale price of other hardware
stores and by opinions shared by neighbors and other customers. But you
would still center your attention on the intrinsic economic value — the worth
and profit-generation potential — of that business, and a determination of
whether that worth and profit justified the price, before you committed your
hard-earned dough. 
Value investors like to refer to this as an appraisal of the business. The 
business would be appraised just as one would appraise a piece of property
or a prized antique. In fact, a business appraisal is deeper and more system-
atic than either of those two examples, as value is assigned to property or
antiques mainly by looking at the market and seeing what other houses or
vases of similar quality sold for. In the investing arena, there’s so much more
to go on. There are real facts and figures, all publicly available, upon which
the investor can base a true numbers appraisal, an appraisal of intrinsic
value, not just the market price.
Appraising the value, relating the value to the price, and looking for good 
bargains captures the essence of the value approach.
Beyond investment analysis
You may be inclined to ask, “Isn’t value investing merely ‘souped up’ 
investment analysis?” The kind of analysis done by professional Wall Street
analysts? 
11
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

It’s a good question, and becoming a better one as the tech boom and its
excesses fade into history. Analysts in those days were too focused on stock
prices and the general “buzz” about an industry, and were often too influ-
enced by their peers. Witness the hype about Amazon.com, which turned out
to be far too optimistic (and indeed at the time of this writing, still is). 
Basic investment analysis should start with an analysis of business funda-
mentals — the metrics and measures that define business performance, like
profitability, productivity, and capital structure. But it needs to go further to
be blended with the “story” to determine whether the fundamentals will hold
up, or better yet, improve. The “boom years” investment analysis tended to
overlook the fundamentals altogether, marching straight into the story. Some
analysts today tend to focus too much on fundamentals, like return on equity
(ROE) or “free cash flow,” without understanding the story. 
The value investor gets good at understanding and blending both — the 
fundamentals, the story, and how the two work together to define a really
great business. 
Chapters 6–10 dig into the mechanics of financial statements and funda-
mentals, while Chapters 11–15 explore how financial and marketplace 
fundamentals work together to define “intrinsic” and “strategic” values of a
business. At the end of the day, your appraisal will touch all of these bases. 
Get used to this idea: Adopting the value investing approach means becoming
your own investment analyst. You may read the work of others, but you’ll
incorporate it into your own analysis and investing decision. As your own
analyst, the pay can be good, but isn’t guaranteed — it’s clearly a “pay-for-
performance” proposition. One thing for certain: You’ll never have to buy or
dry clean a Brooks Brothers suit!
Ignoring the market
How can you spot the value investor at a cocktail party? Easy. He’s the 
only one talking about an actual company while all others stand around 
discussing the stock market.
The bird of a value-investing feather is easily spotted. Focusing on the 
company itself, not on the market is a consistent value investing attribute. 
As a general rule, value investors ignore the market and couldn’t care less
what the Dow or NASDAQ do on a particular day. They tune out the brokers,
advisers, commentators, chat-roomers, and friends (insofar as investment
advice is concerned, anyway). They may, however, listen to folks in the 
industry, customers, or people who know a lot about competitors.
12
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Value investors have a long-term focus. And if a value investor has done his
or her homework right, what the market does to his stocks on a daily basis is
irrelevant. If the company has value but the stock went down on Tuesday, a
value investor feels that it’s probably a result of the market misreading the
company’s value.
Now, to be sure, external factors can affect stock prices. Interest rates, in 
particular, can affect not only stock prices but also the true intrinsic value of
companies, as the cost of capital rises and falls and the value of alternative
investments increases (there’s more in Chapters 3 and 12). So while it makes
sense to pay some attention to the markets, especially in the long term, daily
fluctuations, particularly when they are just that, should be ignored. The
value investor can wait anywhere from a few years to forever for her invest-
ments to mature. The value investor looks for a good price with respect to
value, but doesn’t try to time the market. If the value is there and the price is
right, it will probably be right tomorrow, too.
Some sage advice from Warren Buffett: “For some reason, people take their
cues from price action rather than from values. What doesn’t work is when
you start doing things that you don’t understand or because they worked last
week for somebody else. The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is
because it’s going up.”
Value Investing Is Not... 
Following the same thread of logic that holds that “we all learn best from 
our mistakes,” sometimes the best way to define what something is is to
define what it isn’t. Or at least, to show why it isn’t constrained to a limiting
attribute like “value investing is long-term investing.” 
One at a time...
Not just conservative
Most people equate the concept of “value” investing with “conservative”
investing. Conservative investors focus on minimizing risk, and in many
cases, maximizing short-term cash returns from investments. 
Fixed income investments — such as bonds and money market funds and
stocks in placid sectors like utilities and insurance companies — meet the
“conservative” criteria, and there is nothing wrong with these investments.
Indeed, most, but not all fit “value” criteria as well — strong intrinsic 
value, steady, predictable returns — at a reasonable price.
13
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

But while most conservative investments are value investments, not all value
investments are conservative. It is possible to view a company like Starbucks,
with incredibly strong brand features, strategic position, and growth 
potential, especially ten years ago, as a value investment. A conservative
investment, no, but a value investment, quite possibly yes. 
Not just long term
Most value investments are long term. In fact, the Buffettonian view is to
“hold forever” and look for businesses that you would want to hold forever.
That’s part of what makes them a good value. 
But not all long-term investments are good values, and not all value invest-
ments are long term. Indeed, as business cycles shorten today, what is excel-
lent today may look like a flash in the pan as technologies used in business
and marketplace acceptance change. 
Buffett deals with this problem by simply avoiding technology makers and
heavily technology driven companies, for example, because (1) technology
changes and (2) he doesn’t understand technology in the first place. But even
stable businesses see their products change and change ever more quickly.
You once could buy only one “flavor” of Tide detergent, but now there are
dozens, and they change all the time. And it isn’t just all powder — there are
liquids, concentrated liquids — you get the idea.
So when buying a business, it’s good to look long term, but you must also
realize that businesses and their markets change, and you should always be
prepared to sell a business if assumptions change. That said, most value
investments — if they are truly value investments — should be good to hold
onto for more than a year, which is the IRS definition of “long term.” 
Not just low P/E
Oil companies, banks, food producers, and steel companies all have had P/E
ratios (price-to-earnings) below market averages. But does that mean they
are good values? Sometimes, but not always. Bethlehem Steel or — ahem —
Enron all traded at one time or another with low P/Es. But the earnings, and
the business itself, turned out not to be sustainable. 
So while low P/E can be part of the investing equation, especially when 
deciding when the stock price is right, it is far from the whole story. 
14
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Not the “opposite of growth”
“Stock ABC is a growth stock, and stock XYZ is a value stock.” You hear 
that all the time, and you’ll also hear it about mutual funds, which have 
been neatly divvied up by stock and fund information portal Morningstar
(www.morningstar.com) into neat little boxes tagged as “growth,” “value,”
and “blend.”
So value stocks aren’t supposed to grow? Well, some, like your local electric
utility, may prosper just fine on the business they have, and may pay you
handsome returns in the form of dividends. But for most companies, growth
is an integral part of the value of the business — it creates the return you
desire as an investor. 
So this treatment of value investing places growth in the center of the “value”
stage. It is the potential for growth that defines Starbucks and its brethren as
good values — the current assets and perhaps even current business levels
alone don’t justify the price. Indeed, this is what separates early value invest-
ing, as practiced and preached by patriarch Ben Graham, from the more
recent views practiced by Buffett and many of his current disciples: Growth
creates value. More on this in Chapter 3 and throughout the book. 
Cheap is a relative term
Above all, value investors seek to buy businesses at or below their appraised
value. Why? Not just because they like to get a good deal — it’s to provide a
margin of safety. 
Because any business appraisal is imprecise at best, the value investor likes
to give a cushion for error, a cushion just in case things don’t turn out exactly
as assessed.
So does that mean that a value investor always buys a stock below its highest
price? Usually, but not always. Does a value investor “bottom fish” for the
lowest 52-week price? Usually not. Why? Because it’s all about price relative
to value. A stock at a 52-week low may have serious flaws in its business or
marketplace acceptance. 
And value investors have been known to buy stocks at 52-week highs — 
if (and only if) even that price understated their value appraisal. Doesn’t
happen often, but knowing that it does happens reinforces the true value 
concept. 
15
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

Comparing the Value Investing 
Style to Others
Value investing is more than just a set of rules or guiding principles; it is an
investing style. It is an approach; a thought process; a “school” of investing; a
way of investing life that governs investing behavior for at least a portion of
an investor’s portfolio. Just like with the definition of value investing itself, it
helps to contrast the value investing style with other popular styles you may
have come across. 
Throughout market history, much has been made of the different approaches
to investing. There are fundamental and technical analysis, momentum
investing, trading, day trading, growth investing, income investing, and spec-
ulating. And there’s story or concept investing, where the investor goes with
whatever fad or technology is popular or sounds popular, without regard to
intrinsic value or price. Add to these the academic treatments of security 
valuation and portfolio theory that may make it as far as institutional trading
desks but seldom find their way to individual’s bookshelves.
16
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 
Evaluating your values
Value can be defined in many, many ways. Kind
of like pleasure, the term probably means some-
thing different to each one of us. Investors of all
feathers attach different meanings — a day
trader can look at a small uptick and call a stock
a value at a current price. Even among value
investors, the definition of the word may vary.
Some additional perspective may be in order.
Timothy Vick, in his book Wall Street on Sale
(McGraw-Hill, 1999) provides a few definitions of
value that are recognized by U.S. civil law:
 Fair market value is whatever someone will
be willing to pay for a similar asset — a.k.a.
market value. 
 Book value is a company’s net worth on an
accounting basis, which may differ from true
financial value because of accounting rules,
timing, and so on.
 Liquidation value (which is very subjective
and hard to predict) is what a company
would be worth if all the assets were sold. 
 Intrinsic value is “what an appraiser could
conclude a business is worth after under-
taking an analysis of the company’s financial
position,” based on assets, income, and
potential growth. The value investor looks to
establish intrinsic value. Only in some situa-
tions will the value investor take book or 
liquidation value into account.

In words that Abraham Lincoln may have used, all styles make money some
of the time, but no one style makes money all of the time. Each style suggests
a different approach to markets, the valuation of companies, and the 
valuation of stocks.

Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

The Value Investing Style 
We’ve stated it before: Value investing is a style of investing. It’s an approach
to investing. You, as an investor, will adopt some of the principles presented
here, but not all of them. You will develop a style and system that works for
you, and the knowledge available in the rest of this book will contribute to
your style.
No magic formulas
Some people buy and read investing books looking for a magic formula that
guarantees success. Buy when a stock crosses its 50-day moving average and
you’ll profit every time, or buy when the PEG (covered in Chapter 16) is less
than 1.0. 
Value investing isn’t quite that simple. There are so many elements and
nuances that go into a company’s business that you can’t know them all, let
alone figure out how to weigh them in your model. So rather than a recipe for
success, you will instead have a list of ingredients that should be in every
dish. But the art of cooking it up into a suitable value investment is up to you. 
Like all other investing approaches, value investing is both art and science. 
It is more scientific and methodical than some approaches, but it is by no
means completely formulaic. Why, if it were, everyone would use the same
formula, and there would be no reason for a market! Stock prices would
simply equal formulaic value. Wouldn’t that be boring?
Always do due diligence
It can’t be repeated enough: The value investor must do the numbers and
work to understand a company’s value. Although, as explained in Chapter 5,
there are information sources and services that do some of the number
crunching, you’re not relieved of the duty of looking at, interpreting, and
understanding the results. Diligent value investors review the facts and don’t
act until they’re confident in their understanding of the company, its value,
and the relation between value and price.
Nipping closely at the heels of diligence is discipline. The value investor does
the work, applies sound judgment, and patiently waits for the right price.
That is what separates the masters like Buffett from the rest.

Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Investing is no more than the allocation of capital for use by an enterprise
with the idea of achieving a suitable return. He who allocates capital best
wins!
A quest for consistency
While value investors have varying approaches to risk, some willing to
accept greater risk for greater rewards, almost all like a degree of consistency
in returns, profitability, growth, asset value, management effectiveness, 
customer base, supply chain, and most other aspects of the business. It’s 
the same consistency you’d strive for if you bought that espresso cart or
hardware store yourself. 
Before agreeing to buy that hardware store, you’d probably want to know
that the customer base is stable and that income flows are steady or at least
predictable. If that’s not the case, you would need to have a certain amount 
of additional capital to absorb the variations. Perhaps you’d need more for
more advertising or promotion to bolster the customer base. 
In short, there would be an uncertainty in the business, which, from the
owner’s point of view, translates to risk. The presence of risk requires addi-
tional capital and causes greater doubt about the success of the investment
for you or any other investors in the business. As a result, the potential
return required to accept this risk and make you, the investor, look the other
way is greater.
The value investor looks for consistency in an attempt to minimize risk and
provide a margin of safety for his or her investment. This is not to say the
value investor won’t invest in a risky enterprise; it’s just to say that the price
paid for earnings potential must correctly reflect the risk. Consistency need
not be absolute, but predictable performance is important.
Focus on intangibles
As you’ll see in detail especially in Chapter 14, today’s value investors are as
intently focused on business intangibles, like brand and customer loyalty, as
on the “hard” financials. It’s all about looking at what’s behind the numbers,
and moreover, what will create tangible value in the future. 
So a look at the market or markets in which the company operates is 
important. Looking at products, market position, brand, public perception,
customers and customer perception, supply chain, leadership, opinions, 
and a host of others factors is important.
19
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

Provide a margin of safety
We mentioned the idea of buying a company at a bargain price to achieve 
a margin of safety; that is, to provide a buffer if business events don’t turn
out exactly as predicted (and they won’t). The value investing style calls for
building in margins of safety by buying at a reasonable price. The style also
suggests finding margins of safety within the business itself, for instance, 
so-called “moats” or competitive advantages that differentiate the business
from its competitors. Finally, a large cash hoard or the absence of debt offers
a financial margin of safety. 
It’s not about diversification 
You probably have heard on every talk show or read in every investing maga-
zine that the key to investing success is to diversify. Diversification provides
safety in numbers and avoids the eggs-in-one-basket syndrome, so it protects
the value of a portfolio.
Well, yes, there’s some truth to that. But the masters of value investing 
have shown that diversification only serves to dilute returns. If you’re doing
the value investing thing right, you are picking the right companies at the 
right price, so there’s no need to provide this extra insurance. In fact, over-
diversification only serves to dilute returns. That said, perhaps diversifica-
tion isn’t a bad idea until you prove yourself a good value investor. The point
is that, somewhat counter to the conservative image, diversification per se is
not a value investing technique. More about this is found in Chapter 4.
A blended approach
If you decide to take up the value investing approach, know that it doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing commitment. The value investing approach
should serve you well if you use it for, say, 80 percent or 90 percent of your
stock portfolio. Be diligent, select the stocks, and sock them away for the
long term as a portfolio foundation. But that shouldn’t exclude the occasional
possibility of trying to enhance portfolio returns by using more aggressive
short-term tactics, like buying call options. 
These tactics work faster than traditional value investments, which 
may require years for the fruits to ripen. Of course, this doesn’t mean taking
unnecessary or silly risks; rather, it means that sometimes investments can
perform well based on something other than long-term intrinsic value. It
doesn’t hurt to try to capitalize on that, so long as you understand the risks
20
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

and are willing to face losses. In fact, it’s best to think of a short-term trading
opportunity as simply a very short-term value investment — a stock, for
instance, is very temporarily on sale relative to its true value. 
Likewise, it’s perfectly okay to put capital away for short-term fixed returns.
You don’t have to work hard on “due diligence” for all parts of your portfolio
at the same time. 
A solid base in bonds, money market funds, or similar investments will 
produce returns and allow you to focus your energy on the parts of your
portfolio you do want to manage more actively. 
You don’t have to use the value investing approach for all your investments.
Depending on your goals, it’s okay to mix investing styles.
Are You a Value Investor?
By now, you’ve probably asked yourself the questions, “Am I patient
enough?” “Do I have what takes?” “Can I do the numbers stuff?” “I’m not 
sure I was cut out to be an entrepreneur — how to I appraise a business?”
Here are seven character traits found in most value investors:
 Bargain hunter: Do you check the price of the hotel across the street
before you check into your chosen hotel? Do you study detailed automo-
bile specifications and prices before you buy? Do you look at different
boxes of detergent to see how much better the deal is on the 67-ounce
size versus the 43-ounce size? You have a key trait of a value investor,
although we continue to be surprised at otherwise frugal folks who are
willing to throw investment dollars at almost anything.
 Do it yourselfer: Value investors want to check the numbers themselves
and build their own assessments. By doing so, they develop a better
understanding of the company and its fundamentals.
 Like margins of safety: People who actually slow down when it rains are
more likely to be better value investors.
 Long-term focus: Value investors would rather make a lot of money
slowly than a little flashy money in one day. Sort of like going for mar-
riage instead of one-night stands.
 Business, not price oriented: The value investor focuses on the underly-
ing business, not the price or superficial image. They look under the
hood instead of at the trim. Value investing is sometimes called 
inside-out investing.
21
Chapter 1: An Investor’s Guide to Value Investing

 Numbers oriented: Not advanced mathematics, mind you, but you can’t
get completely away from the numbers. Value investors are concerned
about company business fundamentals and performance. For those who
don’t like numbers, fortunately there are software packages that do
some of the computation and preparation for you. And there are screen-
ers to semi-automate company selection. Find out more in Chapter 5.
 Contrarian: Value investors are not crowd followers! Value investors
stay away from what’s exciting and hip quite purposefully. By definition,
popular stocks aren’t normally bargains.
Value investors like to make lists of selection criteria and then choose compa-
nies that match the greatest number of them. You can do the same with this
list. To be a good value investor, you certainly don’t need to excel in every
trait! But you’ll find that five or six out of the seven listed here would be a 
big help.

V
olatility. The “V” word. You hear about it all the time. The market is on
“cruise control,” and then all of a sudden, some little thing unforeseen
happens to stir things up. Subprime loan defaults. Oil prices. The dot-com
bubble burst. A war.
Yet, the markets have run mostly up and to the right for 25-plus years —
since August 1982, in fact. The S&P 500 index — today’s most widely
accepted index of the broader stock market — was hovering at about 100. 
In mid-2007; it reached a new all-time high of 1,555.90. 
But along the way, we’ve had our bumps. Some five trillion in investment
value or “market cap” wiped out in the 2000–2001 bear market. That steadily
rising S&P 500 got “trucked” from its 2000 peak in the 1,500s all the way back
to 775 in October 2002. Was that a big deal? You bet — for all of us. 
The boom years of the late 1990s and the early part of the year 2000 signified
an important change and an important turning point in the history of invest-
ing. Clearly, investing, investors, and investment practices at that time had
moved away from analysis of value and the business fundamentals that 
support it. As the percentage of stock-owning households moved from the
teens in the early 1970s to 30 percent in the 1980s to beyond 50 percent in
2001, a growing portion of the investing public knew little about reading
financial statements — or perhaps even where to find one!

People bought stocks based on stories they heard from colleagues at the
office, friends at cocktail parties, and neighbors over the backyard fence. 
And the retail brokerage industry got into the game, too, offering investment
analysis that seemingly supported almost anything. Add to that the prolifera-
tion of online brokerages and the reinvention of do-it-yourself investing as
online trading and we got a frothy investment mix driven by people who
didn’t really know what they were doing.
Since then, however, value investing has caught on, and we’ve seen a dra-
matic return to investing based on fundamentals — so much so that many 
of the so-called “value” stocks actually became overvalued. 
Add to that the dramatic shift in retirement savings from defined benefit 
pension plans to self-directed investment accounts — led by 401(k)s — and
you have a far greater emphasis placed on long-term, fundamentals-based
investing. That said, there will always be short-term “players” out there. . . .
The good news is that value investing has become more popular, so there’s
more information and commentary out there to help the value investor. The
bad news is that — well — value investing has become more popular — so
it’s harder to find good values. 
This chapter doesn’t dwell on the details of the story, but instead furnishes 
a contextual canvas onto which we can paint the value investing picture. 
Markets and Market Performance
The story of markets and market performance over the past decade could fill
many books (and has). This book doesn’t go that far, and won’t belabor the
different markets, stock investing details like how trades are executed, or the
myriad performance indicators. There are plenty of other places to pick up
this information. But, more to the point: Value investors really don’t care. 
Now that’s a bold statement. Do value investors have an attitude problem? 
Nope. The point is that value investors aren’t that concerned about markets,
trading processes, and trading behavior. The market is simply a place to buy
a portion of a business — and perhaps not sell it for a long, long time. Value
investors care little about whether an order is executed on the bid or ask
price, nor do they care what regional market, ECN, or execution system was
used. The transaction is an investment, a long-term investment. The market
simply provides a place to acquire the investment. So the NYSE (New York
Stock Exchange) or NASDAQ, market or limit order, SOES or SuperMontage,
and other jargon from the world of active trading really don’t matter. 
24
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

So in a departure from most investing books, we don’t talk much about 
markets. And if you’re really a value investor (or want to become one), you
yourself don’t care about markets . . . except when they undervalue 
businesses.
Despite the academic rumblings of the “efficient market theory” (which 
holds that with good information and a sufficient number of players, markets
will find the right price for a business), markets aren’t perfect. There are
always bargains. Stocks may be undervalued because of lack of knowledge 
or lack of visibility, or perhaps they’re part of a group that’s out of favor alto-
gether. These stocks are selling for less than may be indicated by the value of
the business or the potential of the business. So in this sense, value investors
love the markets. The markets, through their imperfections, provide value
investors their opportunity. As Warren Buffett says, if markets were perfect,
he’d be “standing on the corner holding a tin cup.”
The Markets: How We Got Here
A stock market represents the sum total of the public’s perception of the
business value of the companies trading in that market. True business value,
which we explore in depth in this book, is the sum total of productive assets
and, in particular, what those assets produce in the form of current and
future earnings. As long as companies produce more, it makes sense that
their values rise. And as long as the public perception matches true value,
the stock value rises in lockstep. 
You can and should expect, in aggregate, that the total value of all businesses
would rise roughly in line with the increase in the size of the economy, as 
represented by gross domestic product (GDP). This is true, and it can be
argued that business value grows further through increases in productivity.
The value of market-traded businesses could rise still more if the businesses
grew their share of the total economy — as Borders Group and Barnes and
Noble have grown their share of the total bookselling business. 
If you look closely at long-term stock market growth (by most measures 
of return, 10–11 percent annually) you see how the long-term GDP growth of 
3 to 5 percent, productivity growth of 1 to 2 percent, and long-term inflation
in the 3 to 6 percent range, added together, provide an explanation for the
long-term market growth rate. In the short term, depending on the value of
alternative investments, such as bonds, real estate, and so on, market value
may actually rise faster or slower than business value. And inflation also 
tampers with market valuations. So can markets grow at 20 percent per year?
Not for long.
25
Chapter 2: How Value Investors View the Markets — and Vice Versa

It isn’t impossible for the markets to rise 20 percent in a given year or two,
but such growth year after year is hard to fathom if the economy at large is
growing at only 3 to 5 percent annually. But for a particular stock? Sure it’s
possible. If the company is building a new business or is taking market 
share from existing businesses, 20 percent growth can be quite realistic. But
forever? Doubtful. Some call this “reversion to the mean” — sooner or later,
gravitational forces will take hold and a company will cease to grow at above-
average rates. As an investor, you must realistically appraise when this 
will happen. 
They say history predicts the future, so let’s take a short tour of the past six
decades of stock market history, with special focus on lessons for value
investors.
The “Good Old Days” — 
The 1950s and ’60s
Time was, you simply bought the market. You plunked down hard-earned
money to invest in the American Way, believing it the right and most 
economically progressive way on the planet.
You bought for the long term. You owned General Motors, General Mills, 
RCA, and, if a little more adventurous, IBM or Xerox. The stock certificates
sat in your safety deposit box and you most likely called your broker only if
you had accumulated a little more money to invest, or if some was needed for
a major purchase. A few government bonds or savings bonds may have sat
alongside the stock certificates, purchased as much out of patriotic duty as
for safety or investment return. Maybe you purchased a bank or S&L CD with
an eye for safety, but also for the kitchen appliance “premium.” 
You checked the paper at most weekly. At that time, many major newspapers
didn’t have stock tables because only a small slice of the population had 
individual investments. You watched the Dow Industrials, Rails, Utilities, and
65 Stocks nightly on the Huntley-Brinkley Report. You cared more about the
averages than your individual stocks, because the market was your stocks.
You got excited when General Motors reported record sales and earnings,
although you probably didn’t think too much about what that meant or
whether it would continue. You probably bought stock in companies you
worked for, and bought the company’s products out of a sense of duty to 
support your business. Your investments grew with the economy. There was
little to worry about — and little for you to do.

Political Ties and International
Dependence — The 1970s
On May 1, 1975, high fixed brokerage commissions became a thing of the
past. A more competitive environment evolved with more, better, and
cheaper services for individual investors. Lower commissions enabled more
investors to trade in and out of stocks more frequently without worrying
about high fixed commission costs. Markets became dramatically more
liquid, with more investors and traders making more trades, and shifts
between stock sectors, as well as in and out of the market, became much
more feasible. 
In the 1970s, investors and investment professionals alike started to 
realize that investments weren’t bound to follow the economy as a whole,
that certain sectors and industries were bound to do better than others.
Cyclical companies and companies overly dependent on cheap, abundant
resources — such as foreign oil — were no longer the best bets. It was 
certainly the beginning of a more complex, dynamic investing climate with 
an ever-expanding list of factors that influenced investing performance. 
The advent of NASDAQ and deregulated commissions made “main street,”
“do-it-yourself” investing really feasible for the first time. 
But aside from annual reports and other company releases, there was little
information for a value-oriented investor to use. Some individual investors
began to speculate in rapidly rising resource and technology companies, but
most continued to buy name-brand, blue-chip U.S. stocks. Unfortunately,
some of these companies took big hits from resource supply shocks and the
economic fallout that followed. Large conglomerates, the 1960s’ answer to
productivity gains and stability, fell apart in the 1970s. Many investors
became skeptical of big corporations for the first time. 
Aside from the oil embargo and the two major equity market changes, the
1970s were fairly uneventful. The Dow Jones Industrial average traded in a
modest 500 point range through the decade. Businesses, dogged by political
uncertainty, high interest rates, high commodity prices, and general inflation,
couldn’t get much traction. “Stagflation” was the buzzword of the day. Key
industries, such as automobiles and steel, had to deal with foreign competi-
tion. There were few individual investors in the market, and most new
entrants came in through the mutual fund route, which was just starting to
gain popularity because of its simplicity, trading cost edge for very small
investors, and professional managers who were able to understand the ever
more complex business world. 
27
Chapter 2: How Value Investors View the Markets — and Vice Versa

Globalization, Asset Shift, and 
Technology — The 1980s 
Ronald Reagan took office in January 1980 with little market fanfare — 
at least initially. However, the high interest rates at the time (at one point 
the Fed funds rate was 22 percent — compare that to the 1 percent rates of
2003–2004!) stifled any business growth and convinced most that hard assets
such as real estate — though expensive to buy — were still the best choice.
Interest rates were kept artificially high to combat inflation, and businesses
paid the price in two ways — high interest rates and high commodity prices.
The inflation factor became the biggest “swing factor” in most business 
decisions. 
As August 1982 approached, interest rates had started downward and infla-
tion had started to subside. President Reagan pushed through tax legislation
that included a new assortment of retirement savings incentives for individu-
als and small businesses. Transportation deregulation, more free trade, and
increased government spending in technology and defense sectors added to
the story. The result was a long-awaited shift of capital from real estate and
fixed assets into stocks. The “bull run,” which was to last almost 18 years
with a few short interruptions, had begun.
The newly rediscovered stock market grew steadily through the mid-’80s.
Suddenly, picking stocks was trendy and cool, and exciting developments in
technology and computers brought investing to the masses. 
As the decade went on, the market continued upward to a point more than
triple its modest August 1982 beginnings — until that horrible day in October
1987. Lower taxes, as well as business and consumer optimism, led the mar-
kets higher and induced people to spend more in their personal lives as 
well. But what were they buying? A lot of foreign goods. Buying foreign had
become the trend not only for cars but everything, from clothes, food, and
skis to home décor, tires, and beer. 
A ballooning trade deficit resulted, and, to keep the dollar relatively strong
and attractive for foreign investment, interest rates were kept high. The left-
over inflation fear from a few years prior also fueled a lingering high interest
rate mentality. That week in October, a particularly bad trade deficit report,
high interest rates of over 10 percent for U.S. Treasury bonds, a period of
almost uninterrupted stock market growth, and some speculative excess in
stocks such as Digital Equipment created a volatile mix. The Dow dropped
from over 2,700 points to just above 2,200 on Monday, October 19, 1987 —
the worst one-day percentage plunge ever. 
28
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

The situation was worsened by the increased participation of novice individ-
ual investors — and the fact that the investing infrastructure had not evolved
to handle such an event. Most buy-and-sell orders were manual or, at best,
semi-automated. The resulting onslaught of orders overburdened the system
and caused requests to sell (or buy) to be ignored altogether, adding to 
the panic.
Shocked investors lost their proverbial shirts. A lot of wealth disappeared,
and what was left seemed to be teetering on the brink. Everyone watched the
overseas markets with bated breath. Would they rush to cash in their U.S.
investments and debt securities? Many investors woke to find some of their
wealth had disappeared into the coffers of Japan, Hong Kong, or Singapore.
There was concern that, for the first time, U.S. market results may be dictated
by what happened to the Nikkei, the Hang Seng, and the German DAX. People
watched CNN round the clock waiting to see what signals these markets
would send. It felt like the stock market never closed — it just shifted to 
different parts of the world as the day went on. 
Fortunately, foreign investors stood pat and did nothing to exacerbate the
crisis, and the Fed followed by pumping the system with liquidity and by
gradually reducing interest rates. After a six-month consolidation period,
investors once again gained confidence and started back in, but this time
more cautiously. Business, aided by technology, was changing fast, and 
government policy was changing too — for the first time really being used 
to prop up asset values. Even the most secure long-term investor now had 
to watch for such “perfect storms” that could wipe out huge chunks of
market value. Conditions were still favorable for investing in businesses —
and even more so as interest rates and the dollar declined. But the impera-
tive to invest rationally grew by leaps and bounds due to this event.
Democratization and the Internet 
Bubble — The 1990s
Saddam Hussein kicked off the 1990s with his September 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which resulted in “Gulf War I.” The investors held their breath, but 
by January 1991, we could all breathe easily again. But although the markets
initially applauded the end of the threat, an extended period of economic 
dislocation followed. The boom of the 1980s had gotten tired; key industries,
such as automobiles and basic manufacturing, saw a down cycle, exacer-
bated once again by the flood of imports. The markets really didn’t get going
29
Chapter 2: How Value Investors View the Markets — and Vice Versa

again until 1992 — an election year. A youthful Bill Clinton and his vision of
the “information superhighway” jazzed the markets, particularly the technol-
ogy sector. The vision promised faster, more efficient business and a new
conduit to reach customers. Few really knew what the Internet was at that
point, but it sounded pretty good. 
Within a couple of years after Clinton’s inauguration, the first fruits of this
vision started to show. Americans could sign up on America Online to access
the Internet from their homes. Businesses could network computers and
operations with each other, and e-mail became a standard within corporate
walls. The growth of the Internet was not just a boon to suppliers of Internet
“parts,” nor to up-and-coming Internet-only companies building a new elec-
tronic channel to sell existing products. It was a new opportunity for all busi-
nesses to build a new market presence and streamline or simplify operations.
Every company developed a “web strategy” and executed it, at least in 
part, in record time. The stock market liked what it saw and recognized all
companies, both suppliers and beneficiaries, of this new exciting business
paradigm. 
There were speed bumps in the late 1990s. In 1997, a currency crisis created
by poor monetary policy in the rapidly growing Asian nations caused another
short but sharp market decline. A crisis mentality took hold again in the fall
of 1998 when Russia defaulted on some international debt. These sharp
declines were driven by fear, world events, and, most of all, because stocks
needed a breather and people had a reason to sell.
In June of 1998, the stock price of a small company called Amazon.com
started to move. The market awoke to the dot.com concept, and the stock
rocketed skyward. Soon, other companies started following suit. The whole
game became finding companies that hadn’t been “found” yet and buying
stock in them before they took off. This strategy worked most of the time,
egged on by huge initial public offering (IPO) run-ups for still more companies
and the beginnings of a merger phase. The Internet stock boom took the 
rest of the market with it. Like most booms, there was some rationale — the
cost of doing business would go down, sales would go up, and everyone
would happily march to the bank.
This notion of business utopia combined with stock market excitement to
create a self- fulfilling prophecy. Believing that things were getting better
made things seem better. But there was still another force at work, shaped 
by the Internet. For the first time in history, individual investors had virtual
real-time connections to the stock market. Free and easy access gave entry 
to many more market players, and the market was already in a boom to 
begin with.
30
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

In the late 1990s, the last overhanging concern — and in some cases, para-
noia — was the year 2000 itself, and what that particular number would 
mean to the computer code that now ran everything. The reality: Years of
preparation and purchase of new equipment made Y2K a non-event. The one
legacy that Y2K had created was huge demand for technology products to
protect against catastrophe. So much so that businesses right after the new
year started wondering where all the business had gone. At the same time,
the huge capital inflow into the markets from individual investors and ven-
ture capitalists started to play out, as people began to wonder when they
would start getting a return on their investments.
Once again, a perfect storm was brewing. This time it wasn’t global events 
or interest rates — it was a fading business cycle and the realization that,
although the Internet brought improvements in business fundamentals and
productivity, it wasn’t an “off the charts” improvement. The presence and 
use of the Internet did not guarantee success to any business. The Internet
was a tool to execute a sound business strategy, not a business strategy 
in itself.
The grim result and profound lessons are recent enough to stick in the minds
of all investors. There were many lessons — some repeated history and some
were new. No bull market can go on forever; overvalued stocks are indeed
overvalued and should be treated as such, growth in value of business assets
cannot consistently exceed growth in the economy, and it takes more than a
business plan to guarantee success. One other obvious realization from this
period: Business cycles are becoming ever shorter, and investors need to
stay on top of these cycles and invest accordingly. As the years 2001 and
2002 unfolded, investors realized that the “perfect storm” of the millennium
was more damaging than anyone thought.
And in the mists of the dot-com blowup, one could barely recognize the
group of old “value” names like Procter & Gamble and Campbell Soup — 
companies that continued to churn out profits and cash flow with relatively
low P/E ratios compared to the market. but they didn’t have “sexy” products,
so the markets left them behind. 
Even Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway declined some 50 percent during
the dot-com bubble and subsequent fallout. 
But this group was about to come forward in a big way during the “oughts.”
31
Chapter 2: How Value Investors View the Markets — and Vice Versa

Trust Shattered and Recovered — 
The “Oughts” 
As the “perfect storm” of the millennium began to blow, other events began
to release their fury on the investment world, events that would shake the
very foundation of “traditional” investment behavior and practice, and make
the vastly grown pool of individual investors once again wary of the markets. 
The fallout started in late 2000 with persistent downward momentum in the
markets. Earnings results were at best flat; sales forecasts released by major
companies were flat or declining. Clearly the business cycle had shifted and
had started to contract with reduced demand, reduced inventories, and 
cancelled orders. The message had changed from steadily rising expectations
to executive bewilderment and a strongly implied “things won’t be what 
they were again for a long time,” and investor confidence was spooked with
predictable results. 
In November 2001, Enron shocked the investment world with a revelation 
of a $1 billion write-off for assets suddenly deemed worthless. No longer
could we trust what had been sacred — the reporting of financial results.
When Adelphia Communications and, later, the still more mainstream
WorldCom went down for much the same reason, we suddenly realized a
much bigger problem: Most individuals — and a large number of professional
investors and analysts, for that matter — never really understood financial
statements. We had forgotten that although assets may be fictitious and 
subjectively valued, liabilities are always real. Following the trail of how a
company came up with its numbers was nearly impossible and, in the era of
increased public visibility, where any earnings “miss” was sure to be pun-
ished, executives did what they could to make things look right. Investors
knew the books could be cooked, but were surprised at how much. 
Meanwhile, questions started to emerge about the brokerage and invest-
ment banking industries. The very companies who hired these analysts and
published their advice had investment banking relationships with the compa-
nies they followed. If a firm had lent millions to a company and makes 
millions more selling that company’s securities to investors, under what 
circumstances would that firm tell the public that investing in that company
was a bad idea? Not many. Fewer than 10 percent of all analysts gave 
recommendations to sell. 
Corporate earnings, naturally, declined substantially during the fallout from
the bust. After overspending, especially on technology, businesses simply
stopped spending. Consumers, shaken by the 9/11 terrorists attacks and job
instability, also cut back. Growth expectations fell, and stocks fell to lows that
many thought would never be seen.

But the Fed took quick action to stimulate the economy by dropping interest
rates, and a renewed focus on business fundamentals and rationale squeezed
the previous fluff out of the business environment. Corporate investing deci-
sions once again became based on ROI (return on investment) and, perhaps
helped along by Congress and new accounting rules, financial reporting
regained footing in reality. 
The result: Markets in 2003 started a four-year trend upward, culminating in
new record highs set in the summer of 2007. But unlike the previous highs set
in 2000, these were based on corporate profitability — and hence, value.
That’s most easily shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1 from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, shows the S&P 500 index and
the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio for the index. The chart shows that the most
recent rally, starting in 2003, has truly been based on fundamentals — while
the S&P has risen steadily, the P/E ratio has not, and in fact, is hovering near
a 17-year low. Interpretation: The most recent stock gains are based on 
earnings growth — that is, based on growing company value. 
By the time you read this, you’ll know more about how things turned out
than we do at this writing juncture. We will maintain our position that 
companies with sound financial fundamentals and valuable assets fundamen-
tally positioned for growth, selling at reasonable prices, will outperform in
the long run. 
As the “oughts” went forward into 2007, by some accounts so-called growth
stocks had once again overtaken “value” stocks. According to a story in The
Wall Street Journal, for the first time since 2000, a growth stock index tracked
by Morningstar was up 14 percent for the first 7 months of the year, led by
names like Amazon.com, vs. 8 percent for a value stock index.

Chapter 2: How Value Investors View the Markets — and Vice Versa

The Investing Climate — 
Changed Forever? 
The 2000–2002 market collapse and the highly visible demise of Enron and
others created an era of mistrust and a quest for safety that in turn led to 
a boom in value oriented investing. A number of investors became ardent 
do-it-yourselfers — analyze the business, ignore the analysts, disintermediate
the middlemen. Others went the fund route and opted for value-oriented
funds. Still others went to real estate investment trusts, and more recently,
ETFs as instruments to build or fill out portfolios. And some left the markets
completely — and missed out on the stellar performance that followed. 
Whichever path or paths were chosen, it is clear that ever since the bust
people are looking at their investments more objectively with more realistic
goals and appraisals of their financial and marketplace fundamentals. No
longer are individual investment decisions driven by stock market behavior
alone or by the advice of those individuals who work on Wall Street.
Value investors: The new market gurus
And what about value investors as a group? Has their “stock” risen as, for so
many years, they were the butt of so many comments from high-flying tech
investors — “Procter & Gamble? How boring!” Even Buffett himself took a lot
of shots, many wondered publically — even journalists — whether his 
investing style was finished.
The reality: Value investors and portfolio managers like Buffett have resumed
their former status as gurus. And for a number of years now — mention 
at a cocktail party that you’re a value-oriented investor in the Buffett-Graham
style, and you’ll have a crowd of people around you asking about your
“secrets” and what your favorite value plays are. Guaranteed.
The world is flat, and other trends
The “investment style of the day” has shifted from value to growth to outright
speculation, back to value, and maybe back to growth — although we don’t
separate “growth” and “value” to the extent that market “experts” do.
34
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

It’s worth following other business and investing trends, for they should
always be in the back of your mind as you evaluate companies and 
investments. Here are a few:
 Globalization: The world is getting smaller, economically speaking.
Businesses are increasing global market reach into international
economies, and are increasing “supply” reach in sourcing goods and 
services at the lowest possible prices. Value investors need to appraise
whether a business is getting the most out of these trends, taking advan-
tage of available import and export opportunities. It also raises the 
question of whether to invest in overseas companies. The answer is the
same as with domestic ones — if you understand the business and
understand the financials, maybe yes. But understanding the business
and especially the financials, with different accounting practices, may 
be difficult. 
 Shorter business cycles: It took the railroad industry 70 years to start,
prosper, and begin its decline. It took the Internet industry about seven
years to do the same. The point: Business changes come much faster,
and what you invest in today may not even be around in 10 years — 
you must stay on top of business and technology trends. Even if you’re
investing in soup or razor blades. 
 The Information Age: It’s here, and there’s no going back. The success
of a business often depends on its use of information systems and 
technology; in fact, in many businesses, it’s a key competitive advantage
that forms a “moat” or barrier to entry for others. But technology leader-
ship can be notoriously hard to assess. Often it can be through your 
own experience with a company — Southwest Airlines is a good exam-
ple, with its industry-leading use of the Internet to enable consumers 
to book their own travel easily, quickly and cheaply. 
 Volatility: Exacerbated by the three factors just mentioned, market
volatility seems to be here to stay. Markets will rise and fall in 5 or 10
percent increments in a given month — with no real change in business
value to support the change. Investors must, more than ever, be patient
and try to separate real business change from market change. And 
they will learn to use the dips to find value.

alue investing has been around since the beginning of market and 
investing history. Yet, especially before 2002, it has had relatively low
visibility. As more individual investors jumped on board in the late 1990s,
people were more excited more by the go-go world of trading and aggressive
growth investing. More intrigued by companies that make 2GB fabric- and
fiber-channel storage-area network routers and switches than by companies
that sell paint and insurance. 
While boring to some, the value investing approach has earned strong
returns for its faithful followers, often far beyond market averages for good
stock pickers. Value investing has brought prosperity in healthy markets and
survival during the numerous downturns throughout the twentieth century.
Value investing often deals in boring industries and requires patient exami-
nation of the nitty-gritty details of financial statements. Value analysis comes
slowly, as does value investing success. Because that may be discouraging to
some investors, we decided to share the journey and thoughts of the most
successful value investors, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and some of
those who follow their practices. Value investing got its beginnings and 
developed into a serious investing discipline based on their teachings and
experience. 

The Patriarch: Benjamin Graham
The beginnings of value investing as a documented discipline go back to
Benjamin Graham. Graham was a self-made financial analyst and investor
who proved very successful through some very trying investing times (as 
in the Great Depression). Graham was born in 1894, excelled in academics,
started with a Wall Street firm at age 20, and was managing other people’s
money before he was 30. He went on to found Graham Newman, a New York
investment firm, and to build a substantial investment portfolio for his
clients. 
Graham left a legacy for the rest of us when he went on to write the original
bibles of value investing and to teach the art of value investing at Columbia
University. One of his many famous students is Warren Buffett. To this day,
Mr. Buffett and other Graham disciples pay the utmost respect to his 
pioneering leadership.
The good books of value investing
During the Depression (1934, to be exact), Graham teamed up with one of his
junior Columbia colleagues who took notes during his lectures, David Dodd,
to write Security Analysis. The most recent edition of the book (McGraw-Hill,
2004) is 770 pages long and is hardly an easy read. Aimed largely at the 
professional investment community, the book takes apart businesses and
financial statements brick by brick. The book has been in print, in several 
editions, since 1934, and probably has the longest legs of any investing book. 
Now here’s a value investment: An original 1934 first hardcover edition of 
the book, signed by Graham himself, was recently listed at $50,000! But you
can also buy a brand-new copy of the reprinted McGraw Hill 1934 “classic 
edition” in hardcover for about $40. 
Although Security Analysis is targeted at investment professionals, it is 
useful to all types of investors. According to writer/biographer Janet Lowe,
the early editions are worth reading “because they show how much things
change and how much they don’t.” Truly, Graham’s recognition of the impor-
tance of fundamental business basics (assets, earnings, cash flow, risk, cost
of capital, and interest rates) is timeless. Also interesting are the observa-
tions on the speculation and shady investment schemes that happen 
today just as they did back then. Graham was quite outspoken and cynical
about the motives and methods of the speculator, stating that when a 
stock purchase is “motivated by speculative greed” the investor “desires 
to conceal this unlovely impulse behind a screen of apparent logic and 
good sense.”
38
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Graham was among the first to separate market movement and timing from
investing. For Graham, the market was an emotional animal, and trying to
time its moves was guesswork that amounted to speculation. He described
the market as an “emotionally disturbed business partner.” To Graham,
investing required a focus on the company. The students of Graham learned 
a few specific mathematical formulas and relationships, but went on to learn
the reasoning processes and investing philosophy that drive the value 
investing style. Graham specifically taught people to calculate intrinsic value
to look for a margin of safety, and to avoid speculative impulses.
In 1949, Graham came out with another classic, The Intelligent Investor. It’s
widely available today, priced at $30.00. Because it’s only 296 pages long, you
may initially question its price versus its intrinsic value. But if you weigh in
the intangibles of enjoying one of the classics of investing history — and the
prospect of making good investments — the rather high per-pound price is
justified!
The Intelligent Investor is largely a repackaging of Security Analysis for the 
nonprofessional investor, although the language and formulas are still a bit
intimidating for some. The more contemporary books on value investing
(including this one) are easier to digest.
The foundation
Benjamin Graham and those value investors who followed him relied on 
the balance sheet for the first indication of a company’s status and value.
Essentially, the balance sheet is a snapshot of what the company owns and
what it owes. If it owns more than it owes, the company scores points with
the value investor. If what it owns is productive and has marketable value,
the company scores more points. Graham and some value investors place
more emphasis on the balance sheet, while others, notably Buffett, take a
closer look at the income and cash flow statements. The reality: You have 
to look at all three statements; they are inextricably linked. None of the 
three alone can tell the whole story.
Graham believed that the balance sheet revealed the foundation, the value
below which a company would never go. The balance sheet also reveals the
degree of safety, in the form of liquid assets and assets in excess of debt.
A brief word about assets and asset quality: Assets come in all shapes and
sizes. Liquid assets are those that can be quickly and easily sold or converted
at or near their reported value. Cash, most accounts receivable, and mar-
ketable securities owned by the firm are liquid. Certain inventories and other
assets may be liquid, but many are not. For example, a stock of Intel Pentium
III processors is obsolete and probably not worth what it says it is on the
books. Same goes for buildable land in a weak housing environment. 
39
Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

Fixed assets, such as plants and equipment, are usually considered illiquid.
True, they can be sold, often for prices meeting or exceeding their reported
value. But the selling process may take a long time and the cash won’t be
available for a long time. Likewise, hard assets — those that you can see, feel,
and touch, or that show up on a bank statement — usually have more value
than soft items, such as patents, business agreements, and other items of
goodwill. Assets not only come in different shapes and sizes but also have 
different degrees of quality. An old disused railroad track is certainly less
valuable than the latest state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing
machine.
Nets and net net
Graham liked to take a close look at assets and particularly current assets.
Then he compared per-share asset values with stock prices. When a stock
was selling at a discount to asset value, particularly current asset value, it
was a bargain.
Net current asset value
Graham used two key measures: net current asset value and net net asset value
per share. Net current asset value is defined today by most financial analysts
as working capital. Working capital is the asset base that recirculates through
the business as cash, receivables, and inventory and is used to acquire raw
materials and to produce and sell products. (It is calculated simply by sub-
tracting current assets from current liabilities — more on that in Chapter 7.)
A company with a strong working capital position can expand its business,
try new things, and produce new revenue and earnings streams. A company
short on working capital struggles to produce and market its products can’t
capitalize on new business opportunities, and is vulnerable to downturns.
Working capital is analogous to a household checking account. High checking
account balances and low debt afford the household more opportunity, 
flexibility, and safety — the same is true of a company with healthy working
capital.
What we just said about working capital — the more, the better — is gener-
ally true. However, modern corporate finance as practiced by some compa-
nies, notably retailers and some high-efficiency manufacturers such as Dell,
Inc., uses very low or even negative levels of working capital. In effect, these
companies run the business on someone else’s money. Increased profitability
results from high asset turnover and asset productivity combined with
reduced exposure to obsolete inventory. For such a company, Graham’s 
formula wouldn’t make much sense; return on assets (ROA) or return on
equity (ROE) become better yardsticks.
40
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Graham would typically look for companies selling at prices lower than net
current asset value. A stock selling at less than two-thirds of working capital
was considered a bargain. In today’s world, with more efficient use of capital
and a focus on reducing asset efficiency and exposure, stocks meeting this
criterion are hard to find.
Net net asset value
Net net asset value per share is an even more conservative view of liquidity
and company health. Net net asset value is current assets less not only 
current but also long-term liabilities. For Graham, a company whose current
assets were one-third greater than both current and long-term liabilities 
was in great financial health, and if the share price was less than the net net
asset value per share, it was a bargain.
Net net asset value per share: 
(Current assets – Current liabilities – Long-term debt) ÷ Shares 
outstanding
By the book: Book value
Book value was another Graham focal point. Book value represents the
accounting value of owners’ equity in the business. Book value is a fairly 
subjective look at company valuation, one that today brings considerable
debate. Per-share book value is defined as
(Total assets – Intangible assets – Liabilities – Preferred Stock value) ÷
Common Shares outstanding
From an accounting viewpoint, book value can be pretty theoretical. Why?
Because of the way companies manage and depreciate fixed assets and 
how they account for intangibles (goodwill, patents, value of research and
development, and the like). For manufacturing and technology companies
especially, book value can be misleading. For banks and other financial 
institutions where most assets and liabilities are in cash or cash equivalents,
book value is more relevant. 
Book value is, at least in theory, what a person buying a business would want
to look at first. It is the bottom-line net value of the company. But because of
the accounting complexities, Graham and others did not compare it directly
to share price. A number of value investors, including Buffett, like to observe
whether book value is growing and is at least within reasonable range of the
share price. In fact, Buffett uses book value as a key yardstick to measure
Berkshire Hathaway’s success.
41
Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

Up and to the right: Earnings and growth
Graham started with the balance sheet, but certainly didn’t stop there.
Earnings, more specifically earnings growth, is the engine that moves a 
stock price upward. Indeed, unless a payout of company assets is imminent,
the combination of earnings and earnings growth is what truly defines the
intrinsic value of a business, and thus its stock price. The upper limits of a
company’s intrinsic value are determined by earnings and earnings growth;
the lower end of the value range is determined by the asset base. 
A first trip to the P/E counter
We’ve come to the most basic and well known of all the stock-valuation tools:
Price to Earning ratio, or P/E ratio. Almost every investment analysis covers
P/E. Graham probably didn’t invent P/E, but it was a key part of his investing
philosophy. Naturally, he recommended looking for stocks with a low P/E 
relative to the market. Although he didn’t specifically mention a more con-
temporary measure, the Price/Earnings to Growth, or PEG ratio, which
attempts to scale the P/E according to underlying growth, he did recognize
that different stocks should have different P/Es. Growth stocks could have a
P/E in the 20s, while others should be lower. Moreover, Graham recognized
that good bargains have current P/Es lower than historic P/Es. Graham’s
advice to investors generally was to avoid stocks with a P/E higher than 20.
42
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 
PEG
You may be familiar with the popular valuation
metric known as PEG, or Price Earnings/Growth.
PEG is the price to earnings ratio divided by the
earnings growth rate. The lower the PEG, the
better.
PEG’s message: High P/E ratios are justified by
high growth rates. If the P/E outstrips the growth
rate, the resulting PEG is high and the stock may
be overvalued relative to its underlying growth.
There’s a reason it’s brought up here. A closer
look at Ben Graham’s intrinsic value formula
reveals a relatively high implied PEG, consis-
tently over 2.0 (driven by the multiplier of “2” in
the equation just discussed). Then when added
to the base no-growth 8.5 P/E multiplier, the
resulting calculated PEG consistently exceeds
2.0 at all growth rates — at least until interest
rates are factored in (an important “until”). Still,
given many investors’ reluctance to buy stocks
today with PEG exceeding 2.0, Graham’s formula
is less conservative than you may expect. 

Intrinsic value . . . and beyond
Although Graham didn’t invent P/E, he did create a very useful and easy-to-
use intrinsic value formula.
Graham was trying to establish a stock’s value based on earnings and earn-
ings growth, while keeping an eye on bond yields available as an alternative.
Comparison to low-risk or risk-free bond investments, by the way, is a
common and recurring theme in value investing. 
Bond yields are an important valuation and pricing factor for value investors.
Higher bond yields suggest a stock must return relatively more to be a choice
investment. Furthermore, high bond yields suggest high cost of capital 
and inflation, which in turn depreciate future earnings and cash flows, thus
driving down valuation. 
Bonds may be boring, but you as an investor must make sure that a stock’s
return is reasonably higher than that of an ordinary bond. You must also be
sure the return is reasonable given the risk taken. If not, just buy the bond,
sleep at night, and be done with it!
Back to Graham’s formula: You take current earnings, apply a base P/E ratio,
add a growth factor if there is growth, and adjust according to current bond
yield. The result is an intrinsic value that the stock can be expected to
achieve in the real world if growth targets are met.
Formula: Intrinsic value = E × (2g + 8.5) × 4.4/Y
E is the current annual earnings per share.
g is the annual earnings growth rate — 5 percent would be figured as a
“5.” (Graham would have suggested using a conservative number for
growth.)
8.5 is the base P/E ratio for a stock with no growth.
Y is the current interest rate, represented as the average rate on high-
grade corporate bonds. Note that lower bond rates make the intrinsic
value higher, as future earnings streams are worth more in a lower 
interest rate environment.
Take Hewlett-Packard as an example. With current earnings (trailing 12
months) of $2.30 per share, a growth rate of 10 percent, and a corporate bond
interest rate of 6 percent, the intrinsic value is
$2.30 × [(2 × 10)+8.5)] × (4.4/6)
or $48.07 per share
43
Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

This value almost exactly matches the price at the time that these calcula-
tions were made. That suggests little potential price appreciation in the 
stock — unless per share earnings growth accelerates or bond yields dip. 
Acceleration in the business would increase the earnings growth rate, and
share repurchases would increase the earnings per share. Both changes,
especially taken together, would stimulate growth in intrinsic value. You
shouldn’t go out and buy or sell stock based on this formula alone, of course,
but it’s a great “quick” test of a stock’s price and true value. 
Check the checklist
In addition to identifying and quantifying important value components,
Graham left us with an assortment of general stock selection rules. He cre-
ated a number of checklists at different times in his career to serve different
investment objectives and portfolio strategies. The checklists review 
different aspects of a company’s financial strength, intrinsic value, and the
relationship with price. Table 3-1 helps identify undervalued stocks.

If a stock meets seven of the ten criteria, it is probably a good value, according
to Graham. If you’re income oriented, Graham recommended paying special
attention to items 1 through 7. If you’re concerned about growth and safety,
items 1 through 5 and 9 and 10 are important. If you’re concerned with aggres-
sive growth, ignore item 3, reduce the emphasis on 4 through 6, and weigh 
9 and 10 heavily.
Again, these checklists are a guideline and example, not a cookbook recipe
you should follow precisely. Don’t log on to restructure your portfolio just
this minute! They are a way of thinking and an example of how you may 
construct your own value investing system.
The criteria in Table 3-1 are probably more focused on dividends and safety
than even today’s value investors choose to be. But today’s value investing
practice owes an immense debt to this type of financial and investment 
analysis.
The Master: Warren Buffett
It seems that about once per century the English-speaking world is blessed
with a gifted leader and philosopher of unique and extraordinary talent.
These special people have an incredible gift for understanding and doing
complex things. But the gift goes further into how they explain their thoughts
and pursuits to others with a remarkably effective use of humor. Benjamin
Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, and Winston Churchill all easily qualify, and 
without doubt Warren Buffett also belongs in this elite group. 
Warren Buffett arrived on the scene on September 30, 1930, and has turned
his steady devotion to value investing principles into some $52 billion in net
worth. He is the second wealthiest person in the world (depending on the
price of Microsoft stock). Buffett is clearly the Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods
of value investing. His on-court record cannot be touched. Much of this book
describes elements of his game. And it would be a disservice not to mention
Buffett’s off-court demeanor, where his candor, clairvoyance, and wit com-
bine with his own enviably humble lifestyle to create a model for investors 
to emulate. 
45
Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

In the beginning
The early stages of Buffett’s career and lifestyle suggested investing success,
although hardly on the scale he actually went on to achieve. Warren grew 
up in an investing environment. His father, Howard, ran an Omaha brokerage
house in the 1930s that was known as Buffett, Sklenicka, & Co. In his late
teens, Warren worked in the house posting stock quotes and doing odd jobs,
providing exposure to the trade. He learned about business through this
experience and through a series of small business ventures in his high 
school days.
Like many other financial prodigies, Warren’s aptitude did not go unnoticed
by his parents, who urged him to attend the revered Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania. This didn’t work out well. Warren soon became
bored and dissatisfied, feeling that he knew as much or more than Penn’s
vaunted faculty. Perhaps he was homesick; perhaps he had a more practical
view of matters than the pages and pages of portfolio theory he was no doubt
exposed to. In any case, he retreated to more familiar territory at age 19 to
finish his degree at the University of Nebraska.
Benjamin Graham’s Intelligent Investor hit the shelves, and legend has it that
Warren, with a newly rekindled interest in investing and the business world,
decided to put the finishing touches on his business education by attending
Harvard Business School. Again, a poor match. Warren was rejected, as the
story goes, after a 10-minute interview. Perhaps the admissions department
had already reached its quota of Nebraskans. 
Warren bounced back quickly from this setback and applied to Columbia
Business School. Then and there, Buffett hooked up with Benjamin Graham.
The rest, as they say, is history.
Warren took to Graham’s preachings like a pig to mud. The two bantered in
engaging dialogue from the opening bell to the end of class. Warren gradu-
ated in a year with a Master’s in Economics. More important, he left with a
philosophy of investing based on valuing companies and finding undervalua-
tion in the marketplace.
Buffett returned to work in his father’s brokerage firm and later went to work
for Ben at Graham’s brokerage firm, Graham Newman. There, he learned to
manage investment portfolios and use insurance company assets as an 
effective investing vehicle. 
From these beginnings Buffett started his own investment fund (with con-
tributed capital from neighbors, relatives, coworkers, and the like) and later
built the Taj Mahal of investment companies, Berkshire Hathaway.
46
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Taking charge
Like most investors, Buffett evolved his investing style, trying different things
along the way. Often, Buffett would simply buy shares, hold them, and wait
for growth prospects to materialize. Sometimes his objective was a little
more short term in nature, buying to capture arbitrage — small differences
between price and value that often emerge in merger, acquisition, and liqui-
dation situations. (Capturing arbitrage is value investing, too; it’s very short
term in nature and you had better be good. You’re going up against other 
professionals who have access to a lot of information and are betting for
something different to happen.)
Sometimes Buffett would buy a large stake in an undervalued company, large
enough to be noticed and reported to the SEC, usually 5 percent or more. He
then would get himself installed on the company’s board of directors. Many
of these companies were having financial problems or problems translating
company value into shareholder value. Many welcomed his presence. Buffett
would help right these problems and, if necessary, assist in selling or finding
a merger partner for the company. Of course, most ordinary investors can’t
do this, but the thought process is important.
The start of Berkshire Hathaway
Buffett spied a faltering Massachusetts textile company known as Berkshire
Hathaway. He saw potential value in a very depressed stock and began buying
shares cheaply for his partnership. These shares traded at less than half of
working capital (remember Ben Graham’s net current asset value model). If the
stock price would just grow to reflect the balance sheet value, a 100 percent
gain was in store, at the very least. Buffett continued to accumulate shares
until the partnership owned 49 percent of the company by 1965. He effectively
controlled the company.
Originally, Buffett planned to right some of the wrongs and capture quick
gains by selling or merging the company. But he saw a tempting opportunity
to use Berkshire as an investment conduit to build worth by buying other
businesses. The opportunity owes its origin to favorable tax treatments for
companies owning other companies The ability to defer taxes is very impor-
tant in value investing as a way to keep capital deployed and continuously
earning returns (for specifics, see Chapter 4). 
When Buffett distributed the partnership in 1969, he offered a choice of cash
or Berkshire shares as part of the distribution. For his portion, Buffett took
shares. He offered to buy the shares of other partners for himself. Suppose
you had invested with Buffett. Your modest investment in the partnership
resulted in getting offered 200 shares of Berkshire Hathaway or $8,400 cash

Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

(equivalent to two new cars, or maybe a third of a new house in 1969). What
would you have done? We all know the answer now: At a current share price
of $111,600, your investment would be worth over $22 million! A small group
of wealthy folks made the choice to stick with Buffett. Many of them still
make the annual pilgrimage to Omaha to enjoy those juicy steaks and count
their blessings.
To insurance and beyond
Neither Berkshire nor Buffett made it very far in the textile business. No 
“Buff It with Buffett” line of designer towels ever made it to the shelves at
Nordstrom’s (although they’d be worth a lot today, too, if they had!). Instead,
Berkshire is now the world’s largest investing pool. The Berkshire formula 
is as follows: 
 Employ cash flows from businesses owned within the holding company.
 Buy stocks and bonds in the open market.
 Use the cash flow to buy businesses outright — preferably cash rich 
and cash generating — to build the investment pool and increase 
book value.
 Acquire solid insurance companies to provide cash flow and further
build investing float and to insulate from downturns.
In short, Berkshire as a combined insurer and investment holding company is
a fabulous investment ship and capital allocator — especially when you have
someone of Buffett’s investing prowess at the helm.
From socks to stocks
Gradually, Buffett shifted his emphasis from small, opportunistic, turn-
around situations, often of a short-term nature, to longer-term, large cap
investments — he even acquired whole companies when the numbers were
right. He did this with a clear eye on tapping the growth potential of the
major companies and major brands that are abundant in American life. No
more buying “cigar butts with one puff left in them,” such as trading stamp
companies, as he often did in the mid-1950s. Berkshire Hathaway was off to
the races with a winning portfolio of value investments, a world-class pit
crew, and high-octane fuel provided by the insurance business.
Things go better with Coke
Berkshire put together a world-class portfolio of high visibility, blue chip
growth stocks, including such household names as Coca-Cola, Gillette,
American Express, and Wells Fargo. Buffett could not resist the low price of
48
Part I: The What and Why of Value Investing 

Coca-Cola in the mid-1980s as the company seemed to struggle for reinven-
tion with new Coke and other twists and turns in corporate strategy (most of
which turned out to be unnecessary). Coca-Cola had the balance sheet and
certainly the stability of earnings that one would expect of the world’s lead-
ing purveyor of sugar water. Buffett saw not only the intrinsic value but also
the franchise or marketplace value. Coke is arguably the world’s most recog-
nized brand, and that brand was and still is the closest thing to a guarantee
against dips and significant competitive inroads. It’s what Buffett calls a moat
around the business.
Intrinsic value on the balance sheet, solid earnings with at least some growth
and growth potential, and solid value in the franchise are what Buffett looked
for in all his investments. And always — repeat, always — at a good price.
Berkshire Hathaway acquired 200 million shares of Coke in the mid-1980s at
around $6 to $6.50 per share (split adjusted). Coke generally sells at over $50
today. The Berkshire before-tax profit is in the $10 billion range.
Wanna know what Berkshire buys? It isn’t easy to find out. Berkshire keeps
its purchases a secret (to avoid market overreaction, among other reasons).
But as much as it tries to avoid disclosure, investments of certain size and
that constitute a certain proportion of ownership must be disclosed. SEC 13F
filings contain the disclosures as statements of change of ownership. You can
watch these directly or just watch the news. Any time a 13F surfaces, the
financial news media is quick to pounce. 
The most recent 13F filing, released in mid-May 2007 for the close of business
on March 31, uncovered four new purchases, three of them in railroad com-
panies (Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, Burlington Northern Santa Fe) and a
new position in health provider, Wellpoint. Buffett increased positions in
Comcast, Iron Mountain, Wells Fargo, Johnson & Johnson, and Sanofi-
Adventis, while reducing holdings in financials Ameriprise and H&R Block,
brewer Anheuser-Busch and Western Union. 
We know now, but hardly soon enough to have made a market killing from the
knowledge. That said, knowing where Buffett has been and where he is going
never hurts. By the way, you can find these 13Fs yourself simply by doing a
search on Berkshire Hathaway 13F and the year you’re interested in. 
Shares? Why not the whole company?
Acquiring shares certainly works over time and is what we ordinary value
investors should be focused on. But Berkshire went beyond this strategy —
way beyond — to buy whole companies for its portfolio. Why? Two reasons,
mainly. If you own the whole company, you’re entitled to its cash and cash
flow and can reinvest it as you wish. You don’t have to compete with other
shareholders, and management and reporting relationships are simpler.

Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

So Berkshire Hathaway has made many “whole enchilada” investments. 
The Insurance group has grown substantially and is anchored by consumer
favorite GEICO, originally bought by Ben Graham in the 1950s), and by
General Re, in the lucrative reinsurance (wholesale insurance) market. The
companies play in different insurance segments, and combine to produce $81
billion in revenue in 2006, with almost $13 billion in pretax income and an
amazing $50 billion in “float” — cash taken in but not paid out on claims and
used for investments. 
Beyond insurance, the manufacturing, retail, and service group now consists
of some 70 companies, large and small, all successful in their own arena. 
An obvious favorite is Borsheim’s, a chain of high-end jewelry stores. Dairy
Queen, RC Willey Pampered Chef, and See’s Candies are strong consumer
names. Applied Underwriters (worker’s comp) NetJets (company jet leasing),
FlightSafety International and MiTek, are for the business-to-business world.
Some companies are large and others are small, including the Nebraska
Furniture Mart, which Buffett bought one morning as a $60 million birthday
present to himself. See Table 3-2.

What do all Berkshire Hathaway companies have in common?
 They are profitable, safe, and solid.
 They are easy to understand with simple business models.
 They produce plenty of cash flow to reinvest.
 They are unique businesses with strong market positions and franchises.
 They have solid, trustworthy management.
 They were bought at reasonable prices.
We ordinary value investors can’t assemble this kind of portfolio, but we can
learn from what makes Berkshire Hathaway and its master tick. That’s ground
we cover in the rest of this book.

Smaller Slices
Buffett doesn’t always buy the whole company, for either it is too big, or he
simply wants to take a position without a complete commitment. Needless to
say, the list of 42 holdings in publicly traded companies as of March 2007 is
instructive, see Table 3-3.

Acquisition criteria: Telling it like it is
If you don’t believe what we just said about
Berkshire companies, take a look at the follow-
ing set of “acquisition criteria,” straight from 
the 2006 Berkshire Hathaway Annual report.
Straight, clear, to the point — and never before
have we seen anything like this — including the
commentary — in a shareholder report. 
ACQUISITION CRITERIA
We are eager to hear from principals or their 
representatives about businesses that meet all of
the following criteria:
(1) Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax
earnings unless the business will fit into one of
our existing units),
(2) Demonstrated consistent earning power
(future projections are of no interest to us, nor are
“turnaround” situations),
(3) Businesses earning good returns on equity
while employing little or no debt,
(4) Management in place (we can’t supply it),
(5) Simple businesses (if there’s lots of technol-
ogy, we won’t understand it),
(6) An offering price (we don’t want to waste 
our time or that of the seller by talking, even pre-
liminarily, about a transaction when price is
unknown).
The larger the company, the greater will be our
interest: We would like to make an acquisition 
in the $5–20 billion range. We are not inter-
ested, however, in receiving suggestions about
purchases we may make in the general stock
market.
We will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We
can promise complete confidentiality and a very
fast answer — customarily within five minutes —
as to whether we’re interested. We prefer to 
buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when
we receive as much in intrinsic business value as
we give. We don’t participate in auctions.

For more on Buffett
Entire books can be — and have been — written on Buffett, his personality,
humor, lifestyle, experiences, and teachings. We cannot begin to approach
the rich material available in other books devoted to him as a topic. Another
interesting, though plain and simple to the extreme, place to get information
from and about Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway is the corporate Web site,
easily accessed at www.berkshirehathaway.com. Buffett’s letters to share-
holders are particularly worthwhile and exemplify his deep understanding
and sense of humor.
The Disciples
Along the way, the Buffett-Graham school has acquired a good-sized follow-
ing, although how few people have really made a name for themselves 
investing in the Buffett style still surprises us. Perhaps they are as low key 
as he is; perhaps there just isn’t that much other than sustained long term
performance to grab headlines. 
Good investors know how to play “follow the leader” — if not to invest liter-
ally as they do, at least emulate their style, and better yet, get good investing
ideas. We all watch Tiger Woods play golf, not with any real hope of shooting
63 in a major, but with the hope of picking up some elements of his 
playing style.

Chapter 3: The Value Investing Story

Here are a few well-known value investors to watch:
 Bill Nygren: Nygren is Portfolio Manager of The Oakmark Fund and The
Oakmark Select Fund, two widely held and admired mutual funds. Since
its 1991 start, the Oakmark fund has returned over 16 percent a year,
and the Select fund has returned over 20 percent since its 1996 start.
Nygren is a classic value picker, choosing stocks based on a discount
from underlying business value based on cash flows, management own-
ership, and how cash is reinvested in the business. Successful invest-
ment picks include Coca-Cola, Discovery Holdings, and Schering-Plough.
 Bill Miller: Miller manages the Legg Mason Value Trust, and became
famous for beating the S&P 500 Index for 15 consecutive years until 
failing badly in 2006 — his fund underperformed by some 10 percent.
Miller buys mostly large cap stocks at discounts to his measured intrin-
sic value, and is well known for picking fairly aggressive growth stories
like Amazon, eBay, and Home Depot, all three of which did not serve 
him well in 2006. 
 David Dreman: Dreman is founder, chairman, and chief investment 
officer of fund family Dreman Value Management, LLC, and is a regular
Forbes columnist. Dreman’s classic approach considers P/E ratios,
above market dividend yields, and strong historic earnings growth.
Many picks are smaller companies like Stride Rite, Amedisys, Inc, and
SPX Corporation. 
 George Soros: Known more for his successes as a speculator but also
his philanthropy and political leanings, few know that Soros has also
done quite well as a long-term, value-oriented investor. His Quantum
Fund, started in 1969, has one of the best performance records during
that span, with gains of some 1,500 percent from 1969 through 1994.
Today he manages Soros Fund Management, a firm that provides advice
to public mutual funds and hedge funds. You can follow his picks, which
include Conoco Phillips and CarMax, as well as smaller companies like
Bioenvision, Inc. 
To find out what stocks your favorite value guru is holding, buying, or selling,
you can visit Web sites that track this sort of thing — but they come and go.
The best bet is to Google “George Soros Stock Holdings” or something similar.
Better yet, keep up with the changes by reviewing SEC 13F filings — do that
search on “George Soros 13F filings” instead.

t’s hard to imagine the words “short” and “painless” being used in the
same sentence as “math,” but, this chapter attempts to prove that math —
at least the math you need for investing — can indeed be both short and 
relatively painless. We explore a handful of fundamental math concepts in
value investing, keeping it simple and practical and focusing on how the 
concepts are applied.
You won’t find any statistics, stochastics, or oscillators — just some harm-
less algebra and arithmetic and basic principles that value investors employ
daily. No fancy Ivy League portfolio-theory higher-math stuff that you may
have heard about, or seen, or even studied in school, because that doesn’t
really apply to value investing. And you won’t come across formulas with
little Greek symbols, either. As Warren Buffett once said, “If calculus were
required, I’d have to go back to delivering papers.” 
The tools and underlying principles covered in this chapter are thoroughly
understood and employed by value investing masters. They will become part
of your investing vocabulary, just as knowing the taste and strength of garlic
is part of your cooking vocabulary. Knowing the chemical makeup and con-
centration of the allyl propyl disulfide in garlic is hardly important for cook-
ing. Similarly, the math technicalities themselves aren’t so important either,
leaving us to ponder whether we should have used the word “math” in this
chapter in the first place. 

Lesson 1: Time Value of Money
First, we explore a cornerstone principle in all of business and finance: 
A dollar today isn’t worth the same amount as a dollar yesterday, nor is it
worth the same amount as a dollar tomorrow. The bottom line is, invested
money appreciates with time — how and how much is examined here. 
Note there will be exponents in this discussion, but keep the faith — the 
calculations are easy, and today’s calculators and spreadsheets easily 
perform them.
If you are already familiar with time value of money basics, you can probably
skip Lessons 1 through 3 in this chapter.
Money and time: An interesting story
Suppose that you have a $10 bill in your pocket. What’s it worth today? Ten
bucks. You’re right, but keep reading.
Now suppose that the $10 is in a bank account or some other investment
vehicle that pays a return. This return can be a fixed payment in return for
the financial institution’s use of the money, known as interest. Or it can be 
a return in some other form, say, a profit generated through the use of the
$10 in a business, increasing the value of the business.
Either way, if you leave these dividends alone and don’t withdraw them, 
they become part of the investment. At a 10 percent rate of return, the $10
becomes $11 in the first year, and $11 is invested in the interest or profit-
generating asset for the second year. With $11 invested, assuming that the
interest or profitability stays the same, you reap the greater rewards due an
$11 investment. In this case, the reward is now $1.10, not $1. The investment
is now worth $12.10 ($10 + $1 + $1.10). Now $12.10 is invested, and the return
is $1.21. And so forth. Both the investment and the incremental dollar return
grow over time. Each year’s golden eggs become part of the next year’s
goose, which then lays still more golden eggs.
Present and future value
So what is the investment worth? It depends. The investment is worth $10
today, as we said earlier. That ten bucks is known as the present value. Pretty
simple so far, right? Now what about the future? If the investment grows over
time, the total value will include the initial $10 plus all returns generated
during that time. This is known as future value.
Invested money grows and compounds. In other words, there is growth on
the original investment, plus return and growth on returns already earned. A
snowball rolling downhill is a good analogy. As the ball gets bigger, it picks up
60
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

ever-larger amounts of snow. How much? Compounding formulas, which are
driven by rate of return and the amount of time, supply the answer. 
Investment returns in the future: When it isn’t yours yet
Suppose that someone promises to pay you $10 five years from now. Are 
you $10 wealthier? In five years you are, but what about now? Well, the truth
is, if you look in the mirror today, you can’t say that you’re worth $10 more.
The reality: To have $10 in the future, you only need to put some fraction of
that $10 in the bank today. The exact fraction depends on the same factors
that drive future value: rate of return and time. At 10 percent, you would need
to deposit only $6.21 today to have $10 five years from now. Same formula,
but this time, the approach is from the opposite direction. Instead of asking,
“What is my $10 worth in five years?” you ask, “What would I need today to
have $10 in five years?” 
The magic compounding formula
The fundamental time-value-of-money, or compounding, formula provides 
an indispensable foundation for value investors. A word of advice: It’s just 
as important to understand the formula, the dynamics, and the factors that
drive or have the most influence on the result as it is to memorize the for-
mula to do lots of math problems. Furthermore, just as it takes more than
garlic to cook, you need a lot more than this formula to select stocks and be
successful. Here’s the formula:
FV = PV × (1 + i)n
where . . .
FV is future value
PV is present value
i is the interest rate, or rate of return
n is the number of years invested
Now, to take apart the formula: The future value is a function of the present
value, expanded or compounded by the interest rate over time. To calculate a
return for one year, simply take PV and multiply by 1 (to preserve the original
value) plus i (to increment by the interest rate or rate of return). The result is
future value.
To calculate the return for more than one year, it gets more interesting.
Multiply PV by (1 + i) factored by the number of years, so 5 years is (PV) ×
(1 + i) × (1 + i) × (1 + i) × (1 + i) × (1 + i). Each (1 + i) indicates another year 
of compounding interest. The exponent is mathematical shorthand for 
such sequential multiplications The FV of $10 invested at 10 percent over 
5 years is 
61
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

FV = $10 × (1 + .10)5
or
$10 × (1.61), or $16.10 
Fine, we can calculate future value. But what about present value? What if
you want to figure out what interest rate would give you $16.10 on a $10
investment if held for 5 years? In other words, what if you want to work back-
ward? You can transpose the formula algebraically to calculate PV, i, and 
even n:
1) PV = FV ÷ (1 + i)n
2) i = ((FV ÷ PV )(1/n))-1 or the nth root of (FV/PV)
3) n is trickier — it involves logarithms!
Why Lesson 1 is important
Time value of money helps you estimate or determine the future value of an
investment held over time. The importance of time value of money calcula-
tions doesn’t stop there. Some value investing techniques call for discounting,
or calculating the present value of future income streams. Time value calcula-
tions are an important ingredient in measuring the value of investments and
comparing them to alternatives. And you see later in this chapter and in
those that follow how compounding becomes a main engine powering the
value investing concept.

12C your way clearly
If the formulas in Lesson 1 appear cumbersome,
there is help in the form of a $70 device from
Hewlett-Packard — the oldest product in its cat-
alog — the HP 12C Financial Calculator. Other
financial calculators work fine, too. These 
calculators have a built-in set of easy-to-use
financial formulas. They also do the more com-
plex things, such as calculate FV if you contribute
$10 more every year. Or you can use it to figure
out your next car payment. It’s one of the best
values available to a value investor. 

Lesson 2: The Amazing Power 
of Compounding
Compounding is perhaps the greatest and most powerful investment princi-
ple ever “discovered.” In fact, Albert Einstein called compounding “the 
greatest mathematical discovery of all time.”

Some pictures are worth a thousand words, and Table 4-1 is such a picture. 
It shows what happens to $1,000 invested for a period of time, defined on the
horizontal axis, at a rate of return, defined on the vertical axis. The formula
to calculate these values is — you guessed it — the time value of money 
formula presented in Lesson 1 of this chapter.
And you’re right. That is $7 million and change in the lower-right corner, 
on a $1,000 investment. If you really do well and capture consistent 25 per-
cent returns on your investments, that’s what you’d have in 40 years. If you
invested $20,000, you would have $140 million, assuming no taxes. Easy,
right? All you need to know is how to achieve consistent 25 percent annual
returns!
Before you dismiss 25 percent annual returns as out of the question, know
that until 1999 Berkshire Hathaway achieved over 30 percent annual com-
pounded return for over 30 years. Things flattened a bit in 1999 and 2000, 
but have resumed since, and long-term returns once again handily exceed 25
percent. Don’t assume that high rates of return are impossible. Later in this
chapter we examine the dramatic power of beating the market.
The power of “i” and “n”
The point isn’t necessarily to turn $1,000 into $7 million. The point is to 
show that the farther you go down and to the right on Table 4-1, the larger
the future value gets. In fact, it increases at a faster rate the farther down and
to the right you go. 
The nature of the (1 + i)n expression in our formula produces this fascinating
result. If i is small, no matter how large the n, the end result doesn’t grow
much. (Recall from seventh grade math that 1 raised to any power is still 1.)
Likewise, if n is small, it doesn’t so much matter what the i is. 
64
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Why Lesson 2 is important
The power of compounding assumes its full glory (and your investments
reach their full girth) as the i, or the rate of return, gets larger, and the n, or
the length of time, gets longer. The and is important! Value investors look for
a few more i points of return and to hold the productive investment for as
many n years as possible.
Because n is an exponent, it exerts the greatest power and influence on your
investing portfolio. Time is an investor’s best friend. As Warren Buffett says,
“Time is the friend of the good business, and the enemy of the poor one.” No
wonder value investors tend to be long-term investors! The upshot? Find the
best possible i and then let n happen.
Lesson 3: The Amazing Rule of 72
No investor in the history of the world understands, or has applied, the 
principle of compounding to a greater degree and with more success than
Buffett. Yet he reportedly does most investing math without a calculator.
Does he possess a 2-gigahertz mind that’s able to grind out multiple power
and exponential calculations faster than you can say Coca-Cola? Hardly. 
Not to say that being the gifted individual that he is, he couldn’t perform so
many rapid-fire calculations in his head. But he doesn’t. Instead, he uses one
of the most useful general rules in investing, maybe in all mathematics, as a
computational shortcut. It’s known as the Rule of 72.

Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math
How to make 40 quintillion dollars (in 500 years)
One can go to extremes when applying the prin-
ciples of compounding. If the Spanish royalty had
invested the estimated $30,000 stake it placed in
Christopher Columbus at 7 percent, that $30,000
would be worth over $40 quintillion (40, followed
by 18 zeros) today. Spain would be the major
world power (which is, of course, what they
were trying to achieve in 1492!) The trouble is
that the Columbus expedition produced immedi-
ate results on the world stage, while the com-
pounding approach would have required 500
years. So Ferdinand and Isabella probably made
a good decision. Success depends on your time
horizon — and what you do with your winnings.

How the Rule of 72 works
The Rule of 72 is based on compounding formula mathematics. With the 
Rule of 72, you can quickly estimate the rate of return or time period needed
to double a sum of money with compounding. If you know the rate of return,
you can compute the time period and if you know the time period, you can
compute the approximate rate of return. Here it is:
Number of years to double an investment at a given return rate:
= 72 divided by the rate of return (as an integer: the rate × 100) 
Return rate required to double an investment over a given number 
of years:
= 72 divided by the number of years
Here are some examples to make the concept clearer: 
 At 12 percent, it takes six years to double your money (72/12).
 To double your money in eight years, you must earn a 9 percent rate 
of return (72/8).
 At 10 percent, how many years does it take to quadruple your money?
Answer: It doubles in 7.2 years (72/10), so quadrupling would take twice
that long, or 14.4 years.
 If your best friend brags about having bought a house for $150,000 
that’s now worth $600,000 and he’s had it for 10 years, what is the rate of
return? Answer: It doubled twice ($150K to $300K to $600K) in 10 years,
or once every 5 years. So (72/5) gives a 14.4 percent compounded rate of
return. Not bad at all, but as a sharp investor you could well have beaten
your friend in the stock market! Not to mention impressing him or her
by doing this calculation in your head!
Return rates done right
Just what is the rate of return on an investment? It depends on how it’s 
calculated. Take a look at the example just presented for the Rule of 72. Your
friend brags about buying a house for $150,000 and selling it 10 years later 
for $600,000. He may call that a 300 percent return and, because it occurred
over 10 years, boasting of an average of 30 percent per year. On the surface,
that’s correct. 
But when evaluating the home purchase as an investment (compared to other
investments), one must include the compounding effect to have an accurate,
apples-to-apples comparison. If that $150,000 were invested 10 years ago in
such a way as to allow returns to compound, what rate of return would have
produced $600,000? As approximated using the Rule of 72, the compounded
66
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

rate of return is only 14.4 percent. Although not bad, 14.4 percent doesn’t
make headlines, particularly compared to long-term stock market returns of
11 percent annually. 
The compounded rate of return is sometimes called the geometric rate of
return — in contrast to the straight average approach of simply dividing the
total return by the number of years (as in 300 percent divided by 10 equals 30
percent annually). So, how do you calculate true compounded, or geometric,
rates of return? There is a formula:
Compounded rate of return = [(Ending value/Beginning value)(1/n)]–1
where n equals the number of years.
In the example, $600,000/$150,000 is 4. Take 4 to the 1⁄10th power (use your 
calculator) and get 1.149. Subtract 1, and get 14.9 percent, which is not
exactly equal to the Rule of 72 result, but remember that the Rule of 72 is an
approximation. You’ll have fun at cocktail parties telling people what they
really made on their investments.
Why Lesson 3 is important
The Rule of 72 gives tremendous power to make fast calculations and deci-
sions. It helps you to quickly compare investing alternatives and to speed up
investing decisions. Not only that, it can help you figure out how long it will
take to become a millionaire, and it’s pretty good for impressing your friends. 
Lesson 4: The Frugal Investor, or 
How Being Cheap Really Pays
What investor hasn’t heard the advice “buy low and sell high”? The principle
behind this cliché is so obvious that one can hardly write about it. But in the
irrationally exuberant markets of 1999 and 2000, this old standard gradually
gave way to “buy high, sell higher.” Traders (and novice investors experienc-
ing the markets for the first time) bought stocks because they were going up,
defying value investing logic. 
What’s the problem? Well, simply, the higher a price you pay for a stock, the
less likely it is to achieve a high rate of return. Suppose that a stock has an
intrinsic value of $75. If you pay $100 for it, you’re essentially betting that
something good will happen to dramatically increase intrinsic value — or
that some greater fool is out there to pay $110. True, it may happen, and it
seemed to happen with regularity during the bubble years. You may get a 10
percent or 20 percent return on the investment.
67
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

But suppose that you were to buy the same stock at $50 as a value play, mean-
ing that you think it’s undervalued. The chance for a 50 percent return —
reverting to intrinsic value — is much higher than with the at-value or 
overvalued $100 stock. 
Keep your “i” on the ball
Value investors always look for that opportunity to achieve superior i (think
back to the formula in Lesson 1). You achieve superior i by buying a stock
with good fundamentals, including growth. So you get the growth rate — 
perhaps 6 percent, maybe 8 percent, or even 10 percent. But as a bonus, you
also get the return to intrinsic value, which can turn 6 percent, 8 percent, and
10 percent returns effectively into 12 percent, 14 percent, 16 percent, and
higher returns. The lower the price paid, the higher the likelihood of above-
average returns. This idea comes straight from the teachings of Ben Graham
and the practice of Warren Buffett.
Buffett always tries to find a pricing situation leading to an extra 2 percent or
3 percent or more for his investing return, or i. Remember Table 4-1? This is 
a very good thing. 
How much does buying cheap help?
Take a look at Table 4-2. Note how long-term profits jump as the rate of 
return grows beyond the market average and time has an opportunity to
work its magic. An investor consistently beating the market by 2 percent
would achieve 20 percent greater return in 10 years ($3,106/$2,594), 43 per-
cent in 20 years, and 72 percent in 30 years. An investor beating the market

Investment gravity
Central tendency, statistical mechanics, rever-
sion to the mean, or whatever scientific name
you want to apply — random numbers tend to
move toward means, just as spinning space
objects form perfect spheres and choppy water
eventually becomes smooth. (Don’t worry — this
isn’t going to turn into a physics lesson now.) This
investment “gravity” (not really a function of
math and physics but of aggregate investor
behavior) causes short-term high and low prices
to move back toward long-term averages.
Similarly, and more important for value investors,
asset prices over the long run rise or fall to meet
corresponding asset values. Several studies
have confirmed this. It doesn’t always happen,
but taking this investing perspective over the
long run is like betting with the house.

by 6 percent would get 70 percent more in 10 years, 189 percent in 20 years,
and 392 percent, or almost 5 times as much profitable return, in 30 years.

Ben Graham bought stocks cheap mainly to provide a margin of safety 
and to cash in on a return to intrinsic value. Warren Buffett and other more
growth-oriented investors may buy cheap to capitalize on growth, with a
return to intrinsic value as an added kicker to beat market returns. 
Why Lesson 4 is important
The mathematical power of compounding makes a small increase in investing
return, or i, very compelling. To increase the chances of achieving a higher i,
buy cheap. Buy expensive, and you’ll be lucky to match market returns. 
Lesson 5: Opportunity Lost
By the time you finish this lesson, you may regard it as an extension of the
last one. In Lesson 4, we describe how beating the market with even slightly
higher rates of return is a shorter path to wealth. This is especially true if the
investments are left on the table to perform, and perform consistently, over
69
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

time. This lesson, as the title indicates, is about lost opportunity. What about
investments achieving less than market average return? What happens when
you cling to these investments? Are they like a bad marriage, not only pro-
ducing inferior returns but also consuming valuable time that you could put
to work elsewhere? From an investment perspective, you bet.
Pruning the dead branches
Table 4-3 illustrates that it isn’t hard to show what happens when you hang
on to the losers, or even the inferior “winners.”

Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Compared to market returns, an investor underperforming the market by 2
percent (or achieving an 8 percent return) falls 17 percent behind a market
performer after 10 years, 31 percent behind over 20 years, and 42 percent
behind over 30 years. An investor underperforming by 6 percent loses 43 
percent, 67 percent, and 81 percent to the market-performing investor over
10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. That’s quite a price to pay for underperfor-
mance. Now, if your investments are producing negative returns, the results
can be quite ugly indeed.
There’s a lesson in these numbers: Don’t hang on to chronic losers! Not only
do you lose, but you also lose out on opportunities to gain. If it’s broke, fix it!
The $3 million sports car
Perhaps you can see where this discussion is heading. You’re a successful
value investor achieving consistent 12 percent, 15 percent, or greater returns,
and you have the discipline and fortitude to hang on to investments. Now,
even successful value investors can have fun, right? They can splurge on a
new car, a vacation, a really nice outdoor barbecue. But savvy value investors
also know how much this costs in the long run.
Suppose that you’re a modestly successful 12 percent value investor. You
spend $1,000 on that new barbecue today. From Table 4-1, you can see that
you could have had $3,106 in 10 years, $9,646 in 20 years, $29,960 in 30 years,
and $93,051 in 40 years instead. Spend $30,000 on a new car today, and forgo
$289,380 20 years from now, $898,800 in 30 years, and $2.8 million in 40 years,
at 12 percent! And, if you’re a better investor (an investor normally capable
of 12 percent returns or better), the “losses” grow faster! So, the better an
investor you are, the more the “good things” in life may cost. Ironic, right? 
Why Lesson 5 is important
A value investor’s mind operates in a continuous buzz, deciding whether an
investment is achieving its best possible returns or whether it should be
replaced. Value investors like cheap stocks, but if the stocks get cheap on an
investor’s watch, the investor should consider a serious reappraisal of a com-
pany’s prospects. Value investors continuously check for dead branches and
aren’t afraid to get out the pruning shears. Value investors know the cost of
dead wood. Likewise, like frugal citizens, value investors avoid squandering
money that could be put to better use and always think of the best use for
their capital. For Warren Buffett, a penny found on a sidewalk is “the start of
the next billion.”
71
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

Lesson 6: Discounting
Lesson 1 discusses the notion that money acquired tomorrow isn’t worth as
much as money acquired today. This idea is very important for value
investors deciding whether to buy a stock today. 
The investing decision is almost always based on some future expectation of
growth in earnings and cash flow that a company will generate. In fact, a pure
value investor defines a stock price as the sum of all future cash flows gener-
ated per share. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, as a practical matter, a stock
value is less than the nominal value of all future cash flows because of the
time value of money. You must discount the earnings or cash flow to achieve
an equivalent present value. 
How to discount earnings
If an investment returns a dollar today, a dollar next year, a dollar two years
from now, and so forth, each dollar should be discounted for time at a rea-
sonable discount rate. The formula reverses the benchmark formula in Lesson
1, FV = PV × (1 + i)n. Instead, each year’s cash flow is divided by (1 + i) n where
n is the number of years until the cash flow is received. The resulting figures
are summed into a single figure representing the cumulative present value, 
or PV.
If the cash flows are even, or unchanged each year, then you can use Table
4-4 to estimate the present value at a given discount rate and for a number of
years. Thus, $1 returned on an investment for the next 15 years has a present
value of $7.60 at a 10 percent discount rate (not $15, as would be the case if
not discounted).

Discounting uneven cash flows 
Applying the formula gets trickier when the cash flows aren’t evenly distrib-
uted for all future years. It’s common for cash flow growth to diminish over
time as a business gets larger. 
To figure out PV, you must estimate each year’s cash flow and discount it
according to the year the cash is received and the chosen discount rate.
Again, you add up all the value to arrive at a single PV. 
The example in Table 4-5 shows the PV of a series of per-share cash flows
over 10 years, starting with $1 in the first year and increasing by 20 percent
for the next 4 years; then by 10 percent for the next 5 years. 
Now, how do you know what discount rate to choose? That’s next.
Use spreadsheets, such as those available in Microsoft Excel, to make compli-
cated PV calculations much easier. Excel comes preloaded with several pre-
loaded time-value-of-money functions, or you can create your own using the
PV = FV ÷ (1 + i)n formula as a basis.

The great discount rate debate
So what discount rate should be used? This is undeniably a favorite debate
topic in financial circles. It may be that more business school professors have
gained tenure writing articles on this subject than on any other. Regardless,
the discount rate chosen is an important factor. Here’s what it comes down
to. The discount rate should reflect the following:
 What it costs to acquire money to invest (which is in turn driven by 
prevailing interest rates)
 What the possible returns are from alternative investments (opportunity
cost, also driven by interest rates)
 Some compensation for business risk, inflation risk, and financial risk
Unfortunately, calculating these values just isn’t that simple. That’s why the
whole issue is so much fun to debate. What is clear is that the more conserv-
ative approach is to set a higher discount rate, which places a smaller value
on future cash flows. 
Once again, the Buffett approach makes sense. Rather than burn energy striv-
ing for a precise discount rate (“it’s better to be approximately right than pre-
cisely wrong,” he quips), Buffett suggests using a minimum of 10 percent, and
15 percent if you want to stay conservative. Fifteen percent should cover the
range of possibilities — higher inflation, tax law changes, business cycles,

Residual value
The term “residual value” sounds pretty techni-
cal, and indeed it is. Some value investors assess
company value as the sum of all future cash
flows, discounted back to the present. In fact,
many finance experts consider this the true
value of a security. The tricky part is figuring
what all means. Theoretically, all refers to infin-
ity, if a company is assumed to last forever. Even
if you reduce the relevant all to 50 or 100 years,
you end up with a challenging discounting prob-
lem, especially if cash flows and growth rates
vary over that time period (and they will). Imagine
a spreadsheet constructed to discount irregular
cash flows expanded to cover 50 or 100 years! 
Many numbers-oriented financiers and value
investors assign a residual value or continuing
value to all cash flows beyond, say, 10 years.
Forecasting growth rates and appropriate dis-
count rates that far out into the future is difficult.
Moreover, because of the nature of the dis-
counting formula, individual years don’t count for
as much. We introduce a computational formula
for residual values in Chapter 12. We also share
another approach known as the acquisition
approach in Chapter 12. In this approach, instead
of estimating and discounting cash flows far out
into the future, we try to predict the value of the
business as an acquisition target at the 10-year
cutoff. This technique helps to avoid the residual
value calculation altogether. 

and so forth. If a stock still looks to be selling at an attractive price even after
discounting its cash flows at 15 percent, it probably has the margin of safety
that value investors seek.
The artificially high discount rate that Buffett and other value investors use is
sometimes called the hurdle rate. As the name implies, it is an aggressive rate
of return that your investment or company must exceed to be viable.
Why Lesson 6 is important
Making a fair and honest evaluation of a company’s value often requires
understanding the value of its future cash flows. To understand the real value
of these cash flows and their relation to today’s price, you must discount the
cash flows back to the present. You see more about how this concept is
applied in later chapters, in particular Chapter 12. 
Lesson 7: Be Wary of Large Numbers
And you thought the whole idea of investing was to produce large numbers.
What gives? In investing, like life, some numbers are too good to be true and
can’t go on forever.
The 30 percent beanstalk
Your high-tech company (or mutual fund, for that matter) brags in each
report of a continuous 30 percent growth in sales and profits. The stock is
priced at a lofty 60 times earnings because it’s the norm for stocks in that
industry to have price-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios of 2 (that is, P/E can
be twice the growth rate, a topic discussed later). So what’s the problem? 
In a word, sustainability. 
Suppose your company has $100 million in sales today. To achieve a 30 per-
cent growth rate, it has to achieve $130 million in sales next year. So far, no
problem. But to maintain this rate, what does the company have to achieve 
in the second year? If you grasp the compounding thing, you know that 30
percent growth in the second year is $130 million plus 30 percent of that
figure. So 30 percent growth would require $169 million in sales. Still not too
bad. But what about in 10 years?
You see the formula coming together. FV = PV × (1 + i)(n-1). (It’s (n-1) because
we’re talking about growth after the first year.) Only this time you don’t calcu-
late the future value of an investment. You calculate the future value of sales
required to sustain a 30 percent growth bragging right. So for our example:
76
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Future sales in 10 years = $100M × (1 + 0.30)9
Or $1.06 billion
In 20 years, that becomes $14.6 billion, with an annual incremental
growth of $1.3 billion at the end of the 20 year period.
Now, if you’re the sales manager for XYZ Corporation, assigned the glorious
task of meeting shareholder expectations for growth, where can to find the
incremental sales? Your company has conquered the world, but Earth is a
small planet. Extraterrestrial markets are still pre-emergent. FedEx and UPS
have yet to deliver to Mars or beyond. So what happens? Growth rates likely
start to decline. Maintaining the growth rate requires greater and greater
chunks of incremental dollars, which becomes increasingly difficult as 
markets become saturated.
Smart value investors recognize the increasing difficulty in maintaining high
growth rates, so they project lower rates in years further out. 
The $20 billion wall
Over the years, there has been a noticeable trend toward diminished 
growth when a company hits the $20 billion, and then again the $40 billion,
sales mark. IBM, HP, GE, Home Depot, and even big oil companies have 
experienced the wall. Companies with $20 billion in sales and 20 percent
growth rates suddenly see growth rates fall off the table and must buy growth
through potentially harmful acquisitions. It seems to happen again at $40 
billion; HP’s 2002 acquisition of Compaq is a good example of this sequence,
although it seems to have worked out. 
Why? Markets become saturated, and large incremental sales in core busi-
nesses become more difficult to find. Additionally, these companies, because
of their sheer size, have more difficulty organizing themselves to execute
dynamic and aggressive sales plans. The meaning for value investors:
Conservative or even zero growth estimates are in order, especially beyond
the 5- to 10-year horizon.
The diversification paradox
All TV and radio programs and magazine and newspaper articles on invest-
ing start with the same inviolate, unassailable principle. It’s presented 
as if gospel: diversify. That principle goes something like this: “The prudent
investor will always look for ways to diversify his or her portfolio by buying
multiple stocks or funds in different industries. That way, risk is minimized,
and there is a greater chance of achieving market rates of return.”
77
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

Okay, not bad. Most investors are satisfied with something at least close to
market rates of return, and most of them want to sleep at night. The part
about “a greater chance of achieving market rates of return” is actually true.
But the sheer mathematical fact is that the more stocks you put into your
portfolio, the less the odds of beating the market. 
Think of the old probability models you studied in high school. If you toss 
a penny into the air, it comes down heads or tails. Fifty-fifty probability. Toss
a few more pennies in the air, say six total, and the odds are you’ll get three
heads and three tails, maybe two and four, maybe one and five, maybe even
all six heads. Probabilities decrease as you go to the extremes, but these 
outcomes are all plausible. Now throw 100,000 pennies into the air. What are
the chances of all 100,000 coming up heads? Desperately small. This is an
extreme case, but the point remains: The more stocks you have, the more
likely your winners and losers will cancel each other out. 
Additionally, suppose you hit a home run and score a 50 percent gain on a
stock. If it’s one of four stocks in your portfolio and all others break even, the
portfolio gains 12.5 percent on average. If it’s one of 10 stocks, with all the
others breaking even, the gain is only 5 percent. Holding too many stocks
dilutes the gains of the winners. Combined with transaction costs and man-
agement fees, this phenomenon helps explain why some two-thirds of stock
mutual funds underperform the markets, as measured by the S&P 500 index.
But what about reducing risk? True, the more pennies you throw, the lower
the odds that they will all come up tails. If the performance of your stocks is
really random, then owning more stocks reduces the chance of beating
market returns. The converse is also true: Owning many stocks reduces the
chance of dramatically underperforming the market. 
Value investors aren’t random stock pickers! They take the risk out by under-
standing the companies and their intrinsic value, rather than by spreading
the risk across more companies. Value investors are focus investors — driving
toward deep understanding of their investments without diluting possible
returns through diversification. They see danger in owning too many invest-
ments. Instead of reducing risk through diversification, risk may actually
increase as it becomes harder to follow the fortunes of so many businesses.
Therefore, Warren Buffett and most other value investors reject diversifica-
tion per se as an investment strategy. They prefer to reduce risk by watching
a few companies — companies that they thoroughly understand — more
closely. 
Why Lesson 7 is important
As a value investor, know that large numbers can work against you. Large
numbers imply diminishing returns. Companies can’t grow at the same rate
forever. Further, successful value investors reduce risk through focus and by
selecting the right companies, not by adding more companies to the portfolio. 
78
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Lesson 8: Inflation, Taxes, 
Interest Rates, and Risk
How do you factor inflation, taxes, and interest — insidious, largely unavoid-
able forces — into the world of value investing? You’ve heard about the 
wonders of compounding and seen all those seven-figure possibilities on the
long-term compounding table. Are you going to let these forces take those
gains away? 
The answer (again): It depends.
You can imagine these forces acting on your value investments much as the
wind acts on a bicyclist. Think of inflation as a persistent head wind, always
blowing against you, the issue being how hard. Taxes always blow in your
face, too. But as we show you in a minute, you can put up shields to protect
yourself from these head winds. 
Interest rates can work as a head or a tail wind. High interest rates are a defi-
nite head wind, as investment capital becomes more expensive (hence higher
discount rates) and safe investments, such as bonds, have relatively more
attractive returns. Low interest rates, on the other hand, act as a welcome
tail wind, stimulating market performance and helping stocks become rela-
tively more attractive as investments. You can’t do anything about interest
rates, but you need to watch them for shifts and signs of shift. Finally, risk can
act like turbulent gusts of wind coming from all directions. You can manage
risk by riding your bicycle slower. Just knowing that risk exists also helps. 
Let’s look at how these factors affect your investments and investment 
calculations.
Inflation
Inflation is a bad word for all investors. In this book, we largely ignore 
it. Although inflation provides a light head wind that reduces the future 
purchasing power of your investments, it has the same effect regardless of
how you have invested your money. Thus, it doesn’t materially influence
investing decisions or practice, and you could go silly adjusting all prices and
future cash flows for inflation. Furthermore, inflation isn’t a cash transaction.
You don’t write checks to the Consumer Price Index gods. And when you 
discount future cash flows, the discount rate nominally covers some of its
effects anyway. Keep in mind, however, that increases in inflation often lead
to increases in interest rates, which can alter your interest in buying stocks. 
79
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

Taxes
You can’t avoid taxes completely, but you can defer them. We’re not talking
about tax-deferred IRAs and 401(k) plans here — those are beside the point. 
For seasoned value investors, here’s a big secret to expanding value and
reducing taxes: Don’t sell stocks; hold them for the long term. Why? Once
again, it’s the power of compounding. If your investment grows each year but
you sell it each year and reinvest it, you’re liable for taxes on your gain. Why
is that so bad? Because that chunk is forever denied the opportunity to 
compound.
Table 4-6 is a rather extreme but illustrative example of the tax and profitabil-
ity differences between holding investment gains and cashing out frequently.

Net Profit
Admittedly, Table 4-6 is extreme, as it assumes an annual doubling of your
investment. It also uses a high, short-term, combined income tax rate of 36
percent — in reality, if you sell “long-term” gains, at least for now, this
number is 15 percent for Federal and varies by state. 
Regardless of the assumptions, taxes do matter. The difference is compound-
ing. Every dollar, every doubled dollar, and so on is left untouched in the no-
sell strategy, while in the sell-and-reinvest strategy, 36 percent of the golden
eggs are sent to Uncle Sam and his statehouse brethren each year. The result:
$671,000 in net profit for the hold strategy versus $19,809 for the sell-and-
reinvest strategy, even though under the hold strategy, you pay more than 30
times as much total tax! Both you and Uncle Sam win! Why? One hundred per-
cent — not 64 percent — of the golden eggs are allowed to hatch into geese.
This result speaks volumes for the value investor’s buy-and-hold approach. 
So why does Congress go so far to provide tax breaks in the form of tax-
deferred retirement savings plans, like IRAs and 401(k)s, anyway? Some pun-
dits say it’s because they know they’ll get a larger tax take later on, when
these massively larger investment pools are withdrawn as taxable income. If
you doubt they’re really that pragmatic, you have a lot of company. 
And of course, you don’t want to buy and hold yourself down the drain! If a
company’s fortunes and prospects change, selling and finding a new invest-
ment, regardless of tax consequences, make sense. If your goose isn’t laying
golden eggs, you need to find another goose! 
81
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

Interest rates
As just stated, interest rates can act as a head or tail wind. Higher interest
rates tend to diminish perceived investment returns, and hence stock prices,
while lower interest rates stimulate economic and profit growth while making
stock investments look relatively attractive. So what do you use as your
investment weather vane to determine interest rate direction and effect?
Like so many investing issues, much has been written on this topic. For illus-
tration, we’ll use the Ben Graham intrinsic value formula from Chapter 3: 
Formula: Intrinsic value = E × (2g + 8.5) × 4.4/Y
where . . .
E = annual earnings
r = average growth rate
y = the interest rate
The second expression, (4.4/y), is what’s important here. The interpretation
is clear: If the interest rate is greater than 4.4, the expression will calculate to
less than 1, dragging down the intrinsic value. Similarly, interest rates less
than 4.4 result in a positive influence and a tail wind for intrinsic value. 
Is 4.4 still the right number? Conceptually, Ben Graham’s approach is good
for value investing calculations. The baseline interest rate, which Graham
derived from studying long-term corporate bond rates, is probably a little low
by today’s standards. Considerable debate exists on what kind of interest
rate to use and whether it is a long-term or a short-term rate. Some investors
watch 10-year Treasury securities, while others watch the Fed Funds and 
discount rates set by Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee. 
From experience, anything greater than 5.5 percent probably represents a
head wind, and anything less than 5 percent for these key rates probably 
represents a tail wind. Interestingly, as both inflationary pressures (energy
and food prices) and recessionary pressures (credit squeeze, home price
contractions) existed in the 2006–07 timeframe, the Fed kept the rates right 
in the middle — 5.25 percent — for over a year. Interest rates change over
time, depending on the economy, inflation and investor expectations.
Apart from Graham’s intrinsic value formula, interest rates are also a factor 
in discounted cash flow approaches (introduced earlier in this chapter).
Current interest rates affect the discount rate. The higher the current interest
rates, the higher the discount rate, resulting in a lower total investment value
using the present value formula. Conversely, lower interest rates turn into
lower discount rates, which act as a tail wind, and relatively high valuations. 
82
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Again, there is more theory than fact on how to quantify the effect of 
interest rates on discount rates, so the Buffett approach, calling for simple,
conservative, generally inclusive assumptions devoid of heavy quantitative
analysis, generally makes sense. Buffett would likely set the discount rate at
10 percent in a tail wind environment and closer to 15 percent in a head 
wind environment.
Risk
Risk is perhaps the most debated, theoretical, difficult-to-quantify element 
of all. Many types of risk in the business and investing world are beyond 
the scope of this book. The theorists who have tried to quantify risk as a
component of investment analysis have generally circled around the notion
of beta — a simpler-than-most Greek letter formula that assesses a stock’s
price movements versus the market and versus other stocks. Essentially, a
beta greater than 1.0 means that the stock tends to fluctuate farther in the
same direction than the base market index or portfolio of stocks it’s being
compared with. A beta less than 1.0 means that the stock price moves less in
the same direction, or even in a different direction. If you’ve read any invest-
ing books, you’ve probably encountered beta somewhere in the discussion
and been told that high beta stocks are riskier and low beta stocks are safer.
What’s wrong with this picture? It turns out that beta is relatively meaning-
less for value investors. Why? Because it measures the fluctuation of stock
prices. As a value investor, you aren’t concerned with stock price fluctuation,
only whether the stock price is a bargain compared to long-term value. Value
investors ignore the type of risk measured by beta. They’re more interested
in how the company performs, not how the stock performs relative to 
other stocks. 
Beta is useful only in the sense that higher price volatility for an issue may
reflect underlying uncertainty in the company itself, such as with many of the
higher flying tech stocks in 2000 and 2001. But the risks associated with these
stocks become apparent long before you examine beta.
If you reflect again on Buffett’s approach, you realize that the risk isn’t 
inherent in the stock’s price, but rather on the clarity and consistency of a
company’s future prospects. The more unpredictable (hard to understand)
the company and its future, the greater the risk. There is no way to easily
quantify this kind of risk. Generally, business risks are accounted for in the
discount rate by making a conservative assumption — a high discount, or
hurdle, rate — to provide a margin of safety.
83
Chapter 4: A Painless Course in Value Investing Math

Why Lesson 8 is important
Inflation, taxes, interest rates, and risk all affect your investments and invest-
ment decisions. Inflation can be left alone as a decision factor, but watch out
for possible effects on interest rates. Taxes affect how investments should 
be managed. The more taxes can be deferred, the higher the long-run total
return. Taxes don’t generally influence the buy decision, only the sell decision
for a stock. Interest rates can increase or decrease the valuation of a com-
pany as an investment. Risk for the value investor is defined in terms of the
company and its prospects, not the volatility of its stock price. Where more
risk is perceived, you seek a greater margin of safety, or discount, between
price and value. Quantifying these effects is difficult at best; but it can be
done by adjusting discount rates in valuation formulas or by requiring higher
rates of return before committing investing dollars.

W
ithout a doubt, information is the fuel that drives all forms of invest-
ing today. This is especially true for the do-it-yourself investing styles
that have emerged since the 1980s with personal computers and the Internet.
Whether you’re a long-term value investor or a minute-to-minute trader, you
use some form of financial information to make investing and trading decisions. 
This chapter provides an overview of the types of investing information
needed to make value investing decisions, and the various sources of that
information. We examine the quality of those sources and their cost to you,
but by no means do we offer a complete list. The chapter presents some
favorites with an emphasis on low cost and simplicity. It’s a good guess that
your approach to acquiring information and other tools is similar to your
investing approach: It’s value-based. 
In some ways, this chapter puts the cart before the proverbial horse because
we haven’t yet described value investing techniques and practices, and you
may not know what to look for. The information in this chapter will become
more valuable as your understanding of value investing increases, so the best
advice is to read this chapter once as an introduction and then return to it
repeatedly as you refine your value investing system.
It’s assumed that most of you are connected to the Internet. The Web has
made research and information gathering so easy, cost-effective, and straight-
forward that, really, no investor should do without it. True value investing is
a long-term endeavor, making the real-time nature of Web-based information
relatively less important compared to other investing styles. But it’s much

easier and often cheaper on the Web. That said, published information avail-
able by mail or even at your local library can be quite sufficient. Most of
what’s presented here, however, is available online.
What a Value Investor Looks For
No two investors are alike — that’s a fundamental principle of investing and
investors. Inevitably, investing combines art and science. Quantifiable and
unquantifiable facts are put into the pot, and the resulting stew is interpreted
according to taste. The “science” part is using numbers, facts, and formulas
to measure business value. The “art” part is taking all the facts and measure-
ments together and weighing them according to intuition and experience to
judge the most likely outcome or set of outcomes. 
This intertwining of art and science is, in fact, what makes markets work. The
difference of opinion and judgment coming from thousands of investing
“pots,” combined with differing investing objectives, is what makes markets
go up and down. Just as there is no single value investing formula, there is 
no one set of investing resources guaranteed to make you a successful value
investor. We can provide only the ingredients — and the pot.
Further, like so many other things in life, the law of diminishing returns applies.
Too much information is, indeed, too much information. As all bargain hunters
know from experience, driving by every gas station in town in search of a
slightly better deal doesn’t make sense. Similarly, using too many information
sources will probably just confuse you. The best advice: Pick a couple infor-
mation sources, learn all you can from them, and use them consistently. In
other words, keep it simple. The rest of this chapter is concerned with the
facts, analysis of those facts, and the intangibles value investors need to
properly blend art and science into their investing decisions. 
Facts and more facts
All value investors need facts about a company’s financial and operating per-
formance. These facts, and there are lots of them, provide the foundation for
value analysis. Value investors look for current or most recent performance
and also trends and changes that can help paint a picture of the future. These
facts are available from the company itself as financial statements or from
one of many information sources that repackage company-provided data for
investor use.
Financial results
Financial statements provide a picture of company assets, liabilities, earn-
ings, and growth. The balance sheet presents a snapshot of assets, liabilities,
86
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

and net worth. The income statement shows revenues, expenses, and earn-
ings for a set period of time. The statement of cash flows follows the income
statement, showing where cash is obtained and used in the business. Each 
of these usually has supporting tables and information conveying other key
aspects of financial and operating performance. See Chapters 6–8.
Financial trends 
As presented, financial statements usually show the most recent performance,
as a snapshot (balance sheet) or as the most recent period of activity (income
and cash flow statements). The most recent information is, of course, impor-
tant. But it is also helpful to capture and measure change as it occurs over
time. Like history itself, the past, and the changing trend patterns throughout
the past, often suggest the future.
Good trend data, and especially good trend analysis, is hard to come by.
Many financial sources, including company reports, show only the past two,
maybe three years of performance. Not bad, but seeing where a company has
been for the last five, ten, or even more years is really helpful. For example, if
profits or profit margins have grown steadily over the last three years, that’s
nice to know. But it says more if that trend is solid over the past ten or so
years. Better financial information sources give enough facts to see trends. 
Comparative metrics, ratios, and percentages
Similarly, it’s easier to see how good or how bad a set of facts is by compar-
ing it to another set of facts — either within the boundaries of a single com-
pany or across different companies in the same business. From raw financial
data the value investor can construct ratios — relationships between facts
that offer clues to financial safety, quality, profitability, and efficiency, thus
providing a clearer picture of company value. Ratios also serve to normalize
data so that companies can be compared to other companies or whole indus-
tries. Price/earnings, price/book, price/sales, and debt/equity are examples,
and there are many others. We explain more about ratios in Chapter 10.
Like ratios, percentages relate facts to other facts and help paint a clearer pic-
ture of company performance and normalize data for comparison. Examples
include return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and gross and net
profit margin. ROE, ROA, and margins are explored in depth in Chapter 13.
Marketplace facts
As will be seen later on, financial facts represent past business results pro-
duced by a business, while marketplace facts can often be a leading indicator
of future financial results. So it’s important to understand metrics like market
share, customer base, or unit sales growth wherever possible. Unfortunately,
companies aren’t required to report such facts and often choose not to do so
for competitive reasons — you’ll have to rely on what a company does dis-
close and on market analysis done by third parties.
87
Chapter 5: A Guide to Value Investing Resources

The term market or marketplace is used frequently throughout the book.
We’re talking about how a company performs in its marketplace — where it
sells its products and services — not how it performs in the stock market.
Marketplace information is not about stock price history or trends, relative
strength, or any other technical analysis of stock price behavior.
Operating facts
Certain kinds of operational facts or metrics can also be used as a measure to
compare companies or to support financial analysis. It’s interesting to know
the number of employees, stores, plants, or square feet as measures of size of
operations. From there, one can determine productivity or efficiency — how
much revenue, profit, and so on is produced per unit of operational activity.
Hence, some call these unit measures. Some unit measures are general, such
as employee counts, while some are more specific to a particular industry,
such as seat miles flown for the airline industry.
Fact sources
As you can probably imagine, it’s easy to immerse yourself into more facts
and data than you can possibly absorb or do anything useful with. The trick,
as a value investor, is to develop a series of sources providing what you want,
in the form you want it, with the right timing, so that you can analyze a busi-
ness or get a useful update without spending hours on the details. 
More information is not always better. Seasoned investors find and use the
right sources for the right information at the right time at the right cost.
Annual and quarterly reports
Most American companies are required by law to provide annual and quar-
terly financial summaries to their investors and the financial community.
There are two kinds of annual reports: One is a “consumer-friendly” version
with pictures and descriptions of the company’s business with the appropri-
ate financial facts included, usually in the back of the report. The other is the
so-called “10-K” annual report, submitted according to guidelines to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This report is more detailed
overall, with more supporting financial facts and an analysis of the company
business, including key marketing and operating facts. 
Quarterly reports, also required, summarize the most recent business activ-
ity and major changes during the quarter. The “10-Q” version, similarly, has
more detail and is cast to SEC standards. Annual reports give a good hands-
on financial summary, often with a healthy dose of marketing and operational
data. They may have considerable “lookback” data for determining trends,
but not always. Quarterly reports are usually issued concurrent with earnings
announcements, but annual reports may considerably lag an actual business
year. 
88
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

To get 10-Ks reliably and quickly, the SEC created a Web site known as
“EDGAR,” or “Electronic Data Gathering And Reporting.” “EDGAR Online” can
be found at http://sec.gov/edgar.shtml. While Edgar will help you find
annual reports and other filings, today it’s almost become easier just to go to
the company “Investor Relations” page. Annual reports are usually available,
are easily downloadable, and have indexes to help you hone in on what you
want. The upshot is you don’t have to mail the company a postcard and wait
3 weeks to get an annual report (or buy shares) like you did 20 years ago. 
Financial portals
Printed materials, such as annual reports, used to be investing mainstays —
that is, before the Internet. The Internet has done wonders for packaging
information, enabling investors to quickly find the current information they
need, all without waiting or going anywhere.
Financial portals, such as Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com), assemble
vast amounts of company and performance information, including business
descriptions, financial summaries, news items and some comparative analy-
ses, performance analyses, and screening tools. Portals are a great source for
quick overviews or updates, usually with links to more detailed information.
Although Yahoo! Finance is probably the leading financial portal today, there
are others that bear watching, like Google Finance (http://finance.
google.com). Google Finance is currently a work in progress, but Google has
long demonstrated a knack for providing the right stuff with easy navigation. 
Broker sites
Some years ago, broker sites, especially the Internet brokers like E*Trade and
Ameritrade, led the way in bringing information to investors online. Today,
most broker sites, even the traditional ones, enable some investing analysis.
The quality and ease of use of their tools varies, and in many cases you have
to have an account to get the “good stuff” like professional analysis or stock
screeners. Today, most of these sites are geared only to very high-level analy-
sis and packaged recommendations, like Standard & Poor’s rating reports. 
Research services
There are dozens of companies set up to provide data and analysis to
investors; however, many aim at providing these products to professional
investors, not you. Companies like S&P and Hoover’s offer huge packages of
investment information, but of course, the issue is cost, which can run into
the thousands. At this point, Value Line is the one research service aimed at
individual investors providing a complete package of — as the name would
suggest — value-oriented facts and analysis. More at the end of this chapter. 
89
Chapter 5: A Guide to Value Investing Resources

The best “fact” tools allow investors to (1) view results over time; (2) tie
financial performance to operating measures, as in sales per employee or
sales per square foot metrics; and (3) compare companies to each other 
and industry averages. 
The soft stuff
In addition to financial information, value investors want a sense of a com-
pany’s management effectiveness and market position. This is where a lot of
the “art” comes in. Understanding a company’s products and markets is an
exercise in judgment helped by looking at Web sites; advertising and market-
ing campaigns; the company’s own description of its products; and what you
see, hear, and experience on the street. 
Management effectiveness can be gauged by looking at a company’s financials
and financial ratios, previous marketplace and financial decisions, business
execution, acquisitions and mergers, public statements and other “track
record” items. Many value investors look at management ownership of com-
pany stock as a signal of management commitment. 
Market position refers to a company’s approach to the marketplace and the
resulting success — or failure — of that approach. Some elements of market
position can be measured — like market share — but most of the market
appraisal — like brand strength — is subjective. We take a closer look at
these “intangibles” in Chapter 14. 
The company Web site and annual report
Almost as if in dating or employment relationships, first impressions can be
important. And today — unless you’ve been directly involved as a customer
or in some other way with a company — first impressions are likely to come
from a company Web site.
Company Web sites can tell a lot about a company, including how the com-
pany sees itself. A well-organized and presented site, offering easy to get
information both to customers and prospective investors, says a lot. Some
sites give too much or too little detail — and seem more a monument to man-
agement or some professional marketing agency than a real portal into a
company’s business or intentions. It doesn’t take long to figure out. 
Annual reports — though gradually being replaced by the drier regulatory 
10-K format — can also reveal how a company views its business. Again, cus-
tomer focus and focus on specific facts and figures are better than endless
pictures of managers “in action” at some company facility. If a company is
proud of what it does, and talks to you about it on the straight and narrow,
that’s a plus.

Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

News releases
Most companies have a public relations department, and the job of those PR
departments is to disseminate news about the company. Some of it relates to
specific company events like annual meetings, earnings releases, or confer-
ence calls, while others occur on a more ad-hoc basis, like new product
announcements or management changes. 
Value investors look most of all for honesty, openness, and understandability
in these messages. They look for a balance of good and bad news and willing-
ness to admit mistakes, all delivered in clear, crisp language not overly
clouded with jargon or business buzzwords. It’s what they say and how they
say it that counts. 
If you hear or read something like, “...we’re leveraging our core competencies
to achieve scalable results in our global off-shoring enterprise,” look out below.
This sentence has little to no real meaning — if they have nothing specific to
say, they probably aren’t doing much that’s specific, either. Look for another
investment. 
Financial commentary
Of course, not all commentary comes from the company itself. Journalists
and financial experts write stories about companies all the time, especially
larger firms. The stories, which can be found both online and offline, usually
highlight key facts, blending in analysis and subjective assessments — in
short, they add value.
Value investors should tune in to what the journalists are saying — not to be
taken as gospel, of course, but as another view to consider. Many financial
journalists have access to information that most value investors do not —
from professional data sources, industry observers, and often the company
itself. 
In the marketplace
For most companies, the real “soft stuff” lies in how the company positions
itself in its marketplace, and whether or not it is succeeding with that posi-
tion. It can make or break a business.
Value investors should consider how well a company is doing in terms of cus-
tomer perception and brand strength. Are customers satisfied with products?
Are they loyal? Do advertising campaigns work? Is the brand an asset or a
work-in-progress? If the company is competing on price, is it successful? 
And is the strategy clear? Realistic? Executable? Or muddy, sort of, “we’re
everything to everyone,” with no clear focus? And what about operational
efficiency? Does it deliver the goods? In a way that creates a positive customer
91
Chapter 5: A Guide to Value Investing Resources

experience without giving away the store? Long lines at Starbucks suggest
good business — but also suggest a likelihood that some customers are being
turned away. Realizing that specific answers are hard to come by, such are
the kinds of answers a value investor would seek. It’s where the “art” enters
the value equation.
Sources of soft stuff
The list of “soft stuff” sources is almost endless. As a value investor, you’ll
develop your own ways to tune in to happenings with your company, its man-
agement, and marketplace success. Again, no two investors will do this alike.
Among the many sources are the following.
Financial and investing Web sites 
Financial portal Yahoo! Finance has already been mentioned, and will point to
a lot more information about a company located and posted in various corners
of the Internet. MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com) and theStreet.com
(www.thestreet.com) offer general news and journalistic commentary
about companies across the board, while Morningstar and The Motley Fool
(more on these later) provide more thorough analysis generally from a value
perspective. 
Business journals
Old standbys like The Wall Street Journal and Business Week still offer timely
and high-quality journalistic appraisal of companies, often with a value slant.
Trouble is, they write about the companies they choose, not what you want
to read about at a given moment. You’ll find a few nuggets occasionally in
Kiplinger’s, Smart Money, and Money magazines.
Trade journals
Value investors learn about the businesses they invest in, and reading about
a trade can be one of the best ways to keep up. Various journals and Web
sites are available to follow everything from the restaurant industry to mili-
tary electronics. Hobby and special interest periodicals can help, too — the
latest PC magazines can keep you up to date with the computer industry. 
Sometimes industry-specific Web sites can offer lots of unique and compara-
tive factual information to go with the soft stuff. For example, the U.S.
Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics offers
detailed snapshots of some 26 U.S. air carriers, loaded with marketing, 
operational and financial information — check out www.transtats.bts.
gov/carriers.asp.
92
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Conference calls
Broadband Internet service has made it easier and more popular to listen in
on quarterly earnings conference calls held by management. These calls,
once held mainly for the benefit of security analysts, can now be tuned into
in real time or as archived material through Yahoo! Finance and other portals,
and usually through the company’s investor relations page. For deeper and
more complete conference call access, including scheduling tools, “BestCalls”
(www.bestcalls.com) is worth a look. 
Most conference calls offer a scripted management review of the “hard” num-
bers, followed by a question-and-answer session with the analysts. These
analyst sessions often go much longer — and deeper — than the script. It is
especially during these “Q&A” sessions that “soft stuff” like marketplace
intelligence and other business nuances come forth as an explanation of
financial performance or projections. In a conference call you may hear that a
sales slump for manufactured decking producer Trex Corporation is due to
inventory cutbacks at Home Depot and Lowe’s, their largest sales channels.
Heard (and seen) on the street
Above all, most value investors develop a knack for casual and informal
observation of the business world around them. Which companies are doing
well in the marketplace? Which companies have a unique and different story
likely to give sustainable competitive advantage? Which companies have bar-
riers to competition? 
Value investors hit the streets and stop, look, and listen to what’s around
them. They talk to customers and employees to get the “scoop” on what’s
working and what isn’t. They look at facilities for signs of success or failure.
One famous story involves Warren Buffett, who, when trying to decide whether
to invest in a gasoline additives business, watched the number of tank cars
being switched in and out. Now most investors won’t spend a lot of time
hanging out by railroad tracks, but if stuck behind a train, you may as well
watch to see which ethanol company is shipping the most product! 
Analysis tools
Beyond the facts and the “soft stuff,” value investors occasionally use specially
packaged tools to help select companies to watch or to develop a value
analysis.
Screeners
Stock screeners come in many shapes and sizes. The better ones offer more
value-oriented screening factors like cash flow, cash on hand, profitability,
and return on assets. Others are more oriented to stock price behavior,
which of course, generally isn’t part of the equation.
93
Chapter 5: A Guide to Value Investing Resources

Screeners change, so it’s hard to catalog them here. Some require brokerage
accounts or fees to access. Customizable screeners are best, although some
of the “prepackaged” screens are helpful, too. The best at the time of this
writing are at MSN’s “Money Center,” and at Fidelity Investments. The latter
requires an account, but with their broad management of retirement plans,
many have the requisite account. A Google search of stock screeners will
return the latest available.
Analyzers and calculators
Like screeners, analyzers come and go. Analyzers usually package financial
information and deliver it with an analysis of a company’s current and future
value based on a set of assumptions. Currently the best is offered free by
independent investment service “iStockResearch” (www.istockresearch.
com). 
Value Investing Tool Kits
While the number of investing resources available has exploded with the
advent of the Internet, we still have found no such thing as a “complete” tool
kit for value investors. That would be too easy, and would likely be impossi-
ble since as stated at the outset, no two value investors do it alike. But
among all that’s out there, three packaged sets of resources and analyses for
value-oriented investors stand out, and are at least worth a look for current
and aspiring value investors. The “resources” include not only decision-
making facts and tools to help in decision making but also worthwhile educa-
tional tools to learn more about value investing and how to incorporate more
factors into a business appraisal. 
Morningstar
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) is probably best known for its origi-
nal roots as a mutual fund Web site and its well-known classification and
rating system for funds. It is still the premier financial site in that space, with
plenty of information and analysis on mutual funds, ETFs, closed end funds,
and other investment vehicles.
More recently, Morningstar has come into its own as a stock analysis site. It
offers plenty for the do-it-yourself investor, including financial information,
stock screeners, and commentary from an analyst staff. Most useful for set-
ting Morningstar apart from the others is its analysis of economic “moats” —
94
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

that is, competitive advantages and barriers to competition a company may
enjoy. Overall, Morningstar analysts take a market-focused and growth-
oriented view of value; we like that. The free service is good, and for $15.95/
month or $145/year you can get a “premium” service giving access to more
complete stock analysis, a state-of-the-art stock screener, and portfolio-
analysis tools. A free trial is available.
The Motley Fool
Edgy, contrarian, downright funny at times, The Motley Fool (www.fool.com)
has grown far from its roots as an America Online page back in 1994 to
becoming a full-fledged investing Web site. Its motto, “To educate, amuse, 
and enrich,” says a lot. Motley Fool, or “TMF” in lingo, brings educational
resources and sharp commentary to ordinary online investors. (Books by
founders David and Tom Gardner are also worthwhile reads.) Much of its
commentary centers on “rule makers” — stocks and companies that follow
convention — and “rule breakers” — contrarian picks that may not show
value in the rear view mirror, but have everything pointed the right way. Its
close following of Starbucks over the years is a case in point. 
TMF places great importance on brand, and closely follows value indicators
like dividends and stock buybacks. It is a staunch advocate of companies that
treat both their customers and their investors well. Articles also give solid
review and commentary on company financials, saving you a lot of legwork
and hitting the important stuff. TMF articles citing companies appear regu-
larly in financial portals like Yahoo! Finance for free. While much of their 
content is free, there are also subscription services for stock research and
analysis — like the aptly named Hidden Gems newsletter available for
$199/year.
95
Chapter 5: A Guide to Value Investing Resources
Follow the leader 
If you’re reading this book, you probably (at least
to a degree) aspire to be an independent
investor. That’s a good thing. But no matter how
independent you are, there is value in following
the lead of other successful investors. Why?
Expertise, maybe — but really, it’s about effi-
ciency. Why reinvent the wheel? If well-known
investors like Warren Buffett or George Soros
own a stock, why shouldn’t you at least consider
it? So, while it may take a dose of humility, sage
value investors follow their idols. Some of those
idols — along with tips on how to follow them —
are listed at the end of Chapter 3. So don’t be
afraid to learn from the masters.

Value Line
Sadly for we value investors, not everything out there is free. If we’re willing
to open our wallets, possibilities expand. If you’re willing to spend the money,
lots of paid-for investing services are available to the more serious value
investor. Professional database and analysis services targeted to the billion-
dollar fund manager would be nice to have, but the $10,000 annual price tag
probably places them beyond your interests. One moderately priced service
targeted to the independent investor segment has been doing its thing for
some 50 years and costs less than $1,000 a year (and can be had under the
right circumstances for free): Value Line. 
Value Line publishes distinctive one-page company summaries designed
especially for value-oriented investors (the name is a giveaway, right?) The
traditional Value Line Investment Survey package consists of sets of one-page
bound reports on newsprint mailed biweekly to subscribers. Each biweekly
set features five to ten industries and all companies judged to be within the
industry. Sixty-plus analysts cover 1,700-plus companies in depth, usually
once per quarter. And most of it is also available online accompanied by the
search and screening tools you’d expect to find. 
Value Line provides basic company facts but smartly narrows it to what’s
needed to appraise the business. The Statistical Array presents a composite
of ratios and percentages often specially tuned for an industry, for example,
the insurance industry. Analyst commentaries are brief and full of insight.
Although Value Line goes beyond to suggest stock timeliness and safety (and
it has done well with these judgments), the greatest value is delivered before
making these recommendations. Value investors are do-it-yourselfers, but a
little help never hurts. The Value Line Investment Survey costs $598/year for
the printed version and $538 for the online version. There are smaller, more
focused products available too — for small cap stocks, convertible securities,
and other more specialized analysis. Trial versions are available for a small
charge.
Many libraries and brokerage firms with physical offices still carry the printed
Value Line Investment Survey on their shelves. Depending on where your local
library or broker is, you may want to try this path before committing your
dollars to a subscription.

 Using financial statements for value investing.
K
nowledge is power. Nowhere is that more true than in the investing
world. Value investors need to know about the companies they invest
in, just as traders need to know what’s happening in the market minute-by-
minute. In either investing space, absence of knowledge reduces investment
decisions to mere guesswork.
Fortunately for the value investor, the SEC requires publicly traded compa-
nies to publish complete financial information about themselves. An enor-
mous amount is available and easy to find. But for most of us, unfortunately,
it’s too much information, and too confusing. How many of you have read an
annual report from cover to cover and gained a solid understanding of the
business from doing so? Not many, right? 
Most people who open an annual report look at the pictures and read a few
highlights — if they open it at all. Some may read management’s optimistic
commentary about the strength of the company’s markets, products, and
financials. A few may look at the colorful graphs and charts. The more curi-
ous look enviously at executive salary and option grant disclosures.
But what about the financials themselves? The goes-into’s and goes-outta’s
indicating the true health and success of the business? The challenge is to
acquire the right information about a company and then to convert it into

actionable investing knowledge. This knowledge reveals the true character
and dynamics of a business, the intrinsic value, the business performance
characteristics that conclusively indicate whether you’d want to own a 
company — which in turn may suggest that it’s a good place to invest. 
To the untrained eye, most of the information public companies disclose is
too complex and detailed to make much sense of for the common reader. The
unknowing reader is unaware of what’s important and may even be misled.
Although it was worse prior to the 2001 Enron and WorldCom scandals, it 
is still possible to present legally correct information in ways that the true
meaning isn’t necessarily obvious to the investor. 
The goal of this chapter and the next few chapters is to provide a guide for
separating the wheat from the chaff. You won’t emerge from this section of
the book prepared for the next CPA examination or a career in a corporate
finance department. You won’t be able to prepare financial statements. The
main idea is to know what you need to know to invest rationally and wisely. 
We start with a basic overview of financial statements and moves forward
into the balance sheet, income, and cash flow statements. Building on that
base, it advances into basic financial analysis, using ratios to gain a better
understanding of what the financial data tell us. Along the way, you’ll see
some of the tricks of the trade and creative accounting practices that can 
and do deceive the inattentive investor from time to time.
Accounting Isn’t Just for Accountants
Why is accounting so important, anyway? Why does an individual investor
care how a company counts its beans? The purpose of accounting is just to
pay bills, collect money owed, pay taxes, and keep track of what’s in the bank,
right? And to keep a small army of CPAs, analysts, and clerks employed?
Wrong. Accounting, and the financial reporting that emerges from account-
ing, serves a critical function: to reflect the economic reality of a company
and its business. 
Accounting and accountants are supposed to project a fair, unbiased view 
of company performance. Accountants build financial reports according to
accepted practices in the field, which dictate such principles as substance
over form, conservatism, and materiality. But despite (and maybe because
of) the fact that no fewer than three governing bodies decree accounting and
reporting practice, a degree of latitude and flexibility exists in how reporting
is actually done.
This flexibility exists mostly in the valuation of assets and determination of
revenue and cost. Those issues are covered in Chapters 7 through 9. And
companies took advantage of this flexibility, especially in the late 1990s as
98
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

they became increasingly under the gun to perform, especially in the short
term. Back in those days, the art of creative accounting bloomed to help com-
panies achieve desired levels — on paper — of performance. Accounting is
supposed to be used to measure and report business results, not to achieve
them!
Value investors need to be smart about what and how much to question in a
financial report. The investor who spends his time questioning the origin of
every number in a financial report will never come up for air and probably
will never make a successful value investment as a result. Without seeing all
background data, you can’t possibly understand the origin of all those stated
numbers anyway. The smart investor knows what to look for in a statement
and what levers a company’s management can throw to convey a certain
image. It’s okay to be a skeptic, but it’s probably not productive to dispute
every figure in the report. As with so much else in life, focus on what’s 
important.
The State of Financial Statements
If every company were able to report information as it pleased, financial
reports would be apple-to-orange nightmares, rendering all information use-
less to everyone. The purpose of financial reporting is to present accounting
information in a comprehensible, consistent format. But one person’s “com-
prehensible” may be another’s “complex,” and “consistent” doesn’t mean
“exactly the same.” Why did financial reporting evolve this way? In part,
because financial statements serve a lot of different readers. 
A family of readers
Financial information isn’t just for those who commit equity capital to a com-
pany. Those who commit debt capital (as in loans from banks, for example)
have an equal, if not greater, vested interest in a company’s financial health.
Here’s a short list of interested parties and what they want to know:
 Shareholders want to know about a company’s short- and long-term
financial health and performance to decide whether to keep or expand
their investment.
 Potential shareholders want to know a company’s financial health and
performance before they make an initial investment.
 Creditors and lenders keeping track of a company’s financial health to
know whether to keep or expand credit.
99
Chapter 6: Statements of Fact Part 1: Understanding Financial Statements

 Suppliers want to better understand a company’s business to determine
product fit and know whether to extend credit.
 Customers, especially business-to-business customers, want information
about a company’s products and dependability as a supplier.
 Potential employees want to understand a company’s products and 
culture to determine whether the company is stable.
 Government statisticians and market analysts look at financial reports
to understand industries and financial performance within an industry.
The point: As an individual investor, realize that you aren’t the only customer.
It’s hard to speculate how company-published financial information would
change if investors were the only customer, but it’s unlikely that reporting
will change to perfectly meet the investor’s needs. You have to make do with
what you have. 
A slave of many masters
Imagine if the tax code were specified not only by the IRS, but also by three
or four different agencies, public and private, all with a hand in the matter.
That scenario is pretty close to what the financial reporting professional
faces. 
No fewer than three agencies are involved in creating the rules and constructs
for reporting financial performance:
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
 The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
Each entity researches and publishes opinions and acts as a watchdog. The
SEC can require compliance to its own dictates and to those of the others,
especially the FASB. The FASB issues numbered guidelines for financial report-
ing that companies can choose to adopt or be required to adopt by the SEC.
The SEC acts as overseer and enforcer of regulations and cooperates with the
FASB and other agencies to initiate new regulations and standards. The AICPA
sets standards governing the accountancy profession and the conduct of indi-
viduals within that profession.
While the FASB, SEC, and AICPA shape most financial reporting law and prac-
tice, recognize that Congress itself plays a big role, especially with sweeping
legislation like the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. And there is a push toward greater
international consistency in financial reporting being led by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Someday, it all may be simpler, but right
now it’s a pretty complicated landscape. 
100
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Value investors should watch out of the corner of their eyes for financial
reporting standards changes and discussions leading toward change. The
financial media usually report the big ones. For a deeper look — or to see
what’s coming before it arrives — the SEC Web site, www.sec.gov, is a good
source. 
Financial Statement Anatomy
The rest of this chapter covers the financial statements themselves and the
forms in which they typically arrive. Many of you will get your statements
from published annual reports or quarterly summaries, but more and more
this information is found in Web portals like Yahoo! Finance. 
Regardless of your source, what you’ll find is usually the same. The annual
report is a more complete package, containing company market information,
management perspective, and certain other legal reporting requirements. So
the discussion will start there, recognizing that regardless of where you get
your financial statements, there’s more work to do to understand them. 
The 10-K annual report
The Form 10-K annual report and its quarterly sibling, the 10-Q, form the
backbone of detailed company analysis for investors and other financial
statement readers.
One of the SEC’s many goals is to ensure that financial information about
public companies is correct, consistent, regularly reported, and readily avail-
able. So the SEC created reporting forms for an assortment of financial infor-
mation: financial results, financial changes, and ownership changes. 
The 10-K is similar to a company’s printed and distributed annual report.
However, it goes into more detail, and most dispense with the glossy pictures
and marketing material. It looks like a government document because it is
one. The reports are available from the company investor relations site or 
the EDGAR site (http://sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/company
search.html for the company search page) and through certain other
sources like The Wall Street Journal annual reports service. A 10-K goes into
the following details about a company’s business and financials: 
 Detailed business description: This includes business segments, prod-
uct lines, geography, operating units, plants, property, technologies,
patents, customer base and key customers, employees and employee
mix, and so forth. 
101
Chapter 6: Statements of Fact Part 1: Understanding Financial Statements

 Company markets: And market size, market position, market growth,
market share, competition, threats, and strengths. 
 Detailed financials: The line items are often similar to printed annual
reports, but there is more history, often five to ten years’ worth, deeper
analysis, and more complete notes explaining certain lines in greater
detail. More detailed explanations of acquisitions, pensions, and other
special accounting transactions are also usually available. 
 Risk factors: 10-K reports list a company’s risks and how those risks may
affect company performance. 
 Management’s analysis of results, financial condition, and go-forward
prospects: Again, the information is often more detailed and contains
less “spin” than that found in printed reports.
 Description of legal proceedings: Usually not important, unless the com-
pany is involved in major patent, asbestos litigation, or something similar. 
Dissecting the annual report
Making generalizations about the construction of an annual report isn’t easy,
but most, if not all, reports contain the following elements. From one com-
pany to the next, these elements won’t look the same, be the same size, be in
the same order, or contain the same information. But the main pieces are all
present in some form.
Highlights
The highlights section is usually a one-page graphic summary of significant
financial results: sales, earnings, and a few productivity measures key to a
company’s industry. Four or five years of history are often included. Highlights
are useful for a first glance, but there’s usually more to the story.
Letter to shareholders
The letter to shareholders presents a chipper one- or two-page summary,
usually from the CEO, describing the past year and the year ahead. Although
some managers are frank in describing and confronting a company’s difficul-
ties, others are not. You may see a discussion of milestones and achievements
(“We opened our 2,000th store,” “We maintain an in-stock level unequaled in
the retail world,” or “We achieved #1 position according to XYZ Industry
News”) without a lot of discussion of whether they were worthwhile. The
letter may include something about new customers, new technologies, and
employment practices. The value investor can assess accomplishments and

language without panaceaic jargon or buzzwords, and many look for willing-
ness to discuss bad stuff in these letters — a sign of management honesty
and integrity.
Business summary
This objectively worded section covers the business — its products; markets;
competition; and factors such as seasonality, patents, and international expo-
sure that may affect the business. That’s usually followed by a summary of
the management team, which is in turn followed by a fairly detailed discus-
sion of potential risks to the business. The business summary section is one
of the best ways for an investor to gain business understanding.
Management’s discussion and analysis
From there, we move into the financials themselves, which usually begin with
a management discussion and analysis of the financials. The discussion covers
specific financial statement components, including sales, costs, expenses,
assets, liabilities, liquidity, and may cover market expansion risks. 
The statements
The financial statement section usually consumes the last half to two-thirds
of an annual report. Several versions of consolidated financial data are 
presented.
What does “consolidated” mean? Are they leaving something out? No.
Consolidated means that (1) many legal subsidiaries include foreign sub-
sidiaries; and (2) many, many accounts are combined into a simplified report-
ing structure for presentation. Consolidation makes the resulting statements
shorter and easier to understand.
103
Chapter 6: Statements of Fact Part 1: Understanding Financial Statements
Does (report) size matter?
Merrill Lynch did a study years ago to correlate
the size of company 10-K reports with company
stock performance. What did it find? There is a
strong correlation between the size of the 10-K
report, in number of pages, and poor investment
performance. From March 31, 2000 to March 31,
2001, companies with small 10-K filings (150
pages of text or fewer) lost 52 percent of stock
value, while those with large (between 150 and
200 pages) or jumbo filings (200 pages or more)
lost 73 percent and 78 percent of stock value,
respectively. Interestingly, AOL/Time Warner’s
filing was 1,861 pages with the merger, but
wasn’t included in the study. On the plus side,
Adobe Systems, which, ironically, produces
software used to download and print 10-Ks,
weighed in with an 87-page filing and lost only
37 percent — and has been a solid performer
ever since. This speaks well to the value
investor’s quest for simpler businesses, 

Financials invariably include a balance sheet, income statement, and state-
ment of cash flows. Most reports include a statement of shareholder’s equity,
a statement of working capital, or some other summary of changes in the
financials. The main statements, covered in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8:
 The balance sheet captures a company’s financial position at a point in
time. It shows all assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity, usually in clearly
defined subsections. In fact, the balance sheet is often called a statement
of financial position or statement of financial condition.
 The income statement captures a company’s performance over an inter-
val of time. Of interest here are the sales or revenues, cost of those
sales, other expenses, and, of course, the difference between sales and
costs — earnings. This statement is sometimes called the statement of
operations or operating activity.
 The statement of cash flows also captures company activity and perfor-
mance over a time interval, but this time it’s done in cash terms. As
explained in Chapter 8, cash and accounting flows can be different. The
difference is usually timing. Cash flows are just as the name implies —
cash or checks coming in, cash or checks being paid out. Cash flows are
a lifeblood flow into and out of the business. Cash flows tell you a lot
about company liquidity — which refers to the presence or absence of
enough cash to operate, and the quality of earnings — and whether the
earnings are real or a result of accounting gimmicks.
No assessment of company performance, quality, or success can be achieved
without these statements and, in particular, without looking at all three state-
ments together. Consider some examples of financial statements. Figures 6-1
through 6-3 are presented from the Simpson Manufacturing Company (a man-
ufacturer of construction fastening products) 2006 Annual Report. Simpson is
chosen as an example for the relative simplicity of the business and it’s “fit”
as a value stock. The Simpson statement example is referred to repeatedly in
Chapters 7 through 10 and beyond.
Common size statements
Some annual reports provide, in addition to normal financial statements, a
set of common size statements. Common size statements are standard finan-
cial reports with all information presented as percentages. Thus, cash or
accounts receivable are presented as a percentage of total assets, and the
cost of goods sold or marketing expenses are presented as a percent of rev-
enue. Common size statements are useful for comparing companies.

Chapter 6: Statements of Fact Part 1: Understanding Financial Statements

Notes
Ironically, the notes part of an annual report may take more room and con-
tain more detail than the financial statements themselves. Notes can give a
lot of important detail or “color” to support the statements. 
Notes not only show more detail, but also show the accounting practice a
company uses in preparing a statement. A company’s description of deprecia-
tion methods, option accounting, pension funding, and the like can make big
difference in interpreting the statements. Notes also disclose one-time situa-
tions such as acquisitions, discontinued businesses, and asset write-downs in
greater detail, or changes in accounting methods. 
Auditor’s review
The auditor’s review is normally a one-page boilerplate somewhere toward
the back of the annual report. This element looks pretty much the same in
every annual report (because the AICPA specifies the format) and also reads
much the same.
The purpose of the auditor’s review is to provide concrete evidence of review
and acceptance of a company’s accounting and financial practices. Financial
procedures are audited (sampled) for correct handling of material and money
flow. Financial reporting practices are reviewed to make sure that information
is being reasonably captured. What is important is identifying exceptions. The
standard auditor’s review is three paragraphs. If the words “qualified” or
“adverse” creep into the third paragraph, or if there’s a fourth paragraph,
watch out.
108
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 
Going long(er)
The Simpson statements only show three years’
worth of operating performance on the income
and cash flow statements. That gives you a pretty
good synopsis of company performance. But
value investors like to look at trends, and many
trends have more significance if looked at over a
longer period of time. So many financial state-
ments, to provide this detail without consuming
tons of paper, will provide a highly summarized
snapshot of key data over a longer period.
Simpson offers a five-year summary. Some com-
panies offer as much as ten years, and many key
figures are available on Value Line or through
other services over a much longer horizon. 

What the Value Investor Looks For
Successful value investors must be able to pull the relevant information out
of financial reports and statements. Chapters 7 and 8 explore the statements
in more detail, while Chapter 9 covers statement quality and raises some of
the tricks and pitfalls in reading statements. Chapter 10 starts the process 
of evaluating a company using financial data, which continues through most of
the rest of the book. At a high level, value investors are looking for five main
things in or from financial statements:
 Intrinsic valuation: Value investors use financial statements as a base to
assess a firm’s intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is a composite sketch of
current net asset value, net worth, and future earnings and growth
potential. More detail comes in Chapter 12.
 Quality: Investor need to assess the quality of the business and the story
around it. Financial statements can provide important clues through their
construction and use of accounting principles. More in Chapter 9.
 Consistency: Financial statements can provide an important record of
consistency, and the more history, the better.
109
Chapter 6: Statements of Fact Part 1: Understanding Financial Statements
The Enron effect
The 2000–2002 dot-com bust and debacles of
giants like Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia Com-
munications, and Qwest led to a large public
and Congressional outcry for more control and
regulation of financial reporting. And it went
beyond the usual public sector and consumer
complaints — the financial industry itself was
rapidly losing credibility and was also in the fray
calling for change. So change happened.
The biggest change was the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, or “SOX,” of 2002, which mandated a much
tighter standard of overall reporting and gover-
nance around that reporting with greater levels
of responsibility for reporting managers. Other
significant actions included the 2004 FASB
Statement 123, requiring expensing of options
and “share-based payment” for employees,
effectively ending this often-excessive off-state-
ment expensing activity. Another was FASB
Statement 132, clearing up pension accounting
and reporting. 
There are more of these adjustments than can
possibly be covered here; suffice it to say that
the overall quality of financial statements has
improved dramatically. There are still plenty of
ways that management can use statement
“flexibility” to influence reporting, but SOX and
public pressure has made “creative account-
ing” more the exception than the rule. 

 Trends: History also shows important trends. Trends and changes in
long-term trends imply vastly different business — and investing —
results. Financial statements help you understand trends and undercur-
rents in profitability, asset utilization, and other factors that may be
leading indicators of new trends.
 Intangibles: Value investors can’t and don’t thrive on numbers alone.
Market position, product quality, customer base, competitive position,
public image, management strength, and similar attributes all function
to protect or enhance future business results. As leading indicators,
these factors can’t be ignored. Financial statements and the reports
companies construct around them, along with press releases and other
communications, provide a body of information vital to the business-
valuation process.

Statements of Fact Part 2: 
The Balance Sheet
In This Chapter
 Reading a balance sheet 
 Understanding assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity
 Using the balance sheet as an investment tool
T
he balance sheet is fundamental to all managers, business analysts,
investors, and anyone else who looks at a company by the numbers. It’s
the first topic covered by most books about financial analysis. This book isn’t
designed to turn you into an accountant or financial analyst, only to make
you familiar with basic concepts and how to use them to achieve investing
objectives.
As Benjamin Graham and David Dodd put it in their master work, Security
Analysis: “On numerous occasions . . . we have expressed our conviction that
the balance sheet deserves more attention than Wall Street has been willing
to accord it for many years.” That bit of wisdom, first espoused in 1934, sets
the tone for this chapter. 
A Question of Balance
As you probably guessed, there is a “balance” in the balance sheet. Something
must equal something else, or it doesn’t balance. There must be an equation,
the sum of one side of which equals the other. 
Yes, a core financial equation (a simple one: no Greek letters, symbols, or
exponents) forms the heart of the balance sheet, indeed the business enter-
prise itself. We’ll begin by going through the equation and discussing the
nature and form of the balance sheet itself.

Balance sheet components
The entire practice of business accounting is based on the relationship
between business resources and their sources. A business resource is an
asset, generally defined as any resource that can be put to use by the busi-
ness to achieve business results: revenue, profit, brand recognition, and 
so on. These assets are acquired and paid for either by borrowing or by a
contribution of funds from the business owners.
So a generalized equation shows this relationship:
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity
Briefly: 
 Assets are the resources available to the business to produce and market
its product or service, including cash, investments, receivables owed by
customers, inventory, buildings, land, equipment, and an assortment of
“intangible” assets necessary to carry on the business. Assets are what a
business owns.
 Liabilities represent the portion of assets financed by others or borrowed,
including short- and long-term borrowings, amounts owed to suppliers
and others. Liabilities are what a business owes.
 Owners’ equity is the portion contributed by the business owners. There
are many names for this: Shareholders’ or stockholders’ equity, net worth,
owner’s capital, and book value are among them. Included in owners’
equity are not only funds contributed directly from shareholders but
also past profits retained in the business known as retained earnings. 
It’s important to reinforce the idea that a balance sheet must balance. That 
is, for every asset dollar, there must be contributed dollars produced by bor-
rowing (increased liabilities) or additional funding by the owners (owners’
equity) to match.
In this chapter, each component of this equation is examined in greater detail,
with an eye for what’s important the value investor.
Taking time into account
A balance sheet is a listing of assets against the liabilities and equity that
fund those assets, taken at a specific point, or snapshot, in time. For invest-
ment and legal reporting purposes, these snapshots are generally taken at
the end of each fiscal quarter and at fiscal year-end.
112
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

A balance sheet is necessarily a consolidation of a vast number of accounts
maintained by the business. That’s a good thing. Investors don’t want to see
the myriad separate accounts that companies set up for each type of physi-
cal asset or inventory for each operating subsidiary in each country. Balance
sheets generally fit on one page.
Making sense of the balance sheet
The balance sheet can be a powerful indicator of business health. It is a static
indicator. That is, it doesn’t tell much about the future of the business and
particularly about future income, but rather more about where the company
has been and how well it did getting to where it is now. 
On a balance sheet, value investors and business analysts look for the 
following: 
 The composition of assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity (lots of inven-
tory and little cash can be a bad sign)
 Trends (increasing debt, decreasing owner’s equity — also bad)
 Quality (do stated values reflect actual values?)
Each of these examinations is done with an eye toward what the figure
probably should be for a company in that line of business. A company like
Starbucks, with frequent small cash sales, shouldn’t have a large accounts
receivable balance. A retailer should have sizeable inventories, but they
shouldn’t be out of line for the industry or category. A semiconductor manu-
facturer has a large capital equipment base, but should depreciate it aggres-
sively to account for technology change. 
To determine whether balance sheet numbers are in line, most analysts apply
specifically defined ratios to the numbers. Ratios serve to draw comparisons
among companies and their industry. By doing so, they show whether perfor-
mance is better or worse than industry peers. We look at the balance sheet
itself in this chapter. Because many ratios involve items found outside the
balance sheet, mostly on the income statement, the discussion of ratio analy-
sis is deferred to Chapter 10. 
A Swift Kick in the Asset
An asset is anything a company uses to conduct its business toward producing
a profit. From an accounting standpoint, an asset must
113
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

 Have value toward producing a return for the business.
 Be in the company’s control. (A leased airplane is still an asset even if
it’s not legally “owned” by the company.)
 Be recordable and have value. (Employees don’t show up as a balance
sheet asset, though they’re frequently referred to as assets by their
CEOs.)
Using Simpson Manufacturing as an example, here’s a short walk through the
asset portion of a balance sheet (see Figure 7-1).
Simpson reports, at the end of its fiscal year 2006 (ending December 31, 2006),
a total of $735.3 million in assets. 
As one may expect for a manufacturer, there are large asset commitments in
inventory ($217.6 million) and in property and equipment ($197.2 million). 
A closer look reveals something called “current assets,” totaling five individ-
ual items at $479.3million. The way this figure is broken down into compo-
nents on the balance sheet is typical. 
Most companies classify assets as current or noncurrent. Current assets, as
the name implies, are short term in nature, actively managed, and directly
tied to a current level of business. Noncurrent assets include longer-term
“fixed” assets and a catchall of other types of assets not always used in 
day-to-day operations.
Current assets
Current assets are items generally held for a year or a business cycle. (If you’re
building a space shuttle, the business cycle, or completion of a deliverable
product, is longer than a year.) 
Here’s a good way to think of current assets: They (especially cash assets) are
the lifeblood of the business, while noncurrent assets are the body through
which they circulate. The lifeblood flows to and from customers, to and from
suppliers, and around to the different locations in the business operation to
produce the greatest possible business and customer benefit. Current assets
are managed by the business pretty much on a daily basis. See Figure 7-1.
Current assets normally include the following:
 Cash and cash equivalents
 Accounts receivable
 Inventory
 Deferred taxes and other temporary asset items

Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

We explore each element in more detail in the following sections. From here
on, refer to Figure 7-1, the condensed version of Simpson’s balance sheet
obtained from Yahoo! Finance. It is typical of what is shown in most financial
portals, and is based on the same set of numbers shown from the Simpson
annual report in Figure 6-1. 
Cash and cash equivalents
For most businesses, cash is the best asset it can have. There’s no question
about its value — cash is cash — and it’s the most useful and flexible asset a
business can have. Cash equivalents, which are short-term marketable secu-
rities with little to no price risk, can be converted to cash at a moment’s
notice and are, for balance sheet purposes, essentially cash. 
Value investors like cash. Cash is security and forms the strongest part of the
“safety net” that value investors seek. Value investors question a cash bal-
ance only if it appears excessive against the needs of the business. If Simpson
had a billion dollars in cash — more than one year of sales — you may ask
why. Could the company not put that cash to work in an investment or acqui-
sition that may return more than the 4 or 5 percent it may get in a bank? And
why isn’t it being returned to shareholders? Most companies don’t retain that
much cash, but occasionally it becomes a value investing red flag.
It’s important to recognize the total picture when companies report high cash
balances. Many companies have large cash or cash equivalent balances for a
while immediately following an initial public offering (IPO). For example, at
the end of the year 1999, Webvan Group had $500 million, well over one
year’s sales. Why? Because they just went public. They just received a huge
contribution of owners’ equity in the form of cash. That’s what an IPO is all
about. That cash is there to be depleted (hence the term “burn rate”), hope-
fully to produce a favorable return. But that scenario, as you know, comes
with a lot of risk. Cash is hardly a safety net in this kind of company; you
need to look at cash differently.
Cash on the balance sheet is great to have, and for most businesses beyond
the IPO situation a cash balance reflects profits received at some point in the
course of business. But for some companies — like banks and other financial
services companies — cash is more like inventory. Banks take in cash and
lend it out to generate profits. A cash snapshot at a given point in time is less
about profits and more about inventory levels carried, and thus isn’t as clear
an indicator of business success or flexibility. 
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable represent funds that are owed to the business, presum-
ably for products delivered or services performed. As individuals, everyone
likes to be owed money — until we’re owed too much money. The same prin-
ciple applies to businesses. 
116
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Accounts receivable are driven by the type of business that a company oper-
ates in. Obviously a small-sale retailer such as Starbucks operates mostly on
cash — you don’t give them an IOU for that double-cream latte, do you? Even
when you charge something, the credit card company pays almost immedi-
ately, leaving perhaps a slight residual in accounts receivable. Most compa-
nies that sell directly to consumers have little to no accounts receivable.
Contrast this to companies that sell to other companies (business-to-business,
or “b-to-b”), or to distributors or retailers in the supply food chain. Most of
this business is done on account, meaning that goods or services are deliv-
ered and invoices are then cut and sent. The billing process creates an
account receivable, which goes away only when the customer pays the bill.
So suppliers to other businesses or through distribution and sales channels
often have significant accounts receivable. 
How much of a company’s asset base should be made up of accounts receiv-
able? U.S. government data suggest that cash businesses such as Starbucks
or grocery stores have 10 percent or less of their asset base in accounts
receivable. Traditional retailers and other “b-to-c” (business-to-consumer)
companies have 20 percent to 30 percent or more in receivables if they pro-
vide credit through their own credit card. Equipment manufacturers and
other b-to-b concerns sometimes carry receivables of 50 percent or more of
total assets.
For most “b-to-b” industries, accounts receivable are a part of doing business
and, in a sense, a cost of doing business (cash is forgone to give the customer
time to pay). The question is how much commitment to accounts receivable
is necessary to support the business? You should be aware of situations in
which companies aren’t collecting on their bills or are using accounts receiv-
able to create credit incentives for otherwise questionable customers to buy
their product. 
To assign value to accounts receivable, pay attention to the following:
 The size of accounts receivable relative to sales and other assets: Is a
company extending itself too much to sustain or grow the business?
Ratios (covered in Chapter 10) help measure this, and industry compar-
isons and common sense dictate the answer.
 Trend: Is the company continuously owed more and more, with poten-
tially greater and greater exposure to nonpayment? Look at historical
accounts receivable and compare them to sales.
 Quality of accounts receivable: Typically, most companies collect on
more than 95 percent of their accounts receivable balances, and thus
they’re almost as good as cash. But if accounts receivable balances grow
and particularly if large reserves show up on the income statement
(“allowance for doubtful accounts” or similar), this is a red flare not to
be missed. Unfortunately, most investors don’t see information on indi-
vidual creditors nor can they assess their credit-worthiness.
117
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

Some financial statements show “notes receivable” as a separate balance
sheet item under current assets. Notes receivable are essentially a special
form of accounts receivable — a promissory note for a significant sum
extended to a specific firm for a specific reason. For the most part, these
should be treated like normal accounts receivable, but it may be worth a
quick glance at the note holder and the terms of the note. For example, a note
granted by Boeing to a weak or bankrupt airline may be cause for concern. 
Inventory
Inventory can be a critical, make-or-break asset and factor in company valua-
tion. Companies live and die by their ability to effectively manage inventory.
Inventory is all valued material procured by a business and resold, with or
without value add, to a customer. Retail inventory consists of goods bought,
warehoused, and sold through stores. Manufacturing inventory consists of raw
material, work in process, and finished goods inventory awaiting shipment.
For most companies, the key to successfully managing inventory is to match
it as closely as possible to sales. That is, the faster that procured inventory
can be processed and sold, the better. More sales are generated per dollar
tied up in inventory. Dollars tied up in inventory cost money because they
could be invested elsewhere in the business. 
Measuring inventory
Measuring the size of inventory assets is often done by measuring turnover.
Turnover is simply annual sales divided by the dollar amount of the asset on
the books. If sales are $500 million a year and inventory on the books is $100
million, inventory turnover is 5 times a year. Another way to look at it: The
average item of inventory is on the books for about 2.4 months (12 ÷ 5). Some
would represent that figure as “months’ sales in inventory,” or “months of
supply.” The greater the turnover, the more efficient the utilization of that
asset. Turnover ratios naturally vary by industry. For example, Starbucks
turns over inventory much faster than Boeing. 
Moreover, inventory carries with it a significant risk of obsolescence. Changes
in demand patterns, technology, or the nature of the product itself can cause
valued inventory to rapidly lose value. The most extreme example of obsoles-
cence risk is newspapers, where an inventory of today’s latest edition becomes
almost 100 percent worthless at the stroke of midnight. But almost any other
type of inventory carries obsolescence risk, as few inventories are worth 100
percent of their purchase price or anywhere near it.
Incidentally, accounts receivable are another asset that can, and often are,
measured by turnover. You may choose to measure it as “days’ sales in
receivables.” A company with a normal 30-day billing cycle that has 45 days’
sales in receivables has a problem. 
118
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Valuing inventory
Valuing an inventory asset can be challenging. Companies don’t provide
much information about their inventories. About as far as you’ll normally get
is a breakdown of how much inventory is in “finished goods” and “purchased
parts and fabricated assemblies,” and even that is buried deep in the 10-K
(the 10-K is discussed in Chapter 6). The value investor knows little about
what those inventories really are or about their real value. A warehouse of
outdated Pentium III computer processors probably carries a book inventory
value, but they aren’t worth much to the company or anyone else.
Inventory valuation is further affected by accounting methods employed by a
firm. The method affects both balance sheet carrying value and cost recogni-
tion on the income statement. Mainly the choices are “first in, first out”
(FIFO) and “last in, first out” (LIFO), meaning that a company assigns either
the earliest stocked goods or the latest stocked goods to a sale. In a normal
environment in which costs increase over time, LIFO will result in a more con-
servative view of earnings and inventory balances — the more expensive
items are assumed to be consumed first. (This approach may not work in
technology companies, where more recently purchased components are actu-
ally cheaper — LIFO may be less conservative!) 
The FIFO versus LIFO decision is documented in annual report notes, usually
Note 1, significant accounting policies. Under normal circumstances, you
probably don’t need to be too concerned about this, unless industry price
instability or inflation becomes a big factor. Also watch for accounting policy
changes, which can be used to hide or inflate performance.
Further refining the reported value of inventory is the decision to carry at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is as implied — what the material cost in the first
place. LIFO or FIFO affects the cost carried. But the most conservative inven-
tory valuation practice is to carry at market, which is what the company thinks
the market value of its inventory is on the resale market. Normally this comes
closer to a true valuation for the inventory, but it depends on the company’s
assessment and the recency of that assessment. Most companies carry at the
lower of cost or market, but again, look for valuation practice in the notes
section.
Investors should keep an eye on inventory balances for economic value and
efficiency of use. Look at the size of the asset in an absolute sense and rela-
tive to the size and sales of the business. Look for trends, favorable and unfa-
vorable, in inventory balances and ratios. Look at competitors and industry
standards. Where possible, look at inventory quality and past track record
for inventory obsolescence and resulting write-offs. And then be conserva-
tive. It often makes sense to assign a value of 50 percent to 75 percent, some-
times less, to inventory values appearing on a balance sheet.
119
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

As in most other aspects of value investing, it is important to know something
about the industry when assigning value to balance sheet assets. Suppose
you’re an investor in bookseller Borders Group. You may be alarmed by the
$1.4 billion in merchandise inventories carried on the Borders Group balance
sheet, a figure that’s more than half of the total assets with fewer than three
turns per year ($4.1 billion in sales). But a closer look at the book industry
reveals a special case: Booksellers are entitled to return nearly all inventory
to publishers for 100 percent credit! Booksellers need to stock even the slow
movers to get people into the stores, so publishers realize this and have 
created this policy to get their inventory onto the shelves. So although the
Borders book inventory is large and requires significant cash tie-up, it carries
with it far less risk of obsolescence and future write-offs than many of its
retailing brethren. Know thy business and know thy industry.
Deferred taxes and other current assets
Most balance sheets contain small amounts for other items carried on the
books. “Deferred taxes” is an item that appears frequently and results from
timing differences between financial reporting and tax reporting requirements.
120
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 
Dreaded diamonds
Or, “When diamonds (hopefully) aren’t forever”
Business and inventory cycles can wreak havoc
on inventory and inventory valuations. Some
classic 2000–2002 headlines came from this phe-
nomenon, such as Cisco Systems’ $2.5 billion
dollar write-off of raw materials in the quarter
ending April 2001. In late 2000, as demand
swelled for its products, and deliveries were fre-
quently missed, the company decided to grab
the bull by the horns and stock up on compo-
nents so as not to miss future sales and lose
customers to competitors. The business cycle
turned, and on top of that, many of the orders on
the books were probably superfluous anyway,
with customers rushing to get their orders in to
make sure that they got their product in a tight
supply environment. The business turn plus can-
cellation of some of the order backlog reduced
the need for raw materials, and combined with
technology shifts, the stockpile rapidly lost
value. Inventory managers call this cycle the
“dreaded diamond” — exaggerated demand on
the up portion of the business cycle causes
overordering and overstocking, and then once
the demand slows on the down cycle, the down-
turn is further exacerbated by the cancellation
of overzealous orders. Technological obsoles-
cence makes technology companies particu-
larly vulnerable to inventory cycles. You must
recognize business cycles and watch for inven-
tories growing out of proportion to sales. Many
value investors avoid tech altogether because
of inconsistency and the inability to predict the
future. However, it should be added that compa-
nies have generally gotten better at managing
inventories and anticipating these cycles, and
less of this is seen today. That said, as 2008
unfolds, homebuilders are seeing some of the
same kinds of “dreaded diamonds” in their
industry.

It is essentially estimated taxes paid before a tax liability is actually deter-
mined. For the most part, you shouldn’t worry about these items; seldom 
do they comprise more than 5 percent of stated assets. 
Bolted to the floor: Fixed assets 
The balance sheet entry called “property, plant, and equipment” (PP&E) is
pretty clear from the name. It refers to the fixed assets — land, buildings,
machinery, fixtures, office technology, and similar items owned by the firm
for productive use. Depending on the industry, this item may have a different
name. Retail stores, for example, don’t have “plants,” but may have distribu-
tion centers. 
Valuation of PP&E can vary widely. The key to understanding PP&E value is
to understand depreciation. Depreciation is an amount subtracted each year
by accountants from an asset purchase price for normal wear and tear and
technological obsolescence. Depreciation methods are discussed further
under the next heading, but for now it’s important to note that depreciation
can affect underlying asset values substantially. Further changing the picture
can be a company’s decision to value at lower of cost or market value. As for
other accounts, the accounting method is disclosed in the statements under
the notes entry.
The value of property, plant, and equipment, of course, can vary a lot by
what it is, where it is, and how it’s used. These in turn vary by industry and
things specific to the company itself, like its location. A Bessemer converter
probably has a smaller market value compared to its purchase price than a
modern semiconductor wafer fabrication machine. An old building in down-
town Syracuse probably has less value than a new building in Santa Clara,
California. 
Although most PP&E items are subject to depreciation charges, land is not. Is
the value of land overstated on the books? Hardly. Land is normally carried at
purchase or acquisition value. This affords a unique value investing opportu-
nity. Land purchased in the 1940s or 1950s is often worth much more today
than back then, but it is seldom reflected in the books. Consider railroads,
with vast ownership of downtown lands and land grants in the West, mostly
from over 100 years ago. If one realized the value of these holdings (less the
cost of an occasional environmental cleanup), the value of these investments
may increase enormously. (Is this why Warren Buffett has been buying rail-
roads recently?) There may be some real hidden gems lurking below the 
balance sheets of railroad, timber, mining, and certain old-line industrial 
corporations. But realize that land isn’t always a hidden gem — the home-
building industry has suffered from too much of it acquired at excessive
“boom” prices. 
121
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

Understanding the nature of a corporation’s PP&E and its depreciation meth-
ods will help in assessing the value of this account. Generally, value investors
assign very conservative values to PP&E (unless a lot of land is involved): 
50 percent or less.
Appreciating depreciation
Depreciation is a methodic reduction of PP&E asset value with assignment of
a corresponding dollar amount to a period expense — an expense recorded
for a reporting period. As the name implies, depreciation represents an
accounting treatment of normal wear and obsolescence on productive assets.
When companies buy a capital asset, usually a purchase greater than $1,000,
they don’t record the entire cost as an expense in the year purchased. Instead,
they gradually recognize the cost as expense in subsequent years through
depreciation. At the end of the depreciation cycle (in theory at least), it is
time to make another capital outlay, replace the asset, and start the cycle all
over again.
There are a variety of accepted methods for assigning depreciation dollars. A
detailed discussion of depreciation and depreciation methods is CPA stuff
well beyond the scope of this book. You may find it useful to recognize two
major methods for assigning depreciation dollars: straight-line and acceler-
ated depreciation.
Straight-line depreciation is just as the name implies: Each year an equal amount
of asset value is expensed until the asset value reaches zero. 
Accelerated depreciation methods allow the accountant to expense propor-
tionately more in the early years of asset life. Accelerated methods include
“sum of the years’ digits” and “double declining balance.” The details of these
methods can be found in most accounting books and aren’t important here,
only the effects.
Effect of depreciation on income and asset quality
Acceleration and the corresponding increase in expense — reduction in
reported profit — serve the purpose of reducing taxes in early years. With
the time value of money (see Chapter 4), that’s a good thing. Accelerated
depreciation also results in more conservative PP&E asset valuations on the
books. It also may better reflect reality — because of obsolescence, that
semiconductor fab machine, like your new car in the driveway, probably
loses relatively more market value in the first few years.
What you should consider
The choice of depreciation methods is important. Accelerated depreciation
results in the most conservative PP&E asset valuations. It also results in the
most conservative view of earnings and allows more room for future net earn-
ings growth, because you can assume that a greater portion of depreciation
is behind you.
122
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

But some companies may deliberately prop up current earnings by employ-
ing straight-line methods. Watch for companies changing over to straight-line
from accelerated methods. Depreciation methods are disclosed in the notes
section of the statements.
Depreciation is an accounting — not a cash — expense. No check is cut 
for depreciation. Instead, the check is cut when the asset is purchased.
Depreciation is the leading difference between stated earnings and cash 
flows and can mean the difference between survival and failure for a com-
pany recording net income losses. Cash flow, unburdened by depreciation,
may still be positive. But look out below. Cash consumed to keep a losing
business afloat may not be available the next time a key piece of equipment
needs to be replaced. Reporting methods that downplay depreciation or
ignore it altogether, such as “pro forma” or “EBITDA” reporting, indicate 
trouble. For more on this issue, see Chapter 9.
Investments: Companies are investors, too
Besides more liquid marketable securities, many companies commit surplus
cash to more substantial long-term investments. These investments can serve
many purposes: to achieve returns as any other investor would, to partici-
pate in the growth of a related or unrelated industry, or to eventually obtain
control of the company. Favorable tax treatment of dividends and gains
makes investing in other companies still more attractive, as exemplified in
extremis by Berkshire Hathaway (see Chapter 3).
There are a lot of good reasons for companies to invest in other companies.
Accepting investments as payment for goods and services rendered is proba-
bly not one of them. This practice became rather fashionable in the Internet
boom, as companies freely paid for products and services bought from other
companies with their shares. When their shares became almost worthless,
well, you know the rest of the story. Watch also for technology companies
making investments in startups as a way of fostering business or directing
purchases their way. 
There are many ways to value investments, boiling down basically to histori-
cal cost or market valuation, sometimes referred to as “mark-to-market” 
valuation. 
Market valuation is obviously better. Although investment value is disclosed
in the 10-K (discussed in Chapter 6), you need to read carefully to find a
statement such as, “. . . as of xx/xx/xx these securities were recorded at an
estimated fair value of $328M with a cost basis of $176M . . . gross unrealized
gains were $216M and gross unrealized losses were $64M. . . .” Such a state-
ment gives you a fair idea that the company is ahead on its investments.
Watch out for declining fair values and particularly for large gross unrealized
losses — future write-offs and asset value impairment loom large.
123
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

Gauge the size of investments on the balance sheet, look for detail, and
understand management’s intent in making the investments.
Soft assets
Asset valuation gets really interesting for the value investor when the discus-
sion turns to intangibles, also sometimes referred to as “soft” assets.
Intangibles are assets that don’t have a physical presence but are critical in
acquiring and maintaining sales and producing a competitive edge. Intangibles
include patents, copyrights, franchises, brand names, and trademarks. Also
included is the all-encompassing goodwill often acquired by acquiring (and
sometimes overpaying for) other companies. 
Placing a financial value on these ethereal marketing assets is difficult, but
accountants must and do. If there is an historical cost, accountants may
carry the intangible at that cost. This is often the case with “goodwill” from
company acquisitions. 
Valuing intangibles
The key to assessing intangible assets is to understand (1) their carrying
value and (2) their composition. Most important is to understand the source
of goodwill — from acquisitions, from patents, or what? 
Before 2001, companies were required to amortize goodwill from acquisi-
tions, but that changed in the middle of that year. Companies are no longer
required to amortize it, but to review it for “impairment” — loss of value —
each year (FASB No. 142). Unfortunately, it’s hard as an investor to determine
whether you agree with a company’s decision on impairment, which takes
you back to knowing where the goodwill came from in the first place. You
may have to dig through “Notes” in the annual or 10-K report to find out. 
Intangibles are subject to a great deal of discretion in their accounting, and
their sources and form can be numerous and highly variable from one com-
pany to the next. Cast a skeptical eye on large goodwill accounts in particular.
Companies with aggressive acquisition strategies can be a value investor’s
nightmare, particularly where large amounts of goodwill and other intangibles
are involved. Consider telecommunications flameout Lucent Technologies,
which reported acquiring 10 major companies and 11 more small ones in the
years 1998 through 2000. In the year 2000 alone, acquired intangibles reflected
on the balance sheet went from $960 million to $9.945 billion, a tenfold
increase. Add to that a major divestiture (Avaya) and a host of patents and
other intangibles from the former Bell Labs, and you have a valuation night-
mare. Cisco Systems reported a similar tenfold increase in acquisition good-
will to over $4 billion during that period. The best advice is to stick to
simplicity.
124
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Intangibles and investing
The classical school of value investing suggested deducting intangibles from
company valuation altogether. In Ben Graham’s day (see Chapter 3), intangi-
bles were subtracted directly from book value. They were considered fluff,
and a conservative valuation would remove them completely. In many cases
where a company simply overpays to acquire another company, this is still
true. But with the advent of modern technology and marketing, the ideas of
intellectual capital and brand equity are part of a company’s value and
cannot simply be ignored. 
In fact, for some companies, these intangibles may represent their greatest
value. What is the value of the Coca-Cola Company without the Coke recipe
and brand name? Or the value of Microsoft without its lock on PC operating
systems? Such brands and locks often ultimately produce the best profit
streams and best value. 
An asset assimilation
By way of recap, here are a few more tidbits and resources.
Four score and a million bucks ago
The single statement that best characterizes the nature of assets and impor-
tance of their scrutiny came from Ben Graham himself, in the book Security
Analysis, “The liabilities are real, but the value of assets must be questioned.”
This statement is the Gettysburg Address of balance sheet valuation. Aside
from cash and equivalents, asset values, although not as much as in years
past, are still somewhat subject to a company’s accounting philosophy and
practice. Valuation of liabilities, on the other hand, is not subject to manage-
ment control. You owe someone a buck, you owe them a buck. 
The prudent investor tries to “peel back the onion” to get a better grip on
asset and thus on company value. This requires a deeper look at financial
statements and the accompanying notes, and knowledge of industries and
industry competitors. Of course, it’s a trade-off: Too much peeling back of the
onion results in teary, weary eyes. This stuff is complex, and deriving mean-
ing can take hours, if indeed it’s possible at all. In business, it often seems
that the more you know, the more you don’t know. Eventually, you’ll get good
at recognizing where benefits of knowing deep intrinsic values aren’t worth
the cost of acquiring it. It’s often easier to just leave behind companies that
are too complex to understand.
And finally, remember to look at three defining characteristics of any asset:
size, trend, and quality.

Assigning value to assets
Table 7-1 is useful as a simple reference to convert reported asset values to
liquidating value, a conservative base for intrinsic valuation. The basis for
this table comes straight from Graham and Dodd’s Security Analysis.
Professionals may use evolved versions, but this table is still a handy tool.

Does the Company Owe Money?
The preceding section identifies business resources in place (on the books 
at least) to produce income. Now it’s time to identify where these resources
come from. Recall that assets = liabilities + owners’ equity. Now it’s time 
to take a look at the right side of the enterprise equation to identify what a 
company owes and what it owns free and clear, and what it all means to you.
As Ben Graham’s quote suggests, assessing liabilities is fairly straightforward.
Although different things can be done to state asset values differently, we
know of no creditors that afford the same opportunity to liabilities. If you
owe, you owe. The effect on a company’s intrinsic value is straightforward.
126
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Current liabilities
Like assets, liabilities come in two basic flavors: current and long term. Current
liabilities are just as implied: liabilities for which payment is due normally in
less than a year. As a personal analogy, your monthly credit card, any other
monthly bill, or a monthly payment on a longer-term debt like an installment
loan, are short-term liabilities, while your 30-year mortgage is a long-term liabil-
ity. The portion of that mortgage you pay every month is a current liability,
found on the statements as the current portion of long-term debt due.
Payables
Almost everyone, whether an individual or a corporation, has payables,
defined as money owed to others for products purchased or services ren-
dered. The liability is created when the service or product arrives; a cash
payment follows to discharge the liability. Nearly all companies maintain a
regular balance of current accounts payable, interest payable, and the like. If
payment is received in advance, as with a deposit, the unearned portion is
tracked as a liability. Sometimes contingent liabilities may be recorded, as in
warranty claims expected to be paid but not yet actualized.
Payables and value investing
In personal finance, everyone wants to reduce or eliminate current payables.
Books, TV shows, and personal finance experts all advocate getting out of
debt. And for the most part they’re right. Liabilities represent diminished
worth and, with prevailing interest rates, can be quite expensive.
But in corporate finance, the approach is a little different, and the mood has
been shifting. Brought on in part by reduced interest costs and in part by
enormously successful business models such as Dell Computer, trying to
reduce liabilities — at least short-term liabilities — to zero is no longer in
vogue. Why? Because companies like Dell can run their day-to-day business
on someone else’s money. And because most accounts payable come with a
30-day pay period, Dell and others have realized that “someone else’s money,”
in this case, can be had virtually for free. And here’s the bottom line: It takes
relatively small equity capital requirements from the owners to support the
business, producing a relatively high return on equity invested for those
owners.
So value investors don’t need to take much note of current liabilities other
than perhaps to spot large changes or trends. Investors should also realize
that current liabilities aren’t necessarily a bad thing and can result in higher
effective returns on ownership capital with relatively low cost and risk.
127
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

Long-term liabilities
Long-term corporate liabilities are really no different than those found in per-
sonal finances: They represent contracted commitments to pay back a sum of
money over time with interest. For the individual, they come in the form of
loans and mortgages; for the corporation, they occur more often in the form
of tradable notes and bonds. 
Debt and the value investor
Like short-term liabilities, you don’t need to look too closely at the quality of
these liabilities, or even the amount if reasonable by previous company or
industry standards. Trends can be important, however. Increased reliance on
long-term debt may be a sign of trouble. The company may not be making
ends meet and may be having trouble raising capital from existing or poten-
tial owners — never a good sign. 
In addition, a company constantly changing, restructuring, or otherwise tin-
kering with long-term debt may be sending tacit trouble signals. The com-
pany may be seeking concessions from lenders behind the scenes. In any
event, attention paid to this kind of activity diverts attention from the core
business, which is not a good thing and a warning flag for value investors.
How much is too much?
Finally, excessive use of debt signals potential danger if things don’t turn out
the way a company expects them to. Leverage is a good thing when things
are going a company’s way. Debt financing can be used to produce more
product for more markets and thus more profit and, in the end, a bigger busi-
ness. Return to owners is proportionately higher: Their investment stays the
same while the returns grow. But as everyone knows, this can work the other
way. Value investors don’t like surprises, and a company with uncertain
prospects and a lot of debt may not make it onto their list. Industry stan-
dards and common sense apply to debt-to-equity ratios.
And Now, Meet the Owners
Because you’re contemplating making an investment in a company, isn’t
owners’ equity the most important balance sheet item? You and other
investors, in essence, are either directly or indirectly contributing capital
that is in turn converted into an asset, which is then converted into revenue
and profit to produce a return to the owner. You’re making a decision to allo-
cate capital to a company that in turn does the best job allocating capital to
endeavors that produce the best return. 
128
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Like liabilities, the owners’ equity portion of the balance sheet is critical to a
company’s function, but it requires relatively little scrutiny on your part. The
following short tour avoids the tedious discussions of classes of stock, par
value, and so forth that burden so many finance readers. For this discussion,
owners’ equity consists of two things: paid-in capital, a fancy word for stock,
and retained earnings.
Paid-in capital
Paid-in capital represents the total value paid into the company by its 
owners — its shareholders. It gets a little complicated with the discussion 
of par value and “additional” paid-in capital. Total paid-in capital represents
capital actually paid into the company at initial or subsequent company
stock sales and has nothing to do with market price or market value. In and
of itself, you need to pay little attention to this item.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings are profits from past operating periods that are reinvested,
or “retained,” in the business. Technically speaking, company profits belong
to the shareholders, but it is the management’s prerogative to decide whether
to actually pay them out. Typically, managers think that they can invest the
money more effectively than their shareholders, while shareholders investing
in those companies are betting that they’re right.
So long as a company’s business is viable, shareholders probably want to see
retained earnings as high as possible. It’s a capital allocation game — the
earnings are better suited to that company’s purpose than anywhere else. By
investing in the company, you’ve already decided that, so you may as well
keep your money on the table. 
So generally, more is better, especially if accompanied by a reasonable 
dividend policy in which management is sharing some of the spoils with the
owners. On the other hand, watch for rapidly declining or, worse, negative
retained earnings balances. Negative retained earnings are an almost sure
sign of trouble, usually brought on by asset values declining faster than
expected, excessive debt, an overinflated stock offering price, or a combina-
tion of the three. As a value investor, you should view negative retained 
earnings as a bright red signal flare.
129
Chapter 7: Statements of Fact Part 2: The Balance Sheet

Paging through book value
Owners’ equity is the sum of paid-in capital and retained earnings. (There can
be a few other small crumbs of ownership, but they’re seldom significant.) 
In theory, this is also the book value of a company — the actual net value as
determined by the company’s accounting for its business. The book value is
the net of assets (which it can value and report with a degree of latitude), and
liabilities (which occur at face value). Thus, book value reporting is done with
a degree of latitude. Value investors talk about three different book value
measures:
 Book value is owners’ equity, or total book assets less liabilities.
 Tangible book value is total book value less all or part of intangibles.
 Book value per share is the stated book value divided by the number of
common shares outstanding.
All three of these measures crop up in value investing discussions and papers,
but be careful because sometimes they’re used interchangeably.
If you want a detailed assessment of book value, you can do your homework
by applying asset valuation formulas presented earlier. A little less tedious
approach is one used by Buffett and others: Don’t get hung up on the absolute
book value because you could go crazy trying to assess it with the information
provided. Rather, looking at trends and changes in book value may be easier
and better. You may also find it useful to examine stated book values relative
to business activity and compare with the industry and competitors.
Book in, intrinsic out
Warren Buffett put it all together nicely. He observed that book value is the
sum of what investors put into (or leave in) the business, while intrinsic value
is what investors can take out of the business. Book value or net worth as dis-
cussed in this chapter is a key component of a company’s intrinsic value. But
another and perhaps more important component of intrinsic value is the net
present and future income stream that a company can earn for the investor.
Chapter 8 takes a closer look at income and income reporting, Once all the
pieces are in place, intrinsic valuation is discussed in greater depth in
Chapter 12 and beyond.

Just as life cannot be measured or evaluated by a single snapshot, neither
can a business. Chapter 7 presents a fixed-in-time snapshot of business
life: the balance sheet. This snapshot gives a view of business resources
(assets) and how they are contributed to the business (liabilities and owner’s
equity). But what about the business activity that happens between snap-
shots? What went on between each release of the shutter? Sure, a compari-
son of one snapshot to another tells you something changed, just as
sequential vacation snapshots show different family members in different
places. But what happened between shots, and why?
This is where earnings and cash flow statements come in. The balance sheet
is critical in evaluating the financial state of a business; the income and cash
flow statements together measure business activity and results. Earnings and
cash flow statements show the pulse of the business and explain changes in
balance sheet snapshots. With these statements, the business analyst or
investor can assemble a complete moving picture showing flows into and out
of the business, successes and failures, growth and decline.
Consistent with the style used in the previous chapters, this chapter sticks to
what you need to know as an investor, avoiding deep accounting technicalities. 

The Importance of Earnings
It’s hardly necessary to remind anyone of the underpinning of a capitalist
society and economy, which is that business and economic activity are
undertaken with the idea of generating a profit. Profit is simply the gross 
revenue of an enterprise, minus the cost of producing that income, over a
defined period of time. For businesses, it’s important to measure the profit
and allocate capital resources in such a way as to maximize it. 
Earnings make the world go round
So much is made of earnings and earnings reports. Do you hear much about a
company’s cash balance, accumulated depreciation, or owner’s equity during
Nightly Business Report and other financial shows? Does everyone salivate four
times a year for “asset season?” No, but there’s a definite “earnings season” at
the end of each calendar quarter, giving financial analysts, journalists, and
pundits plenty to talk about.
On an ongoing basis, earnings are the driving force and “macro” indicator of a
company’s success. If earnings are growing, the financial press doesn’t worry
much about the other stuff. Conversely, serve up a couple of double faults on
the earnings front, and everybody is all over asset impairment, write-offs, debt,
weak cash positions, and the other similar “disasters.”
In the purest sense, long-term stock price appreciation is based on the growth
of a company’s asset base and owner’s equity in that base. Ultimately, that
comes from earnings. If a company is earning money, and particularly if it
earns it at a growing rate, that’s a good thing. As Warren Buffett says, “If the
business does well, the stock always follows.”
Earnings tell us how well a business manages its operations, while the balance
sheet tells us how well it manages its resources. 
Bottom lines and other lines
You hear a lot about the bottom line, which refers to the net earnings or income
after all expenses, taxes, and extraordinary items are factored in. The bottom
line is the final “net” measure of all business activity. 
Other important lines in the earnings statement reveal key factors and trends
in the business. You’ll see these lines, or items, in various forms on financial
statements, depending on the statement and sometimes the industry. Among
the important ones are the following: 
132
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

 Gross profit: This is simply the sales less the direct cost of producing
the company’s product or service. Direct cost includes labor, material,
and expenses directly attributable to producing it. Gross profit, often
called gross margin, is the purest indicator of business profitability,
because each cost dollar is directly generated by production and sale of
the product. Value investors closely watch gross margin trends as an
indicator of market dominance, price control, and future profitability.
 Operating income: This term refers to gross profit less period expenses,
such as overhead or marketing costs not directly attributable to product
production. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) usually
cover all headquarters functions, information technology, marketing, and
other indirect costs. It generally excludes financing costs, such as inter-
est, and taxes. Amortization is usually included, because cost recovery
for property, plant, and equipment is part of operating expense. Items
deemed extraordinary are not included. Operating profit gives a more
complete picture of how the business is performing on a day-to-day
basis. It sometimes appears as operating income, earnings from opera-
tions, or similar.
 Net income: This represents the net result of all revenues, expenses,
interest, and taxes.
There are other supplemental earnings measures, such as free cash flow and
“EBITDA,” which are discussed later in this chapter. The point is that there
are many ways to measure income. Each reveals an important layer of busi-
ness performance, both for determining intrinsic value and also for compar-
ing companies. 
Cash flow
You’re probably wondering just what is the difference is between earnings and
cash flow? After all, companies don’t earn Starbucks cards, they earn money.
Why do companies have two different statements?
Good question. The answer: The realization of accounting earnings may occur
at different times from the actual receipt of cash. 
The main differences arise from accrual accounting and from depreciation
and other noncash amortizations and adjustments. A dollar earned today
may not be collected until tomorrow, and a dollar earned today as cash may
be diminished as earnings by a noncash amortization of an asset. Mainly, it’s
timing — although the time difference, especially with a long-lived fixed
asset, can be years. 
133
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements

The number one guiding principle for all accounting and finance folks is to
measure the business activity as closely as possible to what really occurs —
what is produced and sold and paid for — in the business. Doing so accurately
and informatively means tracking both accounting and cash flows into and out
of the business.
Accrual and unusual punishment
Accrual accounting sounds scary, but what it really does is divorce the busi-
ness activity from its corresponding receipt or disbursement of cash. If you
build a machine and sell it to another company in April but don’t receive pay-
ment until June, in which month should you recognize the production cost
and sale? Accrual accounting says in April, while cash basis accounting says
in June. Accrual accounting is the most accurate reflection of the business
activity. In this example, labor, material, and overhead were purchased in April
to build the machine, and it was sold during that month. Assuming that the
cash is eventually collected, accrual accounting measures the profit of the busi-
ness on the sale and costs incurred in April. So because of accrual accounting,
the timing of cash flows versus the recognition of revenue, expense, and earn-
ings may be different.
Amortized to death
Likewise, depreciation and amortization are accounting transactions designed
to recover the cost of large cash outlays for property, plant, and equipment,
and sometimes other costs. The large cash outlay happens once, and it may
be years before the expense is recognized. Amortizations are noncash trans-
actions; they’re simply recognition of a portion of an asset value as an expense
during a period. So, to simply illustrate the difference between cash and
accounting flows for amortization, if net income is $50,000 but there is also a
$20,000 amortization expense recognized in the same period, all things being
equal, how much cash did the business take in? The answer: $70,000. 
To summarize the difference between earnings and cash flow statements:
 Earnings statements measure business activity as it occurs, regardless
of cash flow, and including noncash amortization and other transactions.
 Cash flow statements specifically track the movement of cash into and
out of the company. This cash flows into and out of the “cash and mar-
ketable securities” item on the balance sheet.
What to look for
Used by investors of all kinds, earnings statements are among the most
widely examined of company publications. Even the most short-term trader
trades in anticipation of earnings announcements, compares net income with
projections, and trades on the result. Investors look at the top line (revenue
134
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

or sales) and the bottom line. For value investors, earnings statements are
indispensable, and most will take a much more in-depth look at the underly-
ing numbers, trends, and history. 
The following sections highlight important attributes to look for in an earn-
ings statement.
Growth
After all is said and done, the long-term growth of a stock price is driven 
by growth in the business. Growth in the business means growth in the 
earnings — there is no other way to sustain business growth without infu-
sions of additional owner capital. Sure, you can acquire, merge, or sell more
stock to make a business larger by common definitions, but has the business
really “grown”? 
The value investor works to obtain a deep understanding of business growth,
growth trends, and the quality of growth. Is reported growth based on inter-
nal core competencies? Or is it acquired or speculative growth based on
unproven ventures? The value investor assesses growth and growth patterns,
judges the validity of growth reported, and attempts to project the future.
A business’ ability to grow on its own, through its own success and resulting
earnings, is known as organic growth. Growth through acquisition or other
capital infusions is not “organic” and thus does not suggest growth in true
business value. 
Consistency
Long-term growth should be sustainable and consistent. Look for sustained
growth across business cycles. A big pop in earnings one year followed by
malaise for the next two does not paint a pretty picture. Long, consistent,
successful earnings track records get the A grades. 
Beyond earnings, consistency is a desired feature for other parts of the earn-
ings statement. Consistency in sales and sales growth, profit margins and
margin growth, and operating expense and expense trends is highly prized.
The less consistency, the more difficult to predict the future five or ten years
and beyond, and the less attractive a company looks to value investors.
Healthy components: Comparative and trends
Value investors look at individual lines in the earnings statement, not just the
bottom line. Improving gross margins — especially sustained improvement —
signal strong business improvement. Costs are under control, and the com-
pany is improving its market position. Likewise, improving operating margins
can show better cost control, greater efficiency, and rewards from earlier
expansion cycles. And value investors constantly compare companies in 
135
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements

similar industries. Gross margins of competing computer manufacturers, for
instance, tell a lot about who has the best market position, production and
delivery process, and business model.
Comparing the incomparable is an all-too-common investing pitfall. With
earnings statements, this error takes three forms:
 Earnings statements are not always broken down the same way.
Although the bottom line is the bottom line, the intermediate steps may
be different. One company’s operating earnings may include marketing
costs, while another’s may not. Typically statements from firms in the
same industry are comparable, but not always.
 Two companies that appear (and even are classified) in the same indus-
try may have differences large enough to raise caution. Commercial
and industrial suppliers, such as Honeywell, have consumer divisions,
while consumer businesses, such as Procter & Gamble, have industrial
divisions. Many businesses supply a mix of products in a mix of cate-
gories to a mix of customers. “Pure plays” in a business or industry are
not always easy to find. The upshot: You must understand businesses
before comparing them. 
 Numbers may include extraordinary items. Before comparing operat-
ing or net profit numbers, consider whether there have been write-offs
for discontinued businesses or impaired assets that may be causing 
one-time distortions in the numbers. 
Quality
As Wall Street exerts ever-increasing pressure on companies to perform to a
stringent set of expectations, the idea of accounting “stretch” enters the pic-
ture. Even in complying with the rules, companies have latitude to apply
accounting principles in ways that make performance look better. Later in
this chapter and in Chapter 9, we explore how this latitude can affect the
quality of earnings reports, although recent legislation and standardizations,
like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discussed in Chapters 6 and 9, have brought
financial reporting generally more in line with reality.
Exploring the Earnings Statement
In this section, we explore a specific income statement and take it apart to
explore its components. We continue with the example provided by building
products supplier Simpson Manufacturing. Note the naming flexibility: The
earnings statement is presented as a Consolidated Statement of Operations in
the annual report, and here in Figure 8-1 as a condensed Income Statement
from Yahoo! Finance.

Don’t fall off the cyclical
Always be wary of cyclical stocks. True, com-
panies such as Caterpillar or Deere may look
irresistible with low price to earnings (P/E)
ratios and high short-term sales and earnings
growth rates. But a closer look at the long term
reveals a P/E in the teens and years of marginal
earnings or even losses mixed in. Look at the
long term and be aware of stocks that dip as the
business cycle dips. Basic industries, such as
capital equipment, natural resources, paper,
farm machinery, automobiles, and auto suppli-
ers, are notorious for sending signals of inter-
mittent strength while showing little in the way
of sustained growth. The recent tanking of
homebuilding stocks is an extreme case in
point. It is amazing how many short-term-ori-
ented investors bit on the apparent “value” in
this sector!

Starting at the top line
Sales or revenues make up the top line of any business. Normally, sales and
revenues are straightforward. They represent accounting dollars generated
for business products sold or services performed. (Remember, with accrual
accounting it doesn’t matter whether the company has been paid yet.) With
more complex “b-to-b” businesses or for those selling into a distribution
channel (a wholesaler or retailer), revenue recognition can be more complex.
Accounting revenue is normally recorded at the time of sale or service comple-
tion. But there are situations in which the delivery process isn’t complete and
may call revenue validity into question. If a distributor doesn’t have to pay
until a product is resold, or if the manufacturer is still required to perform sig-
nificant services, such as configuration, installation, or even warranty work, a
sale to a distributor or customer may be exaggerated if fully recorded as a sale.
Similarly, sales to subsidiaries or affiliated companies shouldn’t be considered
a sale. Sales for consideration other than money, such as advertising exposure,
may also be suspect. 
But for the most part, sales are sales. In many businesses, such as trans-
portation or utilities, they may be called revenues, but it’s the same thing.
Occasionally you will see an allowance for returns broken out; if not, you can
usually safely assume that they’re included in the sales figure as a negative
amount. Most businesses don’t give breakouts on sales returns, not even in
10-K reports, because it isn’t required and it discloses competitive informa-
tion, but it would be nice to see this detail. 
When comparing sales figures or projecting trends, compare apples to apples.
If there is a significant acquisition, divestiture, or extraordinary change in the
business, make sure to take it into account.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold, or CGS, is an important driver of business success. For all
but a few companies with high intellectual property or service content, CGS
is the largest piece of the revenue pie. Cost of goods sold is the cost of acquir-
ing goods and raw material plus labor and direct overhead expended to add
value for sale. 
Different accounting treatments can affect CGS. Chapter 7 covers LIFO (last
in, first out) and FIFO (first in, first out) as different ways of valuing balance
sheet inventory. This valuation can also affect CGS — if more expensive LIFO
raw material units are assumed to be consumed first, that will drive up the
CGS and down the gross margin, operating income, and net income. Hence,
LIFO is the more conservative reporting method except in some technology
industries in which older components may actually cost more. (Note 1 in the
138
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

financial statements usually clarifies accounting methods.) Value investors
should be careful to understand which accounting method is used before
comparing companies, and watch for changes in accounting methods that
may shift reporting bias. In a price-stable low-inflation environment, the 
LIFO-FIFO thing becomes less important.
CGS varies widely by industry and industry cost structure. For example, the
physical CGS of Microsoft is tiny with respect to revenue, whereas a grocery
store or discount retailer may see CGS in the 70 or 80 percent range. Apples-
to-apples comparisons and especially trend analyses are critical to effective
business appraisal.
Gross margin
Gross margin, or gross profit, is simply the sales less the cost of goods sold. It
is the basic economic output of the business before overhead, marketing, and
financing costs enter the picture. Gross profit takes on added meaning when
taken as a percentage. This percentage — and trends in the percentage —
speak volumes for the health and direction of the business.
Operating expenses
You can’t make a joist hangar without a plant and a headquarters function and
an IT department, and you probably can’t sell it either. 
No matter the business, any company incurs indirect costs, or costs of doing
business not directly related to producing and selling individual units of prod-
uct or service. Some call it overhead, but it goes a little beyond the traditional
definition of overhead and into marketing, R&D, and other costs necessary to
sustain the business in addition to directly producing products. 
Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) is a favorite target of value
investors. SG&A includes marketing and selling costs, including advertising,
sales and sales forces, marketing and promotion campaigns, and a host of
other administrative and corporate expenses such as travel, Web sites, office
equipment, and the like. 
Many investors use SG&A as a barometer of management effectiveness — a
solid management team keeps SG&A expenses in check. SG&A can mushroom
into a vast slush fund and an internal corporate pork barrel that can easily
get out of control. Like gross margin, looking at SG&A as a percentage is best.
For an example of SG&A analysis, see the “Practical example: SG&A at
Simpson” sidebar.
139
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements

Research and development
Manufacturing and technology companies in particular need to invest in
future products. Because these investments occur long before product pro-
duction, and because many of them never pan out into saleable products,
companies are allowed to expense research and development (R&D) as a
period expense. 
Simpson, our example, does have a small R&D function with reported costs 
of $19.2 million, or about 2 percent of sales in 2006. No R&D expenses were
reported in 2004 or 2005 in the Yahoo! Finance summary, but smaller figures
do appear in the Simpson annual report. It is always a good idea to check
actual company statements, although the difference in this case wasn’t really
worth worrying about. 
A few companies have been able to capitalize software development costs; that
is, build them into an intellectual property asset instead of expensing them,
thereby inflating earnings. Accounting principles, aside from this exception,
state that R&D costs must be expensed as incurred. There’s quite a bit of
debate on this topic, for many R&D expenses have a long-term payoff and 
are key to building a business. Expensing them is a conservative accounting
140
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 
Simpson: A look at the top
Here’s a look at the Simpson Manufacturing top
line, CGS, and gross margin in Figure 8-1.
This picture covers a relatively short period 
of time — three years — and investors are
encouraged to look at longer time periods,
either through other parts of a company report
or through an investing service like Value Line. 
Sales grew from $698 million in 2004 to $863 mil-
lion in 2006. Nominally, this reflects slowing
growth, dropping from 21.2 percent between
2004 and 2005 down to only 2.0 percent from
2005 to 2006. Overall this is an 11.2 percent com-
pounded growth rate (see Chapter 4), which
isn’t bad. 
The difference between the years makes it
worth checking whether a recent acquisition
caused a jump from 2004 to 2005. Checking the
annual report, there was a small one, but
according to Note 2 of that report “Pro forma
results of operations have not been presented
as the effect has not been significant for all peri-
ods presented.” So Simpson had a really good
year followed by a so-so year as construction
spending slowed. Cost of revenue (another
name for CGS) grew at a rate apparently close
to sales. A closer look will tell.
If you take gross margin in dollars and divide by
each year’s sales, you come up with 40.2 per-
cent in 2004, 37.4 percent in 2005, and 40 percent
even 2006. This probably isn’t enough to show a
trend, especially not a growth trend, but it could
be assessed as at least steady. The large 2005
sales increase suggests there may have been a
small change in pricing strategy or product mix
to achieve the stronger growth numbers; this is
common. Again, it helps to know the business,
know the quarterly and annual patterns, and
know the facts that support the numbers where
possible.

approach, because today’s expenses may bring in a lot of tomorrow’s revenues.
For obvious competitive reasons, companies don’t disclose much detail about
their R&D expenses.
Appropriate levels of R&D expense vary widely by industry. For example,
software companies incur very large R&D as a percent of sales, but insurers
or retailers have small R&D percentages. Because you won’t know the detail
of R&D expenditures, it’s probably best to watch the trend and changes in
R&D as a percent of sales. Increasing R&D percentages reflect an increasing
cost of doing business and possibly ineffective R&D, while decreasing R&D as
a percent may reflect sacrificing the future for the present. Neither is a good
thing. Watch for these changes and any explanations thereof.
Also note that companies without a significant R&D effort may not report it
as a separate line. In some financial statements, it’s called “product develop-
ment,” or it may be bundled into some other expense line. 
Appreciating depreciation (again)
Chapter 7 covers the effect of depreciation on balance sheet asset figures.
This chapter discusses the effects of depreciation and amortization on earn-
ings and cash flow. 
Depreciation and amortization represent the accountant’s assignment of the
cost of a long-lived asset to specific business periods. Depreciation is used
when referring to physical fixed assets, and amortization is used when refer-
ring to intangible assets (such as goodwill, patents, and so forth). Some oil
and natural resource investors may run into the term depletion: A cost recov-
ery for exhaustion of natural resource assets.

Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements
Practical example: SG&A at Simpson
For Simpson, selling, general, and administra-
tive (SG&A) dropped from 21.4 percent of sales
in 2004 to 19.4 percent in 2005 and 19 percent in
2006. This is a good performance, and proba-
bly reflects economies of scale and effective
management. 
Normally, economies of scale should bring
some decline in the percentage in the long run,
as economies of scale allow for more business
activity to occur per unit of headquarters cost,
IT cost, and so on. In the short run, SG&A may
increase more rapidly as marketing campaigns
or staff are added or new facilities are required.
That’s why a longer view is really needed to
make a final determination of whether SG&A is
on the right track. 
Company comparisons are appropriate here, too.
But watch again for economies of scale.
Although Wal-Mart reports SG&A at 18.4 percent
of sales, easily beating bookseller Borders at 24.3
percent, the sheer size of Wal-Mart suggests
that its SG&A should be lower as a percentage.
Compare carefully.

Depreciation and amortization expenses are usually broken out on the earn-
ings statement, but may also be buried in a consolidated SG&A or other oper-
ating expense line. 
Do you really want to know what a company wrote off for depreciation in a
reporting period? Then refer to the statement of cash flows. This is jumping
ahead a bit, but depreciation, a noncash expense, is a major source of differ-
ence between accounting income and cash flow. So, accountants show depre-
ciation as a separate add-back item on the cash flow statement.
What should you look for? The actual amount of depreciation is normally not
that important. What is more important is the method and time period over
which it occurs. Accelerated depreciation methods result in more conserva-
tive earnings statements. Companies sometimes use straight-line methods for
financial reporting and accelerated methods for tax purposes — giving rise to
two sets of books and can contribute to the deferred taxes lines in the balance
sheet. Watch for sudden changes in depreciation methods, and be careful
when comparing especially capital-intensive companies to assure that they’re
using comparable depreciation methods. 
Impairments, investments, and other write-downs
When the value of an asset changes significantly in the eyes of management,
a company can elect to take a write-down recognizing the change. The write-
down shows up as a decrease in asset value on the balance sheet for the asset
category involved and as a (usually) one-time expense somewhere on the
earnings statement. The rules for when and how to take these write-downs are
somewhat flexible. The rules for writing down investment losses are particu-
larly complex and beyond the scope of this book. The good news is that write-
downs are normally reported as a separate line and are well documented in
the notes.
For value investors, knowing the detail or amount may not be as important as
knowing the pattern. Are these write-downs really one-time adjustments, or
does the company continually overinvest in unproductive technology? Are
companies quick to recognize mistakes, or do they linger, pushing an ever-
larger “bow wave” toward amortization and earnings oblivion? Write-down
behavior provides insight into management behavior and effectiveness, as
well as overall business consistency, and should not be ignored.
It is also critically important to understand write-offs and one-time charges
when building intrinsic value models (more in Chapter 12). Many intrinsic
value models base forward projections on the most recently reported net
income numbers. Most financial portals and automated investment analysis
tools simply take the latest year’s earnings figure from a database. If that
figure was significantly reduced (or enhanced) by extraordinary items, a
large (and compounded!) error in the intrinsic value assessment can occur.
142
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Giving to goodwill
As presented in Chapter 7, intangible assets are long-lived assets that have
no physical existence. Included are patents, copyrights, trademarks, fran-
chises, and other legal protections. Also included — and attracting more
interest from value investors — are goodwill assets obtained by acquiring
other companies. These goodwill assets arise when more is paid for an
acquired company than it is worth in hard assets. Acquired goodwill assets
often have real value — brand equity, customer base, and so forth — but
more often than not, the amount booked exceeds this value, and goodwill is
used as a plug-in figure to account properly for the purchase. 
The treatment of goodwill has changed — it has become more uniform. The
deal that accountants struck with the corporate world calls for allowing
goodwill to remain on the books forever — but it also subjects them to an
annual review for impairment of the fair value of those assets (FASB Standard
# 142). Goodwill amortization involved quantitative methods that can be quite
complex and beyond the scope of this book. And as stated in the Simpson
annual report, “determining fair value of . . . an indefinite-lived purchased intan-
gible asset is a judgment involving significant estimates and assumptions.”
Like depreciation and impairments, goodwill amortizations are accounting
phenomena and don’t result in a cash transaction. Goodwill amortization
affects earnings, not cash flow. Informative annual reports deconstruct
impairment analysis for you and give estimates not only for current but also
future asset impairment charges.
You can decide how you want to appraise goodwill, but conservative is usu-
ally best. Ben Graham was particularly leery of goodwill and usually removed
it entirely from company valuation, regardless of company policy. Buffett and
other contemporary value investors recognize the value of patents, copy-
rights, brand equity, customer base, and other intellectual property and
allow it to stand in valuation, so long as it’s not in excess and is accounted 
for realistically.
Operating income
Now, finally, we can summarize how a company has performed at its basic
business by examining operating income. Operating income is simply sales
less cost of goods sold, less operating expenses. Because it includes noncash
amortizations, it is a “fully loaded” view of operating performance in the 
business.
143
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements

If you closely observe the effects of amortizations, special write-downs, and
accounting changes, you can better understand operating income and oper-
ating income trends. For Simpson, 2006 operating income (“Operating Income
or Loss”) increased to $161.4 million from the previous year’s $153.7 million,
a modest increase. 
Interest-ed and taxed
Interest and especially taxes are the corporate world’s equivalent of the
proverbial sure things. So not surprisingly, space is reserved for them on 
the earnings statement.
Companies invariably have some form of interest income or interest expense,
and usually both. Interest income comes primarily from cash and short-term
investments held on the balance sheet, while interest expense comes, not
surprisingly, from short- and long-term debt balances. Interest reporting is
usually done as net interest; that is, by combining interest income and
expense into a net figure. Taxes are quite complicated, just as they are for
individuals, and the details go beyond the scope of this book. There is nor-
mally an income tax provision recorded as a single line item on the earnings
statement, consisting of Federal, state, and local taxes put together.
You don’t need to pay too much attention to these areas except where inter-
est expenses are disproportionately high and growing. In most situations
value investors treat taxes as a given, unless the company has recently been
through tough times and has a lot of write-offs to carry forward. If that’s the
case, taxes can be artificially low for a while; investors must take into
account when they will return to a normal level.
Income from continuing operations
What results from netting out interest and taxes from operating income is
income from continuing operations. This figure gives a good picture of com-
pany performance, not only from an operating but also a financial perspec-
tive. A close look at interest costs tells, for instance, whether operating
success (operating income) comes at a financial price (high interest
expense). If operating income is low or declining while financing cost (inter-
est) is large or increasing, look out below!
Income from continuing operations tells shareholders, in total, what their
investment is returning, after everyone, including Uncle Sam and his
brethren, is paid. Income from continuing operations is a good indicator of
total business performance, but be aware of truly extraordinary events dri-
ving expenses or income.
144
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Ordinary extraordinaries
Extraordinary items on an earnings statement are, according to accounting
rules, to be tied to events that are unusual and nonrecurring. Unusual events
aren’t related to typical activities of the business, at least going forward.
Nonrecurring events aren’t expected to occur again.
Extraordinary items commonly result from business closures (“discontinued
operations”) or major restatements due to changes in accounting rules. They
may result from debt restructurings or other complex financial transactions.
They may result from layoffs and other employee transactions. Extraordinary
items generally are not supposed to include asset write-downs (such as
receivables, inventory, or intangibles), foreign currency gains or losses, or
divestitures. Some companies interpret the accounting rules and guidelines
more strictly than others.
Our advice to you is to watch for extraordinary expenses that aren’t so extra-
ordinary. For example, companies that routinely have some kind of write-off
every year or reporting period aren’t doing as well as the investing commu-
nity is being led to believe. If earnings are consistently a dollar a share each
quarter with a consistent $4 write-off each year, the true value generated by
the business is closer to zero than four. 
145
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements
A bit of EBITDA
Some companies and financial analysts like to
use EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation, and Amortization, as their busi-
ness health barometer. EBITDA fans consider it
the truest indicator of operating success, and
many companies use it internally as a barome-
ter for operating decisions. EBITDA measures
operating cash generated before non-operating
interest and taxes and noncash depreciation
and amortization. In a sense, EBITDA is operat-
ing income before accountants, bankers, and
government. EBITDA is also sometimes looked
at as a liquidity measure: Positive-EBITDA com-
panies can service their debt, while negative-
EBITDA companies must borrow more. 
Although the desire for “pure” business mea-
sures makes EBITDA compelling, many value
investors look at EBITDA as a dangerous shell
game. Sooner or later, a company must replace
assets, as a business can’t proceed on the
assumption that its assets will last forever.
Ironically this is especially true for the technol-
ogy businesses that have traditionally favored
the measure but sit on top of some of the most
rapidly depreciating assets! And as for interest
and taxes, they’re facts of business life. Who
are we kidding anyway? Beware of glowing
announcements of positive EBITDA, especially
when accompanied by losses on the earnings
statement.

The bottom line: Net income
Sales less CGS, less operating expenses, less interest and taxes, less or plus
extraordinaries give you a company’s net income, sometimes referred to as
income attributable to common shareholders or some similar phrase. 
Net income represents the final net earnings result of the business on an
accounting — not necessarily a cash — basis. 
Net earnings are usually divided by the number of shares outstanding to
arrive at earnings per share — the common barometer heard in nearly all
financial reports. Most analysts and investors focus on diluted earnings per
share, which figure in outstanding employee stock options and other equity
grants beyond actual shares outstanding in the share markets.
In and Out of Pocket: Statement 
of Cash Flows
Earlier we mentioned the difference in timing between certain accounting
transactions and related cash collections and disbursements. Build it and
ship it this month and record the revenue, even though cash payments may
not arrive until months later. Buy and pay for a million-dollar machine today,
but expense it over its production life through depreciation. Amortize a
patent and never write a check at all. 
These transactions and a host of others create differences between account-
ing earnings and cash measures of business activity. A business needs cash
to operate. A business generating positive cash flow is much healthier than
one bleeding cash and borrowing or taking cash from investors to stay afloat.
Because of noncash items, earnings statements don’t give a complete cash
picture. So value investors use the statement of cash flows as a standard part
of the financial statement package.
Sometimes the statement of cash flows is called “sources and uses of funds”
or something similar, although that is becoming less common. Accountants
use the terms “funds” and “cash” interchangeably.
The statement of cash flow tracks cash obtained in, or used for, three sepa-
rate kinds of business activity: operations, investing, and financing.
146
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Cash flow from operations
Similar to operating income, cash flow from operations tells what cash is gen-
erated from, or provided by, normal business operations, and what cash is
consumed, or used in the business. Net income from continuing operations 
is the starting point, to which cash adjustments are made. That net income
for Simpson in 2006 is $102.5 million (see Figure 8-2).
To that figure, add (or subtract) what was called the “adjustments to recon-
cile net income to net cash provided by operating activities” in the Simpson
annual report (refer to Figure 6-3) or “Operating Activities: Cash Flows
Provided By or Use in” section in the Figure 8-2 Yahoo! Finance summary. 
The first adjustment item is depreciation, which in 2006 was $24.5 million. So
far, we know that without other adjustments, $24.5 million more in cash was
generated than reported as net income, because depreciation was subtracted
from net income, but not from cash flow because it isn’t a cash expense. So
far, so good. 
After a catch-all “Adjustments to Net Income” category comes “Changes In
Accounts Receivables” of $7.1 million. Because that is a positive number, it
means $7.1 million in cash was generated for the business by receivables
activities, which means — because cash is used, albeit indirectly to finance
receivables — that receivables must have decreased for the period. Similarly,
in the next line, “Changes in Liabilities,” the parentheses indicate a negative
number — that is, cash was used for this item. This means cash was used 
to pay off some liabilities. Next comes the change in inventories of $34.1 
million — negative — meaning that $34.1 million in cash was used to buy
inventory. 
It takes a while to get used to the logic: A positive number means that the
item sourced or generated cash; a negative number means that the item used
cash. And by now, it’s also apparent that cash sourced through depreciation
and to a lesser extent by receivables was in effect used to buy inventory. 
Finally, you arrive at a total “Total Cash Flow From Operating Activities,” a
figure of $99.067 million, derived by netting the adjustments to total income.
This is a very important figure, because it shows that Simpson generated
about the same amount of cash as it did income. Essentially, this is cash gen-
erated by ongoing day-to-day business activities. If this amount is negative,
that’s bad, because it means that the business isn’t even supporting itself on
a day-to-day basis and requires an infusion of cash. If it’s positive — we’re
still not out of the woods yet — capital investments may still require more
cash than the business is producing. On to that question next.
147
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements

Cash flow from investing activities
Cash flow from operations tells what cash was generated in the normal course
of business and by changes in current asset and liability (working capital)
accounts on the balance sheet. But what about cash used to invest in the
business? Invest in other businesses? What about cash acquired by selling
investments in other businesses? The second section of the statement of
cash flow provides this information. 
This section shows, among other things, cash used for investments in the
business, including capital expenditures for plants, equipment, and other
longer-term product assets. For most growing companies, while cash flow
from operations should be positive, cash flow from investing activities is
often negative. Why? Because growing companies need more physical invest-
ments — property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) — to sustain growth.

Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

It is possible to generate positive cash flows in this part of the statement,
either by selling PP&E or by selling investments owned by the company.
More often than not, the total “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” is 
negative, and that’s perfectly normal.
By comparing net cash flows from operations and net cash flows from invest-
ing activities, you can get a first glance at whether a business is productive
and healthy. If positive cash flows from operations exceed negative cash
flows from investing activities, then the business produces more cash than it
consumes. But don’t jump to a favorable conclusion too quickly — you may
be looking at an airline that’s about to pay for five new jets in the next quar-
ter. A surplus cash situation must be sustained to be meaningful. 
149
Chapter 8: Statements of Fact Part 3: Earnings and Cash Flow Statements
How changes in current assets 
and liabilities affect cash
In different financial statements, it’s common to
see accounts receivable, inventories, and
accounts payables either providing or using
cash. Sometimes the logic is hard to follow —
what if “Changes in Accounts Payable” is gen-
erating cash? How does that work? How can an
increase in accounts payable (a bigger liability)
generate cash? In your personal world, an
increased Visa card balance is hardly followed
by a check in the mail. Is this another dreary
example of how corporations are treated better
than individuals in our society?
No, not really. The confusion is caused by other
accounting transactions happening behind the
scenes, but it really does work out. An accounts
payable increase indicates that something was
bought from someone. That something —
whether books, entertainment services, or wash-
room supplies — resulted in an increased
account payable and a corresponding expense
against earnings. Without that expense, net
income would have been higher 
Suppose the company you’re watching has a $45
million increase in cash from accounts payable.
There is $45 million in cash floating around in the
business that didn’t show up in net income. Let’s
suppose that one large item was purchased for
$45 million. An accounting expense was incurred
when the payable was created, but no cash has
yet been used to pay the bill. It’s still in the bank.
So while the expense was incurred, reducing
earnings, the cash wasn’t paid and, at least for
now, there’s more cash in the business. 
Repeat this over and over for lots of small pur-
chases, and the higher level will be sustained,
and it will become a source of cash for the busi-
ness. This is, in fact, how Dell uses accounts
payable to generate cash. 
Increases in liabilities provide cash. Decreases
in liabilities use cash. (This concept is easier to
grasp: a single cash transaction to pay a bill.)
Increases in current assets (other than cash)
use cash. Decreases in assets (as in a net
decrease in inventory) provide cash. It will all
come together with practice.

“Free” cash flow
Sounds like what we all want, right? Positive cash flow, and it’s free. Free cash
flow is a good indication of what a company really has left over after meeting
obligations, and thus could theoretically return to shareholders. For that
reason, free cash flow is sometimes called “owners’ earnings.”
Free cash flow is defined as net after-tax earnings, plus depreciation and
amortization and other noncash items, less annual capital expenditures, less
(or plus) changes in working capital (current assets and liabilities). It is sur-
plus cash that is really free, not waiting for a bill to come for a big capital 
purchase or inventory increase. 
Earn income, pay for costs of doing business, and what’s left over is yours to
keep as an owner. Pretty simple. Free cash flow is a much more realistic long-
term view of business success and potential owner proceeds than EBITDA
and is used by many value investors as the basis for calculating intrinsic value. 
Cash flow from financing activities
Investing activities tell what a firm does with cash to increase or decrease
fixed assets and assets not directly related to operations. Financing activities
tell where a firm has obtained capital in the form of cash to fund the busi-
ness. Proceeds from the sale of company shares or bonds (long-term debt)
are a source of cash. If a company pays off a bond issue pays a dividend or
buys back its own stock, that’s a use of cash for financing. 
A consistent cash flow from financing activities indicates excessive depen-
dence on credit or equity markets. Typically, this figure oscillates between
negative and positive. A big positive spike reflects a big bond issue or stock
sale. In such a case, check to see whether the resulting cash is used for
investments in the business (probably okay) or to make up for a shortfall in
operating cash flow (probably not okay). If the generated cash flows straight
to the cash balance, you should wonder why a company is selling shares or
debt just to increase cash, although often the reasons are difficult to know.
Perhaps an acquisition?
The Simpson statement shows a happy story for investors: $15.4 million paid
to investors as dividends, and another $8.2 million paid out in “Sale Purchase
of Stock” — this is most likely for a share buyback. In fact, Figure 6-3 shows
that Simpson actually repurchased $17.2 million in its own stock on the
market; then issued $8.9 million in stock, most likely for employee stock
options and compensation. Still this isn’t bad — shareholders benefited from
both the dividend and the repurchase. Bottom line: Simpson is using surplus
cash generated from operations to give something back to shareholders.
That’s a good thing.

F
rom the height of the now-defunct “Y2K” tech boom, take a look at a
quarterly earnings release from computer technology supplier Sun
Microsystems, Inc.
Pro forma net income was $1.367 billion, up 19 percent compared with last
year’s pro forma net income of $1.146 billion. Pro forma earnings per share
was $0.40, an increase of 18 percent compared to last year’s pro forma
earnings per share of $0.34.
Sun reported actual (or GAAP) net income (included realized gains/losses
on Sun’s venture equity portfolio, the effects of acquisition related charges,
any unusual one-time items, and cumulative tax effects) for the third quarter
of 2001 of $136 million or $0.04 per share, compared with $509 million or
$0.15 per share for the same period a year ago. 
Did Sun earn 40 cents or 4 cents? Just over $1 billion or just over $100 million? 
In many cases it was hard to tell where a company was headed at the start of
the new millennium. Back then, it was often difficult to know what the finan-
cial statements really revealed, because many companies played hard and
fast with the rules to boost their results in investors’ (and analysts’) eyes.
Happily, since those frothy times, with some regulatory stimulus, things have
gotten better in the reporting world, although there are still some issues. As a
value investor, you need a solid, consistent, and trustworthy set of numbers
to evaluate companies. 

But accounting rules, while improved, still allow enough flexibility to give
companies latitude to manage their business and decide what to recognize,
when, and how. Understanding company accounting and reporting policies —
and conservative versus aggressive bias — has always been considered a
good value investing practice.
The market events of 2000 and 2001, and particularly the subsequent col-
lapses of Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia Communications, and others, brought
the issue to greater light. Millions of investors who never before picked up
nor read a financial statement save for an occasional earnings release won-
dered why their stocks and entire portfolios fell apart. 
But that was then; this is now. The Enron collapse and others brought the ele-
phant in the room to center stage. The public outcry, quite readily noticed by
federal and state regulatory bodies and by certain individuals like New York
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, launched an active and decisive effort to dis-
cover the games companies play to — at least sometimes — make things seem
better than they are. From that outcry came new rules and clarifications and
major legislation — the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act — to bring accountability and
responsibility for the numbers to those who report them. 
This chapter, while not a complete treatise on the subject, illuminates some
of the flexibility companies exploit and “games” companies still play, gives
some tips on how to recognize misleading information in the statements, and,
in certain cases, advises you of what further changes are being considered to
improve statement quality and transparency.
The bottom line in this bottom-line reporting issue is quality. Just as with a
physical product or service, low quality or poorly represented financial
reporting, whether deliberate or not, is less dependable. We don’t bring this
issue up to point fingers or accuse companies and their management of mali-
cious intent, but rather to caution value-oriented investors that things may
not always be what they seem.
Financial Reporting in Perspective
Back in the good old days, around 1970, fewer than 10 percent of the U.S.
population owned common stocks. Stocks were owned, bought, and sold
mainly by professionals in large institutions. They were bought and held for
the long term. Business cycles were long, companies were stable, predictable,
and relatively simple and small, and quarter-to-quarter results variations
didn’t much matter. If big fund managers wanted to know more about a com-
pany’s numbers or performance, they simply called the company.
152
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Today, more than 50 percent of the public owns shares. There’s a large invest-
ment service industry set up to cater to retail customers, as brokers, fund
managers, retirement plan managers, financial advisors — you name it. The
public — and the industry that serves it — are highly tuned into stock perfor-
mance and the factors that drive it. And the industry hires lots of “watchdogs,”
or security analysts, to translate every number, new item, or nuance from a
company into a buy, hold, or sell recommendation.
Additionally, business cycles have shortened dramatically. A company with a
good idea is expected to profit from it more quickly than ever. The whole
world is moving faster because of technology, and because the world moves
faster, companies, especially technology companies, must keep up the pace. 
And finally, companies are getting bigger and more complex. They buy other
companies, operate international subsidiaries, enter new businesses, and
employ tens of thousands in dozens of locations worldwide. Even the sim-
plest of businesses have become enormously complicated. Even a business
like Dell Computer, which started in a dorm room and evolved into a multina-
tional giant, ran off the rails when complexity collided with the need to
demonstrate superior short-term performance, all with little to no warning 
to investors. 
Managing outcomes
So, what happens? Companies are under tremendous pressure to meet or even
beat projections. Anything less — called a miss in the industry — can send a
stock on a deep dive, from which many have never emerged. Managers, who
once worked for shareholders through the company’s board of directors,
seem ever more to work for the investment industry and its analysts to meet
their projections. The fact that capital is allocated to companies with sus-
tained track records of meeting their numbers isn’t lost on management.
Meeting the numbers means raising the share price and getting the capital
that a company needs. And for many executives, meeting the numbers means
cashing in on the bonuses and stock options they covet in the first place to
stimulate aggressive financial reporting.
Add to this fact that fewer and fewer chief financial officers (CFOs) came
from the ranks of professional accountants. Increasingly, CFOs rotated into
the position from other parts of the business. Often the CFO was charted
more with the task of cost cutting and financial efficiency and internal control
than with rigorous financial reporting. Fortunately, Sarbanes-Oxley (“SOX”),
discussed in Chapter 6, has righted that ship somewhat. 
The end result was predictable: Management learned to tell its story in a way
that put the company in the best light. Pressure from analysts, capital sources,
shareholders, and even employees made other outcomes unlikely.

This phenomenon was especially evident in technology companies, where
capital needs are high, business models are complex, business cycles are the
shortest, and an honest company picture could be damaging. Startup costs
and initial capital outlays were huge, and often technology companies grew
or filled product line gaps by acquiring other companies in lieu of incurring
massive research and development (R&D) expenses and capital outlays. But
it wasn’t just in the tech space as we were soon to learn.
The rest of this chapter describes where we are and where we’re going with
accounting principles, how they’re applied in practice, and how their flexibil-
ity may still lead to some financial reporting ambiguity. 
The Rules — and Where They Come From
Not surprisingly, a well-established body of rules governs financial reporting.
What is surprising: These rules aren’t absolute but rather are designed to
provide a framework, or a set of “guardrails” governing financial reporting.
Fall into the GAAP
GAAP, which stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, is a body
of accounting rules evolved over many years by regulators, accountants,
auditors, and companies in the private sector. GAAP rules provide the guide-
line for financial reporting. The SEC works with the FASB (Financial Accounting
Standards Board), AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants),
and other watchdog organizations to implement GAAP; they alone have statu-
tory authority to enforce it. The SEC’s role tends to be directed more toward
investigation and compliance than rule origination. 
You may justifiably be surprised at the rather loose sound of GAAP. The
accounting profession would seem to be a formulaic, mathematical profes-
sion like engineering, not one based on generally accepted principles pro-
vided by agencies representing the very entities being regulated. 
Instead, accounting operates more like the legal profession, where common
law originates from lawyer arguments and is confirmed by a judge and a jury.
GAAP is the accounting “common law,” originating from practitioners and
practitioner organizations and confirmed by the SEC. GAAP rules tend to 
be specific on some points and subject to wide interpretation on others.
Interpreting and applying GAAP to company situations furnish full-time jobs
for legions of financial analysts and CPAs.
Further, GAAP is sometimes criticized for allowing companies not to present 
a sufficiently complete picture of their performance. Performance indicators
such as number of employees, number of managers, square-foot occupancy,
154
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

sales returns, inventory composition, and so forth are routinely left out. In
defense, GAAP is designed to improve financial, not operational, reporting.
Still, GAAP is widely regarded as the fairest and most consistent way for com-
panies to report. It provides a common language for reporting, even though
the same concept may be communicated in different words. In the eyes of
some professionals, GAAP standards don’t always provide the best measure-
ment for their business activity, but in general, the standard survives. The
details of GAAP are beyond the scope of this book. 
Accounting S-t-r-e-t-c-h
The relentless pursuit of the American corporate dream — business growth —
has led to increasingly aggressive accounting practices. This section explores
some of the “stretch” practices used to make business results look better.
Before you get the idea that value investors should throw in the towel on
gleaning dependable information from financial statements, a couple of clari-
fying comments are in order. First, although GAAP legally provides stretch lat-
itude, that doesn’t mean everyone does it. The largest abuses have occurred
in technology and other high-growth industries. These companies felt the
most pressure to meet aggressive expectations, support high stock prices,
and justify large capital infusions. But this doesn’t mean it doesn’t occur in
155
Chapter 9: Games Companies Play: Irrational Exuberance in the Financial Statements
FYI: FASB
Here’s a little more about the Financial Account-
ing Standards Board (FASB) in its own words
from its Web site (www.fasb.org). 
“Since 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board has been the designated organization 
in the private sector for establishing standards
of financial accounting and reporting. Those
standards govern the preparation of financial
reports. They are officially recognized as
authoritative by the Securities and Exchange
Commission . . . and the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants. Such standards
are essential to the efficient functioning of the
economy because investors, creditors, auditors,
and others rely on credible, transparent, and
comparable financial information.
“The SEC has statutory authority to establish
financial accounting and reporting standards
for publicly held companies under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Throughout its
history, however, the Commission’s policy has
been to rely on the private sector for this func-
tion to the extent that the private sector demon-
strates ability to fulfill the responsibility in the
public interest.”

other businesses. It happens, and all you can do is look for the obvious symp-
toms and favor companies that have simple, easy-to-understand, and conser-
vative accounting and reporting practices.
Second, the greatest abuses got a lot of scrutiny from the SEC and its advisory
boards. Several rule changes have already been implemented, and more are
in the pipeline. From 2002 forward, it got better.
Stretch points
Stretch opportunities are found in both revenue and expense portions of the
earnings statement. Among the more popular “stretch points” are 
 Revenue recognition
• Contractual services, forward revenues, service fees
• Channel stuffing
• Related sales
• Creating sales by financing
 Direct costs
• Warranty costs
• Inventory valuation: LIFO vs. FIFO
 Indirect costs and expenses
• Options and stock-based compensation
• Depreciation and amortization
• Marketing and R&D costs
• Pension funds and obligations
 Write-offs and extraordinary items
Although some of the stretch opportunities can lead to outright misrepresen-
tation, others are merely designed to smooth out the bumps in revenue and
earnings flow. Individual and institutional shareholders covet business pre-
dictability and consistency, so some of the techniques, while not changing
long-term business outcomes, are used instead to move events around, lead-
ing to an apparently more consistent performance. 
Remember that the balance sheet is a snapshot in time that captures the
cumulative effects of business activity over a period. This business activity 
is measured on earnings and cash flow statements. As such, the balance
sheet reflects the results of accounting policy and any stretch that may have
occurred — that isn’t where stretch is initially applied.
156
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Revenue stretch
Recognition of revenue can be a major factor compromising financial state-
ment quality. In a cash-only business, cash is cash, and thus revenue is rev-
enue. But in the real world of accrual accounting, revenue recognition (at
least in theory) follows the business activity, not the receipt of cash. Still, this
seems simple: Deliver a product or service and record the sale. Yet it doesn’t
always happen this way.
There are two major sources of revenue recognition problems. The first
involves timing, where revenues for long-term deals and contracts may be
recognized prematurely. The second involves customer financing or price
adjustments, where a customer receives an incentive or is otherwise enabled
to buy a product but revenue is overstated by not recognizing the downside
of such incentives.
The following sections describe some of the ways companies can manipulate
revenue and revenue timing. 
Contractual revenues, forward sales, service fees
Accounting principles state that revenue can be recognized for substantial
performance of delivering a good or a service. Yet cases abound where com-
panies, perhaps selling a three-year forward service agreement with a prod-
uct, or perhaps an insurance policy, bundle downstream revenue into the
original sale. 
Software vendors, like MicroStrategy, Inc. and i2 Technologies, have had
problems booking revenue on incomplete installation contracts. And some
companies have also “sold” future revenue streams from product installa-
tions to third parties, inflating current revenues — Xerox got caught doing
this in 2001. Likewise, until accounting principles were clarified and standard-
ized, some companies, notably retailers, had issues recognizing revenue with
gift cards and other similar instruments. 
Channel stuffing 
Manufacturers who distribute through retail or other channels often fall to
the temptation to sell as much as they can downstream into the next channel
“tier.” Computer suppliers would sell tons of equipment to their distributors,
often to turn around and reverse the sale with a return or a credit for a price
drop somewhere down the line. 
Today, some companies don’t recognize revenue until the product is “sold
through” — that is, sold to an end customer. Other companies will recognize
the revenue, but with an appropriate reserve for returns. Look for companies
that specifically state this practice in their financial statement notes. Also,
157
Chapter 9: Games Companies Play: Irrational Exuberance in the Financial Statements

avoid companies with large fiscal year-end revenue jumps matched by weak
subsequent quarter performance, unless seasonal factors suggest the pattern
is normal. 
Related party revenue
Some companies, most recently Dell Computer, got caught mishandling rev-
enue from closely aligned third parties — or even with sales to subsidiaries
or other “controlled” entities. Related party revenue is common in the tech
industry or other businesses with strong partner relationships or lots of sub-
sidiaries. Intel pays Dell to advertise its products on Dell products (“Intel
Inside,”), but how, and when, is this revenue recognized? 
Accounting and SEC rules are pretty clear about recognizing revenue only
when a transaction is done at “arms length” — that is, without being con-
trolled in any way by the company recognizing the revenue. And as for the
timing of third-party revenues, it should be done only when related costs 
are booked and timing is appropriate to the transaction. If Intel payments are
based on units shipped, Dell shouldn’t book Intel product placement revenues
until the units ship. 
Creating sales with financing
An increasing number of companies have resorted to financing their customers
as a way to win deals, win customers, and bolster revenues. Although this
has been common in department store retailing for years through store credit
cards, it takes on new meaning when, for example, billions are lent to single
customers to buy telecommunications equipment. Lucent Technologies
became the unhappy poster child for this sort of activity in the late 1990s. 
These sales may turn out not to be real. First, the buyer may go bankrupt, as
was common during the dot-com era. In some cases, the sales may be real,
but are artificially brought forward, creating gaps in subsequent periods.
Investors should look carefully at financial statement notes for evidence 
of extensive financing programs, and also look at the running “Accounts
Receivable” and “Notes Receivable” balances compared to sales. (A/R is
another way to finance customer sales.) 
How do you detect these issues? It isn’t easy. In general, you should pay atten-
tion to revenue recognition policies (usually Note 1 of the statements) and
unusual increases or bumps in sales, receivables, or allowances against receiv-
ables. Accounting clarifications and a stronger imperative toward cleaner
reporting (SOX, for example) have diminished these revenue issues somewhat,
but there is still plenty of latitude, and judging companies often becomes a
matter of understanding their business and trusting their management.
158
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Accountants and investors use the term “cookie jar” to describe little ways
and the little places in the accounting framework to set aside revenues during a
good period to retrieve during a bad one, all in the interest of making earnings
look smoother or more predictable. The four revenue “stretch” techniques can
all involve cookie jars, and there are some on the “cost” side, too, as will be dis-
cussed in the following section. Cookie jars are usually used to adjust timing,
not overall long-term performance. 
Stretching direct costs
Like revenue, management has some tools at its disposal to modify results on
the cost side. This is covered in this section as direct production costs for a
product or service, and the more easily manipulated expenses and indirect
costs in the next section.
Warranty costs
Warranty costs give another opportunity for management to flex the state-
ments. Typically, a reserve for warranty should be set aside for every prod-
uct shipped or service completed. But companies can change the amount set
aside. This is a favorite “cookie jar,” often invisible because most companies
don’t break out warranty costs in detail. 
Inventory valuation and sales
If you read Chapters 7 and 8, you may remember LIFO (last in, first out) and
FIFO (first in, first out). In Chapter 7, these are discussed in the context of
inventory valuation; in Chapter 8, they come up under the topics of cost of
goods sold and gross profit. LIFO typically represents the more conservative
valuation, particularly in an inflationary environment, because recognized
costs are relatively higher. However, LIFO also results in relatively lower
inventory valuations. 
Value investors should understand inventory valuation policy, normally dis-
closed in Note 1, particularly where an accounting policy is changing or has
been changed. If a company switches from LIFO to FIFO, watch out. 
Stretching expenses
Expenses, or indirect costs, are easier to stretch, because there is such a
broad range of expenses, and typically little detail is given on the consoli-
dated statements. Fortunately, this area has received considerable scrutiny,
especially options and amortization expenses, so it is less an arena for abuse
than in the past. 
159
Chapter 9: Games Companies Play: Irrational Exuberance in the Financial Statements

Options
Compensating employees with stock options became much more in vogue
toward the end of the twentieth century, particularly, but not limited to, the
technology space. Why? To recruit and retain better employees without con-
suming precious cash or diluting earnings. That was the prevailing reason,
particularly for startups. 
Investors got very upset with this. Not only were companies inflating earn-
ings by not recognizing option expenses, but many a corporate staffer was
getting fantastically wealthy on the resulting awards. The proverbial fox was
in the chicken coop. Earnings at established companies such as Cisco and
Starbucks were inflated some 30 or 40 percent from what they would have
been with proper option award accounting.
For a long time, accounting rules only required disclosure — not incorpora-
tion into actual statements. So option grants and their theoretical expense
were noted somewhere deep in the statements, but not in the results them-
selves. Finally, in 2004 FASB implemented a revised Statement 123, requiring
expensing and prescribing a formula (long a sticking point) for valuing the
options. Microsoft famously was the first to implement this policy (not a sur-
prise, as a monopoly, they look for ways to diminish earnings) and other
companies soon followed suit.
So now, options can still be abused by greedy or irresponsible management
teams, but at least investors will see the results more clearly. 
R&D and marketing costs
A few companies have been caught deferring certain R&D and marketing costs
into the future. How do they do it? By capitalizing them (that is, by recording
them as an asset when incurred, rather than an expense, and then depreciat-
ing or amortizing the asset over future years).
Accounting rules are fairly firm, but not rock solid, around the notion that most
R&D expenses should be incurred as they arise due to the uncertain nature of
their outcome. There’s no way to tell upfront whether an R&D effort will turn
into a marketable product. However, where R&D is significant as a proportion
of total product expense, as with software, portions are allowed to be capital-
ized. Imagine the wild ride if Microsoft had to report all costs of a software
product development in the year it was developed and then record subsequent
revenue as nearly pure profit.
Rules also call for expensing intellectual property, except the costs of secur-
ing the patents or licenses themselves. But there’s an exception in the treat-
ment of intellectual property acquired through purchase of another company.
Such patents or licenses can be capitalized as goodwill (often broken out sep-
arately) and amortized over time — the rule calls for an “economic viability”
test. Financial statement notes may clarify treatment of the largest intellec-
tual property items. 
160
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Likewise, marketing costs should all be absorbed in the period incurred,
regardless of when the benefit to a marketing campaign may occur. There are
some exceptions for direct marketing costs. Abuses in capitalizing expenses
have been known to occur, and one of the more famous occurred at America
Online in 1996. AOL spent over $350 million to distribute installation disks for
its latest software release. Whether or not it was good marketing strategy is
unclear. But its accounting strategy was to expense only $120 million and
capitalize the rest as a “marketing asset” to amortize over the next two years.
The auditors accepted it, but the SEC didn’t, resulting in a stiff fine and painful
restatements. 
Depreciation and amortization
Choice of depreciation and amortization methods — and time periods — can
influence earnings and balance sheet statements. More aggressive deprecia-
tion results in lower earnings and conservative asset valuations, but the 
pressure to “meet the numbers” on earnings may lead to less aggressive
depreciation. Firms have the choice of method (straight line versus acceler-
ated) and time frame (number of years) to manage their financial reporting. 
Depreciation and amortization methods are among the most clearly disclosed
of financial statement “levers.” Note 1 disclosures are complete with both
method and time period, although frequently a mix of different methods and
time periods is used for different assets. Look for how hard assets are depre-
ciated and how goodwill is amortized.
The value investor should look for conservatism, consistency (as opposed to
frequent changes), and common sense (wireless licenses amortized over 40
years probably doesn’t make sense because the technology probably won’t
be around for that long). If a company suddenly switches to longer deprecia-
tion schedules without adequate explanation, look out.
Pension costs and assets 
Pension fund accounting can be another source of stretch earnings in a pinch.
The details of pension accounting are complex and are wisely left to the CPA
community. But companies can modify pension assumptions in ways that can
affect net earnings. 
Suppose that a plan is targeted to reach a certain funding level in 10 years.
Management has diligently set money aside with an assumption of a 7 per-
cent return in order to achieve that long-term goal. Now suppose that man-
agement decides that an 8 percent return is more likely. Is the existing
balance bigger than it needs to be to meet the obligation? You bet. The plan
is said to be overfunded. Some or all of that overfunding can be recognized 
as income, inflating reported earnings. 
161
Chapter 9: Games Companies Play: Irrational Exuberance in the Financial Statements

Pension information is usually deep in the Notes section, usually Note 10 or
higher. These notes have become clearer in recent years, but are still pretty
confusing. Check the fair value of pension assets, the projected benefit oblig-
ation, and the difference between the two. Look at the assumptions and look
for changes in accounting policy, especially those not mandated by FAS
(accounting standards) bulletins. Large old-line companies are more suscepti-
ble to pension stretch: the IBMs and AT&Ts of the world. Newer companies
use the 401K approach, where few or no pension assets or obligations are
carried directly by the company. 
Write-offs: The big bath
Pundits say, “It’s better to ask forgiveness than permission.” This statement
may play into another fairly old accounting gimmick: write-offs. Bundling
large costs into extraordinary write-offs clears the books of bad assets and
bad decisions. Why? To increase earnings in the immediate future. Write-offs
are an expense, and perhaps should have been included in the list just com-
pleted, but this topic is big enough to warrant its own heading.
GAAP is fairly specific in specifying that write-offs must be unusual and non-
recurring. Unusual means not a part of day-to-day business, and nonrecurring
means, well, nonrecurring. Still, these terms are subject to interpretation. Are
162
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 
Focus on tangible value
New rules implemented by the Financial
Accounting Standard board (FASB) ended the
requirement for companies to amortize goodwill
incurred by acquisitions. FASB’s goal was to
simplify accounting and to eliminate a “pooling
of interests” accounting bypass that has been in
place as an alternative. Companies, however,
are now required to re-evaluate the goodwill
asset each year and write off portions clearly
definable as “impaired.” By not amortizing good-
will, short-term earnings may actually increase,
particularly for companies such as GE or Cisco
that have aggressive acquisitions strategies.
While some investors salivate over the prospect,
remember that it is meaningless from a cash
point of view. There is no true wealth created.
Worse yet, these ethereal assets could be main-
tained forever — or lead to bigger write-offs
some day.
Here as elsewhere, we have to depend on com-
pany management to do the right thing, and to
do it in today’s context of increased scrutiny and
SOX-compliant responsibility. And perhaps one
should follow value investing patriarch Ben
Graham’s original advice: Intangibles should be
eliminated completely from intrinsic value
appraisals. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly
common for investment analysts and informa-
tion portals to focus on net tangible value, a
figure in fact available in the Yahoo! Finance
portal balance sheet.

layoffs, plant closings, and restructurings unusual and nonrecurring? For
some companies, yes, but such write-offs became almost annual events for
automakers and other smokestack industries. For some companies, the
December fourth-quarter write-off announcement became almost as depend-
able as Santa Claus himself. 
Be aware of the reasons for and any regularity in such write-offs. Have they
gotten to be a habit? Are they truly a cost of doing business in disguise? If
Cisco writes off $2.5 billion in unused raw material components, or if H-P
writes off $100 million to trim staff, that’s an event, but who’s to say that it
won’t happen again as technology changes and business cycles continue?
Arguably, at least some of that is a normal cost of doing business.
Investors should look carefully at write-offs, especially large ones, to see if
they resulted from an obvious or clearly stated strategic shift in the business.
If write-offs occur repeatedly or have little in the way of explanation, beware.
The write-offs could be ordinary costs of doing business disguised as some-
thing special. 
Pro Forma Performance
Beyond accounting stretch, the once-ubiquitous “pro-forma” earnings release,
such as the Sun Microsystems example at the beginning of the chapter, gave
even more of a black eye to corporate financial reporting and trust. Pro forma
reports had become almost a public relations alternative to the classic GAAP
earnings statement.
Responding in part to investor and analyst pressure and in part to a fairly
loose (to date) compliance environment, companies started using pro forma
reporting as a press-friendly reporting alternative. The trend started in 1999
with Yahoo!, Inc. and expanded through the technology industry and occa-
sionally beyond. 
Actually, pro forma has been in the accounting vocabulary for a long time.
Pro forma statements were originally used as “unofficial” statements
designed to project — not report — company performance. Companies plan-
ning to go public or merge with another company issued a pro forma set of
statements to give an investor a clue to what forward-looking statements may
look like. 
Today, you may still see some pro forma reports done in parallel with GAAP
reports, but they’ve largely returned to special situations. More likely, you
may see a set of “non-GAAP” numbers alongside the GAAP statements, with a
clear explanation of the differences. Like most of today’s financial reporting
trends, this one is favorable. 
163
Chapter 9: Games Companies Play: Irrational Exuberance in the Financial Statements

“Everything but bad stuff”
Pro forma reporting allowed companies to spin their business pretty much as
they pleased. They include certain things, but leave out others they consider
irrelevant to assessing performance. Former SEC Chief Accountant Lynn
Turner called it “EBS,” or “Everything but Bad Stuff,” reporting. From your
perspective as a value investor, pro forma or other non-GAAP reporting not
only undermines trust; it also makes it difficult to compare one company to
another.
Pro forma is really an extension of the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation, and Amortization) reporting concept made popular in the 1980s
(see Chapter 8). 
Although EBITDA made numbers look better than they were by excluding
financing costs and asset recovery, at least the application of EBITDA was
consistent from one company to the next.
Companies routinely omitted option costs, investment gains and losses, asset
impairment or write-downs, goodwill amortization, and other “noncash”
items. In that these expenses are noncash, value investors can wink and turn
their heads a little — for a while. But some very cash-real expenses, such as
interest expense, get written out of the pro forma. EBITDA for most busi-
nesses is more useful as an internal management decision tool than as an
investing tool, especially for long-term investors.
Companies must provide GAAP-compliant numbers in releases and submit
full GAAP-compliant reports to the SEC. So if a company provides non-GAAP
statements, which reflects how the company wants to see itself, fine. But
make sure to read the explanation of why the non-GAAP and GAAP state-
ments are different — and try to understand why the company wants to
maintain that difference. 
What Should a Value Investor Look For?
Those of you who had an accounting course or two somewhere along the way
are probably now recalling why you steered clear of a public accounting
career. This stuff is complicated. 
And it isn’t reasonable, practical, or even prudent to examine every financial
statement in enough detail to ferret out the real story. It’s literally impossible
if you’re trying to choose from among 2,000 or 3,000 companies to invest in. 
164

The “cake test”
Some of you may be familiar with the technique of sticking a toothpick into a
cake to determine whether it’s done. (For those of you who haven’t tried this,
if you stick a toothpick in a cake and it comes out clean, it’s done.) Try it a
few times in different parts of the cake to verify your conclusion. If you don’t
believe it, or don’t bake, then call your mother. She’d be glad to hear from you.
Especially for time-constrained investors, the “cake test” approach makes
sense to review financial statements. Poke here, poke there, read some of the
notes, get a flavor for financial reporting quality. If you’re Warren Buffett,
ready to commit $2 billion to a company, you may want to take a closer look.
But for most of us, the following will help. 
165
Chapter 9: Games Companies Play: Irrational Exuberance in the Financial Statements
The watchdogs are looking across borders
For the most part, the SEC, FASB, AICPA, and
other influential agencies have brought on a far
greater standardization and transparency in
financial reporting as compared to the turn of
the millennium. These organizations should be
applauded for their efforts, because even
though companies can always find loopholes,
they usually occur within a well-established set
of rules. It isn’t the “wild West” like it was back
then.
While some initiatives are still underway to
bring more clarity to domestic financial report-
ing, the emphasis has shifted to the interna-
tional sphere. Indeed, the world is flat, and
investors now more than ever are guided to
make overseas investments — or even com-
pelled to do it as the funds they own are doing it.
Trouble is, accounting standards can be differ-
ent in every country. Who’s to say that Finland’s
Nokia is more or less profitable than Motorola?
It depends on how their accountants handle
many of the issues just discussed. 
Larger companies usually file a U.S. 10K more or
less by U.S. standards, to grade on major U.S.
exchanges. But the cost of SOX compliance can
be heavy for those companies, and many smaller
ones simply don’t choose to comply, and thus
don’t trade in the U.S. Are they bad companies?
No, not necessarily; just different.
Recognizing this issue, the IASB (International
Accounting Standards Board) is working
closely with U.S. and international counterparts
to standardize reporting across borders into a
set of standards known as IFRS, or International
Financial Reporting Standards. Recently, all
companies listed on EU (European Union) stock
exchanges have become IFRS-compliant. 
Spoken language may never be the same
across different countries, but perhaps the
accounting language will be.

A checklist
The following are a few places to test when considering companies as 
investments.
Earnings consistent with cash flow
These two things won’t be equal but should march side by side. If earnings
consistently grow faster than cash flow, that’s a bad sign.
Growing current assets other than cash
Watch for increasing inventories or accounts receivable, particularly in pro-
portion to sales.
Straight-line depreciation and amortization, long time periods
Asset recovery may be delayed through deferring depreciation and amortiza-
tion in order to boost earnings. Understand what practice the company uses,
and whether it’s consistent with others in the industry — and common sense.
Understand asset impairments
Note which assets are “impaired” or on the block for possible write-downs,
and understand why.
LIFO versus FIFO
LIFO is a more conservative approach to measuring cost of goods sold and
inventory levels, as most of the recent (and more expensive) stock is assumed
to be consumed first. Note that this may not be true in every industry. 
Reserves against bad debts change dramatically
Watch for bad debt and other reserves as a sign of deterioration in current
asset quality.
Accounting policies change
Note 1 should be simple and straightforward. Look at revenue and cost recog-
nition. Complex, unexplained changes may spell trouble.
10-K report is longer than 100 pages
Something complex is going on. Opportunity knocks for accounting fiction
and other things that are hard to understand.
166
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Persistent, poorly explained write-offs
If the write-offs are large or repetitive, try to understand why.
Big gap between pro forma and GAAP
Understand why and what the company is trying to tell you by reporting both. 
Understand where the revenues come from — if the company tells you
What are the major revenue “segments”? Does the company have a few big
customers? Who are they? Are their business fundamentals sound? Does the
company have channel partners? What are their selling arrangements with
those partners? Do they provide financing? What are the other incentives?
Are services broken out separately?
Stay with those who explain best
Better corporate financial statements explain changes in their business and
changes in their accounting policies. It’s worth reading their explanations
carefully. Remember, companies that explain things better are probably
better investments.

s The Motley Fool founders David and Tom Gardner put it, “Gentlemen,
start your calculators!” As you gaze through the dense forest of num-
bers in most financial statements, that lost-in-the-woods feeling is almost
inevitable. After all, what do the numbers tell you? Which ones are impor-
tant? How do you take away any meaning from them? And quickly, because
you don’t have all day to address every number for every business you may
look at. 
Are accounts receivable in line or not? Is the company’s inventory scaled
properly to the size of the business? What about fixed assets, debt, and prof-
itability? Is the company using capital efficiently? And does its stock price
make sense? How do you know?
Applying ratios to the numbers is like using a pair of binoculars to bring where
you’re going into clearer focus. Ratios illustrate the relationship between two
or more numbers, giving a sense of scale and context. For example, Simpson
Manufacturing’s reported $217.6 million in inventory means nothing until
measured against its $863.2 million in 2006 sales. The inventory-to-sales ratio
of 0.252 puts company raw data into perspective, tells a story, and provides a
standard for comparison with other companies and the industry. And it tells
the trends — favorable or unfavorable. The 2005 ratio of .214 suggests that
the amount of inventory required to support sales rose substantially in 2006,
which is not a good sign. 
Inventory-to-sales is one of dozens of “standard” ratios. Each ratio by itself
provides a clue into some facet of business performance. Taken together, ratios
provide a clearer “total” picture of a company for the investor to interpret. 

Ratio-nal Analysis
Before going too far with this discussion, it’s important to understand the
benefits and limitations of ratios. Ratios are great tools and bring understand-
ing to key parts of the financial statements. But realize that they are just
tools, not a substitute for practical judgment. Ratios won’t automate your
stock-picking decisions — they are a step along the way, not an “end-all”
analysis tool.
With that caution in mind, let’s examine the types of ratios, and, in a big-picture
sense, how they’re used in practice. 
Types of ratios
Ratios can be classified into one of four categories largely defined by what
you’re testing for. These categories are covered in the following sections.
Asset productivity ratios
In Chapter 7, assets are defined as resources used in a business to produce a
profit, or return. This group of ratios describes how effectively those assets
are deployed or utilized. Some analysts call these efficiency or asset manage-
ment ratios. How much inventory, accounts receivable, or fixed asset invest-
ment does it take to support a given volume of business? Are these assets
being managed effectively with proper controls?
Financial strength ratios
Company resources are provided either by company owners (shareholders)
or by creditors (debt holders or holders of other obligations). These ratios
measure to what extent company resources are provided by sources other
than the owners. Sometimes called liquidity or debt management ratios, these
ratios are also used to assess the company’s ability to pay its creditors and
how vulnerable it may be to debt problems and high interest costs. They also
describe financial or capital structure — that is, how financially leveraged a
company may be. 
Profitability ratios
How profitable is the company? Sure, there may be a lot of business activity.
But how much profit is produced? Per dollar sold? Per dollar invested? Some
analysts refer to these ratios as management effectiveness ratios, as they
indicate management’s overall success in generating returns for the enterprise.

Valuation ratios
The first three ratio families examine internal business fundamentals. With
valuation the stock price enters the picture. Valuation ratios, as the name
implies, relate a company’s stock price to its performance. The ubiquitous
price to earnings (P/E) ratio shows up here, as do its siblings price to sales
(P/S), price to book (P/B), and a few others.
Ratio information sources
Anybody with an annual report and a calculator can calculate and analyze
ratios. Almost all ratios take a pair of numbers from a company’s balance
sheet, earnings statement, or both. 
Ratio analysis can be cumbersome and time-consuming, particularly when
you’re looking at a group of companies or an industry. Services that “do” the
numbers, and particularly the comparisons, for you are hard to find, espe-
cially for free. Comparative industry ratio data is routinely available to pro-
fessional financial and credit analysts, but they pay hefty subscription fees to
get it. 
Here are some ratio data and comparison sources:
 Free: Yahoo! Finance and similar investing portals provide some ratios
and limited comparison tools. The Yahoo! Finance “Key Statistics” page
shows several ratios, mainly valuation ratios. 
 For a modest fee: At the time of this writing, there is still little available
for the ratio-hungry investor to buy. One source is VentureLine (www.
ventureline.com), where, for $9.95, you can purchase a fairly com-
plete rundown for a particular industry, such as “electronic computers.”
This product provides five years of data, making trend analysis practi-
cal. While $9.95 per industry can add up if you invest in a lot of indus-
tries, this tool is worth considering for investors doing a lot of ratio
analysis. 
 More expensive: Value Line Investment Survey (www.valueline.com)
offers a window to many key ratios. Value Line doesn’t present a lot or
ratios, but does give a lot of history, which can be better. The basic
Value Line subscription costs $598.00 per year but offers a lot beyond
ratio analysis. (See Chapter 5.) 
If you have access to Dun & Bradstreet or Standard & Poor’s industry finan-
cial comparisons, don’t hesitate to use these rich, complete, and up-to-date
resources as well. They may be out of reach of the average investor due 
to cost. If you work with a broker or financial advisor, you may get access to
some of these services for free.

Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements

Using ratios in practice
What does a value investor look for when analyzing ratios?
 Intrinsic meaning: What does the ratio tell you? If the debt-to-equity ratio
is 3 to 1, the company has a lot of debt. If the inventory-to-sales ratio is
greater than 1, the company turns its inventory less than once per 
year. A P/E ratio of 50 implies a 2 percent return on invested capital ($1
returned per $50 invested). These numbers tell you something without
looking at any comparisons or trends.
Want an early test for determining whether a ratio is good, bad, or ugly?
Just think of the company’s ratio as it would apply to your personal
finances. A household with 3 times as much debt as equity is in dire
straits, as is a household that turns over inventory (say, groceries) only
once a year, as is a household that achieves only a 2 percent return on
its investments, or a household that’s owed a third of its annual income.
You can’t apply this test to all ratios, but where common sense tells you
something, use it!
 Comparisons: For many analysts, and especially credit analysts, who are
trying to get a picture of a company’s health, comparative analysis is the
most important use of ratios. A ratio acquires more meaning when it’s
compared to direct competitors, the company’s industry, or much
broader standards, like the S&P 500. A profitability measure, such as
gross profit margin, reported at 25 percent tells more when direct com-
petitors are at 35 percent plus. Analysts make similar comparisons with
asset utilization, financial strength, and valuation ratios.
When doing comparisons, be in tune with what you’re comparing.
Companies can be in many different businesses at once. It’s tough to find
pure plays in any industry. Realize that Dell Computer is almost 100 per-
cent in the PC business, while Hewlett-Packard derives only 25 percent
of revenues from PCs. A company mostly in the health insurance business
may be difficult to compare to a company that sells mostly life insurance.
Borders Group and Amazon, while classified in the same industry, have
very different business structures. While the resulting ratio differences
may in part be valid, they also may lead you to believe that an apple is
bad when it really isn’t. It’s important to compare apples to apples when
comparing different companies.
 Consistency: The hallmark of good management, as well as of an attrac-
tive long-term investment, is the consistency of results delivered. If profit
margins are consistent and changing at a consistent rate, the company is
predictable — and most likely in control of its markets. Inconsistent
ratios reflect on inconsistent management, competitive struggles, and
cyclical industries, all of which diminish a company’s intrinsic value.
172
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

 Trends: Better than consistency alone is consistency with a favorable
trend. Growing profit margins, return on equity, asset utilization, and
financial strength are all very desirable, particularly if valuation ratios
(P/E and so on) haven’t kept pace. Value investors who study trends
carefully have information that most investors don’t have.
What’s on the Ratio Dial
This section details the important ratios in each category, or “type” identified
earlier. We offer examples from the Simpson Manufacturing 2006 financial
statements appearing in Chapters 6 through 8, so you’ll want to refer to these
exhibits as you read what follows.
Note: When using items from the earnings statement in the numerator or
denominator of a ratio, the figure used typically represents either the previ-
ous fiscal year or the trailing 12 months (TTM) of business activity. Balance
sheet items come from the most recently reported period. The terms sales
and revenue are used interchangeably.
Asset productivity ratios
Asset productivity ratios describe how effectively business assets are
deployed. These ratios typically look at sales dollars generated per unit 
of resource. Resources can include accounts receivable, inventory, fixed
assets, and occasionally other tangible assets. Similar analyses may also be
done not just for financial assets but also for operational assets like square
footage, number of employees, number of facilities, and airplane seat miles.
Receivable turnover
Receivable turnover measures the size of unpaid customer commitments to 
a company. Specifically, it measures how many times a year this asset turns
over; that is, is cleared out and replaced by similar obligations from other
customers. Rapid turnover, not lingering old debts, is what you want to see.
Here’s the formula:
Receivables turnover = sales $ ÷ accounts receivable $
For Simpson $863.2 million ÷ $107.2 million = 8.1 (from Figure 7-1), a relatively
weak turnover for most businesses. Another way to look at it: For every
dollar invested in receivables, about $8 comes back to the company in sales.
173
Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements

Accounts receivable is a resource at a company’s disposal like anything else
and must be paid for, essentially, by sacrificing cash that otherwise would be
available to fund some other part of the business. A company selling direct to
consumers with cash sales or bank credit card sales will have lower receiv-
ables turnover than an industrial supplier. Watch for consistency and compli-
ance with normal billing policy for the industry.
Average collection period (or days’ sales in receivables)
A slightly different way of looking at receivables is to show the average number
of days that a given receivable dollar lives on the books. To calculate, divide
the receivable turnover ratio (from the preceding section) into 360 to put it
on a daily scale:
Average collection period = 360 ÷ receivables turnover
So for Simpson, 360 ÷ 8.1 gives 44.4 days of life for the average receivable
dollar on the books. For an industrial supplier with a standard 30-day billing
cycle, a model that Simpson would normally fit, you’d expect 30 days or less
worth of sales in receivables, as most customer accounts would be billed in
“net 30” due date terms. These figures suggest something may be amiss with
Simpson — or that the company may have different collection policies than
industry norms. Investors would want to put a “watch” on this figure to see if
it gets better or worse.
If, based on industry comparisons or stated billing cycles, the collection period
is higher than it should be (or growing), watch out. The company may be
losing control of its collections or selling to customers with questionable
credit. This ratio is also sometimes called days’ sales in receivables.
Inventory turnover
Inventory turnover works like receivables turnover, only you plug in balance
sheet inventory in place of receivables. Here’s the formula:
Inventory turnover = sales ÷ inventory $
As with receivable turnover, the higher the number the better. High numbers
indicate that raw materials, works in progress, and finished goods are flying
onto and off of shelves rapidly. Less dust collects on less stuff in fewer ware-
houses, and less cash is tied up in inventory. Also, there’s less risk of obsoles-
cence and write-offs, and in many businesses, less risk of markdowns to clear
inventory. 
Simpson Manufacturing had $863.2 million in sales on $217.6 million in inven-
tory for an inventory turnover ratio of about 4. Again, a yellow flag may go
up, because as we discuss next, it implies that inventory stays on the shelves
for an average of three months — not too good for a company that sells most
of its product into a sales channel rather than directly. 
174
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Deciphering asset productivity ratios means knowing something about the
business a company operates in. If bookseller Borders Group has a large
inventory for its sales, it’s helpful to know that in the bookselling business,
shelf inventory is fully returnable to publishers, mitigating inventory risk and
providing reader selection — all justifying higher levels of inventory. Know
thy industry!
We saw that the average Simpson product sits on the shelf for three months,
(360 ÷ 4 gives 90 days, or three months). “Days sales in inventory” or “aver-
age inventory shelf life” or “months of supply” measures are used extensively
as internal business measures, especially in manufacturing and distributions
businesses, to help put inventory levels in perspective.
Fixed asset turnover
This ratio is straightforward:
Fixed asset turnover = sales $ ÷ fixed asset $
Obviously, all else being equal, the company that produces the most sales or
revenue per dollar of fixed assets wins.
Total asset turnover
Again, straightforward:
Total asset turnover = – sales $ ÷ total asset $
Here we get a bigger picture of asset productivity as measured by the genera-
tion of sales. For the first time, intangible assets are included. Again, industry
norms form the benchmark. Comparing a railroad to a software company
probably doesn’t make sense.
Nonfinancial productivity ratios
Operational, or capacity utilization ratios, can be quite interesting, yet some-
times hard to find or apply. The raw data is often not available in company
statements or published reports. Calculated ratios are even harder to find,
although Value Line and other analysis services make it a point to present
certain nonfinancial operating data. These measures vary by industry, but
here are some examples:
 Sales per employee: This ratio tells you how productive a company is in
regard to investments in human resources. We think it’s worth a look in
almost all industries, particularly those that are labor intensive, such as
retail, transportation, and other service industries.
 Sales per square foot: This ratio is especially important for retail and
similar businesses where occupancy investments are large and sales 
can be tied directly to them.
175
Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements

 Average selling price (ASP): Many financial reports don’t present the
number of units sold because they don’t have to — and they want to
keep selling prices secret. But sometimes this data is available (for
example, from Boeing and other very-large-ticket manufacturers), and 
it can be quite revealing as to the direction of a business. 
 Industry specials: Airlines and airline investors pay close attention to
seat miles and revenues per seat mile flown. Railroads may look at rev-
enue per track mile or car mile. Other service businesses such as banks,
mail order retail, and such may look at sales or revenue per customer.
Sometimes important information can surface in relatively easy-to-find
places. Employee count figures appear on the Yahoo! Finance “Competitor
Comparison” page, and industry-specific figures such as airline seat-miles
flown can appear in trade-specific publications or Web sites. Seat-miles flown,
in fact, can be found on the U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of
Transportation Statistics Web sites (www.bts.gov), along with lots of com-
parable information for airlines and other transport businesses. 
Financial strength ratios
This set of ratios goes by many names (liquidity, solvency, financial leverage),
but they all point to the same thing: What is a business’s financial strength
and position? What is its capital structure? A balance sheet oriented value
investor looks closely to make sure that the company will be around tomor-
row (as many investors did in the 1930s). A value investor first looks at 
financial strength ratios for obvious danger, then bases the bulk of his intrin-
sic value analysis on business-strength and market-strength measures like
productivity and profitability.
Current and “quick” ratios
These commonly used liquidity ratios help evaluate a company’s ability to
pay its short-term obligations. Here’s the formula:
Current ratio = current assets ÷ current liabilities
The current ratio includes all current assets, but since inventory is often diffi-
cult to turn into cash, at least for a reasonable price, many analysts remove it
from the equation to arrive at a quick ratio. The quick ratio emphasizes cov-
erage assets quickly convertible into cash:
Quick ratio = (current assets – inventory) ÷ current liabilities
Another ratio, cash to debt, is often used. The calculation is self-explanatory.
It takes a still more conservative view of coverage assets (cash only) and a
clearer view of what needs to be covered (total debt, current and long-term
portions).
176
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

The traditional thinking is that the higher the ratio, the better off the com-
pany. Greater than 2:1 for the current ratio or 1:1 for the quick ratio is good
and safe; less than 2:1 or 1:1 is a sign of impending problems meeting obliga-
tions. Simpson, for example, has a healthy current ratio of almost 6 ($479.3
million ÷ $80.3 million). The “quick” ratio of 3.25 [($479.3million – $217.6 mil-
lion) ÷ $80.3 million] is also not bad. If some unknown force caused Simpson’s
current liabilities to be due and payable immediately, they’d have plenty of
coverage. Again, it’s helpful to think of your own personal financial situation
as a comparison. 
More recent thinking, exemplified by the strong historical performance of
Dell Computer, doesn’t always hold liquidity in the highest esteem. Dell
became famous for tying up as little cash as possible in current assets and
instead relying on its suppliers to deliver “just in time.” So current asset
totals were small, while current liabilities were moderately higher, and some
ratios came in under 1. But really, Dell was just living off of cash invested by
suppliers in their receivables (Dell’s payables). Living off the assets of others
is a good technique — if you can get away with it.
The value investor’s general rules for liquidity ratios: First, compare liquidity
to industry norms and watch for unhealthy trends (as with other ratios).
Second, and important, liquidity ratios don’t tell you so much what to buy 
as what not to buy.
Debt to equity and debt to assets
Sometimes also called solvency, or leverage, ratios, this set measures what
portion of a firm’s resources, or assets, are provided by the owners versus
provided by others.
Financial leverage can be a good thing — to a point, and as long as things are
going well. If you put up $1, borrow $9, and invest the $10 total to achieve a
10 percent return, your profit is $1. Your return on equity is 100 percent (your
$1 profit divided by the $1 invested). But what if you lose $2? Your creditor
still wants his or her $9 back and is entitled to it. You lose your entire invest-
ment and then some. On top of that, your creditor demands (and is entitled
to) a fixed level of interest payments, which is a constant expense to your
enterprise regardless of results. Leverage is thus a double-edged sword.
Too much long-term debt costs money, increases risk, and can place restric-
tions on management in the form of restrictive lender covenants governing
what a company can and can’t do, minimum performance levels, and so on.
The two most common ratios used to assess solvency and leverage are debt
to equity and debt to total assets. Here’s the formula for debt to equity:
Debt to equity = total debt ÷ owner’s equity
177
Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements

Note that current liabilities, such as accounts payable, typically are not
included. From this point of view, Simpson has almost no long-term debt; it is
very solvent and not highly leveraged with a microscopic debt-to-equity ratio
of 0.0005 ($338 thousand ÷ $652.9 million).
Here’s the formula for debt to assets:
Debt to total assets = total debt ÷ total assets
Making a sweeping statement about what these ratios should be for a given
company is difficult. When a company has more debt than equity (debt to
equity > 1 or debt to total assets > 0.5), yellow flags fly. But again, industry
comparisons are important. Economic value achieved should exceed the cost
and risk incurred with the debt. Sounds good in theory, but precise appraisal
can be complex. As with liquidity measures, solvency measures probably
deliver a stronger signal for what not to buy than what to buy.
Cash flow ratios
Because cash is really the lifeblood of a business, financial strength assess-
ments typically look at cash and cash flow ratios. But there’s a hidden agenda
behind these ratios: to assess earnings quality.
Overall cash flow ratio
This powerful ratio tells whether a business is generating enough cash from
its business to sustain itself, grow, and return capital to its owners. Here’s the
formula:
Overall cash flow ratio = cash inflow from operations ÷ (investing cash
outflows + financing cash outflows)
Operating cash flows represent, as the term implies, cash generated by normal
business operations. They should be positive. If not, the company isn’t gener-
ating enough cash to cover current expenses, let alone replace assets. Investing
cash flows signify the acquisition or disposal of physical assets and are 
usually negative, assuming that the company is investing in its business or
replacing fixed assets. Financing cash flows include proceeds from financing
transactions, such as the sale of stock or debt (bonds). They can be either
negative or positive, depending on current financing needs and strategy. See
Chapter 8 for details.
If the overall cash flow ratio is greater than 1, the company is generating
enough cash internally to cover business needs. If it’s less than 1, the com-
pany is going to capital markets or is selling assets to keep afloat.
Simpson is cash flow positive, with (+)$99.1 million in operating cash inflow
and $(21.5) million in financing cash outflow (careful, the signs are tricky), and
$(60.5) million in investing cash outflow. The resulting 1.21 ratio tells you that
178
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

things are generally okay. Further, the excess of operating cash flow over
investing cash flow ($99.1 million vs. $60.5 million) tells you that the basic
business is generating cash, although care should be taken to make sure
that’s the case over subsequent periods, avoiding distortions from large 
capital outlays or special items in a single year. 
The numbers show that Simpson invested $60.5 million in its business, some
of that in working capital items like receivables and inventory, and used some
cash to pay dividends ($15.4 million) and buy back stock ($8.2 million on a
net basis, that is, net of shares issued for employee benefits, and so on). 
Overall, cash appears well managed, and Simpson is living within its means
cash-wise and is returning some cash to shareholders. Refer to the summary
(Figure 8-2) and detail (Figure 6-3) statements to see these dynamics more
clearly. 
Cash flow and earnings
Now the topic switches from cash management to earnings quality. Chapters 7,
8, and 9 mention the idea that different accounting methods can produce dif-
ferent results on earnings statements. Earnings can be managed up or down,
depending on depreciation, amortization, noncash write-offs, revenue recog-
nition, and so on. Cash flow comparisons with earnings can be used as a
quick quality test to see how noncash accounting transactions and “stretch”
may have gone into a set of statements.
It’s best when cash flows march in step with, or exceed, earnings. If earnings
increase without a corresponding increase in cash flow, earnings quality
comes into question. The following is a base measure:
Cash flow to earnings = cash flow from operations ÷ net earnings
Because depreciation and other noncash amortizations vary by industry, it’s
hard to hang a specific goal on this measure. Consistency over time is good.
Favorable industry comparisons also are good. Further, it’s good when
period-to-period earnings increases are accompanied by corresponding cash
flow increases.
Profitability ratios
Asset productivity and financial strength reflect essential business basics —
important, but neither alone can point you to good companies and good
investments. Profitability ratios form a core set of bottom-line ratios crucial
to all investment analysis.
This section looks at four profitability ratios. Each is typically based on net
earnings, but variations will occasionally use cash flow or operating earnings.
179
Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements

Typically, items related to extraordinary charges or discontinued operations
should be excluded when calculating these ratios. If you’re using figures from
a financial portal or calculations from a screener or other financial informa-
tion package, check to make sure that figures exclude extraordinary items.
You may have to dig into the company’s own issued financial statements.
Return on sales
This ratio is just as it sounds:
Return on sales = net earnings ÷ sales
Return on sales (ROS) tells you how much profit a firm generated per dollar
of sales. This figure is better known as the net profit margin. Closely related is
gross margin, which is covered in Chapter 8:
Gross margin = (sales – cost of goods sold) ÷ sales
Obviously, gross margin is a key driver of return on sales and is the most
strongly connected to the organization’s business strength and operational
effectiveness. Some analysts also look at operating margin:
Operating margin = (sales – cost of goods sold – operating expenses) ÷
sales
where SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) expenses, marketing, and
asset recovery (depreciation) and special amortizations are factored in.
For Simpson, you see a return on sales, or net profit margin, of 11.8 percent
($102.5 million net profit ÷ $863.2 million in sales), healthy for almost any
industry. Gross margin is 40 percent ($$345.3 million ÷ $863.2 million), and
operating margin is 18.7 percent ($161.4 million operating profit ÷ $863.2 mil-
lion sales). All figures are healthy for the type of business and are steady to
slightly growing, all good signs.
Return on assets
How much profit is generated per resource dollar invested? Return on assets,
or ROA, provides the answer:
Return on assets = net earnings ÷ total assets
This measure is especially important in asset-intensive industries, such as
retail, semiconductor manufacturing, and basic manufacturing. Chapter 13
takes a closer look at ROA.
For Simpson, ROA is $102.5 million ÷ $735.3 million, or 13.9 percent. On the
surface that’s a pretty good number, but it would have to be checked against
other manufacturers, especially in the building industry. 
180
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

Return on equity
Return on equity, or ROE, is one of the more important bottom-line ratios in
the value investor’s repertoire. Again, Chapter 13 explains more about why
and how ROE is used as a strategic performance measure. Here’s the formula:
Return on equity (ROE) = net earnings ÷ owner’s equity
ROE is the true measure of how much a company returns to its owners, the
shareholders. It is the bottom-line result of other factors, including asset 
productivity, financial structure, and top-line profitability, as is shown in
Chapter 13. ROE is important as an opportunity benchmark. What else could
an investor invest in to get a better return? Again, consistency, trends, and
comparisons are critical.
Return on invested capital
Debt, while raising ROE in good times, also can lead to financial disaster. As a
result, many investors instead look at return on invested capital (ROIC), mea-
suring profit as a percentage of combined owner’s equity and debt invest-
ments. This measure is sometimes called return on total capital, or “ROTC.”
Here’s the formula:
Return on invested capital (ROIC) = net earnings ÷ (owner’s equity + 
long-term debt)
Frequently, you see ROE and ROIC side by side in ratio charts and discus-
sions. Sustained ROE of 20 percent or more is considered very good. ROIC
will be lower, because now debt is included in the denominator. But for many
investors it is a truer measure of how much the company is really earning per
capital dollar invested. 
Notably, because Simpson has almost no long-term debt, ROE and ROIC are
almost identical. See Chapters 13 and 16 for more on ROE/ROIC.
Valuation ratios
The ratios presented so far are aimed at appraising a company’s performance
to get a better understanding of its intrinsic value. If a business were an
orchestra, productivity, financial structure, and profitability would be sec-
tions like brass, woodwinds, and strings. The total sound produced depends
not just on individual sounds made by individual instruments (ratios) but
also how they work together to produce music.
Now here’s the critical question: As a music buff, how much would you pay to
listen to it? That’s the question that valuation ratios try to answer. How much
would you pay (and how much are others paying) for tickets to this concert?
181
Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements

Here, finally, the stock price enters the stage. And now finally the most popu-
lar ratio of all, the one seen in the newspaper, heard about on talk shows,
found in all those beginning books on investing, makes its appearance: the
price to earnings (P/E) ratio. Alongside P/E, other valuation ratios including
P/S, P/B, and a couple of boutique P/E variations enter the mix.
Price to earnings
Price to earnings (P/E) is just what it sounds like: the ratio of a price at a point
in time to net earnings in a period, usually the trailing 12 months (TTM).
Here’s the formula:
Price to earnings (P/E) = stock price ÷ net earnings per share
A high P/E, say 20 or higher, indicates a relatively high valuation; a low P/E,
say 15 or less, indicates a relatively low or more conservative one. Most
investors are probably familiar with P/E, so the calculation doesn’t need to
be illustrated here. Rather, it makes sense to share a couple of useful deriva-
tives: earnings to price and price/earnings to growth (PEG), both of which
bring greater understanding to the base P/E measure. Chapter 16 also
explores P/E in greater detail.
Earnings to price
Earnings to price is simply the reciprocal of P/E, or 1 divided by the P/E. Why
is this important? Earnings to price is the functional equivalent of a stock’s
yield, comparable to an interest rate on a fixed income investment. Because
we’re talking earnings and not dividends, this yield doesn’t usually come
your way in the form of a check, but it’s useful just the same to determine
how much return your dollar paid for a share is generating. Many people call
this figure earnings yield.
182
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 
When in doubt, should you average?
Occasionally, you see a variation in the ROE and
sometimes ROA formulas. Because these ratios
use recent snapshot balance sheet items in the
denominator, some analysts feel that the most
accurate financial picture is obtained by adding
year-end and year-beginning equity or asset
values and dividing by 2. Thus ROE would be
ROE = net earnings ÷ [(beginning equity +
ending equity) ÷ 2]
Many information sources and services use the
averaged formula If you use a data source or
service to acquire these figures, it’s best to
understand how your source calculates the fig-
ures. Most importantly, be consistent when eval-
uating different investments.

Take Simpson, for example: 17.6 was a recent P/E based on a share price of $33
and TTM earnings of 1.87. Earnings yield would thus be 1/17.6, or 5.7 percent.
What’s the significance? This investment could be compared to a long-term
Treasury security (today yielding about 4.5 percent) as a prospective invest-
ment. Which investment is better? An investment in Simpson returns more,
and, although riskier, it affords the opportunity for gain through growth. The
difference in earnings yield illustrates the basic risk/return tradeoff between
investing in corporate equities versus safe fixed-income Treasuries.
Price/earnings to growth
You still don’t know whether Simpson’s P/E ratio of 17.6 is attractive or com-
pelling. Long-time tech high-flyer Cisco Systems is at 27.4, while banking stal-
wart Bank of America is at 10. Why the difference? 
The primary reason is growth. Investors pay higher P/Es for companies with
greater growth prospects. Greater growth prospects mean greater earnings
and greater earnings yields sooner. This concept is explored further as intrin-
sic value calculations are examined in Chapter 12.
So when comparing businesses, one popular way to “normalize” P/Es is to
compare them to their respective company’s growth rate. From this compari-
son, you get a ratio known as price/earnings to growth, or PEG:
Price/earnings to growth (PEG) = (P/E) ÷ earnings growth rate
If Cisco has an earnings growth rate of 25 percent, while Simpson’s is 10 per-
cent and Bank of America’s is 5 percent, then PEG is 27.4 ÷ 25 or 1.1 for Cisco,
17.6 ÷ 10 or 1.76 for Simpson, and 10 ÷ 5 or 2 for Bank of America. Now if
you’re confident in the sustainability of the growth rates, you’d pick Cisco as
the best investment, because its P/E is modest compared to its growth rate. 
So, the lower the PEG, the better. But if the low PEG is driven by high growth
rates, you’d better be confident in the growth rate assumption. Nothing falls
faster than a growth stock that suddenly stops growing. For years, Starbucks
had been a high P/E and high growth story, with P/E ratios exceeding 30 and
growth rates exceeding 20 percent. When the growth rate slowed just a bit in
early 2007, the stock lost a third of its value. 
Projecting growth rates can be tricky, and for that reason, value investors
tend to shy away from stocks where growth appears temporary or hard to
justify long term. What rate should you use? What the company has already
achieved? What the analysts project it to do? Over what period? When will
the growth rate run into the law-of-large-numbers wall? (See Chapter 4.) What
growth rate did those Krispy Kreme investors use in the 2000–2004 period?
Most of them ended up with a sticky mess. The big question, of course, in
picking Cisco as the “best investment,” is the sustainability of the growth
183

rate. Simpson, while trailing a bit, may be a safer and better long-term invest-
ment. Upsong: It’s okay to assume a high growth rate, so long as it is sustain-
able growth, based on sustainable business and marketplace fundamentals.
Price to sales
Per dollar of shareholder value, how much business does this company gen-
erate? Price to sales (P/S) is a straightforward way to answer this question.
Here’s the formula:
Price to sales (P/S) = stock price (total market cap) ÷ total sales (revenues)
P/S is a common-sense ratio. The lower the better, although there’s no spe-
cific rule or normalizing factor like growth. Somewhere around 1.0 is usually
considered good. 2.0 isn’t out of hand, but the business had better grow con-
sistently into its valuation. P/S can be a way to filter out unworthy candidates.
At one time, Cisco’s P/S approached 20 (while its P/E approached 100, already
a trouble sign). Cisco still has an aggressive P/S ratio of 5.6. Simpson is much
more conservative at 1.9. 
Don’t read too much into the raw “P/S” number, especially when comparing
companies in different industries. A company selling big-ticket items may
have a very low P/S ratio. Ford Motor is an example at 0.11. But low margins
and high expenses reduce the profitability of those sales; Cisco, on the other
hand, has much higher margins. Remember — compare apples to apples, and
understand the business beyond just the top or bottom line. 
Price to book
The price to book (P/B) ratio is getting varying amounts of attention from
investors in different sectors. Here’s the formula:
Price to book (P/B) = stock price (total market cap) ÷ book value
Chapter 7 explains that book value consists of the accounting value of assets
less (real) liabilities — sort of an accounting net worth or owner’s equity of a
corporation. This figure has greater meaning in financial services industries,
where most assets are actual dollars, not factories, inventories, goodwill, and
other hard-to-value items. Some book value measures include intangible
assets, and others exclude them.
Value investors use P/B a bit like P/S: as a “smell test” for obvious lack of value.
A P/B ratio of 1.0 is very good — unless the asset base is a bunch of rusty
unused railroad tracks. A P/B of less than 1.0 signifies a buying opportunity —
if book assets are quality assets. A price way out of line with book had better
be justified by conservative asset valuation or by the nature of the industry.
184
Part II: Fundamentals for Fundamentalists 

In the software industry, for example, if R&D (research and development) is
properly expensed and intellectual capital intangibles are aggressively amor-
tized, book value and P/B will be low. 
Again, like elsewhere, trends and apples-to-apples comparisons are important.
185
Chapter 10: On Your Ratio Dial: Using Ratios to Understand Financial Statements
Market cap
When calculating P/S ratios or other valuation
measures, it’s sometimes easier to look at aggre-
gate rather than per-share amounts. Sales are
reported as an aggregate figure, not as a per-
share figure. So to compare apples to apples,
you can look at aggregate share valuation
instead of the per-share price. This aggregate
figure is known as market capitalization, or
market cap for short. Market cap is simply the
number of shares (usually the fully loaded
number, including options and equivalents) times
the stock price. Divide total market cap by total
sales, and you have the P/S ratio.

f you compare Value Investing For Dummies to a fancy restaurant meal,
then Chapters 1 through 10 provide the table, dishes, silverware, menu,
appetizers, wine, bread, and ambience. These chapters give the value invest-
ing context and approach, as well as a “menu” of basic tools commonly used
to evaluate a company’s performance.
But the ingredients alone don’t create a dining experience. It must all be put
together. This chapter moves forward to the main course: using what you dis-
cover about a business to appraise it as an investment. Value investors strive
to understand what a business is worth before making an investment decision.
But this main course isn’t all that simple: It could be a college course. Business
valuation has been the subject of extensive theoretical study and debate —
as well as experience and learning — in the investing community. It is at best
an inexact science that no two people do exactly the same way. The goal here
is to expose you to some of the techniques and underlying principles. Whether
you apply them rigorously to every investment decision or just keep them
“back of mind” is up to you.
This chapter outlines a system or approach to business valuation. Two major
valuation approaches are covered: intrinsic and strategic valuation. The chap-
ters that follow provide a practical framework for applying these approaches
and a set of tools that a nonprofessional value investor can use.

Business Valuation vs. Stock Valuation
So you think you know how to value a business? Just look at the price to
earnings (P/E) ratio, then maybe price to sales (P/S) and price to book 
(P/B) ratios, compare to its closest competitor, and voilà — you’ve valued
the business. Right?
If you guessed “no”, you’re on the right track. P/E, P/S, and P/B are valuation
ratios (see Chapter 10). They value the stock, not the business. They com-
pare the stock price to a top- or bottom-line attribute of the business. They
suggest whether the stock price is reasonable in the context of that attribute,
but they don’t tell you what the business itself is worth.
We’re not saying that stock valuation ratios have no place in value investing.
Valuation ratios play into a good value investment system, usually in two ways:
 Valuation ratios can be used at the beginning to screen companies for
deeper analysis. As you can imagine, performing a detailed valuation
analysis of 1,700 companies otherwise takes far too long.
 Valuation ratios can be used after completing the company appraisal to
determine whether the price and timing are right to buy.
Relying on valuation measures alone can give you a superficial view of com-
pany performance, especially if unusual items like one-time write-offs color
the numbers. If you don’t understand the underlying fundamentals and
trends, you may hitch your wagon to the wrong horse.
What Goes into Valuing a Business
Plain and simple, the real and true value of any business is the sum of all the
cash you receive from the business now and in the future. The two questions
left to be answered are “how much?” and “when?” These questions are the
same for any business you may buy or engage in: starting a lemonade stand,
writing a book, or buying the Coca-Cola Company. The importance of “how
much” is obvious, and the importance of “when” refers to the time value of
money. A sum received today has more value than the same sum received 20
years from now. 
If you knew how much cash would be returned and exactly when it would be
received, you’d be able to nail the business value with accuracy. But unfortu-
nately, life isn’t so simple. You must piece together the “how much” and
“when” from what you know, and what can be inferred, about the business
and its value as a business.

Business value drivers
Business value is created and driven by the following factors:
 Income: Profits — revenues in excess of costs — are the starting point.
More important are the cash flows, especially free cash flows generated
by the profits. A company starting at a loss and banking on future profits
is starting in the hole, particularly considering the time value of money.
 Income growth: Steady income with no growth over time is valuable,
and a business with steady income is worth paying for. But without
growth, the value of future earnings depreciates over time. There’s little
to make a stock price rise in this instance unless the market values the
income stream incorrectly in the first place. So income growth becomes
a key driver of business value. 
 Productive capital investments: It’s important that a company be able
to invest additional capital productively — at a greater return than it
would get by putting that capital in the bank. And it goes without saying
that a company should invest capital more productively than you can;
otherwise, it makes sense for you to invest your capital elsewhere. If the
company doesn’t have productive places to invest but pays you a good
return (dividends), the company has value, but again there may be little
to drive share price growth.
 Rising productivity and falling expenses: A good business makes pro-
gressively better use of assets and creates more output per unit of input.
Businesses that can do so are likely to generate more income sooner per
unit of capital deployed than other less productive businesses.
 Predictability: Generally, a business with a predictable, steady income
stream is more valuable than a company that has erratic or cyclical
earnings. The erratic company may return as much money in the long
run as the steady company, but the uncertainty surrounding the earn-
ings stream requires a higher discount rate or margin of safety because
you just don’t know. The higher discount rate reduces value.
 Steady or rising asset values: Asset growth, particularly current assets,
should ultimately lead to higher shareholder returns. If assets (for exam-
ple, cash) aren’t distributed directly to shareholders, the company may
become a more attractive takeover target. Since an eventual takeover
also pays you cash or some other consideration that can be converted
to cash, like stock of the acquiring company, a business with high or
growing takeover value is more valuable. A company with falling assets
is suspicious, unless generated income is still steady or rising — the
decline in assets may be part of a deliberate strategy, as we’ve seen with
railroads and are starting to see with airlines. 
191
Chapter 11: Appraising a Business

 Favorable intangibles: Many internal and external phenomena can affect
or serve as leading indicators of business value. Management effective-
ness, market presence, brand franchises, intellectual property, and
unique skills and competencies all play a part in driving business value.
By nature, these items are hard to quantify, but they are very much a
part of the valuation playing field.
It’s interesting to compare these business value drivers to your personal situ-
ation. If you have predictable income, it’s growing, you’re investing your
income and savings productively, your expenses are falling, and your assets
are going up in value, you, as a “business,” are doing okay. In the business
world, it’s no different — just a little harder to evaluate.
Appraising Business Value
You know the goal: An appraisal of business value factoring in a lengthy list 
of diverse inputs. A “perfect” business value assessment could be a never-
ending exercise. You could unearth more and more detail that could affect
value, and by the time that Input Z was measured, Input A would change. 
And there are enough subjective points to the valuation process (such as dis-
count rates and marketplace intangibles) that peeling back every layer of the
onion just doesn’t make sense. The more you know, the more you don’t know. 
Intrinsic and strategic valuation
From what you’ve read in other books or articles about value investing, you
probably realize that dozens of valuation approaches are out there. One
writer uses a set of ratios; another looks at acquisition value; and a third 
projects earnings based on sales growth, margins, and P/E ratios. All these
approaches make sense. The goal here is to take the best of what’s out there
and make it understandable, practical, and versatile enough to deal with dif-
ferent situations and differing amounts of information. The valuation system
presented in this book is built on two component approaches: intrinsic valua-
tion and strategic valuation.
 Intrinsic valuation places a dollar value on the business by estimating
the value of future income or cash flows considering growth, timing, and
discount rates. Intrinsic value formulas calculate a per-share value for
the company. However, because of predictive uncertainty and the nature
of underlying assumptions, intrinsic valuation is far from precise. As a
result, the value estimate can have a wide range depending on the
assumptions made in the valuation process. Still, whether or not as an
investor you choose to run detailed intrinsic value calculations, under-
standing intrinsic value principles will help in judging business and com-
pany value.
192
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

 Strategic valuation backs up a step from intrinsic valuation to examine
factors that drive and ultimately create intrinsic value, and thus share-
holder value. Most of these factors are influenced or controlled by specific
management strategies, hence the term strategic value. There are two
components of strategic value: strategic financials and strategic intangibles.
Strategic financial value starts with return on equity (ROE), a core driver
of shareholder value. From ROE, fundamental strategic valuation works
backward to assess major ROE drivers of profitability, productivity, and
capital structure. Those ROE drivers, in turn, are driven by the strategic
intangibles, such as market position, supplier position, “moats,” and
management effectiveness.
Strategic valuation doesn’t give a single figure for company value, but 
it tells you how many of the arrows point in the right direction and
whether management is pulling the right levers to create shareholder
value — and eventual shareholder returns.
The two approaches are not altogether unrelated. Strategic value affects
intrinsic value. A company with high and growing profit margins, return on
assets, and a good franchise will not only maintain strong ROE but also pro-
duce high returns on invested dollars and a high intrinsic value.
Intrinsic value gives a specific dollar business value, albeit with a wide range,
for each share of a company’s stock. This value is of little use for comparison
except with the company’s stock price; that is, if the stock price is far less
than the intrinsic value per share, the stock is a good buy. On the other hand,
strategic value is much more comparative; you can use it to compare Company
A to Company B to decide which one to buy.
Developing a value investing system
In the end, if you have the time, you’re probably well served to calculate
intrinsic value; then flavor it with strategic value assessments and intangi-
bles. But the difficulties and vagaries of intrinsic value calculations make
strategic valuation probably the more practical of the two approaches.
You may be disappointed to find no absolute system or set of formulas to pick
the surefire winners. The formulas and thought processes are provided, but
developing a value investing system is a matter of personal preference, and 
to a degree depends on the types of businesses you invest in — and is pretty
much left up to you. The approach you choose depends on your time, appetite
for numbers, goals, and, ultimately, what works through your experience.
Having said that, the value investing approach offered here is an example or
model that could, with or without modifications, form the basis for your
value investing system. It’s designed for nonprofessionals who may have just
a few hours a month to sit down to review and select investments.
193
Chapter 11: Appraising a Business

1. Screen companies.
Using P/E, P/S, or other chosen ratios, get a list of companies to
evaluate. More sophisticated stock screens can be used, as can lists
of stocks you may run across from value oriented fund managers or
other pros. The list can include businesses or industries considered
timely by popular investment analysts or the financial press, or
companies you deal with in everyday life that appear to have their
acts together. 
2. Calculate intrinsic value.
Using models from Chapter 12, derive an estimate of intrinsic value
for each company. Experience will give you a set of assumptions
that you can apply consistently. Getting good at this step may take
practice.
3. Assess each company’s strategic value.
Develop a checklist, similar to Ben Graham’s checklist in Chapter 3,
for key business performance measures (return on assets growing,
return on equity constant, profit margins growing, sufficient liquid-
ity, and so on). Try to determine if the company has a “moat” or 
sufficient business advantage to protect the business against com-
petition and sustain growth. Such a list is presented in Chapter 13.
Then, add a checklist and evaluate intangibles, as shown in 
Chapter 14. 
4. Decide whether the price is right.
Compare current price to intrinsic value, sprinkle in strategic value
assessments, and bake in a dash of judgment. Look at valuation
ratios (P/E, P/S, and P/B, both current and historic) to decide
whether the price is right and whether a margin of safety exists.
Check to see whether price can grow to meet your investment
objectives. This process is the subject of Chapter 16.
This four-step process is only an example; you may end up doing something
totally different. Some investors emphasize certain steps depending on the
amount and reliability of the information available. Steps 2 and 3 can be
reversed. Strategic value can be evaluated first, with intrinsic value used as 
a reality check to validate selections. It all depends on what works for you —
that is, what is time-efficient and produces the best results.

hat is anything really worth? Regardless of what you buy in everyday
life — or invest in — this is the nagging question for all financial skep-
tics. You pay six figures for that house, realizing the impossibility of counting
nails, two-by-fours, sheets of plywood, and roof shingles, not to mention the
work required to get them there and put them in place. The house has a value,
and the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. The value to you as 
a buyer is related not just to nails and boards, but how they fit together to
deliver a “return” to you as a living space — now, in the future, and compared
to alternatives.
Investments can be looked at in much the same way. You can round up all the
buildings, trucks, pallet jacks, servers, and PCs that a company owns, assign
a value to each, and add it all up. But that’s a monumental and largely impos-
sible exercise, and it would still miss the main point. 
Instead, what’s really important is what all that stuff produces in the form 
of investor returns. Intrinsic valuation is the art and science of placing a fair
value on current and future investment returns. When assets are deployed
productively, you don’t care about how much the pallet jacks are worth. The
return they help generate is what’s important. If healthy returns stopped
coming, then and only then are investors concerned about how much the
pallet jack is worth — its residual asset value — for liquidation.
Value investors think of the asset base as a minimum, or floor, for intrinsic
value. True measured value comes from the returns. Intrinsic value formulas
help value investors measure a business value from today’s facts and data. As

will be shown, intrinsic valuation depends on assumptions, many of which
elude precise identification. A wide range of projected values can result. For
that reason, some value investors choose to avoid the intrinsic value calcula-
tion. But that doesn’t mean you should avoid this chapter. Value investors
should understand the principles and purpose behind intrinsic value,
whether or not they attempt the actual calculation.
The Intrinsic Value of Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic value is a present dollar value placed on net returns generated by a
business over time. This is the financially correct theoretical value of any
security or investment. It’s the net present value of all future returns from
investing in a productive asset — in this case, a business. 
As a practical matter, wouldn’t it be great if you could quantify “present dollar
value” precisely? For fixed income or bond investments, it’s relatively easy.
Save for default, you know what you’re going to get back: a fixed return or
“coupon” — a fixed payment. As an investor, you must decide how much that
return is worth. Current interest rates, alternative investments, and default
risk play a role, but calculating the return on a bond is fairly straightforward.
Valuing equities
Valuing business equity investments is a trickier task. There is no guaranteed
return. Instead, returns vary year by year with fluctuations in sales, sales
prices, costs, and internal productivity. Market factors, competitive factors,
operating efficiencies, financing costs, and a wide range of other factors
affect profits — and thus returns — on equity investments.
Further, not all returns are paid to shareholders. Aside from dividends, returns
are reinvested in the company for future returns, which are also unpredictable.
These returns may not be paid back to shareholders for years, even decades,
depending on the life of the company. The company may choose to keep rein-
vesting, hopefully with success. In this scenario, the value investor tries to esti-
mate those returns over the lifetime of the company into the indefinite future.
For all but the largest companies, selling out or merging with another com-
pany is a common outcome. In this case, the long term, or continuing, value 
of a company is paid to shareholders in the form of cash or securities of
another company. But it may not happen for 20 years. In determining intrin-
sic value, investors can model either long-term outcome; this chapter shows
how to do it both ways. 
196
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Intrinsic value models: The reality
You can assign an intrinsic value to a company by mathematically estimating
future returns — from income or the sale of the business or both — and their
current or present value. But as you probably guessed, there’s a considerable
range of possible outcomes, depending on what assumptions you use. 
Intrinsic value models depend on estimating growth rates and growth periods
and assigning a discount rate to bring future returns back to present value.
These inputs are hard to establish precisely, and the outcome is extremely
sensitive to the inputs. So once again, there’s no one-shot formula for securi-
ties valuation. But an understanding of the model and its behavior can con-
tribute mightily to investment analysis. And as a prudent investor, you can
choose a conservative set of assumptions to get a conservative result. 
Once again, if all investing boiled down to simple, precise mathematical for-
mulas built on perfect knowledge, there would be no difference of opinion on
company values, and thus no market. The whole equity, or stock market,
“space” would function more like a Treasury bond market, except that your
investments would rise or fall dollar for dollar with every incremental change
in company fortune. There would be no reason for investment books — 
the same stock valuation formulas would be on your PC or calculator and
everyone else’s. Superinvestors like Warren Buffett wouldn’t become superin-
vestors, because they couldn’t make better judgments than the next investor.
Markets would no longer fire up the competitive juices of investing buffs, nor
provide conversation topics for cocktail-partygoers. It would be a bit boring.
There are many ways to use intrinsic value principles and models: 
 Thought framework: Intrinsic value principles serve as a thought frame-
work, or investing “conscience.” Successful investors constantly weigh
future returns, risk and uncertainty, and alternative investments.
Calculating specific values may not be so important; it’s the thought
process that counts.
 Entry point: Intrinsic value models provide a good entry point for invest-
ment analysis. By playing with the assumptions, you get a picture of a
stock’s logical range and of the factors that could cause a stock to exceed
the range in either direction. 
 Reality check: While precise business and stock valuations may be elu-
sive, intrinsic value modeling may help you validate an investing deci-
sion come to in a different way. As a reality check, look to see whether
calculated intrinsic value is below or close to share price.
197
Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

Intrinsic Value Basics
Theoretically and practically, the value received for owning a business or a
security is the dollar return amount received over time from your invest-
ment. That return may come as a single payment at the end of the ownership
period for selling the stock or business, as payments at regular intervals
during ownership, or (often) as a combination of the two. 
At first glance you may say that it makes no difference — money is money.
But growth and time value of money have a major impact on the final valua-
tion of equity investment returns. In fact, intrinsic valuation is a lot about
assessing the effects of future growth on future returns and then assigning a
present value to those returns.
A checklist of how’s
The following “how” questions can guide the appraisal of business returns.
How much?
How many dollars of return will the business produce, either to distribute to
shareholders or to invest productively in the business? Key drivers are prof-
itability and growth rates — and the collection of business factors that drive
that profitability and growth.
How soon?
Big payoffs are nice, but if you have to wait 30 years for them, they aren’t as
valuable. Remember the time value of money. If two companies produce the
same return, but one does it sooner, that company has more value because
those dollars can be reinvested elsewhere sooner for more return. 
How long?
Although future returns have less value than current returns, they do have
substantial value; and 20, 30, or 50 years of those returns can’t be ignored,
particularly in a profitable, growing business.
How consistent? 
A company producing slow, steady growth and return is usually more valu-
able than one that’s all over the map. A greater variability, or uncertainty,
around projected returns calls for more conservative growth and/or dis-
counting assumptions.
198
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

How valuable?
Finally, after assessing potential returns (how much, how soon, how long, how
consistent), you must assign a current value to those returns. That value is
driven by the value of the investment money as it may be used elsewhere. 
A return may look attractive — until the investor realizes that he or she can
achieve the same return with a bond or a less risky investment. Valuing the
returns involves discounting (using a discount rate) to bring future returns
back to fair current value. The discount rate is your personal cost of capital —
in this case, the rate of return you expect to deploy capital here versus 
elsewhere.
Sooner isn’t always better. A business producing quick, short-term bucks may
not be more valuable than one that produces slow, steady growth. The quick-
bucker may be cyclical and go through years of diminished or even negative
returns. Even though the quick-bucker produces a lot of value in the first few
years, that may not be better than sustained growth and value produced later
on by the slower, steadier company. The quick-bucker may be relying on a
technology or some other competitive advantage that could dissipate or dis-
appear altogether. Likewise, a company with a long-term and sustainable
advantage, sometimes known as a “moat” keeping competitors away, may
beat a company with very high but only short-term returns. Bottom line: It’s 
a combination of how much, how soon, how long, and how consistent. The
tortoise often beats the hare.
More about returns
The term returns has been used kind of loosely so far. What returns are we
talking about? Direct returns to shareholders? Returns to the business? Net
income? Cash flow? EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation,
and Amortization)? What’s the best “base” for intrinsic value? 
Net income to the business is the starting point, but many investors look 
further. 
A few words about dividends
Dividends represent a direct cash payment of a portion of company profits to
its shareholders. A dollar paid to shareholders comes directly out of retained
earnings — and future book value — of the company. For many investors, a
dividend check “bird in the hand” is worth more than two reinvest-in-the-
future “birds in the bush,” and some regard dividends as a reaffirmation of
management commitment to producing returns for shareholders. But divi-
dends paid are money taken out of the business, possibly attenuating future
growth in dollars and future business returns.
199
Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

As part of intrinsic value, dividends are counted as part of yearly investment
returns and grown and discounted in the same way as earnings retained in
the business. But deducting dividends reduces the growth base of retained
earnings and book value kept in the business. Companies with a high growth
rate and return on equity often yield greater intrinsic value if all earnings are
retained and reinvested, which is why you often see just that — no dividends
in high-growth companies.
Cash flow (CF) or discounted cash flow (DCF)
Cash flows, covered in detail in Chapter 8, are yearly cash returns into a busi-
ness, without accounting adjustments for asset write-downs, amortizations,
and the like. Earnings depend a great deal on how the company values and
adjusts the value of assets. At the end of the day, cash accounts grow — and
checks are written — on cash flow. Many sophisticated security analysis
models, including intrinsic value models, operate on cash flow. These models
are sometimes referred to as discounted cash flow (DCF) models. 
EBITDA
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is
an approximation of cash generated by business operating activities. Okay,
but interest and taxes are real, and depreciation “chickens” come home to
roost someday when depreciated fixed assets need to be replaced. So as
intrinsic value calculations are necessarily long term in view, it’s dangerous
to leave out the cost of fixed assets. 
Free cash flow (FCF)
Free cash flow is essentially cash flow generated from operations beyond
interest, taxes, and capital investments. As a business owner, it’s what 
you’d really be able to put into your pocket. Much better.
Net free cash flow (owner earnings)
The most realistic version of free cash flow starts with plain old free cash flow;
then makes an additional adjustment for working capital changes. If persistent
growth in accounts receivable or inventory is required to sustain business
levels, the cost or cash invested in those assets should be deducted from that
returnable to owners. 
Net free cash flow =
operating earnings
less interest and taxes 
less capital investments
less net working capital increases (or plus working capital decreases, if
working capital is being reduced)

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Warren Buffett uses net free cash flow to do his assessments and wisely calls
it owner earnings to represent the annual earnings truly available to business
owners.
Any one of these cash flow streams can be used as an input to an intrinsic
value or DCF model, and they are probably more robust than reported earn-
ings. But they are harder to identify for the nonprofessional investor. Most
free data sources provide little in the way of cash flow figures, and if they do,
they aren’t adjusted to accommodate fixed or working capital investments. It
takes a deep understanding of a company to properly time fixed and working
capital investment outlays into an intrinsic value computation. Therefore,
most investors use earnings as the most readily available proxy for business
returns. It’s a good place to start. Understanding earnings quality and the dif-
ferences between earnings and cash flow goes a long way toward producing
valid results.
When using earnings streams to project future returns, make sure to under-
stand quality and one-time extraordinary gains or losses. Especially when
occurring in the base year, extraordinary earnings items can mess up the
intrinsic value calculation. Be especially careful when using a “canned” pack-
age, as it picks up whatever is on a company’s source earnings database,
ordinary or otherwise. To their credit, analysts and Value Line usually filter
out these abnormalities when making projections.
Projecting growth 
Beyond the net assets owned by a business today, intrinsic value is driven by
current and especially future earnings. So projecting future growth in these
earnings is vital to determining intrinsic value. So it makes sense to examine
growth assumptions more closely. 
Can it climb forever?
No airplane can climb at the same rate forever, and neither can a business.
Soon the air thins, fuel runs low, safety margins diminish — and we must
level off. 
True intrinsic value is the total of all future investment returns. This year, next
year, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 years from now. Now, how can you possibly project a
company’s return 77 years from now? It’s hard enough to do it for this year!
How do you play years 77–80 into the intrinsic value calculation? Especially
with a knowledge of gravity and the understanding that growth rates inevitably
level off?
201
Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

First-stage growth
Near-term growth is by nature easier to model, and as a result of the dis-
counting process, they contribute more towards the final result anyway. So
intrinsic value models are set up to specifically value a first stage in detail,
year-by-year. Typically the first stage is 10 years, although in some analyses 
it may be more or less.
More often than not, the first stage is assumed to have a higher growth rate
and a lower discount rate than the second stage. Why? High altitude attenu-
ates high growth rates as time goes on, while risk and uncertainty call for
higher discount rates farther into the future.
Second-stage growth
The second stage covers the more nebulous period of business life beyond
the first stage. Second-stage returns are harder to project accurately, so
intrinsic value models use one of two assumptions to estimate what’s known
as continuing value:
 Indefinite life: The indefinite life model assumes ongoing returns and
uses a mathematical formula to project returns over an indefinite period
and assign a value to those returns. 
 Acquisition: Want a convenient way to bypass mathematical approxima-
tions? Assume that someone will come along and buy your business
after the first stage at a reasonable valuation. Returns include all future
payouts, including lump sums, so this method works too, so long as
resale value is projected reasonably. 
To summarize, each stage of a business life has a growth rate and discount rate
applicable to that stage. One growth rate and one discount rate is applied to
the first stage, and another growth and discount rate to the second. Then, you
calculate net future earnings by first compounding growth over the first stage
and then discounting that value back to the present. A generalized formula,
either indefinite life or acquisition-based, is applied to the second stage. The
value attributed to the second stage is called continuing value. The process will
be discussed next.
Intrinsic Value Models
It’s time to look at the intrinsic value model itself — that’s the best way not
only to get to know the tools but also the concepts. We’ll build one from
scratch as an Excel spreadsheet. At the time of this writing, there is little in
the way of PC- or Web-based models available for use by consumer investors,
but one available from iStockResearch will get a look. 
202
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Model outcomes 
Any time you use a tool, it’s good to know in advance what outcome to expect.
With intrinsic value models, the finished product is simple, but your work as
a value investor isn’t done. Intrinsic value models provide a single-figure
result: the estimated per-share value of the company. One single number. For
example, Simpson Manufacturing may be projected to be worth $34.97. So are
you done? 
If you’re satisfied with this number and the assumptions going into it, you
can compare this intrinsic value with current market price and make a buying
(or selling) decision. More likely, you’ll want to model a range of intrinsic
values based on different assumptions — results can vary widely. Your analy-
sis will produce a range, not a single number. Then, to complete the value
appraisal, you may want to consider strategic financials and intangibles 
(see Chapters 13 and 14) before hitting the buy button.
Three choices
As mentioned, there are three intrinsic value models to consider: 
 Build-your-own model: Using Excel, the worksheet model is fairly easy
to construct; formulas will be shown along with sample results for both
indefinite continuing value and the acquisition assumption.
 Prepackaged Web-based analyzer: At the time of this writing, the data
and analysis package offered by iStockResearch (www.istock
research.com) is the best free option available. 
 Intrinsic value formula as developed by Ben Graham in Security
Analysis (discussed in Chapter 3): This simple formula is easy to 
apply and gives surprisingly robust results. 
Getting Started: The Intrinsic 
Value Worksheet
With a spreadsheet and a few initial assumptions, you can build your own
intrinsic value worksheet for either “continuing value” assumption. Figure 12-1
shows an example of the “indefinite life” continuing value model, with formu-
las to help you build your own. Note that dollar figures, except per share
amounts, are in millions.

Step 1: Growth and discount assumptions
Not surprisingly, here at the very top of the worksheet is where you can do the
most damage — or the most good — to your analysis. Those of you familiar
with the time value of money and the power of compounding readily recognize
the potential effects of these assumptions carried over 10, 15, or 20 years.
The most realistic way to model intrinsic value is to choose two stages: a
more rapid initial growth stage and a more conservative, or flat, second
stage. So two growth rates are chosen, and two corresponding discount 
rates are chosen. Almost always, the initial growth rate exceeds the second
stage growth rate, while, due to uncertainty, the second stage discount rate
exceeds the initial one. 
Choosing a growth assumption
You’re thinking that you can’t even pick a show horse for the next race, and
you’re being asked to choose business growth assumptions from now to eter-
nity? Scary stuff, for sure. You can rely on outside sources such as analysts or
Value Line. You can eyeball the numbers yourself and pick a number that
makes sense, even with conservative bias. Or you can dig deeper and do
what most professional analysts do and derive earnings growth estimates by
projecting sales, profitability, productivity, and so on. The point is, you need
a number — a number you feel comfortable with. Again, it’s art and science.
Table 12-1 identifies approaches to assessing growth rates.

Figure 12-2 is an example of a revenue growth assumption retrieved from
Yahoo! Finance for Simpson Manufacturing. Note that this Yahoo! Finance
figure represents projected revenue growth as a percentage, so to project
earnings growth, one must assume that revenue growth and expense growth
run in lockstep. If that isn’t the case, you’ll want to make your own expense
growth projection, which will in turn modify the earnings growth forecast. 
Yahoo! Finance and many other sources also project future earnings per
share, not as a growth percentage but as actual per-share amounts. You can
derive earnings growth assumptions from these figures also. We will now
share examples of three resources we used to get growth assumptions. 
Don’t be afraid to check other resources for growth projections, including
Value Line, Morningstar, and assorted analyst reports. Regardless of how you
decide to formulate your growth assumptions, it is important to be consis-
tent. Comparing two businesses by using different approaches to growth and
discounting assumptions can lead to trouble.

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

First- and second-stage growth
The tools and techniques just presented are useful for projecting first-stage
growth, but start to fall apart when assessing second-stage growth. Not even
the most self-assured analysts try to pin down growth rates beyond ten years! 
Be careful, as excessive second-stage growth rates will really distort results
because so much time is involved. And no matter what the company is,
sooner or later it will exhaust market growth and penetration opportunities.
Second-stage growth rates should be less than first-stage growth rates and
less than 10 percent, probably no more than 5 or 6 percent. Conservative is
always better.
If you’re uncomfortable with second-stage growth rates and their effect on
valuation (and many investors are), you can use the acquisition model pre-
sented later in this chapter. Although this model implies that an acquisition
will take place, it can also be used to reduce sensitivity to input assumptions
even if acquisition is unlikely.
Choosing a discount assumption
This part is tricky, and there is no easy or exact answer.
In theory, the discount rate should be your own personal cost of capital for
this kind of investment. If you have a million bucks and can invest it with no
risk in a Treasury bond at 6 percent, your cost of capital is the risk-free 6 per-
cent you would forgo by not investing in the bond. So the implied cost of
your dollars made available to invest in Business XYZ starts at 6 percent.
Financial types refer to this opportunity cost as the risk-free cost of capital.
But implicitly, Company XYZ common stock is riskier than the bond invest-
ment. Sales, earnings, and myriad other intrinsic things can change, as can
markets and the market perception of XYZ’s worth. So an equity premium is
added to the risk-free cost of capital rate. In effect, the total cost of capital 
is your required compensation, or hurdle, for the opportunity you’ve lost by
not buying the bond, plus the assumption of risk by investing in XYZ.
Here’s where we depart from the stacks of research papers and finance text-
books. Much has gone into identifying appropriate risk premiums and the
like. Modern portfolio theory and its reliance on beta — a measure of relative
stock price volatility — doesn’t really do much for most value investors.
(Remember: Price doesn’t determine value.)
The keep-it-simple approach used by most value investors, including Warren
Buffett, is to discount at a relatively high rate, usually higher than the growth
rate. Buffett uses 15 percent as a discount, or “hurdle” rate — investments
must clear a 15 percent “hurdle” before clearing the bar. The 15 percent hurdle
incorporates a lot of risk, especially in today’s environment of relatively low
interest rates and inflation. Conservative value investors usually use discount
rates in the 10 to 15 percent range. 
207
Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

As you build and run models, you’ll see firsthand how the discount rate
affects the resulting intrinsic value. Here are a few points to remember:
 The higher the discount rate, the lower the intrinsic value — and 
vice versa.
 The second-stage discount rate should always be higher than the first
stage. Risk increases the farther out you go.
 If you choose an aggressive growth rate, it makes sense also to choose a
higher discount rate. Risk of failure is higher with high growth rates.
 If the discount rate exceeds the growth rate, intrinsic value will be low
and implode more quickly the larger the gap. Aggressive growth assump-
tions with low discount rates yield very high intrinsic values. 
If you’re worried about earnings and earnings growth consistency and want
to factor it in somehow, but don’t want to do a deep statistical analysis on 
a zillion numbers, Value Line does one for you. At the bottom right corner 
of the Value Line Investment Survey sheet is a figure called “Earnings
Predictability” if the Survey covers the company you’re evaluating. 
It’s really a statistical predictability score normalized to 100 (100 is best, 0 is
worst). A score of 80 and higher indicates relative safety; below 80 means
that you may want to attenuate growth rates or bump up the discount rate 
to account for uncertainty. 
Here again is the set of growth and discount assumptions used for this exam-
ple. Consistency is important, but growth rates will vary for each company,
and discount rates may change also with differing risk assessments.

Step 2: Earnings, shares outstanding, EPS
Now that the all-important growth and discount assumptions are made, the
rest of the worksheet, even with formulas, is relatively simple. 
Earnings, number of shares, and EPS come straight from the statements. It’s
best to use “fully diluted” earnings and share counts, but in any case, to be
consistent. This model projects total, rather than per share, earnings streams
to make it easier to subtract out (not per share) long-term debt (which hap-
pens to be zero for Simpson). 
208
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

When loading beginning earnings, remember to adjust for one-time or extra-
ordinary gains or charges.
Step 3: Calculate ten-year earnings stream
This section projects growth during each year of the first stage and then dis-
counts the resulting value back to the present. The spreadsheet formulas are
straightforward:
For each year
Multiply beginning earnings by [(1 + g1)n]
where g1 is the first-stage growth rate
and n is the sequential future year.
Then
Divide that figure by [(1 + d1)n]
where d1 is the first-stage discount rate.
The resulting figures represent projected earnings for each year, discounted
to the present. Remember again, these dollar figures, except per-share
amounts, are in millions.
Year 1
$100.67
Year 2
$98.87
Year 3
$97.11
Year 4
$95.37
Year 5
$93.67
Year 6
$92.00
Year 7
$90.35
Year 8
$88.74
Year 9
$87.16
Year 10
$85.60
The fact that projected earnings, discounted back to the present, decline over
the next 10 years is okay, even though a 10 percent growth rate is assumed.
Why? Because the discount rate, 12 percent, is higher. This is a conservative
scenario. Simpson is a moderately slow growing company, and being in the
construction materials business, is subject to business cycles. 
209
Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

Step 4: Total discounted return, first ten years
The sum of the first 10 years discounted earnings stream is arrived at simply
by summing the figure for each year. The resulting figure represents the total
discounted value of first stage:
Step 5: Continuing value
Higher math enters the picture in calculating a continuing value for all future
returns, ostensibly from here to eternity. Avoiding the mathematical basis for
the approximation, here’s the formula:
[E × (1 + g1)n +1] ÷ (d2 – g2) all divided by (1+d1)n
where 
E is beginning earnings
g1 and d1 are first-stage growth and discount rates, respectively
g2 and d2 are second-stage growth and discount rates, respectively
n is the number of years in the first stage; in this case, 10
Once this formula is entered into your worksheet, the computation is simple.
The resulting single value approximates discounted value of all future returns
for the business beyond the first stage:
Continuing value beyond 10 years = $941.59 million
Step 6: Total discounted future returns value
The next step is to add first-stage and second-stage continuing discounted
value — $929.54 million and $941.59 million to get $1,871.13 million.
Step 7: Long-term debt adjustment
To arrive at true value, long debt must be taken away from earnings. For all
practical purposes, Simpson has no long-term debt — you could subtract
$0.4 million if desired, but it wouldn’t change the result much. 
Step 8: Net future returns value
Net of long-term debt, this is the total intrinsic value, based on future returns,
of our business: $1,871.13 million.
Step 9: Per-share intrinsic value
Now, finally, the bottom line. Divide net future returns value by the number 
of shares outstanding to get a per-share intrinsic value. This is the magic
number to compare with market price and to compare to other companies:
$38.26. 
210
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

The market price at the time this figure was derived was $33, suggesting some
potential price growth in the stock. 
You’re done!
Working with the worksheet: 
The acquisition assumption
If the continuing value formula makes you nervous, and if the idea behind it —
trying to project to eternity — makes you equally nervous, there is another
approach. The approach is to assume that someone else will buy the busi-
ness at a fair value at the end of the first stage. In essence, you get continuing
value in a lump sum payment, which, of course, must also be discounted for
time value of money.
Before showing the model, here are a few important points:
 Growth and discount assumptions are the same as for the indefinite life
model.
 The price paid by the acquirer is the key assumption that makes or
breaks this model. That price is calculated as a ratio of price to book
value, or P/B. Earnings during the first stage grow the base book value.
You then supply an assumption of what price to book value is appropri-
ate ten years down the road and use that to determine the cash-out
price.
Earnings paid out as dividends don’t accrue to long-term book value and
should be backed out of the earnings stream used to grow book value.
Net share buybacks should also be backed out. 
 Because book value is already net-of-debt, long-term debt doesn’t need
to be factored in.
Figure 12-3 shows a ten-year acquisition version of the intrinsic value 
worksheet.
If you followed the indefinite life version, this will be fairly straightforward.
Growth and discount assumptions are the same. Base values are share price
and per-share book value, which are used to calculate an initial price to book
ratio. A diluted per-share-earnings figure is then used as a base for growth
and discounting.
211
Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

The book value is assumed to increase by each year’s grown and discounted
earnings. If there are dividends or significant share buybacks, subtract them
out — they will not “accrete” to book value — but you may want to value
them as a separate discounted income stream. The formula for growing earn-
ings and discounting to the present is the same, except here it is applied to
per-share earnings instead of total earnings.

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

To model the value in Year 10, when the supposed acquisition takes place,
here is a short tour through the steps:
Steps 1 and 2. Just as with the indefinite life model, make your growth
and discounting assumptions and look up key figures on the financial
statements. Estimate the annual accretion of earnings to book value, 
but subtract dividends and other shareholder payments. 
Steps 3 and 4. Model the incremental book value per share per year by
growing and then discounting the per-share net earnings over the 10
years, much like the indefinite life model. 
Step 5. Take current book value and assume that it remains intact 10 years
from now. Then discount the value back to the present to get an apples-
to-apples view of all components of Year 10 book value. One benefit of
this version of the model is that some value is explicitly placed on pro-
ductive assets already owned by the business.
Step 6. Total the estimated 10-year book value.
Step 7. Now comes the fun part: figuring out the acquisition price based
on the P/B ratio. What P/B should you use? It depends on the type of
business, what other comparable acquisitions show, and your own intu-
ition. Today’s P/B ratio is a place to start, although if it is much higher
than 1.0, there’s a tendency for the ratio to decline over time as growth
patterns settle and the company matures. Any P/B ratio exceeding 3 is
probably excessive. In a manufacturing business like Simpson, a P/B of
2.0 is probably reasonable, because book values of productive physical
assets tend to be low. If we were valuing a financial institution, with assets
mainly in cash and receivables, the “model” P/B would likely be lower. If 
a technology company, perhaps higher. 
Step 8. Multiply the total 10-year book value by acquisition P/B and, voilà,
you get intrinsic value. In this example, the intrinsic value is $34.43, again
higher but not much higher than the stock’s current price. If you factor in
dividends, however, the true value of the investment increases. 
So, depending on how you set the assumptions, the indefinite life model and
ten-year acquisition models yield similar results. That isn’t a big surprise, for
acquiring firms are (or should be) looking for the same kinds of intrinsic value
characteristics that you are. 
The iStockResearch Model
As fundamental as intrinsic value modeling may seem, it’s surprising how few
tools are available for individual “consumer” investors to put it into play. Such
models are commonly used by value-oriented investing professionals, but,
possibly due to their complexity and sticky assumptions like discount rates,
they haven’t hit the mainstream.

Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value

The first edition of Value Investing For Dummies referenced a stock analyzer
offered by Intuit’s Quicken, available both in the software package of that name
and online. It is no longer available. The best tool now available, offered as a
standalone Web site by Canadian-born and educated CFA (Chartered Financial
Analyst) Alexander Chepakovich, is called “iStockResearch,” and is available at
www.istockresearch.com. 
The iStockResearch model is similar to the indefinite life model offered in this
chapter, but is more complete. First, the site contains the financial data for
most major U.S. companies, so you don’t have to find it yourself. Second,
rather than a split first- and second-stage growth pattern, the model allows a
yearly decline or “decay” in growth rates — perhaps more realistic. Finally, it
factors in stock option grants (the earlier models did not) and it supplies a
recommended discount rate based on current economic conditions and the
industry the company is part of.
The results, as shown in Figure 12-4, are similar to the other models. Simpson
Manufacturing is found to have an intrinsic value of $34.97 based on default
assumptions. The model calculated a much lower growth rate than we used
but also used a lower discount rate. You can modify the growth and discount
assumptions as you choose to get a range of acceptable modeling results.
The site is free and easy to use, and gives a complete set of raw financial data
to help in other analysis. We highly recommend this site and set of tools for
beginning and more experienced value investors. 
The Ben Graham Model
Finally, and perhaps most simply, it’s worth checking out intrinsic value
through the eyes of Ben Graham, based on his 1930s formula:
Intrinsic value = Earnings × [(2 × growth rate) + 8.5] × [4.4 ÷ bond yield]
Figure 12-4:

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Well — how about this — a simple straight-line formula, no exponents, no
first- and second-stage stuff, no discount rate? Could it work? Take a look 
at figures for Simpson Manufacturing: 
Intrinsic value = 2.10 × [(2 × 10%) + 8.5] × [4.4 ÷ 6%]
By way of explanation, the first-stage growth rate is used, as Graham calls for.
Assuming a 6 percent corporate bond yield and that the $2.10 in earnings is a
solid base, the model gives an initial intrinsic value of 
$43.89
This figure is higher than those derived from other models, but the Graham
model — and thus this figure — assumes that all earnings are reinvested pro-
ductively in the business. Simpson pays a dividend, which is good for share-
holders, but those funds, in reality, aren’t reinvested. If the model is run on a
net-of-dividends earnings base of $1.70, the resulting intrinsic value is $35.53.
But the dividends do have value to you as a shareholder, right? The present
value of a 40-cent per share dividend received in each of the next 10 years 
is $2.46. 
So the truest Graham-model intrinsic value estimate comes out at $35.53 +
$2.46, or $37.99, very much in range of the other estimates. 
By the way, this example speaks to the wisdom of reinvesting earnings in a
business if there are productive ways to do so. 
So the Graham model, derived from the more complex model but philosophi-
cally aligned to it, can be used as computational shorthand. It doesn’t allow
for stages and uses a more simplistic discounting assumption. And, it can
produce the same wide range of results as the other models. But it is a good
shortcut — one you may be able to do in your head when looking at a
number of investment choices.

Chapter 12: Running the Numbers: Intrinsic Value
Book value and intrinsic value
A final note to help lock down the notion of
intrinsic value comes in another Warren Buffett
observation. Apparently tired of answering
questions about how to use book value to make
investment decisions, Buffett pointed out the
difference between book value and intrinsic
value: “Book value is what the owners put into
the business, intrinsic value is what they take
out of it.” In another explanation offered in a
1996 Berkshire Hathaway annual report, he
likened book value to college tuition paid, with
intrinsic value being the income resulting from
the education. The education and the dollars
spent on an education mean nothing unless
there is a resulting financial return. The point:
It’s easy for investors put too much emphasis on
book value and not enough on intrinsic value.

 Exploring a framework for assessing strategic financials 
C
hapter 12 shows that profits and growth drive intrinsic value. For any
fairly priced asset to increase in value over time, the value of the returns
must grow. Whether or not you indulge in intrinsic value calculations, be
aware that earnings and growth do matter. The time value of money and the
value of alternatives do matter. When you look at a business, you seek consis-
tent, growing returns on a quality asset base — achieving reasonable returns 
without taking on unreasonable risk. 
If it isn’t easy to pin down growth and the value of growth, it gets a little easier
to step back and identify business characteristics that drive growth. Sustained
return on equity (ROE) implies sustained growth and blares out, “well-
managed company!” This chapter examines ROE and its component drivers:
profitability, productivity, and capital structure. These strategic financials
represent knobs and levers that management can control to achieve growth,
ROE, and, hence, intrinsic value. 
This chapter shows how ROE and its component drivers all work together
through a financial formula known as the strategic profit formula. This formula
breaks ROE down into component parts, which can then be separately ana-
lyzed for better understanding. That understanding includes a look at the 
factors — financial and intangible — that drive each component. At the end
of the day, you can use a checklist to evaluate ROE and its drivers. 

The Importance of ROE
ROE is, when all is said and done, a capitalist’s bottom line. Simply, it repre-
sents the return on owner’s equity invested in the business. As a practical
matter, it’s a good barometer for determining whether the company is on the
right track and whether management is doing a good job and acting in the
interest of its shareholders — although it can be jiggered somewhat through
accounting policy and practice.
Comparing ROE and intrinsic value
Unlike intrinsic value, ROE from the beginning doesn’t purport to estimate
the value of a company. You can’t go through a series of calculations culmi-
nating in a per-share value estimate. But ROE — and its components — can
tell whether things are healthy and moving in the right direction. Although
intrinsic value is an absolute measure of company value, ROE and its compo-
nents tend to be relative to past performance and to the performance of
other businesses.
Using a real estate analogy, intrinsic value represents the physical value of a
property — land, lumber, labor — and its ability to generate rents or other
economic benefits to the owner now and in the future. Strategic value, or
ROE, deals more with location, cost, and capital efficiency (the financial and
intangible attributes of a property that generate success), and how that suc-
cess may be viewed by the market and especially as compared to other 
alternatives. 
Another way to look at the difference: Intrinsic value explicitly looks forward
into the income-producing capability of the firm in the long run, while strate-
gic valuation is primarily a snapshot of the present, albeit with many compo-
nents that can predict future performance. 
This isn’t to imply that intrinsic and strategic value aren’t connected. As in
the adage, “where there’s smoke, there’s fire,” where there’s ROE, there’s
intrinsic value. Likewise, where there’s sustained ROE, solid and improving
strategic financials and intangibles lurk just below the surface. 
ROE versus ROTC
ROTC? A connection between military service and value investing? No, no
images of value investors marching around parade grounds in brightly col-
ored uniforms, please. 
218
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

ROTC, or return on total capital, is another measure of owner returns, which
has gained popularity recently. The difference, obviously, is the denominator
“TC,” or total capital, vs. the “E,” or equity. 
Total capital is owner’s equity plus long-term debt. Using the more “holistic”
total capital gives a more complete measure of business performance; that is,
how much the company is earning on its total investment, including borrowed
funds. ROTC helps investors see through the effects of leverage. If a company
is growing ROE but not ROTC, chances are, the company is doing it by borrow-
ing to fund growth-producing assets, thus leveraging the company (this can
be a good thing in moderation). So many investors look at ROTC and ROE
together. They should march side by side and change in unison. Some informa-
tion sources like Yahoo! Finance and Value Line list both figures simultaneously.
The Strategic Value Chain
ROE may appear to be a single number, but in fact there’s a complex “chain of
events” or set of factors underlying the figure. A series of business fundamen-
tals, all linked together, leads to respectable, sustained, and growing ROE.
That “strategic value” chain will become clearer in the strategic profit formula,
to be presented momentarily. 
219
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials
Growing to stay the same?
On the surface, a steady ROE would appear to
indicate a ho-hum business. Same old, same
old, year in and year out. But the truth is quite
different. Many investors, Warren Buffett him-
self included, get pretty excited when they see
steady ROE over a number of years, particularly
when already at a high level, say, greater than
15 percent. 
Why?
ROE is defined as net earnings divided by
owner’s equity. What happens to net earnings,
each year, in well-managed companies? They
become part of owner’s equity as retained earn-
ings. Then, over time, the denominator of the
ROE equation goes up, as earnings become
equity (unless a portion of earnings are paid out
as dividends). That brings the following impor-
tant observations: 
 Maintaining a constant ROE percentage
requires steady earnings growth.
 A company with increasing ROE, without
undue exposure to debt or leverage, is
especially attractive.
In fact, over time, ROE trends towards the earn-
ings growth rate of the company. A company
with a 5 percent earnings growth rate and a 20
percent ROE today will see ROE gradually dimin-
ish toward 5 percent. A company with a 20 per-
cent earnings growth rate and a 10 percent ROE
will see ROE move toward 20 percent, as the
numerator grows faster than the denominator.

Strategic fundamentals
The links in the strategic value chain consist of the business fundamentals
that directly influence ROE and are controlled or influenced by management.
The links are profitability, productivity, and capital structure. When all three
are strong and tight, ROE outcome is destined for success. If there is a “weak-
est link” (a business fundamental that is poor, failing, or declining), it can
weaken the entire chain and hamper ROE indefinitely. 
Strategic fundamentals are manageable business fundamentals that manage-
ment can influence or control to maintain or increase ROE.
And now, the formula
Although this formula surfaces in business schools around the country, it
owes its origins to the real world. Some years back, it originated in the
finance department at DuPont. It’s called the “strategic profit formula” and, 
in some circles, the “DuPont formula.”
Return on equity = [profits/sales] × [sales/assets] × [assets/equity]
It’s easy to see the links in the chain: profitability, productivity, and capital
structure, in sequence. Good managers work on each one, and we talk about
how to do so in a minute. 
You may observe the resemblance between this formula to one of those high
school chemistry or physics formulas in which you take the numerator on the
first term and the denominator on the last term and cancel out everything in
between. Only here, intermediate terms aren’t cancelled out because they tell
us so much about the health of the business. For each intermediate term in
the formula, we observe its value, in what direction it’s going (trend), and
how it compares to others in the industry. See Figure 13-1.

ROE value chain components
You probably guessed that each element in the ROE equation has its own
component drivers. That is, specific business attributes and characteristics
drive profitability, productivity, and capital structure. Each equation compo-
nent forms a major link in the value chain, and those components have a
causal “chain” of their own.
For instance, strategic financials such as gross margins and expenses drive
profitability. Asset levels, quality, and turnover drive productivity, while debt
and new capital requirements drive capital structure. Then, in turn working
back up the value chain, such strategic intangibles as market position, cus-
tomer “share” and loyalty, brand strength, and supply chain strength drive
those margins and expenses. 
Figure 13-2 illustrates the strategic value chain. ROE, the result, is shown as 
a result or outcome at the right-hand side of the figure. Working backward
toward the left, the figure lists a few examples of value chain components
that drive ROE components and thus ROE. They’re grouped into strategic
financials — measurable financial factors — and strategic intangibles —
mostly nonmeasurable market and business characteristics that drive them.
Strategic financials are covered in this chapter and in Chapter 10, while
strategic intangibles are explored in Chapter 14.

Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

The value investor works backward through the ROE value chain to find good
or bad in ROE drivers and the things that influence those drivers. It’s a good
framework to analyze a business, and the checklist offered at the end of this
chapter will help. 
Value investing approaches buying a stock in much the same manner as
buying a business. Now that premise should become quite clear. Breaking
down the strategic value chain, you quickly see how value investing requires
an understanding of not only the financial fundamentals but also the market
and business fundamentals that drive them. As an investor, you need to wear
a marketing and management hat, not just a financial one. Hope it fits!
Quality checks
If you apply for a job, you may have to take a drug test. Does passing the
drug test mean that you get the job? Nope. Does failing the drug test mean
that you won’t get the job? You bet. So how does this apply to investing?
When you look at strategic financials and fundamentals, some characteristics
of the business are normally expected to be okay, but if they’re off course,
they may raise red flags. They can be looked at as sort of a final quality check.
For example, low debt doesn’t necessarily indicate high value, but frequent
trips to the capital markets for debt or stock sales may indicate capital star-
vation and “un-value.” And continuing with the drug test metaphor, the “sub-
stances” you “test” frequently are addictive to bad management: overuse of
acquisitions, write-offs and write-downs, debt, and stock sales, which are
used to pad numbers and fix problems arising from bad performance.
It’s a good idea to do such “drug tests,” or quality checks, for each of the pri-
mary ROE components. These quality checks are usually painless pass/fail
tests, not detailed assessments.
The Simpson Example
Now, back to the Simpson Manufacturing example to take apart ROE and the
strategic value chain. Figure 13-3 shows a sample ROE breakdown based on
five years of data for Simpson.
Where the facts come from
The set of numbers in Figure 13-3 provides all that’s needed to start a strate-
gic financial analysis for Simpson. But where do you get these numbers? It
depends on the company and how far back you want to go.
222
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Most 10-K annual reports provide at least three years of historical information
to a level of detail sufficient for the analysis. Some provide more in a backup
table, as Simpson has shown in Figure 13-4. Figure 13-4 is a five-year fact table
containing all data needed for the top-level ROE analysis in Figure 13-3.
As will be shown shortly, this table does not provide enough factual detail for
the more in-depth “deconstruction” of sales-to-assets shown later in the
chapter. Key figures like accounts receivable and inventories aren’t broken
out. So we have to dig into prior annual reports to get the history — not too
difficult a task with today’s availability of annual reports online at company
Web sites. For some analyses, facts provided by Value Line, which shows a lot
of history but perhaps not enough line item detail, will help, and you can also
depend on portals like Yahoo! Finance for some of the basic facts, especially
for a three-year analysis.
Be wary of extraordinary items and write-offs that can corrupt individual
numbers and trends. When asset productivity gains result from cutting out
slop (not from better utilization), it doesn’t count as much. It may be unsus-
tainable and may even mask bad management practice.

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

The components for fiscal year 2006 (dollars in millions):
Profitability: profit/sales = $102.5K ÷ $863.2K, or 11.9%
Productivity: sales/assets = $863.2K ÷ $735.3K, or 1.17 
Capital structure: assets/equity = $735.3K ÷ $652.9K, or 1.13 
Multiply these together, and you get 15.7 percent ROE for the year 2006.
Okay, so now what?
As you become familiar with this analysis, you’ll come to realize that none of
the intermediate ratios — profit/sales, sales/assets, or assets/equity — in and
of themselves, reflect outstanding performance. A quick view of the “competi-
tors” page will show that profit margins are higher than industry averages
but they aren’t outstanding — and it’s hard to find a true direct competitor 
to Simpson. 
Asset productivity and capital structure figures feel good for a manufacturer
from a common sense perspective (assets less than annual sales, debt less
than equity), but closer examination with other manufacturers is a good idea. 
If these figures felt out of line, a deeper analysis would also be revealing —
for instance, is the company using debt to buy back shares or to fund daily
operations? The answer sends strong signals about company health and
intentions. 
What is compelling is the steadiness and slight strengthening in all drivers:
profitability, productivity, and capital structure. The business appears to be
hitting okay on all cylinders in balance, especially given the 2006–2007 down-
turn in construction. Now each ROE driver is examined independently with
comments on important factors within each driver.
Profitability
Profit/sales, or net profit percent, is the primary profitability measure. For
Simpson, growth in net profit percent from 11.2 percent to 11.9 percent in five
years is a good story, but it isn’t the whole story. It’s a better story than just
nominal earnings dollar or EPS growth; it says that the business is becoming
more productive in generating earnings. 
225
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

Financial drivers
When looking at profitability gross margin, SG&A, and operating profit percent
are closely tracked by most investors and analysts. 
Gross margin
Gross margin tells a lot about a business’s success in managing its sales and
direct costs of producing product and services. A company on top of its 
marketing and production game usually produces improving margins. 
But market characteristics and selling aggressiveness can work against mar-
gins. Intuitively, you may guess that increased volumes lead to increased
margins, as fixed costs are absorbed and economies of scale work in their
favor. However, this isn’t always the case. A company often must make price
concessions to achieve sales goals. And aggressive volume building also
takes its toll on operating costs (not part of gross margin) in the form of 
marketing expenses and sometimes interest expense to expand the level 
of business. 
To some extent you must understand the industry in which you want to invest.
Simpson is in the construction industry, notorious for boom-and-bust cycles,
although Simpson has a healthy remodeling and public-sector business
(earthquake retrofits and the like) that somewhat dampen the cycles. One
would expect sales and gross margins to soften during slow years, which
could explain the recent softness in gross margins. As will be seen shortly,
however, Simpson adjusted for the slowness by reducing selling, general, 
and administrative (SG&A) as a percentage, keeping operating margins 
strong and, by the way, signaling competent management. 
Selling, general, and administrative
SG&A, although not directly tied to net profit percent, tells a lot about how
management controls expenses and how expenses are tied to business pro-
duction. SG&A normally includes marketing expenses such as advertising and
customer incentives, in addition to more traditional selling salaries, commis-
sions, and so on. SG&A percentage is the total SG&A cost divided by sales 
or revenues. You typically have to calculate this percentage yourself, as few
information sources provide it directly. It is an important part of total operat-
ing expenses — and thus operating profit percentage. Also be aware that 
different companies define SG&A differently, so look to annual reports for
clarification.
When SG&A increases faster than sales it’s a bad sign, especially in a maturing
industry. Although investors tolerate short-term expenditures in marketing
campaigns, store openings, or technology platforms, these can’t go on for-
ever. Chronic percentage increases in SG&A should be taken as a red flag.
226
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

In fact, if a company is realizing the benefits of economies of scale, SG&A
expenses should grow at a rate less than sales. SG&A growth even matching
sales persistently is a yellow flag. As a general rule, most analysts look for
sustained SG&A growth rates at 80 percent or less of the sales growth rate.
Simpson has managed SG&A well, dropping it from 22.1 percent of sales in
2002 to 19 percent in 2006. If sales rise as construction spending recovers,
one would expect SG&A to decline further as a percentage.
Operating profit
SG&A is part of this important figure, but certainly not all. Depreciation,
amortization, and certain facility and employee costs can all influence operat-
ing expenses. A company in control of gross margin and operating expenses
will show increased operating profit. Even though Simpson endured slightly
deteriorating gross margins, focus on total profitability and tight control of
SG&A and other operating expenses resulted in keeping operating profit 
percentages relatively flat. 
Quality checks 
As with all major ROE components, it’s a good idea to test them for signs of
trouble or inherent weakness. Here are three quality checks for profitability: 
 Overdependence on acquisitions for growth: Companies sometimes
get so caught up in building the top line that they resort to painful and
expensive acquisitions to do it. Profitability usually suffers. 
 Excessive goodwill: Often working hand-in-hand with acquisitions,
growth in goodwill or a growing gap between total stockholder equity
and “net tangible assets” (from Yahoo! Finance Balance Sheet page or
elsewhere) can signal trouble in the form of future write-offs.
 Overdependence on expansion: Growth is good, but if the core business
isn’t growing or is declining, that’s a bad sign. Try to sniff out “organic
growth” — that is, growth not sourced from new outlets (same store
sales, for retail) or from acquisitions. If sales are expanding, but profits
aren’t, it’s a sign that the most recent expansions aren’t working, although
it depends on the industry (a Starbucks outlet will produce returns more
quickly than an aircraft plant). 
 Cash flow and changes in book value march with changes in earnings:
If earnings rise but cash flow doesn’t and book value doesn’t, over time,
one must question the quality of earnings.
227
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

Intangible drivers
There’s more on this in Chapter 14, but it’s worth introducing a few of the key
intangibles driving profitability here, particularly gross margins. Market posi-
tion is a vital influencer. Market leadership, brand dominance, public image,
and pricing power bear the seeds of improved gross margin, while resource
acquisition power directly affects costs, which also defines gross margin.
Businesses dependent on tight markets for supply invariably suffer in prof-
itability, whether because of labor, fuel, money (as in banks), you name it.
As is more closely followed in Chapter 14, Simpson has a dominant position
in the construction materials industry with a virtual lock on the connectors
business. Like Kleenex or Starbucks, the Simpson and “Strong-Tie” brands
have become virtually synonymous with the product, and competition is far
less of an issue than the business cycles in the industry it supports. Supply —
steel — may present an issue, and, like most manufacturers, Simpson does
have to pay attention to its channels of distribution. But for the most part,
marketplace and management strength signals are positive. 
Earnings quality is also an issue, and the quality of financial reporting may
also be considered an intangible attribute of profitability. So a quick spot
check of cash flows and changes in book value as they relate to earnings is
worthwhile. For Simpson, cash flow hasn’t followed earnings too closely
because of inventory changes, but book value growth has followed pretty
closely without large increases in goodwill or other intangibles, suggesting
that financial reporting is fairly robust. 
What to look for
Look for improving profitability measures and be able to explain those that
aren’t improving. You also need to understand market forces and intangibles
that drive profitability factors and look at them as leading indicators of future
performance. Finally, check with the “neighbors” to see how other businesses
in the industry are faring.
Productivity
Productivity measures tell us how well businesses deploy and use assets.
Assets are resources, and when it comes down to it they have a single pur-
pose: generating profitable sales. So you may as well measure how well this is
done. All things considered, a dollar of sales produced on 50 cents worth of
assets is better than the same company producing a dollar of sales on a dollar
of assets. Such an observation shows prima facie asset efficiency and also
228
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

indicates less asset amortization expense later, which in turn increases prof-
its and cash returns to investors. Obviously, asset productivity figures vary
by industry, as different industries require different assets and differing levels
of asset investment to do business. 
Sales/assets is the primary measure of asset productivity, and is simply the
amount of sales generated per asset dollar deployed.
Financial drivers
Simpson did about $1.17 in sales for every dollar deployed in assets. Not too
bad, and in fact comparable to slightly below larger competitors. The trend 
is basically flat if you disregard the 2006 sales growth slowdown, but a closer
look at the numbers (which we’ll get to in a moment) shows a modest inven-
tory increase. That raises a slight caution flag. We’d hope that the amount of
inventory — and thus assets — required to support sales would return to the
trend line, thus bringing the sales/assets ratio closer to 1.3. 
Here are the two traps to avoid when looking at sales/assets:
 Don’t misinterpret changes due to write-offs. If Simpson or any other
company took the plunge to purge a big chunk of overvalued or nonexis-
tent assets from the books, that would show up as an “improvement” in
sales/assets. Not! Be careful to distill major changes in asset deployment
that create no change in the business.
 Don’t read too much into the absolute figures. Sales/assets will be huge
for a Microsoft or an Oracle, reporting high sales on a small asset base,
while a large industrial corporation, railroad, or electric utility requiring
a large asset infrastructure will appear to have poor asset utilization. Be
careful about comparing across industries. Good comparisons — and
trends — are most important.
Deconstructing ROA
Chapter 10 introduces the return on assets, or ROA ratio. Many popular infor-
mation services show ROA. If you’re wondering why ROA doesn’t make the
grade as a first-tier ROE component, here’s why: ROA really does too much.
ROA is net profit divided by total assets, which you’ll recognize as the first two
links in the ROE chain combined. (Here’s the math: ROA, or profit/assets =
profit/sales × sales/assets.) ROA is valid and valuable, but it’s more meaning-
ful to look at the two links separately. 
Why? Because the first measure, profit/sales, has more to do with market
power and cost structures; while the second, sales/assets, has more to do
with resource requirements and deployment. Deconstructing ROA provides 
a more bottoms-up, inside-out view of the business.
229
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

The sharp reader will note that if ROA and profit margin figures are supplied
by an information portal such as Yahoo! Finance or Value Line, one can
deduce total asset productivity. Bad ROA and good margins indicate bad 
productivity, and that will likely catch up with margins sooner or later.
Deconstructing sales/assets
An obvious key to understanding total sales/assets is to assess utilization or
productivity for individual assets making up the total asset base. Accounts
receivable, inventory, and fixed assets are the major links in this value chain
Figure 13-5 shows how you may “take apart” sales/assets.
The analysis is similar to the top-line sales/assets computation. Investors look
at turnover ratios, specifically sales/accounts receivable, sales/inventory, and
sales/fixed assets. (For more, see Chapter 10.) 
Accounts receivable turnover
How many dollars in sales does the business generate per dollar of accounts
receivable investment? A business on top of its receivables generates more
and more, through faster collections and extending less credit altogether. In
2006, Simpson generated $9 in sales for every dollar of receivables — the
highest in 5 years, and significantly higher than the low of $7.80 in 2004.

Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

When examining statements for accounts receivable, use “trade” accounts
receivable — those that arise from and support the normal course of business.
Avoid “other” receivables, which typically arise from sale of a business or spe-
cific agreements to finance customer purchases. Although these financings can
be important to monitor, they don’t come from “business as usual” for most
companies.
Inventory turnover
Inventory turnover works like receivables turnover. A business in control of
finished goods, raw material, and production inventories shows greater sales
per dollar invested in inventory. With the inventory increase mentioned pre-
viously, Simpson sales-to-inventory dipped a bit to 4.0 from 4.7 in 2005 and
figures over 5.0 in 2002–2003. Stated differently, inventory “turns” four times
a year — not too bad for a manufacturer, but the trend bears watching. 
Fixed asset turnover
And another turnover measure, this time for fixed assets or property, plant,
and equipment (PP&E), the Simpson story is pretty steady, but the figure did
dip a bit to $4.40 in sales per dollar of PP&E in 2006 — another figure meriting
comparison with similar businesses and tracking trends. 
You may encounter situations where total sales/assets show only modest
gains, while components show larger improvements, up to 50 percent. In
some cases this can be caused by increased cash, which is also an asset and
part of the denominator base. Of course, increasing cash is normally a good
thing.
Unit productivity measures 
If the figures are available, you can review sales per facility, sales per store,
same-store-sales growth, revenue per mile of track or passenger seat flown,
or sales per square foot, depending on the industry. You can also track sales
per employee, a handy metric for overall efficiency and management compe-
tence. Finding historic data for these factors can be challenging, but such unit
productivity metrics are good for comparing with other firms in the same
industry once you understand them. 
Quality checks 
Asset productivity measures themselves are pretty good at sniffing out qual-
ity problems — if a company has the wrong assets or poor quality assets, it
generally won’t generate as many sales or as much income. Value investors
should look at write-offs and write-off history. If a company seems to always
be writing off some inventory or writing down accounts receivable with
impairment charges and reserves, asset quality may be called into question. 
231
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

Sometimes it’s a more subjective assessment. Do company facilities look
modern and efficient? Does a company keep up with trends in information
technology and supply chain management? These questions can be hard to
answer because they are more intangible, but closely followed businesses
will usually yield some clues. 
Intangible drivers
Many factors support, verify, or could be leading indicators of asset produc-
tivity. As you can see in Chapters 7 through 9, asset quality is greatly influ-
enced by depreciation and amortization policies. Channel structure (direct,
single-tier retail, two-tier wholesale-retail, OEM, or other) can greatly influ-
ence the amount of assets required, particularly receivables and inventory.
And of course, the base nature of the business — the cost structure — can
tell a lot. A steel mill has different asset needs and utilization than a nail salon.
What to look for
Looking at trends within individual metrics makes sense — improving values
at all tiers is a healthy thing. Give special credit to consistent improvement
through business cycles. Depending on the industry, you may balance
emphasis on inventory, accounts receivable, and fixed assets differently. For
example, you may give more attention to inventory and store utilization when
looking at a retailer, while paying more attention to accounts receivable when
evaluating an industrial supplier. And it never hurts to compare companies to
other companies, so long as you’re comparing apples to apples.
Capital Structure
When looking at capital structure, you’re trying to determine two things:
 Is the business a consumer or producer of capital? Does it constantly
require capital infusions to build growth or replace assets? Warren
Buffett — and many other value investors — shun businesses that
cannot generate sufficient capital on their own. In fact, one of the guid-
ing principles behind Berkshire Hathaway is the generation of excess
capital by subsidiary businesses that can be deployed elsewhere.
 Is the business properly leveraged? Overleveraged businesses are at
risk and additionally burden earnings with interest payments. Under-
leveraged businesses, while better than overleveraged, may not be 
maximizing potential returns to shareholders.
232
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Assets/equity
Assets/equity is the primary capital structure metric. Per dollar of owner’s
equity invested, how many dollars of productive assets are deployed in the
business?
For Simpson, approximately $1.13 of assets is deployed for every $1 of owner’s
equity on the books. The figure has stayed more or less steady for five years,
implying no major changes in debt levels — and also implying that cash funds
generated are being reinvested in the business at about the same rate that
they’re being generated. If a company were expanding its asset base faster than
it could pay for the assets with internally generated funds (through debt), the
assets/equity ratio would be growing. So steady, for most businesses, is good. 
Capital sufficiency
Capital-hungry companies are sometimes hard to detect, but there are a few
obvious signs. Companies in capital-intensive industries, such as manufactur-
ing, transportation, or telecommunications, are likely suspects. Here are a
few indicators.
Share buybacks
The number of shares outstanding can be a real simple indicator of a capital-
hungry company. A company using cash to retire shares — if acting sensibly —
is telling you that it generates more capital than it needs. On the other hand,
if you look at a company like IBM, ROE has grown substantially, and massive
share buybacks are a major reason. 
When evaluating share buybacks, make sure to look at actual shares out-
standing. Relying on company news releases alone can be misleading.
Companies also buy back shares to support employee incentive programs 
or to accumulate shares for an acquisition. Such repurchases may be okay
but aren’t the kind of repurchases that increase return on equity for remain-
ing owners.
Cash flow ratio
Recall from Chapter 10 the cash flow ratio, where you see whether cash flow
from operations is enough to meet investing requirements (capital assets
being the main form of investment) and financing requirements (in this case,
the repayment of debt). If not, it’s back to the capital markets. This figure is
pretty elusive unless you have — and study — statements of cash flow. 
233
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

Lengthening asset cycles
If accounts receivable collection periods and inventory holding periods are
lengthening (number of days’ sales in accounts receivable and inventory —
see Chapter 10), that forewarns the need for more capital.
Working capital 
A company requiring steady increases in working capital to support sales
requires, naturally, capital. Working capital is capital. 
Leverage
Leverage and debt assessments are perpetually subjective and are discussed
continuously by financial and credit analysts. Some debt is usually regarded
as a good thing, for it expands the size of the business and hence the return
on owner capital. But too much is too much. Where do you draw the line?
Guiding principles include comparative analysis and vulnerability to down-
turns. Debt must always be paid back, whether business is good or not — 
so debt stops being okay when it’s too large to cover during a downturn or
business strategy change.
Here are a couple of supporting metrics:
Debt to equity
This old standard is commonly used to get a feel for indebtedness, particu-
larly in comparison with the rest of an industry. The calculation is simple —
total long-term debt divided by equity. The Simpson story is healthy, with
only $338,000 in long-term debt beyond the portion currently due, against
$652.9 million in equity — the company is virtually debt-free. 
As a consumer, you know such a debt to equity ratio well below 1 percent 
is healthy, and so it is for most businesses too. But business analysts may
wonder if Simpson could produce a greater return by borrowing and putting
more assets in play. Evidently management has decided that it isn’t worth it,
so hasn’t. That’s a better decision than borrowing funds to make the wrong
investments. The investor is left to agree or disagree with management’s
judgment, but debt-free companies — just like debt-free consumers — come
out ahead more often.
Interest coverage
One way to look at whether a business has the right amount of debt is to look
at how much of its earnings are consumed to pay interest on it. Interest cov-
erage is the ratio of earnings to annual interest, a rough indication of how 
solvent or burdened a company is by debt. 
234
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

When looking at interest coverage, a good question to ask is this: What hap-
pens to coverage if, say, business (sales) drops 20 percent, as in a deep 
recession? 
Quality checks 
One could develop a large quality checklist in this category. In fact, the older
Depression-influenced checklists of Ben Graham and followers placed great
emphasis on financial strength, liquidity, debt coverage, and so on. It was the
tune of the times. Credit analysts today continue to check all manner of cov-
erage and debt ratios, but for most companies reporting a profit, it may be
overkill. Still, a few checks provide a margin of safety and a further test of
whether the company has an insatiable demand for capital:
 Are current assets (besides cash) rising faster than the business is
growing? This ties to the asset productivity and turnover measures 
discussed earlier in this chapter, but it’s worth one last check to see
whether a company is buying business by extending too much credit.
More receivables result from extending credit, while losing channel
structure and supply chain battles (customers and distributors won’t
carry inventory; suppliers are making them carry more inventory) result
in increased inventories. This could be a problem with Simpson. In a soft
construction environment, distributors and retailers like Home Depot
and Lowe’s simply aren’t taking as much inventory, pushing it back up
the supply chain. The risk is greater capital requirements and expensive
impairments downstream. 
 Is debt growing faster than the business? Over a sustained period, debt
rising faster than business growth is a problem. If the owners won’t kick
in to grow the business, and if retained earnings aren’t sufficient to meet
growth, what does that tell you? 
 Repeated trips to the financial markets? If the business continually has
to approach the capital markets (other than in startup phases), that
again is a sign that internally generated earnings and cash flows aren’t
sufficient. Once in a while it’s okay, but again you’re looking to weed out
chronic capital consumers.
Intangibles
Several intangibles enter in here — some specific, some conceptual. Credit
ratings and changes in credit ratings are a good place to start. Declining
credit ratings mean that someone somewhere is less secure with the capital
structure as currently deployed. Capital intensity is another, particularly
235
Chapter 13: Running the Numbers: Strategic Financials

changes in capital intensity. The semiconductor business happily churning
out DRAM becomes less happy when equipment must be replaced with more
expensive equipment more often. 
A company that faces its finances head on is in better shape than one that
plays games, delays write-downs, uses “good” debt to finance “bad” assets,
and the like. Companies shouldn’t borrow long term to finance short-term
working capital increases, such as inventory. Nor should companies borrow
short term to finance long-term assets — doing so reflects some impairment
in the ability to borrow long term. Some companies may also use gimmicks 
to avoid showing long-term debt, anything from off-balance sheet entities to
short-term notes or payables where long-term debt may have been more
appropriate. There are specific indicators and a lot of general ones, such as
the thickness of 10-K reports mentioned in Chapter 6, the tone of press cover-
age, the departure of CFOs, and so forth.
What to look for
Again — this can’t be said enough — look for signs that the company will be
a healthy user and producer — and not a chronic consumer — of capital.
Trends, comparisons, quality checks, and a good understanding of “goes-
inta’s and goes-outa’s,” particularly from the statement of cash flows, are
good to have.
Finally — A Sample
Finally, all analysis works better if you have a framework and an example to
work with. To that end, Figure 13-6 shows a sample strategic financial analy-
sis for Simpson Manufacturing. 
The format and structure of the analysis is a matter of personal preference —
you can follow the model shown or create one of your own. Many experienced
investors shun the spreadsheet in favor of specific tests of favorite numbers,
or numbers telling of the industry, such as asset utilization in a capital inten-
sive industry.
Finding an approach that works best for you is part of developing your value
investing style.

Big green in Big Blue
One of the best ways to understand a concept
or approach to investing is by example. It’s hard
to find a “pure” example of strategic financial
excellence culminating in a world-class ROE
performance. A search of typical “value” busi-
nesses, including Simpson Manufacturing or
even in the Buffett/Berkshire portfolio, yields
mostly mixed results. Companies may perform
well and indeed have ROE in their sights, but dif-
ficult business conditions or changing markets
make actual performance in all areas and “dri-
vers” a mixed bag. 
The first edition of Value Investing For Dummies
identified IBM as a standout ROE performer,
both in actual ROE performance and in man-
agement dedication to the task. The numbers
still show IBM to be an ROE superstar. 
Using Value Line as the source, IBM’s ROE was
a paltry 5 percent in the 1991–1993 timeframe.
At that point, now-retired chairman and CEO
Louis Gerstner took over. Through a balanced
combination of profitability, productivity, and
capital structure initiatives, ROE rose quickly to
the 20–25 percent range in 1995, and has been
over 30 percent for most years since. Even
maintaining ROE at a steady figure requires per-
formance improvement, unless all returns are
paid to shareholders.
Share buybacks have been one of the keys to
ROE performance. When Gerstner took over,
IBM had about 2.3 billion shares outstanding.
Today, that figure hovers at about 1.5 billion —
IBM has retired about a third of its shares.
Meanwhile, per-share cash flow has risen from
about $3 to over $10 per share.
Looking at IBM’s track record, it’s clear that
Gerstner placed particular emphasis on man-
aging ROE and its components. He managed the
owner’s bottom line — not just sales growth,
earnings reports, and image. He took the con-
cept of ROE to heart.

W
arren Buffett famously said, “If you gave me $100 billion and said,
‘Take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world,’ I’d
give it back to you and say it can’t be done.” This quote underlies the
essence of Chapter 14 — the difference between a business and a mere set 
of assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. 
Chapter 14 may spell relief for those of you who slogged along through the
numbers stuff in Chapters 12 and 13. This chapter deals with the more intu-
itive, cerebral, right-brained world of marketing and management intangibles.
You’ll learn to think like an owner and manager of a whole business, not just a
set of numbers. 
So why are intangibles so important? Because so much of what makes excel-
lent businesses excellent transcends the arcane world of factories, store-
fronts, products, and packages. Anyone can make a hamburger, a cup of
coffee, or a beverage with water, sugar, and a few flavorings. Anybody with a
few tens of millions can start an airline or retail chain. But everyone knows
that there’s something more that turns the McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Coca-
Colas of the world into the great businesses they are. That “something” is the
set of intangibles that go with the business. Intangibles are often the greatest,
most powerful, and most productive set of assets any company can own. 
Really, it’s the difference between “viable” — or even “good” — and “great,”
the difference between Michael Jordan and all those other guys. Although the
original Ben Graham value school set its sights on cheap, safe assets, the
evolved Buffett school goes beyond that to identify, appreciate, and appraise
the intangibles that make great businesses great. The words of the late money

manager and Buffett disciple George Michaelis, discussing newspapers and
television stations, say it all: “Such businesses tend to have a high return on
book equity. Why? Because they are earning not only on their tangible assets
but on the intangible ones as well.”
Intangibles come in all shapes and sizes. Every company has different intangi-
bles. This chapter discusses marketing and management tenets that separate
“great” from “good.” Marketing tenets include franchise, brand, position, and
customer power. Management tenets include competence, independence, and
style. Ownership — who owns the company and especially whether manage-
ment “eats its own cooking” — are important. These intangibles are clearly
strategic in the creation of value in the business and return for the sharehold-
ers. And most of them can be controlled or influenced by a good management
team and strategic vision. This chapter gives a framework for appraising a
company’s intangible value. 
Good to Great
It isn’t often that one book writer borrows a title from another, but here it’s
irresistible. The famous Jim Collins book was aimed at corporate managers,
but clearly it gives a good model for investing, too. Following the premise
that investing should be approached like buying and owning a business, we’d
only want to buy a “great” business, right? So separating the great from the
good, as Collins does, becomes a first priority. 
Lollapalooza
What’s that word again? You’ve come all the way from “compounded, dis-
counted returns on investment” to “lollapalooza.” Lollapalooza effects are 
the “really big effects that come from large combinations of factors.” Charlie
Munger used the term and defined it this way for an executive seminar to
describe the ascent and future of Coca-Cola. Engineers use it to describe
flight, doctors use it to describe treatments, and art critics use it to explain
the success of really great art. We follow Munger’s path to learn to evaluate
the “whole is greater than the sum of the parts” synergies that really great
intangibles add to really great businesses.
Lollapalooza (noun, slang) is defined as an extraordinary or unusual thing,
person, or event, or an exceptional example of something.

Beyond the numbers
So far, we’ve reviewed mainly quantitative methods for evaluating businesses.
But now, quantifying intangibles is at best elusive, and really for the most
part beside the point. Such things as market share, degree of management
ownership, and control can be quantified. But these numbers are merely
details. The point is to size up marketing and management phenomena and
assess the lollapalooza potential as it may help the business. Market and 
customer psychology, history, and corporate personality finally move to
center stage. 
Like other parts of the value framework, status, trends, and industry compar-
isons are important. But happily at last, you’re onto something that the human
mind can do better than a desktop PC.
Leading indicators
Intangibles should and usually do enhance value. Market power allows greater
prices to be charged for the same product produced at greater cost efficiency,
producing more profit and return on equity. If you start with labor, material,
and overhead and add lollapalooza, you’ll likely get above average profits and
returns.
241
Chapter 14: Beyond the Numbers: Strategic Intangibles
A “great” approach to value
The concept of intangibles is somewhat of a
departure from the traditional “value” approach.
Most value investors consider a company a
good value when it has already established
itself, achieved stellar earnings, earnings stabil-
ity, asset quality, and the like, and is selling at a
reasonable price. All true — these are indeed
important ingredients in the value equation. 
But a broader definition of value can well be
proposed and is important especially in today’s
era of rapidly paced, global businesses. A 
company can be a good value if it has “great”
characteristics — even if it hasn’t matured to
the point of producing the promised returns.
Why? Because it has what it takes to produce
financial value longer term. Hence, companies
like Starbucks, CarMax, and even Google in the
early days can be considered great values if
selling cheap relative to the factors that make
them great. They possess competitive advan-
tages, mostly intangible, that others simply don’t
have. In short, growth stocks can be value
stocks — as shown in Chapter 12 and again in
Chapter 16. 

That’s the point, but it isn’t the only point. Those who caught on to the last
three chapters realize that intangibles can be a good leading indicator of
things to come — and numbers to come. Good and improving brand image,
reputation, and popularity beget better sales, stronger pricing, and other
good things downstream. Ignoring actual numbers for a minute, can you see
the potential for a Starbucks or a Panera Bread or a Tiffany’s or a Polo Ralph
Lauren built on reputation, popularity, and word of mouth?
On the flip side, a blown public reputation spells disaster. Who thinks owners
of Bridgestone/Firestone, Ford, or Countrywide Financial will benefit from
any lollapalooza effects any time soon? For those companies, business and
share value will be the sum of the parts, nothing more, and quite likely some-
thing less until investors feel the storm has passed.
Before deciding what revenue and earnings growth numbers to apply to value
a company, a conscious appraisal of intangibles makes sense.
Beyond your windshield
How do you do a lollapalooza assessment? Pure information sources are few
and far between. Mainly, the idea is to keep your antennae up and tuned in at
all times. Tune into the business world by reading company communications,
checking out company Web sites, and following the commentaries of analysts
and journalists. Beyond that, good investors walk Main Street to observe
what common folks are saying, thinking, and doing. 
What should you look for? Bottom line: market power and management excel-
lence. Yes, you can have one without the other, but it’s a tougher road. 
Companies with excellent management but poor market power will stay ordi-
nary, while companies with poor management and excellent market power
will typically underperform. 
Although it is possible to find value in technology companies, that isn’t really
the point. The point is that value investing requires developing a solid under-
standing of the company and of the business to which you plan to commit
capital. If you can’t understand the business, understanding the intangibles
and their effects on the financials will be difficult. 
A company whose business is creating products that “leverage the capabilities
of fibre channel technology to better manage the growth of mission-critical
data by overcoming the limitations of the traditional small computer system
interface (SCSI), which is a captive storage architecture” is probably outside,
way outside, the circle of competence for most people. When in doubt, keep
it simple and stick to hamburgers, coffee, and Cokes.
242
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Market Power
To make a long story short, market power is all about advantage. Market power
is strength in franchise, brand, customer base, supply chain power, or other
competence that gives the company an advantage, or an edge, or a moat, in
the marketplace. Advantage drives and protects the first component of ROE:
profitability. 
Companies with no market power are controlled by the industry they’re 
in. They’re vulnerable to the whims of their competitors and anyone who
chooses to enter their market. As a result, achieving growth is difficult; in
theory, they can grow no faster than the industry as a whole. And improving
profitability is even more difficult. Profits attract competitors and aggressive
pricing, which eliminates the profits. Companies producing undifferentiated
or commodity products can succeed if excellent management creates leading
cost structures, customer base, and reputation, but advantage is hard to
maintain. 
The franchise factor
A franchise is probably the most valuable asset a business can have. And
we’re not talking about the franchise you can buy from a restaurant or conve-
nience store chain allowing you to sell merchandise or services under some-
one else’s logo. The term franchise in this case refers to an established,
sustainable, powerful position in a market.

Don’t drive in dense fog
Lollapalooza is a good thing, but when a com-
pany seems to be all lollapalooza, look out!
There’s much to be said — especially for value
investors — for understanding the business
today and for the long term. When you can’t
figure out what the business is or where it will
be in six months, how can you develop a sense
of strategic financials and intrinsic value strong
enough to commit capital? 
Warren Buffett is famous for his avoidance of
technology investments. Although Microsoft
meets almost any definition of a powerful, prof-
itable, growing franchise, Buffett says he can’t
see what lies beyond five or ten years for the
company. He simply considers technology out-
side his circle of competence and stays away,
despite great respect for his good friend Bill
Gates.

Understanding an industry
It’s usually a good idea to understand an industry
before committing investment capital to a com-
pany within the industry. Understand banking
before buying a bank, insurance before buying
an insurance company, the auto industry before
buying an auto company or supplier, and so forth.
Yet, for the casual or nonprofessional investor,
little concrete information is available on just
how an industry is organized, who the players
are, and how it’s expected to perform in the near
and long term. What do you do? 
Acquiring industry information is sort of an art
and varies by industry. Sure, if you’re willing to
pay the price, you can access Standard & Poor’s,
Moody’s, and professional market research ser-
vices — for example, International Data Group
(IDG) for the information technology business.
But without paying hundreds, or thousands, a
year, how can you develop industry fluency?
Here are a few tips:
 Read, read, read. Read the newspaper and
the newswires. If you follow an industry in
the major financial papers, you’ll find out
what’s reported regularly and where to find
it. The Wall Street Journal has regular sales
statistics on auto sales and a regular sub-
section on technology. Keep your eyes on
the “Marketplace” section. Pick a couple of
companies in the industry and watch the
newswires (through investing portals like
Yahoo! Finance). Releases and stories
cover not only companies but also their
markets and industries.
 Check out analyst reports. You may not trust
everything put forth by securities analysts,
but they usually do a decent job assessing
industries and their players. Much of this
information originates from the big paid-for
services mentioned earlier. Brokerage
houses choose industries to cover and 
provide fairly frequent updates. The trick 
is to get these reports without being an
account holder (if you are, all the better).
Visit broker offices, find a friend, and so
forth. Most online brokers offer some free
investment reports to account holders.
Morningstar, Motley Fool, and a number of
other investing services offer good analyti-
cal reports. 
 Check Value Line. Although free sources of
advice for nonprofessional investors are pre-
ferred, Value Line (which may be in your
local library) is the deserving exception.
Value Line does an industry synopsis in each
weekly report. The problem is, there’s no
telling what industry it will review when, but
the archives fill the gap.
 Read industry publications. Depending on
the industry you invest in, there’s a wealth of
information available online and in printed
journals pertaining to that industry. Tuning in
may be time consuming but not that difficult.
 Check government agencies and reports.
Agencies and departments such as the
Department of Commerce and Federal Trade
Commission can provide important industry
studies and barometers; for example, for the
transportation or construction industries.
Finding the really relevant stuff can be chal-
lenging but handy. 
 Find a friend in the business. While being
cautious for bias and emotion, this often
works out to be one of the best information
sources. As a barometer of industry health
and as a resource to find out about an indus-
try’s structure (channel structure, supply
chain, competition), an informative friend
can be a good friend indeed, but be careful,
for some insiders may focus on the “trees”
and lose view of the forest. 

Understanding the franchise advantage
Why should you care about franchise? Because it produce profits — sustain-
able and growing profits — over a long period of time. Coca-Cola is the classic
case of the franchise, a situation in which the power of the brand and the rep-
utation of the company have created a near-unassailable fortress around the
production and sale of flavored sugar water. But who can argue about the
strength of the Starbucks, Apple, or Google franchises, which set the enviable
standards for their industries? 
Franchises, according to Buffett, sell something people want for which there’s
no close substitute. Franchises beget market power, and market power
begets pricing and supply chain power, and pricing and supply chain power
beget profits. You get the idea. 
Building a “moat”
Franchises also create barriers to entry. If you can grill burgers, you can set up
a hamburger stand, but can you set up a McDonald’s? Would anyone come?
Warren Buffett uses the “moat” metaphor to describe franchise power that
keeps competitors away — and keeps the business and its fundamentals
moving in the right direction.
What determines the width and depth of a “moat?” For this discussion, we
identify five factors that can define market advantage:
 Brand: The company or product moniker with so much behind it.
 Market share and leadership: Presence in the marketplace and the 
600-pound gorilla that has the others following — or attacking — 
the business.
 Customer base: Would customers climb walls to buy the product? Are
they addicted to it? Are customers more likely than not to come back 
to buy again and again? 
245
Chapter 14: Beyond the Numbers: Strategic Intangibles
 Stop, look, and listen. More about this later,
but it pays to make your own observa-
tions about what’s selling and what isn’t
selling, and emergent and dying trends. It
would hardly require detailed research to
discover whether SUVs were replacing
large four-door sedans in the auto market in
the late 1990s, or whether so-called
“crossover” SUVs are replacing traditional
models now. 
Value investors are resourceful types, and usu-
ally find a way to get the important business and
industry information they need.

 Special competencies: Assets or knowledge already in place. Has any
search engine provider matched Google’s speed, breadth, simplicity, and
efficiency? Has any company matched CarMax in applying management
science and data-mining technology to its business? Has any company
matched Apple’s strong profitable software offering and consumer
supply channel to go with its hardware product? You get the idea. 
 Supply-chain power: Can the business dictate terms with its suppliers
or its sales channel?
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) stock and industry reports have some
of the best “moat” analysis available. 
The brand centerpiece
The marketing profession makes its living by evaluating and developing the
“four Ps” — product, price, promotion, and place (physical distribution) — 
of a company’s product or product line. Marketers continuously tinker with
the right mix of these inputs toward building market presence, product
volume, and market share. 
You can’t possibly know all that goes into achieving the right marketing mix.
Most marketers themselves don’t know how well a given mix or strategy
works. But you can pick up on one external manifestation of the marketing
machine creating enduring value: the brand. 
No brand is created overnight (although it got close in the dot-com craze,
when, of all things, going public was considered a brand-building strategy!).
Brands are built over time through a combination of good products and good
presentation of those products to the marketplace.
What goes into a brand
Textbooks are written on brand dynamics, brand psychology, the brand name
and how many letters it should have, and even brand colors. Here are a few
key factors to recognize:
 Image: One of the most important attributes of a brand, brand image is
how the public perceives the brand in the marketplace. Product quality
is part of a brand image, but it goes beyond physical quality into associ-
ation with ideas and images from the real world. People tend to associ-
ate Wrangler with rugged Western jeans; Harley-Davidson with rugged
individualism; or at the other end of the scale, Tiffany’s for classic,
refined elegance. Image branding and marketing can be very powerful
and sustainable, but the landscape is littered with the carcasses of 
quality and image failures. Some brands fail utterly — ValuJet and
Firestone come to mind. Others see their luster and “cache” slowly
246
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

wither away — like Snapple or, more recently, Dell. In some sense, a brand
image is like a relationship or marriage — it requires consistency and
continuous effort to keep going. 
 Familiarity: They aren’t glamorous, and the quality difference isn’t that
obvious. But we buy Tide and Cheer anyway. Could it be the advertising?
The packaging? The fact it’s available everywhere? Familiarity creates
mindshare and drives repeat, or habitual purchase, and creates barriers
for entry. Most value investors place a high value on habitual repeat 
purchase. 
 Reputation: This one may be a composite of the first two but deserves
its own mention. Reputation builds slowly over time and provides a
powerful umbrella giving storm shelter when other things go wrong. But
it must be nurtured and handled with care. A defining case study is
Procter & Gamble’s handling of its Rely tampons and their link to toxic
shock syndrome; this case provided the model for companies to come
forth and admit mistakes. Denial prolongs the battle, and while perhaps
providing short-term financial wins, has long-term negative conse-
quences. When considering companies to invest in, look for businesses
that manage their mistakes well.
The last word on brand
Brand is a complex and fascinating part of a company’s identity, and it can
tell a lot about a company’s value. It’s up to you to decide how valuable the
brand is in the marketplace both today and in the future. Does the brand sup-
port stronger pricing? Does it foster repeat purchase? Is the brand extend-
able into new markets or into other products (as in Nike golf balls or Titleist
clothing)? Does it define the market, as in Coke or Kleenex, or Simpson Strong-
Tie in the construction connectors business? It all becomes part of the value
appraisal, perhaps without involving a single number.
Even with the use of expensive market research, assessing and assigning a
value to a brand in the marketplace is very difficult. Individual investors
don’t have expensive market research at their disposal, and so must rely on
keen observations and judgment to assess the value of a brand, sometimes
known as brand equity. The checklist approach helps, and such a checklist is
offered later in this chapter. 
Market share and leadership
Have you heard the term “600-pound gorilla” used to describe certain indus-
try players? Like Cisco in the networking industry or Wal-Mart in retail?
Market leadership is closely tied to brand as a powerful marketing and pric-
ing tool. Market leadership means that a company defines the market, sets
the pace in price and product, and (usually) is tied to a strong brand. And
market leadership often leads to cost advantages through buying power and
economies of scale.
247
Chapter 14: Beyond the Numbers: Strategic Intangibles

But market leadership is a two-edged sword. Although it can translate to pric-
ing and purchasing power, being number one also makes your business a prime
target of numbers two, three, and four. So a market leader must devote a lot of
energy to staying that way and must avoid the trap of resting on laurels and
maintaining position through arrogance. The pre-Gerstner IBM and the General
Motors of the 1960s serve as reminders that market leadership isn’t always a
good thing — nor is it permanent. In fact, this is the primary argument
Microsoft has used for years in defending various anti-trust challenges. 
Often the size of the market a company is trying to dominate doesn’t matter.
Great profits have been made in small “niche” markets; it can be just as prof-
itable to own a niche as a larger market. Sure, it’s nice to own the PC operat-
ing system market as Microsoft does, but a company like Simpson, dominating
the construction connector market, can be just as successful, if on a smaller
scale. Investors look for dominance, not just size. 
So two items are important in the assessment: (1) to what degree does the
business possess market share and leadership and (2) does it do the right
things and have the right attitude to maintain its market position and grow it?
If a company is continually struggling to maintain a five or ten percent share
in the market — or worse yet, is losing share — that’s a bad sign.
Customer base
A strong and loyal customer base is a hugely important intangible asset.
Why? A company with a loyal customer base can depend on repeat sales and
spends less money acquiring new customers. Profitability increases through
lower marketing costs and repeat sales driven other than by price. Customer
base “nirvana” occurs when customers repeat-buy the product regardless of
price and evangelize the product and company to others. Starbucks has
248

Perhaps you can value a brand . . .
Although quantifying brand psychology and its
value to a business would seem nearly impossi-
ble, there is one annual study and report pub-
lished by BusinessWeek that makes an excellent
attempt. The annual BusinessWeek “Top 100
Brands” study takes a worldwide look at major
brands, assigns a market value for each, and,
perhaps most helpfully, shows how each brand
has changed from the previous year. In case
you’re interested, the top 2007 brands, in order
are Coca-Cola, Microsoft, IBM, GE, Intel, Nokia,
Toyota, Disney, McDonald’s, and Mercedes-
Benz. Don’t forget that this is a worldwide study,
and the focus is on big companies. To access it,
subscribe to BusinessWeek or enter “business
week brand value” in a search engine. 

enjoyed considerable success here as well as in other market-related areas.
Starbucks customers are not only loyal, they’re addicted!
A business that treats a customer base as an asset is more successful than
one that doesn’t. The company that “gets it” carefully manages and cultivates
its customer base. Such a company learns about its customers, listens to
them, talks to them, and nurtures loyalty and referrals. Successful companies
build a mutually beneficial relationship with their customers. 
Companies that don’t “get it” treat their customers as a cost center and must
continually pay to acquire new customers and reacquire old ones. Good
examples of companies that “get it” are Tiffany’s, Nordstrom’s, and Harley-
Davidson. Harley has done a particularly good job of capitalizing on its cus-
tomer base. Apple was once a good example, but recent service and support
history on iPod products brings its customer management into question. 
How do you tell? You can’t always unless you’re a direct customer of the
company. Still, word of mouth and the tone and manner of public communica-
tions can tell a lot. And don’t be fooled just because a company has a loyalty
or points program. Such programs don’t always mean that a company is lis-
tening, nor do they always differentiate (anyone out there a member of an 
airline program?), but they’re a step in the right direction. Managing loyalty
and the customer asset takes on different forms depending on the industry. 
A company selling $2 products through a retail grocer takes a different
approach than one selling plane tickets or automobiles.
Score a “plus” for a strong, loyal customer base and business strategies that
employ the customer base as an asset and capitalize on it. Don’t forget that
this applies to business-to-business companies, not just to consumer busi-
nesses. If customer relationship strategies are hard to detect, talk to some-
one who is a customer or works in the industry. 
Special competencies
Does the business you’re evaluating have a distinctive competence? Does it
just happen to control the operating system of the PC, so that its applications
will work better than everyone else’s? Does it have a Coke formula and 125
years of ingrained brand history recognized by 80 percent of the world’s pop-
ulation? Does it have the best search engine or most innovative designs or
best support available? Does it have special knowledge, experience, or intel-
lectual capital that others don’t have? Has it learned how to apply manage-
ment science techniques to the auto sales business? Does it have deep enough
pockets to write insurance policies where no others can? Or does it have some
other kind of infrastructure, business model, or technology that’s difficult to
duplicate? Score a “plus” if this is the case.
249
Chapter 14: Beyond the Numbers: Strategic Intangibles

The supply chain
Indeed, if investors examine market power influence on pricing and sales,
they still tend to overlook factors influencing a company’s cost structure
today and in the future. Wanna buy an airline stock? Keep in mind depen-
dence on oil for fuel; well-organized labor; scarce aircraft in a two-supplier
market; and tight, government-controlled availability of airport facilities. Are
airlines in control of their cost picture? Clearly not. Although other factors
may not be so grim, airlines have seldom been considered value investments. 
On the other hand, companies can exert considerable influence and control
over their suppliers. Sears certainly influences, if not controls, Whirlpool.
Auto companies have traditionally exerted a great deal of influence over their
suppliers. Being the 600-pound gorilla in any industry usually means power
on the supply side, for every supplier wants such a lucrative customer deal. 
The “supply chain” concept usually refers to entities up the chain toward
suppliers of business resources. A broader and more useful definition looks
down the chain into sales and distribution channels. If a company has sustain-
able control or influence over its distribution partners — a sizable portion of
their business and a good relationship — that’s a good thing. A business that
continually has to fight or pay for shelf space is at a disadvantage. So when
evaluating the business, look at distribution channels and their influence on
stability, sustainable and growable sales, and stable costs. A company that
can economically sell directly to its customers may have an advantage.
Think about the resources needed to sustain and grow the business, and try
to picture whether the company is likely to be in a better or worse position
five or ten years down the road. Give the company a “plus” for supplier
power, and give another “plus” if a company has channel power.
All About Management
Market power can deliver huge intangible benefits to a business and business
results. Less visible in the marketplace but just as important is another intan-
gible pillar: company management. Like market power, it’s about something
drawn from a qualitative, sensory assessment; not from formulas, tools, and
specific resources.
There are four attributes of management excellence: competence, candor,
independence, and customer focus. For those who’ve been around the block
in the corporate world, the term “management excellence” may seem to be
an insufferable oxymoron. Yet, Warren Buffett views management as an X-
factor that can make all the difference, and he feels he can judge a lot about 
a company from a short meeting with its senior management. 
250
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Evaluating management excellence can be tricky. You don’t sit or work with
these managers on a daily basis; in fact, much of what they do is deliberately
kept secret. Yet, a sensitive antenna can pick up a lot over a period of time.
But if you learn about a company in the morning and want to invest that
afternoon, appraising management can be pretty difficult.
Solid information about a company’s management is usually hard to find
except what you see in the press. Yahoo! Finance provides links to the bios
and executive compensation of management, but these do little to help you
assess performance. Read the paper and watch corporate communications
and press releases to catch the buzz about a company’s management. The
following sections discuss some factors that suggest management excellence.
Competence
Does management have the right vision, make the right decisions, and offer
good reasons for those decisions? Sure, anyone can talk up a good future for
a business, but does it stand on its own two feet? Does management make
sound investments in existing businesses? In new businesses? Or does it
grope for growth, itching for acquisitions because it believes that it needs to
be doing something? Does it understand — and control — expenses? Does it
make changes when changes should be made, being neither too eager nor too
reluctant to make them? Does it make reasonable projections about growth
and earnings? 
Bigger picture: Does management seem to have a sound, smart, and “doable”
strategy? Or does it simply talk about cost cuts and layoffs? And, is the mes-
sage consistent and clear, or just choreographed for different audiences or
stages in the business cycle? There’s more, but suffice it to say that good
management understands the business, has a realistic view of it, has a solid
rationale behind strategies and decisions, and employs resources wisely
within it.
Candor
Ever notice that more is heard from many managers when things are going
well than when they aren’t? Value investors like managers who communicate
quickly and honestly about business issues and problems — and without
undue spin. These managers disclose as much data as they can about their
businesses, including information about sector performance, unit productiv-
ity, and key strategies and investments. According to Buffett, managers who
confess mistakes publicly are “more likely to correct them.” Honesty is the
best policy. Along with candor, a little of the right attitude goes a long way.
Arrogant managers who hide problems, think they can solve them all, or,
worse yet, think they are invincible and have no problems are bound for 
trouble. “Kicking butt” is not always the right answer. 
251
Chapter 14: Beyond the Numbers: Strategic Intangibles

Independence
Good management teams think and act independently. They think and act for
the long-term health of the business and resist the temptation to pour energy
and resources into achieving this quarter’s results. Buffett calls this approach
“avoiding the institutional imperative,” which means turning aside the short-
term pressures of Wall Street, its analysts, and institutional investors to do
what’s right for the business long term. They have a vision, a mission, and a
plan and follow them, avoiding distractions. And leadership plays a big part.
Unlikely to follow the lead of others, they play to win and to beat the competi-
tion, not just to keep up with it. 
Customer focus
A management team focused on customers is more likely to succeed than one
focused on its internal issues and on competitors. Does the company know
its customers? Who they are and what are their needs? Do communications
and advertisements stress how company products benefit customers? Does
management spend time with customers? Do communications talk about 
customers and customer “wins,” or are they focused on the glories and 
challenges of the business itself?
In most cases, you don’t work for the company in which you’re investing. So
how do you get a chance to listen to what management says, and how they
say it? How do you pick up the nuances of competence, candor, indepen-
dence, and customer focus? Naturally, it’s difficult, and it’s obvious you can’t
just pick up the phone and call unless you manage a $100 million hedge fund.
But there is a way for the average investor: conference calls (“CCs”). It’s easy
and free to listen in on most publicly traded company conference calls on the
Internet, through company Web sites or Yahoo! Finance or special conference
call portals. Most CCs can be listened to after the fact. The great part about
conference calls is, although the initial management message is scripted, the
answers to analyst questions aren’t. Analysts ask great questions, and you
can hear surprisingly honest answers, as well as the tone of the answers.
Sure, it would be nice to see the body language, too, but the audio portion 
is, in a word, helpful. 
Ownership
By looking at a company’s ownership, particularly those who own the largest
pieces of the business, you can assess the attractiveness of the business to
others — and to its own management. Pure and experienced value investors
may not really care who’s interested in the company, preferring instead to
252
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

rely on their own appraisal rather than follow the lead of others. But as you
develop your personal expertise and style, a look at who else owns the com-
pany may at least provide a valuable “assist.”
Management as owners
Management and insider ownership reflects management commitment. One
place to find out what insiders own and what they’re doing with their holdings
is Yahoo! Finance and its “Insider Roster” and “Insider Transactions” pages.
You can also refer to company publications, including annual reports, but
these may be a little less current. Insider buys and sells can tell something,
but sometimes this indicator can be misleading, as executives routinely sell
options and shares as part of their compensation package. Look for manage-
ment or insider “buys” not matched by an immediate “sell.” And of course,
exceptionally large sales, at peak or trough prices, are not a good sign.
Institutions as owners
Yahoo! Finance also shows the top ten institutional shareholders under the
“Major Holders” tab. Usually these are large banks, pension funds, or trusts.
The larger the holdings and the more “blue chip” the names, the better. You
can also see whether institutions have been buying, but make sure, too, that
this information is current. 
Mutual funds as owners
Yahoo! Finance also shows the top ten largest mutual fund holders under the
“Major Holders” tab just mentioned. Look for who, how much, and what kind
of fund. If the top ten funds all are value funds, that’s a good sign. 
Walking the Streets
This chapter can’t be properly closed without mentioning the concept of
walking Main Street and keeping your eyes and ears peeled to what’s happen-
ing in your corner of the business world. Peter Lynch advocated this strategy
long ago: Buy what you know; buy what you see is going well. If the line at
Starbucks is persistently out the door at all times of the day, if all your home-
based-business friends are considering Starbucks as their office, if parents
with small children use it as a hangout during the day, and if you deeply
believe Starbucks has replaced the corner tavern as the place to fritter away
253
Chapter 14: Beyond the Numbers: Strategic Intangibles

idle time and money, those factors together should work positively for the
company — think “asset utilization.” But you may also come away with an
impression that lines out the door may be a customer negative mandating
expensive operating improvements for the company and supporting the com-
petition. It becomes your imperative and calling as a potential owner of the
business to figure out. 
The trick is then to figure out how that impression extends to the rest of the
business, in other places, and whether all that activity turns to profits. Make
a point of visiting Starbucks when you travel, too, so you can see how well
the idea works in other places. Drop into a CarMax to see how busy it is;
observe the level of customer care, and see how its inventory mix represents
the times and tastes of the area. Talk to contractors about their experience
using Simpson products, and check the big home improvement retailers
occasionally to see how they’re being stocked and merchandised. Talk to
your best friend the PC engineer about what hardware and accessory prod-
ucts are working, and whether AMD is finally going to surpass Intel this time
around. And so on. 
Checking Good to Great
It’s fairly easy to develop your own checklist for intangibles. Figure 14-1 shows
a sample checklist filled out for Simpson Manufacturing. You can use a check-
list like this, together with the strategic financials checklist in Chapter 13, to
get a good grasp of business performance, business potential, and overall
company value. The example shows a relatively strong marketplace story,
perhaps offsetting a somewhat weaker short-term 2006 financial performance,
an attractive position for longer-term investors.

Sultans of SWOT
As an alternative approach to defining intangi-
bles, some business and marketing analysts
employ a tool from the consulting world: the
SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. A
business is evaluated for each of the four attrib-
utes. Figure 14-2 shows how a SWOT diagram
may be filled out for Simpson:
This analysis is by nature very subjective. There
is no scoring system, and attributes aren’t tied
directly to ROE components. Still, it provides a
fast, easy, and practical framework for apprais-

Chapter 15
Warren’s Way
In This Chapter
 Following the Buffett approach to business value and investing
 Understanding Buffett’s business, management, financial, and market tenets
W
ant to do the impossible? Try writing a book on value investing with-
out mentioning Warren Buffett. It would be easier to write a book
about American history without mentioning Thomas Jefferson or a book about
the physics of relativity without mentioning Albert Einstein. Although this is
not a book about Buffett per se, it wouldn’t be appropriate to write a book on
value investing without capitalizing on his vast insight, experience, clair-
voyance, and humor to help explain it.
This book is designed to add breadth and depth to your understanding value
investing and to help you begin to develop your own value investing style.
Mr. Buffett’s example is presented as an art teacher would use Rembrandt,
Picasso, or Monet to help you develop your own painting style. You don’t
necessarily have to copy or duplicate the Buffett style; but you should learn
from it.
Chapters 11 through 14 describe a system for appraising intrinsic value,
financials, and intangibles of a business. Formulas, ratios, and checklists are
offered as tools. Does Mr. Buffett do all this analysis? Pretty much — the prin-
ciples presented in this book are aligned with his. But Buffett’s experience,
judgment, and preferences reduce the complex to a relatively simple 12-point
formula, now presented as sort of a For Dummies guide within a For Dummies
guide. The principles presented in Chapters 11 through 14 shouldn’t be
ignored or forgotten — because they contribute to understanding the princi-
ples behind Warren’s Way.
Robert Hagstrom, Senior VP and Portfolio Manager at Legg Mason (a value-
oriented mutual fund group), author of The Warren Buffett Way, The Warren
Buffett Portfolio: Mastering the Power of the Focus Investment Strategy, and The
Essential Buffett: Timeless Principles for the New Economy (all published by
John Wiley and Sons), has identified and explained the Twelve Tenets of the
Warren Buffett Way. In this chapter, we follow Mr. Hagstrom’s Twelve Tenets
framework.

The Buffett Wisdom
Describing Mr. Buffett’s wisdom, mindset, and approach to life in full would
be an ambitious project indeed — and beyond scope. (Many others have
attempted it, and the 1,100-page Of Permanent Value: The Warren Buffett Story
by Andy Kilpatrick is one of the best.) A few basic paradigms form a back-
ground canvas onto which the more specific tenets of Warren’s Way are
painted.
If you were to sum up Warren’s Way in one sentence, it could read (quoting
Hagstrom): “. . . [H]e looks for companies he understands — businesses that
have favorable long-term prospects, are operated by honest and competent
people, and importantly, are available at attractive prices.”
Here are some additional “basics” of Warren’s Way:
 Buying shares is equivalent to buying the business. You must have the
same rigor, the same approach, and the same discipline.
 A value investor is a business analyst, not a market or security analyst.
The focus is on the business, not the stock or stock price.
 A business valuation is complete and holistic. It includes financials,
intangibles, and price.
 The market values stocks correctly much of the time, but not all the
time. Over- and undervaluation exist somewhere in the markets at all
times. The trick is to find it.
 Long term is the only term. “Our favorite holding period is forever,”
says Buffett. Further, Buffett rails against short-term trading as a waste
of money and, worse, a distraction from what’s really important in a
business. 
 Always think future value and opportunity cost. The power of com-
pounding is one of the sacred tenets of investing. And, any investment
must be considered against all of its alternatives.
Tenets, Anyone?
From Hagstrom’s analysis, the Buffett approach has 12 tenets grouped into 
4 categories:
 Business Tenets are a high-level view of the business itself, including its
markets and marketing strategy.
 Management Tenets are qualities desired in senior management.
258
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

 Financial tenets concern financials and financial strategy.
 Market tenets relate the value of the business to the price of the stock
(in contrast to marketplace attributes described in Chapter 14).
Within each category there are 2 to 4 tenets, giving the total of 12. Here’s the
list, again from Hagstrom:
 Business Tenets:
• Is the business simple and understandable?
• Does the business have a consistent operating history?
• Does the business have favorable long-term prospects?
 Management Tenets:
• Is management rational?
• Is management candid with its shareholders?
• Does management resist the institutional imperative?
 Financial Tenets:
• Focus on return on equity (ROE), not earnings per share.
• Calculate and understand “owner earnings.”
• Look for companies with high profit margins.
• For every dollar retained in the business, make sure the company
has created at least one dollar of market value.
 Market Tenets:
• What is the value of the business?
• Can the business be purchased at a significant discount to its value?
Could this become your golden checklist? Maybe so; let’s take a closer look.
Business tenets
Business tenets are kind of a 30,000-foot overview of the business itself,
including its markets, market position, and strategy.
A simple and understandable business
According to Buffett, a business investor can’t consistently achieve success
without understanding the underlying business. Anything else is pure luck,
an in-and-out trip to the Wall Street casino. If you can’t understand the busi-
ness or the industry, you’re looking for trouble.
259
Chapter 15: Warren’s Way

Enter the circle of competence concept. Buffett steadfastly sticks to busi-
nesses he understands — and understands well enough to predict. His old
adage is that “risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.” The more
you understand the business, its driving forces, and the numbers, the less
likely you are as an investor to make mistakes. 
And that is another key piece of the Buffett Way: Avoid big mistakes. Big mis-
takes hurt portfolio performance, and worse, they derail the compounding
train (see Chapter 4). Buffett avoids technology shares for this reason. Even
for tech companies with apparent enduring value, such as Microsoft, he simply
can’t predict where they’ll be five or ten years down the road. Changing tech-
nology, changing markets, competitors, regulation — you name it — all get in
the way of judging and predicting sustained performance.
Interestingly, Buffett recently declared that, if utility regulation went away, he
would become a bigger utility investor. Certainly, utility companies fit every
other characteristic of a value business: market power, locked in, steady
growth, strong cash flow, and an understandable business. Although Hathaway
famously bought a large stake in Iowa-based Mid American Energy, the portfo-
lio continues to shun this sector. Why? Because of regulation, Buffett feels
companies can’t control their future, and investors can’t predict the future.
Buffett may also have been concerned about Chinese government influence
over PetroChina in his recent decision to reduce holdings. 
Buffett would advise not to take on and solve complex business valuation
problems, but to avoid them. He would recommend doing ordinary things
exceptionally well in business valuation, and not looking for challenges. In
other words, keep it simple and avoid complexity.
Consistent operating history
Related to avoiding complexity, Buffett would advise staying away from com-
panies going through fundamental strategic or operational shifts, and to avoid
turnaround situations (although some may appear to be great values). In his
words: “Turnarounds seldom turn,” “severe change and exceptional returns
usually don’t mix,” and “energy can be more profitably expended by purchas-
ing good businesses at reasonable prices, rather than difficult businesses at
‘cheaper’ prices.” So stick to companies that produce the same products —
and the same or improving results — through the years. Would anyone like 
a Coke?
Favorable long-term prospects
The first part of this tenet is to look for companies with valuable, sustainable
franchises — and to avoid the bulk of the rest of the business world locked
up in commodity businesses (in his view, everything becomes a commodity
business sooner or later). For more discussion of franchise and what it
means, see Chapter 14.
260
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

The key to franchises is the ability to control — and raise — prices, without
necessarily losing market share. Lasting market power is key. Businesses
without franchise compete only on price and/or expensive advertising.
Adding in the competition, there is little prospect for profits, profit growth,
and high ROE. In fact, the only downside for businesses with a franchise is
that they form glaring targets for others who want to challenge it. Companies
like Coke and Procter & Gamble spend billions of dollars and lots of energy
preserving their franchises. It could be easily argued that Simpson
Manufacturing has a strong franchise in the construction materials business.
Management tenets
Bottom line: Buffett looks for managers who think and act like owners of the
company. Do they behave as though it were their own business? People who
spend their own money make better decisions than those who spend the
money of others.
Management should be rational
It seems obvious that management should be rational, doesn’t it? Yet, it isn’t
always the case.
The rational manager has a sound, clear, long-term vision for the business,
and executes consistently toward it. Furthermore, in Buffett’s eyes, manage-
ment must make good decisions about allocating capital. An effective man-
agement can overcome external pressure and internal politics to invest in
(allocate capital to) what really makes sense for the business and for its
return on equity (ROE).
Too often, managers invest in old ideas despite below-average returns. They
believe hopeless situations will turn around. They believe toughness and
sheer determination can pull it off. And they have a hard time admitting
they’re wrong and that the world has changed. Sound familiar? Corporate 
history is littered with the casualties.
Further, managers feeling an itch with the status quo — or responding to
external pressure — will become overactive. Start this business; exit that
business; change brands; fill the shelves with new products, even though
they cannibalize existing ones; look for an acquisition. Somehow, they feel
the need to do something, anything. It often turns out to be anything but 
good for the business. Was “New Coke” a result of management itch, poor
judgment, or a carefully concocted marketing ploy? Most believe it to be a
mistake, but was it really the act of a rational management looking to revital-
ize and confirm the old brand? Looks that way from here . . .
261
Chapter 15: Warren’s Way

And in Buffett’s view, if management can’t find projects or investments with
adequate returns, it should return the returns to the shareholders in the form
of dividends. As dividends set continuing expectations and receive unfavor-
able tax treatment, the alternative is a share repurchase, a Buffett favorite.
According to Buffett, when management buys shares in the market, it regards
the owners’ best interests over a need to unnecessarily expand corporate
structure.
Tell the truth: Candor
As a concept, this one’s also fairly obvious, but wow, consider the failures!
How many have seen management reports that sweep all the bad stuff under
the rug and promise all will be great — just wait ‘til next year! How many have
seen management crow when things are going well. It’s always quoted in the
paper, always headlining the trade show, doing its own TV commercials, and
so on. Then when things turn south, management is nowhere to be found. And
it gets worse when it starts spending more time monkeying with financial
statements and reporting than managing the business.
Buffett consistently seeks managers who can admit mistakes and then study
and learn from those mistakes. A manager who spends 15 minutes talking
about the successes and 2 hours discussing the failures is the right kind 
of manager. And a management team that shares detailed data about the
business — segment performance, unit volumes, and so on — gets higher
marks. Honesty is the best policy.
A lot of what Buffett professes to investors is, as you’ve probably noticed,
well worth incorporating into your own personal business and career life. If
you behave like a Buffett manager or investor, chances are you’ll succeed in
the workplace, too. 
Resisting the institutional imperative
What is the institutional imperative? Good question. It is a combination of
real-world factors that makes managers behave in less-than-rational ways.
External influences are led by Wall Street analysts, fund managers, and large
shareholders. Add internal organizational bureaucracy, legacy, the Peter
Principle, and the tendency for subordinates to agreeably support manage-
ment biases (all common organizational dynamics), and you get a powerful
witches’ brew of factors turning rational decision-making astray.
The result: Management teams engage in folly beyond our wildest dreams.
Okay, outright folly isn’t always the result, but tentative behavior and resis-
tance to change often come up. Short-term focus creeps in: Gotta meet your
numbers and do as well as competitors this quarter. Never mind the long
term.
262
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Managers don’t want to lose credibility either outside or inside, so they often
follow a failure path or put energy into the wrong things instead of managing
for the future. The failure path can be doing nothing, or it can be reaching for
unsound businesses or acquisitions in desperate attempts to meet institu-
tional imperative despite unsound strategy. Was Ford’s acquisition of Jaguar
(and later Volvo) or the ill-fated Quaker Oats Snapple acquisition driven by
institutional imperative or sound business strategy? One wonders.
Independence is the right path. Independent managers give both sides of the
story and resist the temptation to bow to external pressure. They do what’s
right for the business in the long term. Analyst meetings and conference calls
are short and devoid of fluff, and are more about long-term strategy and
vision than prognosticating this quarter’s results. Independently thinking
managers don’t let the analysts set their targets, and don’t cast everything
else aside to meet them.
The management assessment
Summary: Businesses managed with reason, honesty, and independence are
destined to come out ahead.
But how do you, the investor, the outsider, learn enough about management?
There’s no hope of ever meeting them in person or knowing the detail of what
they are up to. Much of that’s hidden behind the corporate veil. Thus, some
investors and analysts take the path of measuring performance by the num-
bers, end of story. But this approach does little as a leading indicator of
results. Buffett’s recommendation: Read, read, read. Read annual reports, 
in sequence, to get a feel of how management perspectives and strategies
change. Compare the statements of managers for different companies in the
industry. Look closely at interviews, speeches, and professional presentations.
Get a feel from the company’s Web sites. Weigh it all, but don’t overweigh it.
Excellent management doesn’t fix mediocre businesses. As Buffett put it, “A
horse that can count to ten is a remarkable horse — not a remarkable mathe-
matician.” Don’t forget context.
Financial tenets
For those who read Chapters 11 through 14, Buffett’s financial tenets will be
familiar. The Buffett approach is a back-to-basics approach focused on 
earnings — real earnings — earnings growth, and the fundamental earnings
productivity of the business. Not surprisingly, the focus is also on the longer
haul, not year-to-year performance and comparisons.
263
Chapter 15: Warren’s Way

ROE is the centerpiece
Return on equity (ROE) — the dollars earned per dollars invested by the
owners — is the single most important financial yardstick for any business.
However, many companies focus instead on increased dollar earnings or
earnings per share. But for Buffett and value investors, these events are less
meaningful, particularly if ROE is actually declining. Because retained earn-
ings (not paid out to shareholders) become part of equity, maintaining or
increasing ROE is particularly challenging, requiring larger increases in earn-
ings. The company that maintains or grows ROE is accomplishing something;
the company that shows declining ROE may still be growing earnings while
actually producing poorer returns for its owners.
Buffett rightly insists on purifying the ROE measure, removing the effects of
investment gains and extraordinary items. Investment gains make ROE look
better without any improvement in business fundamentals, while the effects
of extraordinary items on both numerator and denominator should be 
understood.
Buffett is also cautious about using leverage to improve ROE (for more, see
Chapter 13). A good ROE without debt is better than one with debt. Although
Buffett would err on the side of reducing or eliminating debt, he’s not totally
against borrowing where it makes business sense; that is, where margin of
safety is maintained and the borrowed money is put to productive use. If
good ROE can only be achieved by carrying large amounts of debt, watch out.
Owner earnings
Buffett was hardly the first to recognize that earnings and earnings measures
can be less than pure. For reasons explored in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, and espe-
cially Chapter 9, earnings may not tell the whole story.
Many analysts use cash flow as a more realistic indicator of business perfor-
mance. But cash flow can have its limitations as well, particularly when large
irregular capital expenditures fall outside the analyst’s time horizon. No
matter how you look at it, business performance must include funds required
to build and sustain infrastructure, whether accounted for on a cash basis
(lump sum disbursements) or depreciation (periodic recovery). So Buffett
uses cash flow, but he goes further to include capital expenditures and
changes in working capital. This is the only logical course, especially when
taking a long-term perspective. To Buffett, short-term cash flows devoid of
capital requirements “are frequently used by marketers of business and secu-
rities in attempts to justify the unjustifiable and thereby sell what should be
unsaleable.” We couldn’t have said it any better.
So the tenet boils down to this: Use owner earnings (net income plus depreci-
ation, depletion, and amortization) — less capital expenditures and working
capital infusions — to fairly evaluate business performance.
264
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Behind the curtain: Profit margins
Behind every successful business is an operating machine producing healthy
profit margins. Gross margin and net operating margin (after expenses) are
important. Gross margins indicate market power and potential. Both gross
and net margins reflect control of costs and expenses. Effective margins and
effective cost controls are not discrete events but rather a self-evident way of
life for successful businesses and their management teams. Managers who
rely on one-time write-offs to control costs are not managing expenses and
margins effectively on a day-to-day basis. Look for consistently healthy, grow-
ing profit margins and low overhead costs.
A dollar for a dollar
This tenet drifts a bit from pure company internals to bring in market valua-
tion. Buffett looks for companies for whom every dollar in retained earnings
should result in a dollar of increased book value, and a dollar of increased
book value should achieve a dollar increment in stock price. Although sub-
ject to the whims of Mr. Market, in the long term, stock prices should appreci-
ate as business value appreciates. If this isn’t happening, something is wrong
either with the numbers or the economic prospects of the business itself.
Market tenets
Up to this point, this chapter concentrates on the value of the business itself.
Share price — and whether to buy into the business — haven’t entered the
discussion. Market tenets concern rational decisions about price and value,
and whether it’s time to buy a company.
Determine the value of a business
The intrinsic value principle described in Chapter 12 (a business is worth
what the owners can take out of it) is the centerpiece of Buffett’s business
valuation approach.
Buffett will look at total future owner earnings and insist on an understand-
able, predictable pattern (a circle of competence). These earnings, or
coupons, are discounted back to the present to arrive at a fair figure to com-
pare to price and alternative investments. And what about the discount rate?
Buffett usually uses the higher of a current risk-free bond rate or 10 percent,
and instead of adding risk premium to the discount rate, he requires a lower
price to provide a margin of safety. Buffett’s approach, although principally
sound, avoids getting stuck on the finer (but never precise) ramifications of
risk and discount rates. “Risk comes in not knowing what you’re doing” and “I
put a heavy weight on certainty” are timeless Buffettisms that apply.
265
Chapter 15: Warren’s Way

Swing at good pitches only
The fitting last tenet is the notion of buying only at attractive prices. The pre-
ceding eleven tenets may indicate business success, but they won’t insure
investment success. Investment success means finding a business bound for
success, and buying it at a price bound for success.
So the essential strategy is to “find companies with above-average returns,
and buy their stock when it is priced below its intrinsic value.” The margin of
safety thus provided creates a lot of upside leverage for the owner; at the
same time, it mitigates the risk of declining value and magnifies the expected
return (business growth plus return to core intrinsic value).
And don’t forget the quality variable. It may not be realistic to expect a busi-
ness with really wonderful prospects to show up for sale at a big discount to
value. Although the original Buffett approach (and the Graham approach
before that) was to find good companies at a deep discount, the more
modern value approach (brought to Buffett in part by Charlie Munger) is to
pay up for quality where it makes sense, even to multiples of book value.
A corollary principle (and one of the hardest lessons for the investor) is
patience. Metaphorically, it is the notion of “swinging only at strikes” and
better yet, swinging at strikes you like. The true value investor can pass up a
lot of investment opportunities, even many that fall within the zone. The idea
is to wait for one that looks really good; then swing hard. Too many investors
pull the trigger too quickly and foul off pitches outside the zone or in the
wrong place in the zone. Wait for the investment down the middle, with truly
excellent business prospects at a truly great price relative to value. 
Bottom line: Be patient.

Chapter 16
Shopping for Value: Deciding
When the Price Is Right
In This Chapter
 Understanding the role of price in stock selection
 Looking at valuation ratios as pricing models
 Taking a closer look at P/E
 Making sense of the role of growth in pricing
 Recognizing under- and overvaluation
You tried it on and it fits. You like it and it looks good on you. Now, on to
the next issue: the price tag. Look at the number. Does the price make
sense? Compared to benefits and value received? Seems kind of high. You
ponder. Maybe it doesn’t fit as well as you thought, and it isn’t quite your
color anyway. 
On the other hand, many of you probably checked the price first. Found a
bargain, maybe. Perhaps the fit and color are not quite right, but you aren’t
concerned. You’re willing to accept something less than perfect if the price 
is right. 
Regardless of the exact approach, sooner or later, price enters the value equa-
tion. You look at value; then you look at price. Or, you look at price; then you
determine value. You’re looking for an attractive “price to value” ratio. With a
garment, “value” is largely abstract and a matter of taste. With a stock, it’s 
a combination of business fundamentals and intangibles. The relationship
between price and value is the inevitable final check made when deciding to
buy or sell.
From the beginning this book has been focused on business and company
value. Now it’s time to take a look at the price tag, the market price as set by
the investing public. This chapter looks at price and helps you establish your
system for deciding if the price is right.

The Inside-Out Approach to Buying
If you’re reading this book in chapter order, you’re probably wondering why
the first 15 chapters hardly mentioned stock prices. You may have thought
that’d come up in Chapter 2 or so. Isn’t value investing about finding bar-
gains? And how do you know you have a bargain without looking at the price
tag? What gives?
Impulse buying not allowed
By design, this book takes an inside-out approach. That is, we look at the
merchandise in detail before considering a buying decision. It’s the way most
people look (or should look) at buying a big-ticket item like a car, house, or
college education. And is a securities investment a big decision? You bet. For
the avid Buffettonian, a stock purchase is treated like a life decision.
So that’s why this tour has taken us through business valuation, in some
detail, before discussing price. If the value investor has a good sense for the
value of a company (intrinsic value, ROE and drivers, and intangibles), a con-
scious and deliberate buying decision can be made once price is known.
But . . . still not a formula
Even with all the analysis, regrettably, buying decisions are still not black-
and-white formula answers. Intrinsic value of $22, ROE of 25 percent, good
management, sustainable margins, growth, familiar brand, price of $18.
Should you buy? It’s still a gray area.
Obviously, this example has a lot going your way, and the chances of going
wrong aren’t huge. But before pulling the trigger, you must first think about
risk and uncertainty (the downside) and then think about the alternatives. A
$22 stock for $18 may be better than a $50 stock for $30, depending on the
risk and the clarity of your assessment. And in a risky environment, neither
may be as good as a 6 percent bond. Just like a swimsuit on a store rack is
evaluated not only for price but also compared to the other available swim-
suits, so it must be for a business purchase decision.
Moving outside
“Inside” business appraisal was largely based on profit, growth, and growth
drivers in many layers of detail — solid and improving business fundamen-
tals. As we head out into the real world of markets and prices, the focus
268
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

shifts to putting the right price tag on the fundamentals. More to the point,
we’re deciding if the current price tag makes sense.
What did the market miss?
The value investor usually seeks one of three scenarios:
 Scenario 1: The market underestimates strong and improving fundamen-
tals, usually supported by strong intangibles. Large companies with
strong exports and solid cash positions, like IBM and Hewlett-Packard,
are recent examples. 
 Scenario 2: Fundamentals aren’t there yet, but strong intangibles —
product strength, market position, competitive advantage — speak well
for the business and for improving future fundamentals. The business
value is driven by strong leading indicators — it’s a growth scenario.
Companies like Starbucks, Apple Computer, or CarMax fit the bill.
 Scenario 3: Fundamentals are weak or not improving, but they’re better
than the market thinks. This is the turnaround situation, or what Buffett
calls “one-puff” investments: finding a business, like a cigar, that has 
one good puff of investor payback left. Also included are asset plays —
situations in which the business itself may be in a difficult phase, but 
the underlying assets, including cash, natural resources, real estate, and
patents, have value beyond the current stock price. Bank and building
industry stocks are a good recent example.
Riskier and harder to assess, Scenario 3 is often best left for the professional
investor. Turnarounds often don’t turn around, and precise asset appraisal is
difficult. Value investors specializing in Scenario 3 investments often look to
unlock value by acquisition. Predicting and valuing turnarounds, asset plays,
and acquisitions is challenging. The hard part is figuring out how and when
the value will be unlocked. For this discussion, we’ll stay closer to Scenarios
1 and 2: attaching price to strong or improving fundamentals.
All in the P/E Family
By far, the most popular valuation tool is the price to earnings, or P/E ratio.
It’s in every newspaper, Web site, and cocktail party investing discussion. P/E
will furnish a cornerstone for this pricing discussion, too, although there’s a
lot more to P/E than meets the eye. Once well understood, P/E is one of the
major ways that investors make sense of the price tag. This chapter examines
P/E, its components, drivers and alternatives, and how to deploy it to price a
business.

Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right

The P/E ratio is the main thread that attaches price to value: P is price and E
is earnings — the fundamental end product of the business. Through E and
growth projections, P/E connects price with the intrinsic and strategic valua-
tion presented in Chapters 11 through 14. As this connection is explored,
related valuation measures such as price to book (P/B), price to sales (P/S),
and price to cash flow (or “free” cash flow) will also be covered.
There is no set formula for applying P/E. “If it’s 17 you buy, and if it’s 25 you
sell” doesn’t work. A deeper understanding of the P/E and underlying funda-
mentals is required. The following sections provide some of that depth.
Lesson 1: Earnings yield
What is P/E? It is the ratio of share price to earnings. But there’s more infor-
mation here than meets the eye. First, P/E tells how many years it would take
to recoup an investment if earnings stayed the same. A P/E of 17 means that
270
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 
The many faces of P/E
P/E is the ratio of the stock price to annual earn-
ings for a company. Seems like P/E should just
be P/E, end of story, right? A simple snapshot
comparison of price and earnings. Price is
pretty clear: today’s price. But how does one
define today’s earnings, since earnings aren’t a
snapshot item but represent instead activity for
a 12-month period? Which 12-month period?
The one just finished, the one upcoming, a com-
bination? Actual performance or an extrapola-
tion of the most recently completed quarter?
Indeed, P/E is influenced by the period used to
identify earnings, and some important lessons
can be learned by looking at different P/E fig-
ures. Also important to recognize: Different data
sources calculate P/E differently, so watch out!
To illustrate the point, we’ll share different cuts
of P/E and P/E-related measures, many of which
are found in the Value Line Investment Survey.
Figures are found at the top and in the body of
each company’s Investment Survey page.
 P/E in Value Line is calculated by dividing
recent stock price by the total of the last 
six months’ actual earnings plus the next six
months’ estimated earnings. This is a realis-
tic way to do it. Many publications take the
most recent 12 months’ actual, which is okay
but a little conservative. It can also over-
weight one-time events up to a year ago.
 Trailing P/E is price divided by the last 12
months’ actual earnings, often found in the
newspaper. Value Line shows their current
P/E next to the trailing P/E. Comparing cur-
rent and trailing P/Es is interesting: A cur-
rent P/E less than trailing P/E says price
may not have caught up with projections. Or
there is risk and a wait-and-see attitude
about the projection.
 Forward P/E is P/E based on projected
earnings for the next 12 months. This figure
is found on many Web portals and is a quick
and handy way to judge the future based on
current analyst projections. Of course, you
must decide whether you agree with the
projections, or whether the business has
changed to such a degree that they no
longer make sense — home-building stocks
are an excellent recent example. 

with flat earnings, it would take 17 years to recover your investment. A P/E of
40 means 40 years. That’s a long time, and should tell you that something else
is at work to support a high P/E: Competent investors don’t wait 40 years just
to get their money back! That something is either growth potential or under-
stated current earnings.
But a greater revelation occurs when the P/E ratio is turned upside down. The
inverse ratio, known as earnings yield, tells the annual percentage rate of
return implied by the P/E. It is simply 1/(P/E). If P/E is 10, than 1/(P/E) is 0.1,
or 10 percent. If P/E is 40 then 1/(P/E) is 0.025, or 2.5 percent. This figure is
the equivalent yield the investor would use to compare this earnings stream
to another investment — a bond, for example. A bond returning $5 on a 
face value of $100 yields 5 percent. A stock returning $5 in earnings on $100
invested (stock price) could also be said to yield 5 percent, and would have 
a P/E ratio of, you guessed it, 20 ($100 ÷ $5).
Earnings yield makes the meaning of P/E more clear, and makes more sense
to trained investors. Earnings yield can be used to compare to other invest-
ments including, but not exclusively, bonds and fixed income investments.
P/E is just a number; earnings yield is a rate of return comparable across all
investment forms.
The simple Table 16-1 illustrates the wide range of investment yields implied
by different P/E ratios.
271
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right
 Median P/E is the median statistical P/E
figure exhibited by that company over the
past ten years. A current P/E below the
median shows possible underpricing or
changes in business fundamentals. If the
current P/E is greater than median, the
stock may be overpriced. Be careful to
factor in interest rates. If interest rates are
decreasing, then norm P/Es will tend to
increase.
 Relative P/E is a look at a stock’s P/E
versus the aggregate Value Line universe
of 1,700 stocks they follow. Comparison
can tell you whether a stock flies higher or
lower than the market. To a great degree,
that is a function of growth (we’ll get to
that) but also may indicate over- or under-
priced situations.
 Average Annual P/E tracks average price
for the year (as opposed to recent price)
divided by actual 12-month earnings for the
year. Whereas median P/E sums up the last
ten years into a single figure, Average
Annual P/E is shown for the span of Value
Line coverage: 15 years on the sheets. This
figure is good for analyzing trends such as
P/E and market behavior over time.
If you have Value Line, we suggest becoming
familiar with these figures. If you don’t have
Value Line, make sure you understand where
your P/E data comes from and what it repre-
sents. Depending on what resource you follow,
generally you only get 12-month trailing P/Es
unless otherwise noted.

Lesson 2: P/E and growth
It would be nice if looking at price, P/E, and earnings yield was all there is to
it. Find an earnings yield of 6 percent (P/E of 17), beat the bond, and move
on. But you’re buying equities, not bonds, right? Because you want to partici-
pate in company growth and success. And why do you want to do that?
Because, simply, you want to leave that static bond yield in the dust — if not
today, sometime in the near future. And you want to keep up with — or better
yet, beat — inflation. So to do that, you assume some risk that earnings won’t
happen, but you’re hanging your hat on growth and a stock price that keeps
up with it.
Buy a bond for $100; receive $5 per year for 10, 20, 30 years; never look 
back. Buy a stock for $100, earnings per share constant at $5 for 10, 20, or 
30 years with no change? Should have bought the bond. Why? Less risk.
But suppose the $5 earnings “coupon” grows at 10 percent per year. What
happens at the end of year 10? Get out the compounding formula. Five bucks
times (1+10 percent) to the tenth power is $12.97. If the price were to stay the
same, your $100 investment would be returning $12.97 in year 10, which is
272
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

almost 13 percent earnings yield, or an implied P/E of 7.7 at today’s price. A
pretty nice yield, which really means the price of your investment should go
up, because it’s worth more. Table 16-2 shows future earnings yields realized
in the case of a bond with no growth versus a stock with a 10 percent earn-
ings growth.

So you can see that assessing growth is a major factor in analyzing a stock
price through P/E. Above all else, earnings growth drives stock price growth.
So value investors look closely at what the earnings yield is today and what
will it be in the future.
273
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right
P/E and interest rates
After earnings yield is understood, it becomes
easier to comprehend market-driven P/E fluctu-
ations over time. When rates are low, P/Es tend
to be higher. The reason: equivalent yield. Much
has been made of the rise in P/Es to over 30 for
the S&P 500 (1998–2000) and the subsequent
decline to the 18 range in the middle part of the
“ought” decade. Some (not all) of this is due to
lower interest rates. If 10-year Treasuries (the
best barometer for a risk-free rate of return) are
under 5%, the equivalent earnings yield — with
no growth prospects — converted to P/E,
exceeds 20. That’s part of why the stock market
was strong in the 2003–2007 period, and why a
lot of analysts still thought it undervalued at the
end of that period. A market P/E of 18 is attrac-
tive when interest rates suggest a P/E exceed-
ing 20, unless the market is worried about
coming higher interest rates. That concern,
indeed, helped drive markets lower as 2007
unfolded. 

A PEG in a poke
As a sharp reader, you may be recognizing familiar themes as the topic of
earnings growth and business growth is worked into the pricing model.
Chapter 12 shows how intrinsic value is built on future returns as cash flows
and particularly the growth of those cash flows. This concept connects well
with the valuation ratio known as price/earnings to growth, or the “PEG” ratio,
briefly introduced in Chapter 10. 
PEG relates, or normalizes, the P/E to the growth rate. With PEG, apparently
high P/E ratios are supported by forward growth. PEG thus becomes a better
tool to compare stocks with different P/Es and different underlying growth
assumptions.
By itself, it’s hard to tell whether a P/E is good or bad. A stock with a P/E of 30
may be a better deal than another stock with a P/E of 15. Why? Because of
growth. A stock of a no-growth company with a P/E of 15 will never achieve an
earnings yield beyond 7.5 percent (1/15). Meanwhile the company with a P/E
of 30, with a growth rate of 20 percent, eventually achieves an earnings yield
greater than 20 percent. The analysis is similar to that shown in Table 16-2.
Enter the practice of normalizing P/E by the growth rate. To do that, we divide
all P/Es by the company’s growth rate to create a ratio known as (price/earn-
ings)/growth, or PEG for short. G is the growth rate, expressed as a whole
number (that is, the percentage times 100). So a company with a P/E of 30
and a growth rate of 20 percent has a PEG of 1.5.
This gives a standard for comparison. Company A with a P/E of 18 and a
growth rate of 12 percent has the same PEG as Company B with a P/E of 30
and a growth rate of 20 percent. Are the two P/Es the same? 30 versus 18?
Clearly not — until the underlying growth fundamentals are identified, apply
PEG, and find out they are indeed priced equally.
Table 16-3 extends Table 16-2 to show the relationship between future earn-
ings yield, P/E, and PEG. Watch what happens to PEG and future earnings
yields as growth assumptions rise. Low PEG ratios (less than 2) correspond
to high future earnings yields.

You can see that the PEG = 2 scenario corresponds to a future earnings yield
of 13 percent. A PEG of 1.3 correlates to 20 percent, and a PEG of 1 correlates
to a future earnings yield of 31 percent on today’s investment price. On the
other hand, if PEG goes up to 4, implied future earnings yield is only 8.1 
percent.
So what is a “good” PEG ratio? It all depends on the implied future rate of
return you’re looking for, which depends on investment objectives, risk toler-
ance, and current risk-free (bond) interest rates. A PEG of 2.7 or less implies a
future earnings yield of 10 percent or more. Anything over 2.7, implying a
future earnings yield of less than 10 percent, is probably less return at more
risk than most investors desire. A PEG of 1 or less is great (but hard to find),
a PEG between 1 and 2 is good, between 2 and 3 is marginal, anything over 3
should probably be avoided.
Hurdle rates and the 15 percent rule
Warren Buffett looks at P/E and growth in a slightly different way, using so-
called hurdle rates. A hurdle rate is what the name implies — a minimum level
of compounded annual returns, or a “bar” over which a business, and thus a
275
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right
PEG is a tool, not the answer
PEG should be used as a guideline and an invest-
ing tool, but be careful to avoid overdependence
on this quick, easy-to-calculate, and easy-to-
understand figure when making long-term
investment decisions. The denominator in PEG is
the earnings growth rate, and the careful value
investor looks closely at growth assumptions and
supporting business fundamentals. PEG can be
used as a selection or screening tool to identify
stocks for deeper analysis, and also works at the
end of the appraisal process to determine if price
is in line with (or is lower than) corresponding
growth prospects. But it, by itself, isn’t the whole
answer.

stock price, must be able to appreciate to be deemed a good investment. Part
of Buffett’s thought process: If an investment cannot clear a given hurdle, the
capital is probably better deployed elsewhere. Typically he used a 15 percent
hurdle rate as a standard for comparison.
Not surprisingly, the analysis examines current stock price, earnings 
growth, and potential future stock price based on that growth. If the growth-
supported future stock price can appreciate at a compounded annual growth
rate (CAGR) meeting or exceeding the hurdle rate, it is in buy territory. If
appreciation potential is short of the required price growth hurdle, the stock
is rejected. Either the current stock price is too high or the projected growth is
too weak to meet the growth hurdle. At the risk of providing an oversimplified
example, consider Coca-Cola, which recently sold for $60.50 with annual
earnings of $2.34, a P/E ratio of 25.9, and an annual earnings growth rate of
13.3 percent. 
The earnings growth rate is quite healthy for a company the size of Coca-Cola,
a $28 billion company in annual sales. But the fact that earnings growth trails
the hurdle rate, that the P/E exceeds market averages (about 18 for the S&P
500 at the time), and that the earnings yield is under 4 percent, you would be
skeptical of Coke as an investment.
Taking the calculation further, you may project what Coke’s EPS would be
after 10 years:
$2.34 * (1+0.133)10 = $8.16
Then, calculate the stock price appreciation necessary to meet the 15 percent
hurdle:
$60.50 * (1+0.15)10 = $244.75
Then, calculate the implied P/E in 10 years:
$244.75 ÷ $8.16, or 30
The stock would have to command a P/E of 30 after 10 years, despite growing
dramatically to reach that level — a P/E that is in all probability unrealistic.
Put differently, the stock price is unlikely to grow at 15 percent given the
assumptions made. Either earnings growth would have to exceed the current
expectation, or the current stock price would have to be lower, to make the
15 percent hurdle. 
So using this approach, you would probably reject the investment at the cur-
rent price. 
276
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Before rejecting Coke altogether, you must consider whether the 13.3 percent
growth rate is really right. If sales, profitability, and/or productivity are in for
major improvement, Coke could still be a good buy. Don’t forget the funda-
mentals underlying earnings and earnings growth.
Lesson 3: Deconstructing P/E
You may have seen published figures for price to sales (P/S) and price to
book (P/B) ratios. These ratios can help clarify the current price of a stock
and the context for that price. But do they relate to P/E? And if so, how? Does
the relationship between the three ratios tell us something more about the
business? Turns out, the answer is yes.
If we take apart P/E (or more accurately its inverse earnings to price or earn-
ings yield [EY), you’ll see the relationship. 
Deconstruction #1: Price, sales, net profit
The first deconstruction looks at price, sales, and profits:
Earnings/price (EY) = Earnings/sales × Sales/price
Yes, yet another equation. But a closer look reveals familiar territory.
Earnings/sales translates to net profit margin, which is a key measure of 
success. Sales/price is the inverse of the more common P/S ratio. So the
equation could be restated as:
Price/earnings (P/E) = (1/profit margin) × Price/sales (P/S)
Now you can see that a given EY (or P/E) is driven by profit margins and the
ratio of price to sales. A high P/S ratio may be justified by a high profit margin,
because the resulting EY will be favorable. But if a company has a high P/S but
a low profit margin, the resulting earnings yield would be low, and the result-
ing investment would be suspect.
What kind of P/S makes sense?
If Company A has a P/S ratio of 4, and Company B has a P/S ratio of 1, most
investors would jump at the chance to buy Company B. Invest a dollar for a
dollar of sales, and the profit margin will take care of the rest. Future growth
is gravy. Many small businesses are bought and sold on this basis. But what if
profit margins are chronically thin? The resulting earnings will suffer, and the
price won’t be justified, which is why investors shouldn’t look at P/S in a
vacuum.
277
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right

P/S ratios below 2 are generally considered attractive. But it depends on the
profit margin. Some companies in basic industries or thin-margined retail are
actually well below 1. Ford has a microscopic P/S ratio of 0.11, but has been
losing money, and even in good times had a net profit margin of only about 3
percent. 
When P/S creeps up to 3, most investors become skeptical. Four or greater,
and look out — unless profit margins and/or growth potential are excep-
tional. Microsoft, quite unlike Ford, has a net profit margin nearing 30 per-
cent, so perhaps the apparently out-of-line P/S ratio of 6.15 isn’t so out of line,
so long as the monopolistic profit margins can hold. 
Again, like most other tools, P/S deconstruction shouldn’t be overused or
overly depended upon, but it’s a good way to check if price is in balance with
sales and earnings potential.
Deconstruction #2: Price, book value, ROE
Earnings yield can be examined through another path: book value and profit
return on book value, which is more widely known as return on equity, or
ROE. A company with a high ROE is initially a good purchase candidate
unless the price is out of line with the underlying equity. Enter the third
“cousin” of P/E: the price to book, or P/B, ratio.
When buying a share of stock, ideally you would want to receive a dollar of
owner’s equity for each dollar invested. However, such is rarely the case.
Accounting practices distort the true equity value of companies, and a dollar-
for-dollar approach would omit growth and growth potential from considera-
tion. So typically, most companies sell at a multiple to book value. Companies
selling below book value are hard to find and may indicate overvalued assets
or other forms of financial distress. The classic Graham value investing school
called for buying companies selling at less than book value or working capi-
tal, but “clean” opportunities seldom come forward today.
278
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 
Sky high
Amazingly, in the 1999–2000 bull run, P/S ratios
went into orbit. Cisco at one point sported a P/S
ratio of 30 ($82 on $2.65 sales per share). With a
P/S ratio of 30, net profit margin would have to
be 100 percent just to get “down” to a P/E of 30
or earnings yield of 3.3 percent! High profit mar-
gins and high growth would be expected to be
sure, but the business would have to grow an
awful lot to justify those kinds of valuations.
Today, after a 66 percent “haircut” from the all-
time 2000 high, the price is about $28 on sales of
about $6 per share. That’s a P/S ratio of 4.7 on a
net profit margin of around 22 percent. A lot of
things have to go right for a long time to justify
even the current price. 

The equation:
Earnings yield (EY) = Earnings/equity (ROE) × Equity/price (1/(P/B))
Or
Price/earnings (P/E) = 1/ROE × Price to book (P/B)
So, as with P/S and profit margins, a combination of healthy ROE and reason-
able P/B indicates value. Because of the wide range of accounting practices,
hard and fast rules are less reliable, but companies with an ROE of greater
than 20 percent and a P/B of 5 or less achieving earnings yield with a bal-
anced approach.
Chapters 13 and 14 devoted a lot to deconstructing ROE and understanding
drivers and leading indicators. If a company has a good ROE story, present
and future, and a relatively low P/B today, the investor may be in “value” 
territory. 
Again, Microsoft provides the upper “bookend” to the P/B-ROE relationship,
with a P/B of 10.3 and a stellar ROE exceeding 43 percent. More “normal”
would be Hewlett-Packard, with a P/B of 3.6 and an ROE of 18.6 percent. 
Again, the law of large numbers and competition can rear its ugly head at the
least opportune moments. Very high P/B ratios may be sustained by very high
ROEs, but very high ROEs themselves are hard to sustain (see Chapter 13).
279
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right
Look out for “large numbers”
When a share price valuation is built on high P/S
ratios and very high profit margins, watch out for
the “law of large numbers” and competition. The
law of large numbers says that, sooner or later,
things move toward averages or norms. The P/S
ratio, and thus stock price, may be vulnerable to
downside surprises if the margins prove unsus-
tainable. Microsoft supports its price and high
P/S ratio with exceptionally high margins. That
may be okay for market-dominant Microsoft, but
other “mortal” companies may be walking the
edge of a cliff. Companies with very low P/S
ratios and low margins may sustain price valua-
tion with high sales or sales growth, but watch
out for sales downturns. Retailers, especially
glamorous “concept” retailers, often walk the
edge of the sales downturn “cliff.” As in golf,
staying away from the edges and toward the
middle is the best bet.

Lesson 4: Price to Cash Flow
Today, much of the analysis you see or do goes beyond P/E. Many analysts
and sophisticated investors prefer to look at price as it compares to cash
flow or free cash flow — as truer indicators of business performance. Why?
Because earnings can be managed while, especially over the long haul, cash
flow is cash flow. 
So today’s investors are inclined to look at price to cash flow (P/CF) or price
to free cash flow (P/FCF) ratios. The concept is simple: How much cash does
the company throw back your way per dollar of cash invested?
Unfortunately, cash flow doesn’t always give the best read on a business,
especially in the short term. Fixed asset purchases and working capital
adjustments (accounts receivable, inventory) often distort the short-term
view, and so investors should look long term and at free cash flow. From
Chapter 8, “free” cash flow is defined as net earnings, plus depreciation and
amortization, less average annual capital expenditures, less (or plus) working
capital changes. 
Unfortunately, getting a valid free cash flow figure takes some work, especially
to get the proper long-term view. You won’t find these figures in most com-
pany financial statements, nor the newspaper or financial portals. Yahoo!
Finance does show free cash flow on its “Key Statistics” page, but it’s a short-
term view. And while Value Line provides many of the ingredients, you’ll still
have to do the calculations. 
Regardless, if you can get to a dependable P/FCF figure, it makes an excellent
business barometer and standard for comparison. “Earnings yield” can be
replaced with “cash flow yield” for a truer indication of what you’ll really get
back from the business at the end of the day.
280
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 
Is apples-to-apples important? 
Financial stocks tend to sell with the lowest P/B
ratios, because a lot of their book value lies in
cash or cash-equivalent assets, not factories or
other hard-to-value assets in an accounting
sense. So it makes the most sense to compare
P/B and ROE figures within an industry, not
across industries. But what about P/S and net
profit? 
Should you compare these within an industry,
too? Turns out, while that may be best, it’s not
so important. P/S ratios tend to vary between
companies mainly due to growth, which trans-
lates well across businesses, while P/B ratios
vary because of asset valuation, which may be
more industry-specific.

Lesson 5: Quick rules for recognizing 
value and un-value
This lesson summarizes how to use P/E and its “family” of measures to recog-
nize value and un-value in stocks and stock prices. Many of these can be
found in common stock screeners, so it’s possible to use these factors not
only for final valuation but also for stock selection.
Value
First, find sound and improving business fundamentals — improving ROE dri-
vers and intangibles. Then:
Earnings yield > bond yield (now or soon, some compensation for equity
risk)
PEG 2 or less (growth at a reasonable price)
Stock price growth potential exceeds hurdle rate (e.g., 15 percent, 10 years,
probably better than most other investments)
P/S < 3 and profit margin > 10 percent (good profitability at reasonable
price)
P/B < 5 and ROE > 15 percent (good overall returns at reasonable price)
Shares of companies that fit the preceding factors (the more factors, the
better) are more likely to be a good value for the price. 
Un-value
Earnings yield < bond yield with low growth prospects
PEG > 3, with low or unsustainable growth
Stock price growth falls short of hurdle rate (e.g., 15 percent)
P/S > 3 with low margins
P/B > 5 with low ROE
Making the Buy Decision
Most of this chapter covers the use of P/E as one of the main tools to relate
price to company value. But a lot of space is devoted in Chapters 12 through
14 to calculating intrinsic and strategic value, and these only sort of came into
the P/E equation through earnings. Has the commitment to treat an invest-
ment decision like buying a business gone by the wayside? 
281
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right

As you may guess, the answer is “no.” All pieces of that in-depth appraisal
create a better understanding of the business, a better understanding of the
fundamentals upon which earnings and future owner returns are based. They
help shape the earnings estimate — and the investors’ confidence in the 
estimates.
But it’s worth raising a few more principles and thought processes to consider
in the buying decision. 
What about intrinsic value? 
Ten-plus pages of detailed price assessment using P/E, earnings yield, P/B,
P/S, and hardly a word about intrinsic value? After 15-plus pages about it in
Chapter 12? After repeated Graham and Buffett quotes about how cash returns
and intrinsic value define the value of a business? Explanation, please.
The explanation is simple. If you went to the trouble to calculate intrinsic
value, and you feel good about the answer as a measure of the worth of a
business, by all means, use it. The formula is really simple: If price is greater
than intrinsic value, the stock is overpriced; if it’s less than intrinsic value, it
is underpriced (for you math heads, that’s buy if price to intrinsic value 
[P/I] is less than 1 and sell if P/I is greater than 1).
So do we cast aside P/E by using P/I instead? No. P/E and especially PEG look
at the same things: earnings and growth. Intrinsic value looks at earnings
growth in more detail, with varying growth rates. Intrinsic value also looks
explicitly at the current interest rate climate and risk through the cost of capi-
tal, where P/E and PEG look at it only indirectly by earnings yield comparisons.
So, P/E and its family are really closely related to P/I, and due to the 
complexity of intrinsic value and the fact that we’ve never seen a P/I ratio 
in the paper or other popular financial resources, it’s good to know both
approaches. Both the principles and the calculation provide valuable insight.
What about that “strategic” stuff?
Strategic financials and intangibles, covered in depth in Chapters 13 and 14,
mainly contribute to understanding the business and supporting the growth
projections used in the pricing models. They can be especially important in
determining upside or downside. If today’s growth rate for Coca-Cola is pro-
jected at 13.3 percent, you can, by your own absorption of strategic financials
and intangibles, decide whether this makes sense, and which alternative sce-
narios you want to emphasize. Value investors should never lose sight of lead-
ing indicators, and never be reluctant to re-evaluate a company if they change.
282
Part III: So You Wanna Buy a Business? 

Don’t forget about cash and debt
No doubt it makes sense to look at business earnings, assets, and growth
prospects. But wouldn’t it be nice, if you’re buying a business, simply to
know that it has a lot of cash in the bank?
For most businesses, cash is king. It’s worth what it’s worth, and can be used
for whatever you wish. Clearly, if you were to buy a business for $100,000,
and it had $100,000 in unencumbered cash on its books, that’d be a heck of a
deal, unless the company consistently loses money or is a target of a major
lawsuit or something. The cash would give full value for your purchase price,
and the business would be essentially free.
Now, that doesn’t happen too often. But you will see cases where companies
are flush with cash, best measured on a cash-per-share basis. A company sell-
ing for $15 with $5 in cash per share on its books has a much greater margin
of safety than one that has only 50 cents worth. Small industrial laser tool
maker Coherent, Inc. sells for about $30 per share and has over $14 per share
in cash. That’s a great cushion — such a good one, in fact, that at least a few
big shareholders are wondering why some of it hasn’t been paid out.
Now, when looking at cash, make sure to net out debt, at least the long-term
variety. In fact, Coherent has about 75 cents per share of debt on the balance
sheet, so debt isn’t a major factor, and the cash appears to be unencumbered
and have real value to the business. Also be careful about startups or other
situations where a substantial chunk of funding cash may have just been
received — companies with a so-called “burn rate” coming as the business
develops.
As with many other value components, there’s no hard-and-fast guideline as
to how much cash a company should have or how many dollars per share in
cash a company should have given a certain stock price. It’s a judgment call;
but in almost all cases, the more cash the better. 
Buy low, improve your chances
Value investors buy cheap. Why? Two reasons: 
 Provide a margin of safety.
 Allow for proportionally better returns on dollars invested.
283
Chapter 16: Shopping for Value: Deciding When the Price Is Right

Probably the second most common investing mistake (after throwing good
money after bad) is finding and buying a great company (with growth, intrin-
sic value, supporting fundamentals, and intangibles all there), but paying too
much for it. Paying too much simultaneously creates downside vulnerability
and limits upside potential. The mathematics of underperformance detailed
in Chapter 4 should be reason enough to buy cheap and provide yourself
with that safety margin. 
284

Part IV
Becoming a Value
Investor

In this part . . .
W
e offer information on setting goals and developing
your own value investing style. We provide some
commentary on how to figure out what works best for you.
Because value investment choices go far beyond common
stock, we present chapters describing mutual funds, bonds
and convertible securities, real estate and real estate
investment trusts, and other specialty investments.

Chapter 17
Special Packages: Funds, REITs,
and ETFs for Value Investors
In This Chapter
 Using open-ended and closed-ended mutual funds in value investing 
 Understanding real estate investment trusts (REITs) 
 Exploring exchange traded funds (ETFs) as an alternative to other managed investments
A
ny consumer knows that a packaged, bundled assortment of products is
sometimes a better deal than buying items individually. Buying a PC
bundle for one price is often a better value than buying the system compo-
nents individually.
And any individual investor knows that he doesn’t always have the knowledge,
skills, or time to consistently pick out the best businesses in which to invest.
These two forces combine to motivate a look at investment products; that is,
professionally established and managed investment vehicles created to 
give investors an opportunity to buy a packaged, bundled assortment of
investments.
Although coming with a cost, these professionally designed and managed
products can be useful to value investors in a variety of ways. This chapter
explores the three largest groups of packaged investment products — mutual
funds, REITs, and exchange traded funds (ETFs) — and how they fit into the
scheme of things for value investors. 
Mutual Funds
Although the selection and ownership of individual stocks provides more for
investors to do and more to talk about with their friends, mutual funds are
the backbone of most investors’ portfolios. According to the Investment

Company Institute, an association of investment managers, nearly half of all
American households hold at least one mutual fund. And about half of all IRA
and 401(k) investments are done through stock mutual funds. 
Fidelity, Vanguard, Oppenheimer, and Putnam are all household names. The
financial media continue to highlight mutual fund performance and give
celebrity status to chosen fund managers. But so far, you’ve gotten the pic-
ture that value investing is a do-it-yourself enterprise, right? Research busi-
nesses, appraise them, and buy when the price is right. Value investors are
trained to do their own analysis to find a few good companies to hang onto
for the long term. So where do funds fit into the value investing picture?
The truth is, certain funds invest just as a value investor would individually.
There aren’t many, and the definition of “value” has evolved, but they do
exist. And if you can employ a fund manager and a staff to do exactly what
you would do, with all the expensive professional information at their dis-
posal, well, why not? Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have done it for
years, so why shouldn’t you? 
But fund investing isn’t for everyone, and we’ll get into the pros and cons in a
moment. Know that each fund is different and distinct, and they all come with
particular nuances with which the informed investor should become familiar.
Even an experienced investor could get overwhelmed with the thousands of
funds out there. With so many available, how does a value investor choose? 
The first part of Chapter 17 explores traditional, or “open-ended,” funds and
their role in value investing as an alternative to selecting individual stocks.
After covering traditional open-ended funds, their closed-ended cousins come
into the spotlight. Then we get to the more distant cousins: REITs and ETFs. 
This chapter doesn’t provide in-depth coverage of the details and nuances of
mutual funds and how they work. That’s best left for other books and there are
many — Eric Tyson’s Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th Edition, is one example.
A short history
Although mutual funds as an investment vehicle first appeared in 1924, their
legal form and regulatory requirements are largely products of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, a law defining many of the rules for special entities
known as “investment companies.” 
The function of investment companies is, at its essence, to avoid corporate
level taxation — hence, double taxation — of fund returns. 
In return for the tax exemption, investment companies must pay 90 percent
or more of any earnings to their investors. Investment companies also have
specific disclosure requirements and marketing rules to protect investors. 
288
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

The first real mutual fund “boom” occurred in the 1960s, as markets rose and
greater numbers of individual investors viewed mutual funds as a way to
invest without engaging with the still-murky world of investment analysis and
cigar-puffing full-service stockbrokers.
Mutual funds ebbed a bit as markets became more “democratized” in the 1970s
and 1980s, with reduced commissions and consumer-friendly interfaces arriv-
ing from discount brokers. But they also got a boost from the advent of self-
directed 401(k)s and other retirement savings plans, and increasing popularity
and widespread investing in the stock market. Mutual funds also kept up by
setting up to be bought and sold through discount brokers.
The Internet boom of the 1990s made individual stock investing even easier,
and the more aggressive investors started relegating funds to retirement sav-
ings, while investing nonretirement assets in individual stocks. That trend, of
course, retracted with the dot-com crash, as many of those investors
retreated to the safety of professional investment managers.
Now well into the first decade of the 21st century, two factors are once again
causing a shift away from traditional mutual funds: (1) the advent of ETFs as
a lower cost, more liquid alternative, covered later in this chapter; and (2)
the exposure of unscrupulous trading practices at some of the largest and
most well-known traditional mutual fund firms.
Today, funds are still a good vehicle for getting started and for anchoring an
investment portfolio. Today’s value investor should know about traditional
mutual funds, both closed ended and open ended, along with the REITs and
ETF alternatives examined later in the chapter. 
How traditional funds work
You’ll see funds grouped into two major categories: open ended and closed
ended. The two are quite different. Open-ended funds are the “traditional”
funds you normally see in the paper and hear about on the talk shows. While
these funds dominate the investment company space, closed-ended funds
can actually bring better values to an investor. 
You’ll see quotes for some of the 9,000-plus open-ended funds every day in
the paper. Most are part of a larger fund family, such as Fidelity, Oppenheimer,
or TIAA-CREF. 
There is no exchange trading of the shares; open-ended fund shares aren’t
bought and sold among individuals, but rather between individuals and the
fund company. Individuals send in money (either by check or through broker-
age platforms). That payment immediately becomes part of the fund and is
converted into new shares owned by the investor. Each share represents that
289
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

investor’s proportionate share of the net asset value of that fund. If the
investor sells or redeems shares, those shares go away and the investor is
credited or sent a check for his or her proportionate share of the fund’s net
assets.
Not sure whether it’s an open-ended fund or a closed-ended fund? Look at the
symbol: All open-ended mutual fund symbols are made up of five letters.
Closed-ended funds trade on exchanges, and therefore have a three- or four-
letter symbol. Furthermore, open-ended mutual funds are usually listed in the
Mutual Fund section of newspaper stock listings, whereas closed-ended funds
are usually found in a separate Closed-Ended Fund listing.
Pricing
When you invest in a mutual fund, you actually buy a proportional claim of
ownership to the underlying securities, usually a combination of stocks,
bonds, cash, and other investments, according to the fund’s charter and
investment strategy. 
The mutual fund share price is known as net asset value, or NAV. The NAV is
determined by taking the total assets — securities and cash held in the fund —
less any liabilities or accrued expenses, divided by the number of shares 
outstanding.
The NAV fluctuates each day according to the market price movements of the
underlying securities held by the fund, but it does not change based on addi-
tional investments or withdrawals from the fund. New investor dollars received
by the fund become cash assets in the fund, while investor redemptions are
matched by a reduction in cash assets and sometimes security sales, if fund
cash buffers are used up.
There is no limit to the number of shares that a fund will issue. Closed-ended
funds, on the other hand, have a fixed number of issuable shares. Open-
ended funds must stand ready to buy back shares from investors every day,
so ordinarily carry some cash in their accounts to handle these redemptions.
Fees and expenses
Large mutual fund companies — such as Fidelity, Vanguard, and
Oppenheimer — package, market, and manage an assortment of mutual funds
ranging from a handful to hundreds (in the case of Fidelity). Managing a fund
or fund family entails researching and choosing the investments, monitoring
performance, paying investors, filing regulatory documents, and so on. And
as you may imagine, these services don’t come free. And, keep in mind, these
companies are also out to make a profit. 
290
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

The result — and you probably already know about this — most mutual
funds charge fairly hefty fees for their efforts, ranging from about .50 percent
to 2 percent of net asset value — annually — and higher. So if you have
$20,000 invested in a fund, you may be paying $100 to $400 per year just to
manage and market the fund. (Yes, you as an investor do pay to market the
fund to other investors through something known as a 12b-1 fee.)
That may not seem like much, but a quick trip over to Chapter 4 shows in
eye-popping detail what market “underperformance” can cost — and a fixed
fee coming out of your investment portfolio comes right out of your market
return. Put differently, if your fund succeeds in earning 5 percent with its
investments for the year, and it charges 1 percent in management fees, it is
taking fully 20 percent of your returns as a fee for producing them!
If you’re thinking about funds, make sure to know what the fees are and what
you’re getting for your money. But also remember that while fees can be high,
you do get a service for them, and it may be well worth the expense to get
professional management and to get stock selection off your plate. 
Load and no-load funds
Beyond fees and expenses, you’ll often hear the terms load and no-load used
to describe different types of funds. Load funds add sales charges, usually up-
front and sometimes at the time of sale. These charges are often hefty, but
can also be in lieu of ongoing management fees, making load funds some-
times work better for long-term investors. Many mutual funds give a choice
between “A,” “B,” “C,” and maybe “D” shares, allowing you to pick how much
cost you want to pick up at the beginning, end, and/or during your fund own-
ership. Sales charges — the “load” — typically cover marketing costs but
may not cover all management fees. 
No-load funds, on the other hand, have no up-front or redemption sales
charges but instead collect marketing costs and management fees by deduct-
ing them from the fund value. No-load fund fees can create a bigger drag on
long-term performance.
Typically, the choice of load or no-load has nothing to do with the fund
investing style, performance, or quality of investments. Rather, it has to do
with what fees you want to pay and when you want to pay them. You can see
that load funds may be better for the long run, because annual returns to
you — or better yet, reinvested — have relatively little deducted from them.
The full force of compounding power is unleashed. And, in some cases, back-
loaded redemption fees are waived if the fund is held long enough — usually
8 or 10 years in funds that use this practice. No-load funds, on the other
hand, are better for shorter-term plays, because you don’t get hit with selling
or redemption fees, which can be as much as 5 percent of your investment
value (by law, there is an 8-percent cap). 
291
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

As a value investor, you should first look at whether the fund matches your
own investing philosophy and style, and whether it has a good track record.
If in alignment, then you should look at how fees are handled, and choose
according to how high the fees are and how long you plan to hold the fund.
A question of style
Moving on from the mechanics of open-ended mutual funds, it’s time to explore
how different funds, or kinds of funds, may suit your needs as a value investor.
There are literally dozens of types of mutual funds, ranging from the most
aggressive small company speculative funds to stable, doughty, short-term
bond funds. Bond, stock, international, U.S., growth, income, hedge, option,
convertibles, tax-free bond, high-yield bond, government bond, and on and
on — not to mention combinations of all the above, and of course, value
funds. Covering the whole spectrum of mutual fund choices is beyond our
scope and is better left to books and educational materials specializing in
funds.
Mutual funds are, of course, grouped according to their primary strategy or
sphere of investing — growth, income, emerging markets, Asia-Pacific, or
even country-specific funds. These groupings naturally give investors an idea
of what the fund is trying to do, not to mention being selection criteria for
fund selection. 
But the investing world has, thanks largely to mutual fund and stock invest-
ing portal Morningstar (www.morningstar.com), come to group mutual
funds according to the type of businesses they predominantly invest in.
“Type” in this case refers to (1) business fundamental profile and (2) size 
of the business. 
The expression “business fundamental profile” is awkward but accurate. The
style selector differentiates between “growth” and “value” labels for the fund,
based on how fund investments align to specific valuation and growth mea-
sures. Morningstar analysts classify funds according to how their invest-
ments stack up with their peers on the following valuation measures:
 Price to earnings (P/E) ratio (specifically, price to projected earnings)
 Price to cash flow (P/CF)
 Price to sales (P/S)
 Price to book (P/B)
 Dividend yield
292
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

. . . and the following growth measures:
 Projected earnings growth
 Sales growth
 Cash flow growth
 Book value growth
If the majority of companies fall into the top tiers on valuation measures, the
fund is considered a value fund. If the majority falls into the top echelon in
growth measures, it is considered a growth fund.
The Morningstar style box
Morningstar has developed a unique and generally accepted way to map a
fund investing style: the Morningstar style box. The style box maps the busi-
ness fundamental profile against the typical size of the company the fund
invests in. 
Figure 17-1 shows a style box example for U.S. stock mutual funds. Funds can
be placed on the value/growth axis as either value, growth, or a blend,
depending on how the spectrum of companies invested in score compare 
to other funds. 
Here is how the size axis is mapped: 
 Small, or small cap: Companies with market cap less than $1 billion
 Medium, or midcap: Companies between $1 billion and $5 billion
 Large, or large cap: Companies worth more than $5 billion

Researching mutual funds
If you plan to build traditional mutual funds into your investment portfolio,
just as with stocks you’ll need a solid approach to evaluate funds and infor-
mation sources to do your research.
What to look for
As mentioned, giving a complete guide for evaluating funds is beyond the
scope of this book, but here are a few checkpoints a value investor may look
at to start:
 Style: From the style box, and more generally, what does a fund invest
in, and how closely does it stick to that style?
 Stated mission and objectives: What does fund management say about
what it is trying to do?
 Fees/costs: How do costs stack up against other similar funds? How much
of a drag will fees put on your investment performance?
 Top holdings: As a value investor, there’s no better way to assess whether
a fund is aligned to your style than to look at its specific investments. If
those investments, especially the largest ones, pass your value judg-
ment, the fund is probably on the right track. And don’t be afraid to use
these lists for stock investment ideas — but also know they are dated
from the last fund report and may not be current.
294
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 
Good, but not ‘til the last drop
After a revision, this new Morningstar mutual
fund style box framework went into effect in
June, 2002. It superseded a much more sim-
plistic way of classifying based on just two 
measures — the P/E and P/B ratios. 
The additional depth is helpful. One of
Morningstar’s objectives was to make it easier
for funds to mix styles; indeed, a “value” fund
can own a few growth stocks and be consid-
ered a value fund if its holdings still center on
companies with strong valuation. The fact that
funds are judged relative to each other rather
than strict valuation guidelines is also good.
However, while accommodating some “growth”
stocks in a “value” fund, the approach still
draws a distinction between “growth” and
“value.” As this book has stressed from the
start, growth can be an important component of
the value equation. Stated differently, a growth
stock can be a value stock, and a fund full of
growth stocks can be a value fund, if they use a
rational, intrinsic-value based approach to
select their stocks.
That all said, the style box is a handy way to
classify funds for further research, and we can
all applaud its simplicity and usefulness for
giving a quick read on a fund’s investing style.

 Performance (?): Intuitively, you may think performance is the first
thing to check, but many fund investors save it for last. Why? Because
the past may not predict the future, and may in fact indicate the fund is
exposed to a fall — hence the question mark. The best approach is to
evaluate funds against their peers in the same category rather than
taking stated performance as prima facie evidence of success.
Research services
There are many, and Yahoo! Finance gives a reasonable treatment in its
“Mutual Funds” section. You can also research individual mutual funds by
going to the fund company Web site.
But far and away the strongest portal and research service for the “consumer”
investor comes from Morningstar (www.morningstar.com). Morningstar
not only classifies funds and gives key summary facts, but with its “premium”
service ($15.95/month or $145/year in 2007) it also gives detailed research
reports and analyses of hundreds of funds. 
Morningstar puts a great summary onto a scrolling two-page browsing window.
Three important “chunks” from that window include Portfolio Analysis Fees
and Expenses, and Performance. Here they are in Figure 17-2, using a small
value fund known as RiverSource MidCap Value as an example. 
The style box is probably the first thing to jump out at you. Below that lies
another grid showing the dispersion, or “ownership zone,” of the fund. This
relatively new feature shows how much — or how little — the fund manager
sticks to the stated style. The rest of the page shows allocations to different
sectors and to stocks versus other investments — useful but not prime real
estate. Listed at the bottom are the Top 5 holdings and, importantly, whether
the fund has added or subtracted from those holdings recently.
While the Morningstar summary gives the Top 5 holdings, other sources do
better, giving the Top 10 or more. Yahoo! Finance and the fund’s own site (at
www.riversource.com) give the Top 10, and some fund Web sites may give
a longer list for their funds.
Next on the Morningstar page is the Fees and Expenses summary. See 
Figure 17-3.
295
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

In the Fees and Expenses summary you can see the fund is no-load — there
are no sales or redemption fees — and the total expenses, including the man-
agement fee, ran 1.16 percent as last reported, about the middle of the pack
for this type of fund. 
And next on the Morningstar page is the Performance summary, shown in
Figure 17-4. You’ll see this first, but perhaps you should look at it last —
that’s up to you.

The Performance summary shows the usual graphs and charts; more impor-
tantly, it shows how this fund compares to others in its own category. The
consistent “+” category comparisons and top percentile rankings speak well
for this fund. 
Those interested in funds and, in particular, the Morningstar page, will find
more on the page and much more on the site.
Fund Web site
Portals like Morningstar not only give a lot of information, but give it in a
format that helps making comparisons relatively easy. You can screen funds
to narrow the list, then check out the fund Web site to get more detail and to
get a feeling for how a fund does business. Among items on the checklist, the
fund site will usually provide stated mission and objectives, as RiverSource
does:
RiverSource Mid Cap Value Fund employs a deep value approach to
investing, seeking low-priced stocks that are currently “out of favor” and
believed to be temporarily undervalued in the market. This mid cap fund
invests in domestic equities of mid-sized companies similar to the Russell
Midcap Value Index and may offer strong appreciation potential relative to
large-cap stocks but with less risk than small-cap stocks.
Fund Web sites are also a good place to read about the assortment, or family,
of funds offered by a fund company.
The case for and against traditional funds
Today there are about 3,000 stock-based, open-ended funds with some $6.4
trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute. So mutual
funds are still a huge player, by one estimate owning about a third of all
common shares outstanding.
Traditional funds are still a big player and are likely to continue to be, espe-
cially as managed retired plans like 401(k)s continue to use them. All investors,
whether they choose to use open-ended funds, should know about them and
their advantages and disadvantages. From a value investing perspective, here’s
a list: 
Pros:
 Professional management: Mutual funds are, of course, managed by
trained, and usually experienced, investment professionals. For them it’s
a full time job, and whether professional fund managers know more than
you do, almost certainly they have access to more information than you
do, including key individuals who work for companies. Most fund 
298
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

managers track company events and conference calls and attend special
investment conferences held by companies specifically for the invest-
ment professional. 
 Convenience: You probably aren’t a professional investor, and so don’t
have time to engage in detailed value analysis, not to mention watch
your investments closely on an ongoing basis. Funds and fund compa-
nies help out by doing the legwork and providing a customer service
department, and provide a convenient way to invest in, say, businesses
in “BRIC” countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). 
 Diversification: Funds provide an easy way to diversify your portfolio —
to own small pieces of many businesses, or to diversify into markets in
unfamiliar countries or industries. However, it’s easy to over-diversify —
more in a minute. 
 Safety: With diversification and professional management comes safety.
Funds tend to take a smaller hit when markets go sour, and certainly less
of a hit than you may take with two or three stocks. 
 Flexibility: The thousands of funds available provide plenty of choice.
Additionally, the ability to easily switch between funds in a family can
help you adjust to market conditions without triggering a taxable event.
Cons:
 Fees and expenses: As mentioned, fees and expenses, sometimes run-
ning as much as 20 or 30 percent of expected returns, can put a lot of
drag on your investing portfolio.
 Over-diversification: By nature, funds invest in a lot of companies; some
are required to by their declared charter. As discussed in Chapter 4,
over-diversification is a poor substitute for picking and focusing on a
few good businesses, and tends to put a drag on returns. Good value
funds shouldn’t have more than about 30 companies in their portfolio,
and for goodness sakes, don’t invest in several funds covering the same
space — they probably own the same stocks!
 Institutional imperative: Professional management brings exposure to
the so-called “institutional imperative” — the tendency for professionals
in the same circles to do the same thing, a herd mentality of sorts. How
many funds, regardless of their charter, owned Microsoft or AOL during
the bubble? Like analysts who put a “sell” rating on a stock when it hits
a 52-week low, fund managers who follow the herd aren’t doing value
investors much of a service. A check of portfolio holdings can be a signal,
but it’s hard to ferret out the individuals from the pack. 
 Loss of control: Most value investors invest entrepreneurially; they like
to have their hands on their investments as they would on a business.
It’s a fundamental tenet of the value investing style. Mutual fund owners
cede that control, and may open themselves up for worse, as the recent
insider trading scandals brought to light. 
299

Closed-Ended Funds
Closed-ended funds, like their more populous and popular open-ended
cousins, are investment companies set up to own securities portfolios. But
unlike traditional funds, closed-ended funds trade on exchanges, and their
prices aren’t directly linked to the underlying value of assets held in the fund.
As of 2005, there were about 800 closed-ended funds with about $370 billion
in total assets.
300
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 
Tax talk
Tax exposure and treatment can be a major
mutual fund downside. Mutual funds are
required to pay out nearly all their net income
each year — 90 percent by law. Depending on
the type of fund, the payments can be doled out
on a regular basis throughout the year or all at
once at year end. Whether they choose to take
the capital gain in cash or reinvest it back into
the fund to purchase more shares, those
investors who own the fund on the record date
receive it all as capital gains or dividend income
and are responsible for any taxes that occur as
a consequence.
Capital gains occur when the portfolio manager
sells a stock for profit. Because all gains must
be paid out each year, this profit is passed pro-
portionally to each shareholder, who in turn
pays tax on the gain. When owning individual
stocks, investors can time the sale of stock so
as to minimize tax consequences. When owning
a mutual fund, the timing on all buys and sells is
under the control of the portfolio manager, who
knows nothing of your tax situation.
Here’s the danger: Especially if you buy a fund
late in the year, the price — based on net asset
value — may have gains built into it. You’ll have
to pay taxes on those gains — and you paid
whoever sold the fund for the gains as part of
the sale price. The net effect is you pay taxes on
someone else’s gain. At year end, you’ll get an
unexpected surprise in the form of a reported
capital gain.
The biggest capital gain surprises can come
from older, established funds that made great
investments long ago, such as Microsoft for $3,
for example. Funds that trade frequently, scor-
ing high on turnover, also create capital gain
exposure, more often and sooner. High turnover
can signify tax inefficiency, as well as bring
value focus into question. Percent turnover is
reported by Morningstar and other information
sources. 
Especially if you buy late in the year, it’s a good
idea to find a fund’s analysis of estimated capi-
tal gains for that year. These reports start show-
ing up in September or October, and while
sometimes well hidden, they usually can be
found somewhere on the fund company site.
You can also find out what the fund paid last
year.
Of course, if you hold the fund in a tax-deferred
account, like a retirement account, as many do,
you don’t have to worry about this. 

Closed-ended funds can provide a unique opportunity for value investors.
Why? First, unlike open-ended funds, the market price of a closed-ended fund
doesn’t necessarily match its net asset value. Second, because price doesn’t
necessarily track value, and because closed-ended funds are less popular to
the investing community, their prices tend to lag net asset value. That makes
for possible bargains, and indeed, most closed-ended funds trade at a dis-
count to their net asset value. 
Closed-ended funds have actually been in existence as an investing vehicle
longer than their open-ended counterparts. They differ from open-ended, or
“mutual” funds, mostly in capital structure. Closed-ended funds are invest-
ment companies with shares listed on a stock exchange (some are also
traded over the counter). Shares are traded between investors, not between
an investor and the fund company. Like other publicly traded securities, the
market price of closed-ended fund shares fluctuates and is determined by
supply and demand in the stock market.
Because of the popularity of open-ended funds, closed-ended funds have
become somewhat of a background player in the fund business. Because they
are not major players, and their prices are relatively stable, closed-ended
funds are not listed daily by most financial publications but are listed only at
certain times. The best place to get a listing is the Monday edition of The Wall
Street Journal or the Sunday New York Times or for individual funds, online.
Price, NAV, and discounts or premiums are usually reported.
The price of a closed-ended fund is tied to the market value of the underlying
securities. But it doesn’t match NAV exactly. There is no process to peg the
price to the NAV daily. Instead, the price is set by the market, based on
supply and demand for the shares of the fund. In a sense, a closed-ended
fund is a set of securities within a security — a basket of fluctuating stocks
trading inside a traded stock shell. Closed-ended funds provide investors
with two ways to make and two ways to lose money:
 The underlying value of the securities portfolio changes.
 The market’s assessment of the value of the portfolio changes, which
usually creates a discount or premium to portfolio value in the price of
closed-ended fund shares. 
Are discounts common?
Most closed-ended funds sell at a discount. A recent sampling showed that
more than two-thirds of equity funds trade at a discount, and more than 90
percent of international equity funds trade at a discount. Many discounts are
modest (5 to 10 percent), but many are 30 percent or more.
301
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

Why a discount, anyway?
There is much research and speculation about why discounts happen, but for
our purposes, the debate isn’t nearly as important as understanding a few of
the most common reasons. When selecting a closed-ended fund, investors
must determine the reason the fund is trading at a discount and whether the
discount is significant enough to be attractive. A discount may be justified by
uncertainty, popularity, or perceptions of the fund and the underlying asset
base. All three factors can work to cause a fund based on securities in Russia
or Turkey, for example, to sell at a discount. Likewise, during the heyday of
the Asian Tigers, many funds based in Asia sold at a premium. The reason?
Popularity and the perception of future growth and gains. 
Kinds of closed-ended funds
There are many types of closed-ended funds. The Wall Street Journal lists
closed-ended funds under 14 different headings. You’ll quickly note that most
closed-ended funds are in fixed income categories like bonds and municipal
bonds. For value investors, the so-called “specialized equity” and “general
equity” funds offer the most interesting opportunities. Country funds, under
the category “world-equity funds,” also can be good vehicles to introduce
international diversification into a portfolio. 
Within closed-ended equity funds, value-oriented funds invest in defined cate-
gories like real estate or natural resources. A few strategy funds, like the
Madison Claymore Covered Call Fund, employ covered call option writing
strategies to extract income from equity positions, and pay more than 10 per-
cent in annual returns. These may also be worth a look.
Information, please
From an information perspective, closed-ended funds are treated like a blend
of common stock and open-ended funds. But because they are a specialized,
less-commonly-used, and less-understood vehicle, you won’t find as much
information in typical stock information sources. Still, Standard & Poor’s,
Value Line, and others cover closed-ended funds. And closed-ended funds are
equity securities, subject to the reporting requirements of any stock. So
prospectuses, as well as annual and periodic reports, are all available. Most
funds also offer phone support and access to information on their Web sites.
Closed-ended fund information can be found in Yahoo! Finance and Morning-
star portals if you know the fund name and ticker symbol. Potential closed-
ended fund investors should also check out the Closed End Fund Association
(www.closed-endfunds.com) Web site to learn more about specific funds
and closed-ended fund investing in general. 
302
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

Using closed-ended funds
Just as with open-ended funds, closed-ended funds have advantages and dis-
advantages. Closed-ended fund investors can expect diversification and 
professional management (although some question the quality of this man-
agement since managers aren’t in the limelight as they may be at Fidelity or
Vanguard). There are management fees, usually 1 to 2 percent, extracted from
portfolio returns. Liquidity (relative lack of interest and trading activity) can
be a double-edged sword: If you’re selling, you may not get as good a price,
but if you’re buying, you’ll likely get a discount. It’s not hard to see that these
funds should be considered long-term investments. 
Closed-ended funds can be used to build out a portfolio or add specific com-
ponents like international exposure. Patient value investors seek not only a
good price (meaning a good discount), but also a fund with solid long-term
potential. Many pros use closed-ended funds, including Warren Buffett. In
1972, Source Capital was trading at nearly a 50 percent discount to NAV.
Buffett purchased almost 20 percent of the outstanding shares. Though the
price fluctuated in the interim, Buffett hung in for 5 years before selling for an
estimated $15.7 million profit.
Real Estate Investment Trusts
“They ain’t making any more of it.” How many times have you heard that
phrase to refer to land and real estate, usually from smug real estate investors
or real estate agents? Land would seem like a value investment. It’s certainly
long term, and the long-term price direction is clearly upward. For individual
homeowners, there are tax advantages, too.
And in most economic environments, the fundamentals are strong: increased
demand, fixed supply. Should you consider real estate as a value investment?
And if so, how? Value Line doesn’t publish investment summaries on the five-
acre parcel down the street.
But, in the manner of funds there is another investment “product” you can
use to buffer against the ambiguities of owning a single parcel and take
advantage of diversification and professional management: real estate invest-
ment trusts, or REITs.
REITs — what and why
The details of REIT organization are beyond the scope of this book, but they
are technically investment trusts that work like closed-ended funds holding
real estate instead of stocks or bonds. REITs pool investor money to allow
303
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

average individual investors to invest in a portfolio of commercial, residen-
tial, or specialized real estate properties. 
Face it — unless you’re Donald Trump or were married to him, it is unlikely
that you’ll ever own a 25-story building in New York City, a 100-unit apart-
ment building in San Francisco, or a shopping mall in Dallas. REITs allow you
to do just that. By buying shares in a REIT, you take proportional ownership
in the real estate ventures that the trust owns. And these ventures range
beyond traditional properties to health care and retirement facilities; ports
and warehouses; even car dealerships, penitentiaries, and high-end hotels. 
Certain REIT characteristics make them attractive to the value investor. Just
like closed-ended funds, REITs trade on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ
exchanges, often at a discount to net asset value. It is possible to focus on
certain types of real estate or certain regions of the country. 
And typically, they pay healthy yields, often in excess of 5 percent, while pro-
viding some downside protection. 
There are about 190 publicly traded REITs with some $400 billion of assets.
REITs performed very well during the 2000–2002 market correction, and con-
tinued to perform well as real estate prices boomed in the middle of the
decade, with a gain of 35 percent as a group in 2006, capped off with the $20
billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties late that year. But as the real
estate market soured in 2007, REITs, and particularly those in the mortgage
business or with highly leveraged portfolios, tended to suffer. 
Investors like REITs for their yield, their ownership with hard physical assets,
their stability, and for long-term performance, estimated at over 13 percent
annually during 1975–2005, which is better than most stock investments.
Many investors pick REITs for their negative correlation with stocks — when
stocks are doing poorly, REITs are doing well or are holding their own. 
Kinds of REITs
There are three primary types of REITs:
 Equity REITs own and operate property. An equity REIT must develop
its properties with the intent to operate it, not to sell for a profit. The
income earned by an equity REIT comes from rent on the properties it
owns. This is the most popular type of REIT.
304
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

 Mortgage REITs can either lend money directly to buyers and owners of
real estate or hold loans and other mortgage-backed securities. These
REITs derive income from the interest on mortgages paid to the REIT or
indirectly through the interest paid on the underlying loans.
 Hybrid REITs actively own and operate real estate and make loans or
invest in mortgage-backed securities. These REITs earn profits from the
rent associated with ownership or from the interest associated with
financing ownership or development of real estate through the mortgages.
Dividend income from REITs is normally not subject to the 15 percent maxi-
mum Federal rate legislated in 2003. Why not? Because, as an investment
company, REIT income isn’t taxed at the corporate level, and at least 90 per-
cent of REIT income must be passed on to shareholders. You’ll pay ordinary
tax rates on this income. 
Information, please
Unlike most stocks and mutual funds, the REIT world has traditionally been a
quiet, clandestine one known well only to the few who participate. As the real
estate market boomed and yields expanded mid-decade, REITs enjoyed a
resurgence. But REITs went for years, especially in the late 1990s, as slow, 
relatively unknown underperformers. 
REITs are like common stocks, so many of the common stock research tools
can be used to find out about them. Find a ticker symbol, and you can get a
quote and profile from Yahoo! Finance. They are covered as common stocks
in Value Line. To learn more about REIT investing, or to start the research
process, the National Association of Real Estate Trusts (NAREIT) at www.
nareit.com is a good place to start. 
Yahoo! Finance also has good tools to identify and begin researching REITs. If
you can find your way to the “Industry Index” inside the Industry Center
(here’s a URL: http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/ind_index.html), you’ll 
not only get a list of REITs but also find a handy breakdown of the kind of
property they invest in: Healthcare Facilities, Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Office,
Residential, and Retail. 
Even with these resources, research can still be challenging. Getting to
exactly which properties are owned, what the rent and occupancy rate is,
and whether the parking lot needs paving is pretty difficult. Just like stocks,
you have to place a little faith in the assets, fundamentals, trends, and intan-
gibles such as location and management track record. 
305

REIT advantages
Value investors should understand the advantages and disadvantages of
REITs. Advantages include
 Access: By pooling investor funds, REITs allow individuals to participate
more fully in real estate beyond a residence or a small handful of addi-
tional investments. 
 Professional management: Individual investors receive the expertise
and proven track record of real estate investment professionals.
 Liquidity: Unlike investments in private real estate deals, an investment
in a REIT gives the instant liquidity offered by stock exchanges.
 Tax advantage: Unlike an equity interest in a corporation, profits from
REITs are passed-through to the shareholder and only taxed once. REIT
shareholders do not have to comply with complex filing requirements
and tax statements of limited partnerships and other pooled real estate
investments. 
 Selection: The wide variety of REIT offerings can provide investors the
degree of focus or diversification desired. Some REITs diversify across
geographic areas or types of real estate ventures while others are dedi-
cated to areas as small as a single building in New York City.
 Income stream: REITs offer a relatively stable and predictable income
stream to investors — among the highest current returns available. 
306
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 
REITs and returns 
Funds from operations (FFO) is an important
measure of a REIT’s operating performance.
NAREIT defines FFO as net income (excluding
gains or losses from sales of property or debt
restructuring) with the depreciation of real
estate added back. Most commercial real
estate holds its value longer and more fully than
other tangible equipment that a business may
possess, such as tools or vehicles. 
The depreciation that the accounting process
records each year is often overstated. Current
accounting processes may call for depreciation
of a building (according to a certain formula)
even though the real value of the building may
have increased due to outside forces like
increased demand or low supply of vacancies
in the area where the building is located. For
this reason, adding back the depreciation is a
clearer way to measure the operating profits of
one REIT against another. FFO is more like the
cash flow measures used to evaluate other
businesses, and in most cases more completely
demonstrates annual performance.

REIT risks
Although enticing, an informed investor should understand that REITs have
downsides, such as the following:
 Market risk: The real estate market is the most obvious risk. If a pro-
longed downward pressure mounts on the real estate sector, the value 
of a REIT can decrease despite knowledgeable management and solid
history.
 Business risk: Investors in REITs must take into account current and
anticipated economic conditions for the property held within the trust
to evaluate the current and future success of the endeavor. Are the antic-
ipated returns worth the risks involved to achieve it?
 Interest rate risk: Especially for mortgage REITs, which buy and sell
loans tied to real estate, a change in interest rates or mortgage liquidity
can have a huge impact. With traditional REITS that hold real estate, a
portfolio of long-term fixed rates may be valuable in the face of increas-
ing rates, because the REIT owns its real estate for relatively less cost
than other investors. But this can spell trouble if the rest of the investing
world is paying lower interest on borrowed money, which is the case if
rates fall after you make your REIT investment.
Investing in REITs
Value investors strive to identify investments trading at valuations below
intrinsic value. The objective is then to identify REITs with potential for sig-
nificant appreciation relative to risk. Because REITs are generally regarded as
hedges or defensive investments, they may be overlooked during bull markets. 
Most recently, REITs in healthcare and industrial sectors have done well
because they have both a real estate and a business component. Prologis, a
REIT with worldwide logistics facility interests and a logistics business to go
with it, is a good example.
And during weak economic times, REITs are fairly defensive and often hold
up well because of the underlying stability of real estate prices and rent
returns. That isn’t to say they’re immune, as has certainly been seen with
mortgage REITS and some leveraged residential REITS recently. 
Selecting REITs
In some ways, choosing a good REIT is like choosing any other value invest-
ment. The assets are real estate, debt is like any other debt, and the returns
are rents and other payments received on the portfolio. An investor must
307
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

analyze and compare a REIT’s management quality, real and anticipated
returns, yields, growth, reserves, and asset values. Many of the techniques
covered in earlier chapters for common stock can be put to work here.
Price to earnings (P/E) and price to FFO ratios are examined as they would be
for other businesses — comparison among REITS and relative to growth rates
is important. Also important is the price to book, or P/B ratio. A REIT trading
below its per-share book value is essentially trading at a discount. Remember
that REITs are not immune to asset quality problems, bad management and
management decisions, declining markets, or poor expense management. Do
the due diligence.
Property portfolio
REIT investors should check out the property portfolio. This isn’t easy, but
it’s easier than it used to be with online resources, usually provided by the
REIT company itself. 
Because real estate is not traded regularly, the ability to ascertain values is
limited to appraisals, replacement value, and, for income-producing proper-
ties, discounted cash flow analysis. Appraisals are difficult to find. Looking at
the properties and their locations, and assessing commonly reported local
real estate price trends, occupancy rates, and economic trends, and whether
the book value of a property is sustainable, is probably best.
If the REIT you choose is diversified with a number of different types of prop-
erties in different geographic regions, you will experience less volatility if an
industry or locale experiences hard times. If you are more concentrated, be
sure that the type of property or the geographic area continues to be eco-
nomically viable into the foreseeable future. Occupancy rates for past and
current years are available for most major and some smaller cities in the U.S.
from commercial real estate Web sites, and you may even wish to contact a
local real estate professional.
Funds from operations
Funds from operations, or FFO, includes all income after operating expenses,
but before depreciation and amortization. Growth in FFO typically comes
from higher revenues, lower costs, and management’s effective recognition of
new business opportunities. REITs with a growing FFO are generally more
desirable, because this is a demonstration of an ability to raise rents and
keep occupancy stable. Beware of dividends that are being paid out of profit
from the sale of property or from cash reserves; these payments may not be
sustainable.
Debt and leverage
Good REIT managers will typically hold debt levels to 35 percent or less of
the total capitalization of the trust. Some managers have long tenure and have
weathered many storms. The lower the level of debt, the more conservative
308
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

management tends to be. Also, look for managers investing their own funds in
the REIT.
REIT appraisal is difficult, but there is another way: REIT mutual and closed-
ended funds, and there are even a few REIT ETFs. Many mutual fund families
have funds built around REIT investments. REIT mutual funds are an easy
way to get exposure to REITs without spending volumes of time researching
the valuations of underlying holdings, vacancy rates, economic vibrancy, and
so on. One way to find these funds is to enter “REIT mutual fund” in your
search engine. 
Exchange Traded Funds
Exchange traded funds, or ETFs, are the latest and greatest thing in the invest-
ment “product” space. Essentially, ETFs are open-ended funds that, as the
name implies, trade on exchanges like a stock. For the most part, they are not
actively managed; that is, they track an index instead of being built on portfo-
lio selections of a fund manager.
Since their inception in 1990, ETFs have ballooned in variety and popularity,
growing from 180 choices in 2005 to some 400 choices today. Asset values
have grown to nearly $500 billion, or about 5 percent of the some $10 trillion
in traditional mutual fund assets. They are clearly the growth story in the
fund space.
The mechanics of ETFs are beyond our scope, but ETFs are set up by large
institutional investment companies like Barclays Global Investors or Morgan
Stanley. That company buys a basket of securities to mimic the chosen index;
then sells shares of the ETF. The basket of securities doesn’t change unless
the underlying index changes. So for ETF investors, there is little to no tax
exposure to interim investment sales, and ETFs are highly unlikely to under-
perform or outperform their underlying index. 
ETFs are listed on major stock exchanges, most particularly the AMEX and
NYSE, with a few on NASDAQ. You buy and sell them through your broker,
online if that’s how you trade, and throughout the trading day as you would
with any other stock. 
Reduced fees are one great advantage of ETFs. Because they rely on index
tracking instead of active management choices (and traditional fund market-
ing costs), fees typically run from .10 percent to .50 percent, compared to the
1–2 percent of traditional funds. However, fees are increasing for some of 
the more “exotic” ETFs starting go public. 
309
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

Types of ETFs
With 400 ETFs, growing by leaps and bounds with as many as 30 new funds
added in a good month, you can invest in almost anything through ETFs — 
so long as someone has created an underlying index for it to track.
Generally, ETFs fall into one of the following six major categories, or types:
 Index ETFs: Index ETFs are the original foundation for the ETF move-
ment. Traditional index ETFs track broad indexes like the S&P 500 (the
so called SPDR [“spider”], which is the way the Standard & Poor’s
Depository Receipt ETF is best known) and the Nasdaq 100 Index with
the catchy ticker symbol QQQQ, known in industry jargon as “cubes.” 
Index funds can also track more specific market divisions, like “large cap
growth” and “mid cap value.” These ETFs are sometimes called “style”
ETFs.
 Country ETFs: As the name implies, these funds follow country stock
exchange indexes, and are available for most European and Asian coun-
tries, and some country groupings. 
 Sector ETFs: Sector ETFs generally follow industry segments, like finan-
cials, materials, consumer discretionary, and so forth. 
 Commodity ETFs: Commodity ETFs deviate a bit from traditional ETFs 
in that they usually don’t track an index but often a specific commodity
price, like oil. 
 Short ETFs: Some ETFs are set up to go up when a market index goes
down. ETF provider ProShares offers a series of “short” and “ultrashort”
ETFs covering general and more specific sector ETFs; if your bet is that
technology will decline, you can buy the ProShares UltraShort Technology
ETF. The fund tracks an underlying technology index, and adds leverage
to give price movement double that of the underlying index.
 Strategy ETFs: More recent entries into the ETF space, mainly by fund
providers Claymore Securities and WisdomTree, are based on more 
creative indexes. WisdomTree offers funds, for example, tied to large 
dividend payers, domestically and internationally, and funds tied to con-
ventional indexes, but with specially created indexes using different
weighting formulas. Claymore offerings are still more creative, as exem-
plified by the Sabrient Insider Fund, tracking an index based on compa-
nies with strong insider buying, or the Clear Spin-off ETF, capturing
companies spun off from larger companies. 
As the ETF space proliferates, there’s greater incentive for ETF companies to
get more inventive — that is, to devise new indexes tracking ever smaller 
portions of the market, and to create new ETFs to track them. That’s good,
because we get more choices, and can direct our value investments to more
exact choices. But it can be bad, because as ETFs get narrower, they’re 
310
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

obviously more vulnerable to changes in those markets, and fees will likely
be higher. True value investors should applaud the new choices and be pre-
pared to research the ETF further to decide whether the index really contains
“good stuff.” 
Actively managed ETFs
As you may expect, as the fund industry watches the shift toward ETFs, the
tendency is to offer some degree of active management in the easy-to- use
ETF package. Naturally, active management throws away some of the ETF
advantage, especially in reduced fees. Actively managed funds are still more
of a concept than a reality, but have emerged overseas and are likely to
become more widespread in coming years.
Researching ETFs
As the ETF space grows, so do the research tools. Yahoo! Finance and
Morningstar now both offer portal pages to select and examine specific ETFs.
There are also specialized Web sites (enter “ETF research” into your search
engine). To get the most information, including knowledge of the underlying
index, it’s probably best to go to the fund provider site — there, you can find
a complete catalog of ETFs offered by that provider with some detail.
ETF providers
The list is growing fast but major providers and their “brands” include the
following:
 Barclays Global Investors (“iShares”)
 State Street Global Advisors (“SPDRs”, “streetTRACKS”)
 Rydex
 Merrill Lynch (“HOLDRS”)
 Claymore Securities
 WisdomTree
 PowerShares
 ProFunds (ProShares)
Enter these brands in your browser to get to their sites, or most are accessi-
ble through the Yahoo! Finance and Morningstar portals.
What to look for
As with traditional mutual funds, you should understand fees, and it’s a good
idea to understand the underlying index and what’s contained in it. Portals
and fund sites offer listings of at least the largest holdings. Performance isn’t
311
Chapter 17: Special Packages: Funds, REITs, and ETFs for Value Investors

as much an issue — since the ETF tracks an index, you need to know index
performance, but in this case you aren’t evaluating management performance.
At the end of the day, the amount of research required depends on how
you’re using the fund. If you’re looking to anchor part of your portfolio on
S&P 500 index performance, you probably don’t have to do much research. If
you’re looking to track a more specific market niche, like a specific country,
sector, or strategy, more research is in order. 
Generally, ETF investing requires less research than individual stock invest-
ing, which is why a lot of investors choose ETFs at least for part of their 
portfolio. 
Using ETFs in practice
Like other investment products, ETFs can play important roles in a value
investor’s portfolio. Primary advantages include lower fees and diversifica-
tion, while disadvantages include, well, diversification. Why? Because ETFs
take you away from picking the best businesses and into investment pools
with 20, 30 and sometimes more names. By definition, ETFs don’t outperform
the sectors they invest in, and in practice, most ETFs do not outperform a
carefully selected stock portfolio.
That said, value investors can use ETFs in the following ways:
 Buy sectors: As seen with the Financial sector in 2007, value investors
can decide that an entire market sector is beaten down below its per-
ceived intrinsic value (trying to do the intrinsic value math on an entire
sector is likely a futile exercise!). So value-oriented investors may buy
ETFs in beaten down or out-of-favor sectors — or even countries, if so
intrepid and inclined.
 Buy traditional value: Some ETFs are tied to traditional value indexes —
Midcap Value, for example — so a value investor may invest in a few spe-
cific businesses, then deploy a portfolio segment to broader coverage. 
 Buy value strategies: The aforementioned Claymore and WisdomTree
strategy funds align well to certain value strategies, such as dividends,
insider buys, and spinoffs. If an ETF tracks a strategy you like to use in
your other investments, look deeper.

How Value Investors Use 
Investment Products
To be honest, if you’re an experienced investor with time on your hands and
all the right information and tools at your fingertips, you may not need
investment products. But if you’re just starting out, don’t have time, or need
to build out a portfolio, they may make sense.
Investment products have investor benefits, not just investing benefits.
Selecting stocks can be a daunting chore for busy people. Although you may
be a skilled and knowledgeable investor, you may not have the time or incli-
nation to be actively involved in tracking detailed financial information and
selecting stocks.
One popular strategy for getting started in value investing is to use all the
tools and skills that you pick up in this book to start picking stocks on a
small scale. A few funds, like a core value-oriented fund or ETF, can put the
remaining bulk of your investment dollars to work. Practice makes perfect. As
you gain confidence with your stock selection skills, you can move more dol-
lars into individual equities and allocate fewer dollars to funds.
Funds and investment products can also be a great tool to round out a stock
portfolio. You may not feel comfortable choosing foreign stocks, small com-
pany stocks, or stocks in some other specialty area. You can get exposure to
these areas while getting the help of professional money managers.
Funds, and their choices, can also light the way to individual stock selec-
tions. Although some are reluctant to provide up-to-the-minute lists of
selected stocks (they’re required to twice a year), their investment lists, and
top investments in particular, can initiate your own research into these com-
panies. Most interesting is to follow the funds of value “gurus” (see Chapter 3)
like Bill Nygren and Bill Miller, and of course, Warren Buffett. Imitation is not
only flattering, but it can give you good ideas and save a lot of time. 
Bottom line: Whether or not you’re a do-it-yourselfer, funds and other invest-
ment products have their place.

Shopping for Value: A 
Practical Approach
In This Chapter
 Trading off between philosophy and practicality
 Understanding different kinds of value investing situations
 Using a condensed appraisal approach and checklist 
 Managing your value investments once purchased
F
amed fund manager and value protégé Peter Lynch, in his famous book,
One Up on Wall Street, shared this wisdom: “Once you’re able to tell the
story of a stock to your family, your friends or the dog, and so that even a
child could understand it, then you have a proper grasp of the situation.”
Value investing boils down to finding a good business, analyzing it to find the
simple truths about it, and deciding whether the truths are on track and the
price is right. This chapter sets out to distill the knowledge and background
presented throughout book into a workable, practical approach for everyday
use. It will be sort of a Reader’s Digest version of value investing, if that helps. 
The Thought Process Is What Counts
As the old adage goes with gift giving, in value investing it really is the thought
that counts. Or more precisely, the thought process — how you think about
your investments and investment decisions — that’s important. Analysis
doesn’t decide for you; it only serves to support the thinking behind the
choices you make.
Throughout this book, we cover many analytical building blocks and
approaches to appraising company value and many ways to decide whether
the price paid for that value is right. But we also repeatedly come back to 
the point that no single method works all the time, and if one did, everyone

would make the same findings and buy the same companies and values would
no longer be values. Every article, every book, every value investor has a
unique application of the value investing thought process.
The thought process is the intellectual process — the philosophy — that the
value investor internalizes. The tools are there to help, and different tools
will help more at different times. If you strive to understand the business
value underlying the price before you buy, investing history will be on your
side. As you get good at understanding value and price, your investment
decisions and performance will only improve.
In the real, practical world of value investing, value comes in many forms.
There is so much detail on any given company (much of which you can’t
know) that it often isn’t realistic to become a walking encyclopedia on a com-
pany or its fundamentals. And formulas and ratios, although they work and
can help, hardly can deliver absolute answers. Usually, taking a few shortcuts
makes sense, reserving the deepest analysis to the most critical, difficult, and
largest investing decisions.
As a practical matter, the so-called Pareto principle, also called the 80–20
rule, applies to investing as it does in much of business: 80 percent of the pic-
ture comes from 20 percent of the questions you may ask or facts you may
collect about a business. If you focus on most critical aspects of a given busi-
ness, you’ll get most of the picture, without digging up 100 percent of every-
thing about it. If this weren’t the case, you’d spend six months analyzing each
investment. 
You can’t spend days on each company, and you can’t analyze all companies
in the investing universe. This chapter outlines a simplified, practical
approach to help the new value investor get started, and to help experienced
value investors improve their game. You’ll undoubtedly find yourself adding
plays to your value investing playbook as you gain experience. And you’ll
also get better at finding that 20 percent that’s really important. 
Recognizing Value Situations
As a value investor, you’ll find that value comes wrapped in many different
packages. The mainstream case covered in this book is the growth case,
where solid and improving business fundamentals and intangibles point to
solid business growth down the road, and where the market has undervalued
that growth. That’s arguably the most clear-cut, least risky, and easiest-to-
understand scenario. But other situations do present themselves, and although
they may take weeks of professional-level analysis to fully grasp, they can be
quite interesting. And in a few cases, they may be as easily justified by your
own observations, common sense, and gut feeling as by the numbers.
316
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

Throughout most of this book you’re encouraged to be a do-it-yourselfer. But
in many of the special situations, do-it-yourself may not be practical. Some 
of these value drivers can be well hidden and subjective — like a company’s
breakup value. They often turn into value not through normal business results
but by being unlocked through acquisitions and restructurings. For these sit-
uations it makes sense to rely a bit more on industry professionals and ana-
lysts, who have access to key, paid-for data and a lot of historical precedent.
They can also pick up the phone and call the company itself or others who
may have interest in the assets. Smart value investors know when to — and
when not to — rely on the work of others.
The following sections provide a quick tour of the “situational” landscape.
Growth at a reasonable price (GARP)
So-called “GARP” is the mainstream scenario of reasonable market valuation —
or undervaluation — of growth potential. Solid and improving fundamentals
and supporting intangibles are key. As part of the assessment the value
investor must ask how realistic are the growth projections, particularly over
time, and whether the company takes a balanced approach to the business
and fundamentals. In short, is the business a good business, capable of sus-
tained growth, and selling at a reasonable price? Key words not to lose sight
of are good, sustained, and reasonable.
Or is the business a bet on an extreme but temporary success in short-term
margins, market share, revenue, or profit? The G in GARP must be sustain-
able, not based on a short-term blip, fad, acquisition, or worse, a wild hope.
The business model and its perception in the marketplace must be solid and
on the rise. 
Stocks with a PEG ratio of 2 or less with other solid fundamentals are good
candidates, but “GARP” is not a matter of ratios alone. The earlier example 
of Simpson Manufacturing may fit here, with solid fundamentals and strong
growth prospects based on foreign markets, although the latter is far from a
sure thing. 
The fire sale
Occasionally companies experience deep price declines due to actual or
anticipated news or announcements. These declines can get out of hand, as
more and more bad spin circulates in the market and investors (and institu-
tions) head for seemingly safer waters. The decline is either a one-shot affair
or a longer, momentum-driven decline. The one-shot affair is usually more
attractive to the value investor, as it is often more of a short-term overreac-
tion to news than a fundamental shift in the business.
317
Chapter 18: Shopping for Value: A Practical Approach

Getting creamed
The one-shot hit was recently exhibited by retail laser vision correction
provider LCA Vision. Even though LCAV has no debt, pays a dividend (rare
for a small cap growth stock), and has over $5 in net cash, the stock lost 40
percent of its value, from $28 to $16 over three trading days with concerns
about the economy and an ambiguous earnings outlook (the quarterly report
actually beat expectations). 
The shrewd value investor doesn’t just go out and buy; he or she researches
a situation to determine whether the business model really is broken.
Running the numbers, visiting the stores, and researching the laser vision
correction industry are all appropriate steps in this situation. 
Other examples are too numerous to mention, but anytime a stock loses a
quarter, a third, or half of its value in one day, it may be worth a glance. Just
keep in mind that the reasons for these slaughters are sometimes justified,
and the road to recovery may be difficult. There may be more trouble than
meets the eye. At the same time, a value investor may find bargains among
such distressed inventory.
Misreading the tea leaves
Longer declines are illustrated by nearly the entire telecom and fiber optics
sector in the 1998–2003 era: Long, slow persistent declines driven by ever-
increasing negative sentiment. The reasons are fairly obvious considering the
history of telecom deregulation, the Internet boom, over-ordering, excess
capacity, excess expectations, and subsequent bust. But still, most market
players were focused on the short-term write-offs, layoffs, and lack of visibil-
ity; few looked at the long-term prospects for these businesses. These bust
cycles happen all the time. Some are company-specific; others are inherent in
their industry. Widespread negative sentiment can produce attractive buying
opportunities.
The asset play
GARP refers to growth, but what about assets? Sometimes it isn’t the growth
but the value of current underlying assets that points to value. 
Although in the mainstream case, assets are in place only as resources upon
which to build business growth and thus aren’t valued separately, there will
be cases in which the assets themselves create the value. In other words, 
the company owns them, but they aren’t involved — or aren’t completely
involved — in producing the company’s revenue and profit stream. Or they
could be used more effectively somewhere else, or they simply aren’t valued
correctly on the books. The point is, their actual value exceeds reported
value in the business as it is currently defined.
318
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

Actual value exceeds reported value usually in one of two forms: underval-
ued assets on the books or breakup values that exceed the assets’ current
value to the business. 
Undervalued assets
Both physical and intangible assets can be undervalued, sometimes signifi-
cantly. Frequently this occurs with nondepreciable assets that have been
held for a long time, such as land. Land is often carried on the books at pur-
chase value, which is almost always less than current market value, espe-
cially if held for a long time.
The classic example is railroads, which hold millions of acres originally
granted for free when they were built. Some of this land is used in the busi-
ness, but a great majority isn’t, especially for western roads. Something like 1
percent of all land in California is owned by just a couple of rail firms. Similar
situations occur in oil and other natural resource businesses.
Intellectual property can also be undervalued (although in many cases, espe-
cially with acquisitions, it is overvalued, watch out!). Patents and other
unique, homegrown know-how can have significant value, although corporate
history is littered with companies (Xerox, Bell Labs [Alcatel-Lucent], IBM)
that failed to capitalize on the wealth potential.
The key to undervalued asset plays is whether the assets are really that valu-
able, and what the strategy is for unlocking that value. Railroads until recently
have done little to try to realize the value of their land assets. (Now, we’re
starting to see rail yards converted to downtown plazas, but sometimes at
great expense for environmental cleanups.)
Look for companies with millions of acres or barrels on the books; examine
current market prices; decide for yourself whether there’s an opportunity.
Then look for evidence that the company itself recognizes the opportunity.
Union Pacific Corporation (a railroad parent company) for years not only
looked to sell its rail-adjacent land but also to target potential customer com-
panies who would build facilities along its lines and ship by rail. They had a
whole real estate subsidiary set up around this idea. It was a good strategy,
but so far, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to potential.
When the sum of the parts exceeds the whole
Big, stagnant, set-in-their-ways companies sometimes offer hidden opportuni-
ties. If they were to break into parts, each part would be free to focus on its
core opportunities. Improved focus and reduced corporate bureaucracy can
work wonders toward rekindling growth, satisfying customers, and building
successful new brands. The classic example is AT&T, whose breakup created
billions in new business value (despite the fact that the breakup was far from
voluntary). 
319
Chapter 18: Shopping for Value: A Practical Approach

We see it today in a lot of food companies (such as Kraft Foods) and even
Procter & Gamble, which has spun off several important divisions to J.M
Smucker. And although the spinoff didn’t go public, the Daimler-Chrysler
breakup had a lot of value investors thinking about breakup value. 
The key is to identify these companies; then try to visualize what they may
look like as individual parts — as individual businesses. It isn’t always a suc-
cessful strategy, because new overhead must be created to run each business,
and synergies are lost. A breakup of General Motors may not work because
the dealer network and synergies of common parts platforms would be lost.
It makes more sense where multiple, unrelated, or poorly related businesses
exist under one corporate umbrella. If the customers are different, technolo-
gies are different, or business models are different, separation sometimes
leads to value. Hewlett-Packard and Agilent Technologies (one selling tech-
nology end products and the other selling “things that make things work” to
other technology companies) made a logical break, but it took a long time for
both companies to hit their stride in their marketplaces. 
Markets tend to undervalue huge conglomerates. It is hard to appreciate and
understand the value of each component in detail, so the investing and analy-
sis public tend to discount what they don’t understand.
So put all this together, and you may look at a General Electric or Procter &
Gamble and wonder whether there is more value than meets the stock pages.
Listen to rumors, picture the transition, look for clues that management may
be thinking along the same lines (a few small divestitures may be an experi-
ment). This is an area where professional analysts can provide good informa-
tion on which companies are “in play” and what their breakup value may be.
Growth kickers
From time to time, relatively steady companies come up with small subsidiary
businesses, sometimes related and sometimes not, that can perk up business
growth. Telecom companies got into the cell phone business and 3M is stick-
ing with the Post-It boom. Twenty years ago, the growthless Southern Pacific
Railroad started using its right-of-way for telecommunications lines in a busi-
ness that eventually became Sprint.
These kickers can kindle growth, rekindle growth, and provide good, saleable
assets downstream. They may be like finding chunks of chicken in a bowl of
soup — not there in every spoonful and maybe not there at all. But when a
big company crows about a small new product or business development in
its portfolio within its ranks, keep your eyes open.
320
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

Turning the ship around
Many companies go through restructurings, downsizing, and spinning off
businesses deemed not vital to the core business. There is usually a “back-
to-basics” and “focus” theme to these events, and they usually occur after
extended periods of poor business results. U.S. automakers (particularly
Chrysler) went through this years ago and are obviously doing it again, exem-
plified by Ford’s “Way Forward” campaign. Airlines have done it, albeit with
mixed results, and it’s likely that the banking and lending industry will have
to do the same. 
Do turnarounds work? According to Buffett and many other professionals,
generally not. A few do succeed, and when they do, there’s usually a big
impact on shareholder value. It happened with Chrysler, and again with
Hewlett-Packard (whose problems, notably, were not as severe). Determining
worthy value investments in these situations is difficult. Probably the best
approach is to try to place a value on the core remaining business, as many
did with HP’s core printing business; then try to imagine how other units
would fare either in a sale or with a successful turnaround. Again here, the
work of professionals shouldn’t be ignored.
Cyclical plays 
Generally, cyclical companies shouldn’t be confused with value investments.
Growth, although apparent in the short term, usually isn’t sustainable.
Investors are getting wiser and aren’t as likely to bid up prices in good times,
nor bid them way down in bad times, so this form of market timing doesn’t
work as well.
321
Chapter 18: Shopping for Value: A Practical Approach
Smoke and mirrors
Some apparent asset plays can be a mirage.
Find a company selling at a low price to book
(P/B), look at assets, and notice that per-share
assets are higher than the share price. Is it a
good buy? Depends on the quality and liquidity
of the assets on the books. Large manufactur-
ers and other capital-intensive companies often
have overvalued assets on the books. If the
assets are largely based on buildings, equip-
ment, and intangibles, watch out; but if they are
cash, securities, marketable natural resources,
land, and the like, there may be an asset-play
opportunity. If there is a large cash hoard
exceeding debt, make sure the company is cash-
flow positive or nearly so. You don’t want this
cash to disappear as “cash burn.”

But occasionally companies caught in the cyclical pool come up with strate-
gies to climb out of it, and move more steadily up and to the right.
International expansion can reduce cyclical effects. Manufacturing companies
diversify into more recession-proof financial services (which make more
money as poor business conditions beget lower interest rates). General
Electric has figured this out, and Ford has tried. Other smaller companies
may have more effective cycle-beating strategies, because it’s hard to keep
such big ships as Ford and GE from turning when the wind shifts. If a com-
pany seems cheap and has something new in its portfolio to avoid cyclical
price and earnings behavior, it may be worth a look.
Making the Value Judgment in Practice
In full recognition of the fact that you probably aren’t a professional investor,
and you probably don’t have time to drag your line on the analytic bottoms
of the investing lake, it’s important to offer a practical, simplified model for
picking out value investments.
The goal is to boil the selection process down to something that could be
handled in a half hour or less per company. Now for sure, it doesn’t always
work out this way, and one wouldn’t commit $10 million in capital to a com-
pany based on this analysis, but it provides grounds for making small invest-
ments or pursuing further research. At the end of the drill, you should, as
Peter Lynch suggests, be able to tell the story of a stock to family, friends,
and favorite pets. And most of all, to be able to understand, yourself, why you
like or don’t like a business as an investment.
Real-life appraisals 
The major steps are
 Selection: Using the screening tools, mutual fund holding lists, or your
own selections based on what you see in the marketplace, work the
5000-stock universe down to 10, 20, maybe 50 to look at more closely.
Pick a few and dig deeper.
 Understanding the industry: This step is optional if you’re already
familiar, but understand industry dynamics, trends, industry players,
and how your selected company fits in its industry.
 Appraisal: Figure out what’s right and what’s wrong about a company.
One approach that works is to identify the three greatest strengths and
weaknesses, a mini-version of the “SWOT” analysis shown in Chapter 14.
It’s helpful to do a simplified one-page checklist covering financials, intan-
gibles, and valuation in one page to clarify and summarize the story.
322
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

After you make the decision to invest, you’re not done — downstream steps
include tracking the story and deciding if and when to sell. As you may have
picked up, these two elements can be drawn out over a very long time.
Step 1: Selection
The first step is selection. Screening tools exist in many places to enter singu-
lar or multiple criteria to narrow the search. You can use predefined value
stock screens, or customize your own in Yahoo! Finance or on a broker plat-
form, emphasizing financial and valuation ratios. You can use Value Line
selections highly rated for “Timeliness” or “Safety.” You can watch the activi-
ties of favorite fund managers. Or you can use your own experiences and
market intuition. 
With experience you’ll develop a screening path that best meets your invest-
ing tastes and objectives. If you can narrow your choices down to 5, 10, or 20
companies in which to dig deeper, your selection process is working. And so
long as the appraisal step is performed, it really doesn’t matter how it gets
into the top of the funnel.
The old computer axiom “garbage in, garbage out” applies to stock screeners.
Extraordinary events in the numbers can cause a company to have a distorted
growth rate, ROE, P/E ratio, and so forth. In part, that’s why the screen, by
itself, doesn’t work.
Step 2: “Be” the industry
This step is optional: If you are already familiar with the industry, its players,
and recent news and trends, it probably isn’t necessary. But if you enter this
process through a stock screen, chances are you’ll come up with some com-
pany you’ve never heard of and will have to find out what industry it is in and
learn a bit about it.
Financial portals, like Yahoo! Finance, are probably the best place to start the
investigation of a screened candidate. The quote page provides, of course,
the stock quote, and if you want, charts to observe past stock price perfor-
mance. Don’t spend too long here, because value investing isn’t about price
trends. But you can get an idea of what’s happening with the company in
comparison to the overall market, and you can see whether there is a possi-
ble fire sale situation. More importantly, there is a list of recent newswire
items; from these news stories a picture of the company and the industry can
be started.
The profile page then gives a synopsis of the company’s business and finan-
cials, its sector and industry (under “Competitors”). The more detailed “Key
Statistics” page further develops the financial picture.
323
Chapter 18: Shopping for Value: A Practical Approach

As discussed in Chapter 14, there are many resources for intangibles, some
straightforward; some harder to find. A cruise through The Wall Street
Journal, Business Week, or any related trade magazine can build industry
knowledge. Search capability makes Internet-based media outlets, like
BusinessWeek Online, very helpful, and most information is free. And don’t
forget search engines — a few searches on the company and industry are
likely to return good material. 
Look for . . .
 What industry the company is in (and if it doesn’t fit one neatly, as in
“Starbucks” and “restaurants,” make a note of that).
 General industry trends (buggy whips, most telecom, homebuilding and
more recently, lenders are bad, energy, companies that export technol-
ogy or food or other products may be good).
 The role of your company in the industry (dominant player, number two
and trying harder, vanquished and retrenching, and so forth). Look at
market share and changes in market share. 
 Industry characteristics that may affect financial appraisal. This one’s
harder; it’s hard to know from publicly available material that, for
instance, booksellers can return most all inventory for 100 percent cash,
reducing inventory risk and making otherwise large inventory balances
not look so bad. Or that the ethanol industry is highly dependent on the
price of corn and Federal and state legislation on ethanol blending. If
you have the time (and it probably takes more than ten minutes), it’s
worth talking to someone in the business.
This book takes a cautionary approach to professional investment analysts
and their work. But most of the industry reports they put together — based
on professionally available information, industry contacts, and years of track-
ing the industry — are good and well written. These industry reports are
worth looking at to understand an industry and its players. There are a lot of
ways to get at these reports — some for free and some for a signup or a fee. If
you have a broker (online or full service), that’s a good place to start. 
Step 3: “Be” the business
You’ll develop your own style for doing Steps 1 and 2, and Step 3 is no differ-
ent. Step 3 is where the “do I want to buy the business?” decision is made. 
The tools and techniques have been covered throughout most of this book; it
isn’t necessary to repeat them here. The important point is each investor 
will develop her own approach to doing the appraisal, and over time, these
appraisals will become brief and to the point, especially at first. 
324
Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

The 80–20 rule comes into play here: Twenty percent of the analysis likely
yields 80 percent of the answer. Value investors understand where to look to
assess whether a decision can be made or further investigation makes sense
to do — a bit like poking a toothpick into a baking cake to test whether it’s
ready or needs more time.
To help get started, you may want to develop a checklist. An example
appears in Figure 18-1. Over time, this checklist will evolve — it may start out
longer and get shorter as you understand better what to look for. Seasoned
investors may be able to do away with it altogether, using a “mental” check-
list instead as a seasoned manager working in the business may. 
Making the grade
Each appraisal “category” has a “grade” box next to it, and the sample form
also allows for entry of a “trend” symbol. You can grade these categories as
you wish, however. As these category grades are a composite of many differ-
ent factors, the schoolhouse standard A/B/C/D/F seems to work. Some may
use a “0–4” scoring scheme to make it easier to add the numbers, but adding
numbers to get a composite score is entirely up to you. 
It’s helpful to capture as many comments or observations as possible about
each checklist element. First, it forces you to think about each element.
Second, it’s interesting to return to the analysis later to see whether your
judgments made sense at the time. It makes each appraisal more of a learning
experience, and that’s a good thing. 
What’s your scenario?
Uncertainty is a constant “given” in any business. The economy can and does
change. Industries change, and the role and success of individual businesses
within an industry can change, sometimes very quickly. As pointed out many
times, the data and tools used to construct appraisals don’t yield absolute
answers. So a good appraisal strategy includes at least some attention to
best-, worst-, and average-case scenarios. You may wish to “run the numbers”
assuming the best and worst of sales, margins, expenses, intangibles, and so
forth. If you don’t want to do the numbers, it’s at least a good idea to think
through best and worst cases. At minimum, ask yourself what if things don’t
quite turn out right, what’s the downside? 
If it looks good, there may be something better
Chess players are taught early on to keep looking for moves, even after they
spot a good one, because a better one may be out there.
From this point on, the decision is yours. If a stock comes through the initial
appraisal looking good, it’s worth “running” a few more from your search. In
our experience, it’s also a good idea to run a competitor or two, just to con-
firm your selection is best.

Part IV: Becoming a Value Investor 

It Ain’t Over ’til It’s Over
One wonders what baseball sage Yogi Berra would say about value investing.
Really, it’s common sense and so practical that his philosophy would likely fit
right in.
And one of his gems, “It ain’t over ‘til it’s over,” really fits. Supposedly, a value
stock was to be acquired and kept for a long time, even a lifetime. True, but
especially in today’s world of change, business fortunes can turn on a dime,
either as a result of macroeconomic and industry factors, or micro problems
that escaped your initial read and surfaced during ownership. According to 
a recent study, the average stock fund holds a stock for 1.2 years, down from
3 years in 1976. Sure, some funds “trade” actively, but most don’t — they
simply react to change in business and business conditions. 
Another way to put it: The speed of business is higher, and the speed of busi-
ness change has increased. To hold a stock with a long-term goal of forever is
a great idea, but things change so fast it just may not be possible. 
Keeping track
The point is that you have to keep up with your investments, even after pur-
chase. If you were fortunate enough to do a good job up front, nighttime
sleep should come easy. Stability and consistency are good things to have.
But no longer is it possible to buy a company and stuff the stock certificate
into your mattress. Even Buffett sells shares, and sells them every year.
The best way to keep track is to use many of the same tools used to make the
investment decision in the first place. Watch the financials and intangibles
through Yahoo! Finance, quarterly Value Line updates, and of course, the
newspaper. Repeating the “short-form” appraisal every now and then doesn’t
hurt either. 
A few words about selling. And now, the hardest part. You thought “marrying”
the stock was difficult, full of unknowns and subjective assessments? Try the
divorce! In investing, selling can be one of the hardest things to do. Investors
get emotionally vested in their decisions, and hanging on becomes more a
matter of hope — and desire to be right “after all” — than a rational, conscious
decision based on a company’s merit. 
True value investors don’t think this way. Value investors watch their busi-
nesses perform just as a good manager would, and when they stop perform-
ing, they get out. It’s really one of the great attributes of stock investing:
Investors don’t get the headaches that managers and small business owners
327
Chapter 18: Shopping for Value: A Practical Approach

get. When things turn, or when a better opportunity arises, they can just sell
and move on. The upshot: Keep track the company’s story, and be ready to
reappraise and move on if the new appraisal comes up short. 
Making the “sell decision” 
Most experienced investors know that selling takes more discipline and can
be more difficult than buying — so a condensed thought process and frame-
work may help. 
Indeed, for value investors, the main rule about selling is this: The thought
process is similar to the buying decision. A business must be a good business
to consider owning it, and the price must reflect, or be lower than, the value
of the business. Likewise, if the price exceeds the value of the business, it’s
time to sell. 
Additionally, value investors should consider selling when
 The business changes: Any change in fundamentals or the intangibles
that drive them signal at least a re-evaluation, and perhaps a sale, of the
business. So a changing marketplace, supply chain, interest rates, cost
structure, management team — you name it — can trigger a reassess-
ment and sale.
 There’s something else better to buy: Your company may be good, but
perhaps there’s a better one out there. Selling should only be done when
there’s something else better to buy, even if that “something else” is a
fixed income cash deposit or a rental property or even a vacation home.
If 5 percent risk-free is better than your investment right now, then that’s
the “better thing to buy.” If there isn’t something better to buy, then your
investment is probably okay.
 When you need the money: No additional explanation necessary.

Ten Signs of Value
In This Chapter
 Looking at five tangible signs of value 
 Understanding five intangible signs of value
F
inding value in a business is both art and science. Every investor com-
bines art and science in his or her own way to develop his or her own set
of value tenets to guide the investing process. With that in mind, the follow-
ing ten “core” signs of value are drawn from material presented earlier in the
book. Tangible signs are financial fundamentals reflecting or leading directly
to earnings and business growth, while intangible signs tend to be leading
indicators of good financial fundamentals. 
When all or most signs are present, the business is on the right track.
Tangible: Steady or Increasing 
Return on Equity (ROE)
ROE is the bottom-line return on equity capital invested. ROE is a composite
measure, combining internal measures of profitability, productivity, and capi-
tal structure. For ROE to increase, obviously at least one of these internal
measures must be on the rise, and all three must be effectively managed to
preserve the gain. As mentioned in Chapter 13, when companies such as IBM
improve all three component measures simultaneously, ROE growth can be
dramatic.
As companies earn money, that money goes into retained earnings or is paid
out to shareholders. Steady or increasing ROE is a sign of health, particularly
for companies with a strategy to retain earnings. For those companies, increas-
ing ROE is an especially challenging and worthy goal because the equity base,
or denominator, consistently grows. A company steadily growing ROE is usu-
ally firing on all cylinders.

ROE greater than 15 percent and steady, or better yet, growing, is best. So is a
balanced approach, where profitability, productivity, and capital structure
are all improving. And share repurchases made to reduce the equity denomi-
nator, particularly when funded by excess cash generated by the business
rather than external borrowing, are a good sign. Good ROE performance tells
us that a lot of other things are going right, and is prima facie evidence of
good management focused on the right things.
Tangible: Strong and 
Growing Profitability
Nothing grows a stock price like earnings. Earnings growth will do it every
time, yet for some reason, some investors invest without looking at a most
important driver: profitability. Sales growth too can drive earnings growth,
but sales growth sooner or later hits a wall. Investors forget that improving
profitability is another path, besides sales growth, to achieve earnings
growth. They also forget that declining profitability causes greater reliance 
on sales growth — a risky proposition.
Investors should look at total profitability and profitability trends. Like many
other business fundamentals, profitability can be deconstructed into compo-
nents: gross margin, operating expenses (particularly SG&A), operating
margin, and net profit margin. 
High gross margin is a sign of market power, and market power is a leading
indicator of improving gross margins. Expense growth rates should run lower
than sales growth rates. Otherwise, economies of scale are compromised.
Look at profitability trends and comparisons to like industry players. Effective
management and solid market positions lead to improved profitability, and
improved profitability leads to improved earnings performance and stock
price performance.
Tangible: Improving Productivity
Improving productivity is straightforward but often overlooked by casual
investment approaches. Assets are resources employed by the company and
contributed by shareholders to produce income. Is the company making
good use of its assets? Is the company generating more sales and profits per
unit or dollar of assets employed? 
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Look at both dollar and unit asset productivity. Find out the same store sales,
sales per square foot, revenue per seat mile, revenue per employee, or sales
per fixed asset or current asset dollar. Solid unit productivity numbers show
strong markets and good management, while chronic declines and poor
industry comparisons reflect the opposite, foretelling asset write-offs,
increased capital requirements, and death by a thousand other cuts.
Tangible: Producer, Not 
Consumer, of Capital
If a company generates enough cash from its operations to pay down debt
and buy back shares, that’s a good thing. If the company generates insuffi-
cient cash to grow or even maintain the business, that’s a bad thing. Look
closely at the statement of cash flows (particularly over time) to find out
whether the company produces excess cash and capital that can be
employed elsewhere to grow company value or that can be returned to you
as dividends or, even better, share buybacks. Focus on cash sourced from
operations, cash used for business investments, and cash obtained from or
returned to capital markets as financing.
Tangible: The Right Valuation Ratios
The market decouples price from the value of the business. As Warren Buffett
says, price is what you pay, and value is what you get. If the markets were
perfect, price and value would go hand in hand, but as we all know, markets
aren’t perfect. 
Once you appraise the business value, look at price and use valuation ratios
to connect the price to the business. The venerable P/E ratio is where most
investors start, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Value investors look at pre-
sent and future earnings yield (1 ÷ P/E). PEG —price earnings to growth —
relates P/E to growth rates and tells you something about that earnings yield
future. The relationships between price to sales (P/S), profit margins, price to
book (P/B), and ROE are also important. 
So a P/E of 25 or less is good given today’s alternative earnings yields, but it
doesn’t mean that much without looking at the other numbers. A PEG of 2 or
less, a P/S of 3 or less, and a P/B of 5 or less are good signs for growing com-
panies, with lower figures expected for steady or transitioning companies. 
333
Chapter 19: Ten Signs of Value

Intangible: A Franchise
Market power is tantamount to lasting earnings power, and a franchise (a
market position that’s difficult or impossible to duplicate) is the cornerstone
of market power. An obvious, defensible franchise puts a company in a much
better position to preserve and grow value. Strong franchises create a “moat”
around the business. Companies that don’t have a franchise are continuously
vulnerable to competitive threats and must spend millions just to preserve
the position they have. 
Franchise drives improved current and future business results. Look for
brand strength, product differentiation, intellectual property, international
recognition, and channel position. If a company has something that another
company can’t reproduce regardless of resources, there is franchise value.
Intangible: Price Control
A company in control of its product prices probably possesses franchise
power and is using it effectively. A company that markets its products and
competes on virtues other than price has good market position. That com-
pany is more likely to preserve and grow future profit margins. If price is the
central issue in every buyer’s purchase decision, that’s a problem. If a com-
pany must continually compete on price or mark down its merchandise or
services to sell them, look for future trouble.
Watch a company in the marketplace, including its advertisements and over-
all approach to marketing. Ever see a Ford or Chrysler commercial that didn’t
have something about price (or financing rates)? Ever see an ad from BMW or
Mercedes that did? Well, never say never, but the German carmakers are com-
peting on product and franchise, while their American cousins must depend
on price. Companies in control of their pricing are typically in better position
to deliver solid business results than companies that aren’t.
Intangible: Market Leadership
Market share is important in achieving price control and economies of scale
in producing, marketing, and delivering products. A company with a large
market share has an advantage, while those with small or declining market
share must pay up just to catch up. 
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Look at the market position and share of a business and see whether it’s a
leader in its — or most of its — markets. Read industry reports from the
trade press, financial press, and analysts. Then decide whether the company
is there just because it got there first or whether it really has the products
and franchise to stay there for the long term. If you decide that it’s the latter,
you’re probably looking at strong business value, but watch yourself 
when you go to market. You may be required to “pay up” for that value.
Intangible: Candid Management
Strong management and good leadership are often obvious just from a com-
pany’s behavior. A company should achieve celebrity status in its industry
and may even go beyond, such as GE did under CEO Jack Welch, or as HP
later regained under Mark Hurd after years of questionable management
“value” under Carly Fiorina. 
The theory is that management that communicates with the press, with
shareholders, and with its customers is probably doing a good job and has
nothing to hide. The theory goes further to applaud management teams who
do make mistakes and are able to admit them and correct them publicly.
These management teams know what’s going on and aren’t afraid to deal 
with it, and they probably have the skills to do so.
And of course, outgoing behavior can be taken too far. Investors must be on
guard for unrealistic promises or undue arrogance, especially during bad
times, as we may be seeing at press time with Countrywide Financial CEO
Angelo Mozilo. Make sure what business leaders are saying makes sense —
would you be saying and doing the same thing under the circumstances? 
Intangible: Customer Care
A company that appreciates the value of its customer base and capitalizes on
that value is better positioned for long-term success. That company spends
less to acquire new customers and has another “moat” to protect it from
competition. Look for companies that know their customers and treat them
as something more important than advertising targets. Look for situations 
of strong and unusual brand loyalty. Look for companies that manage cus-
tomers as an asset to be valued, listened to, cared for, and retained —not a
liability, where interactions and the costs of those interactions are the main
focus. If a company is a faceless bureaucracy producing stupid products that
customers don’t want and if it has a reputation for poor service and response
to customer issues, look out below.

Chapter 20
Ten Signs of Unvalue
In This Chapter
 Looking at five tangible signs of unvalue 
 Considering five intangible signs of unvalue 
S
ometimes the best way to learn what something is is to observe what 
it is not. This chapter gives a few ideas of what to avoid in your quest 
for value.
Tangible: Deteriorating Margins
Declining profit margins are usually a sign of trouble. Total earnings or earnings-
per-share declines can happen in economic downturns when sales fall, but
profit margins should remain relatively intact. Declining gross margins suggest
declining market power, increased competition, product commoditization,
deteriorating product mix, increased production cost structures, and a long
list of other business evils. Declining net margins imply asset quality and effi-
ciency problems and poor expense control.
Expenses, especially selling, general, and administrative (SG&A), should grow
at less than the sales growth rate. When expense growth matches or worse,
exceeds sales growth, internal expense controls aren’t working, and economies
of scale are lost. Companies in start-up mode and larger companies with far-
flung worldwide operations have particular difficulty here. If expenses grow
because of a well-documented and communicated strategic initiative, such as a
customer acquisition or retention campaign, that may be okay. But nameless,
faceless, and growing expenses lead to trouble.
And if the company is losing money rather than reporting profits, there had
better be a real good reason and clearly articulated evidence of a turnaround.
Unless it’s a minor and explainable blip on an otherwise good long-term track
record, there is no place in a value portfolio for a money-losing business. 

Tangible: Receivables or Inventory
Growth Outpacing Sales 
If accounts or notes receivable on the balance sheet grow faster than sales, a
company is effectively lending money to its customers to buy its products.
This is a very dangerous situation. 
Excessive growth in either receivables or inventory as a percent of sales,
especially if persistent, indicates loss of market and channel power.
Company-made products aren’t being bought on their merits but rather
because of the terms (receivables) or availability (inventory). If inventory
increases are caused by poor management and control, there is exposure to
missed deliveries as the company tightens the inventory belt, resulting in too
little of the right inventory. These indicators signify more trouble inside the
company and in the marketplace, and they consistently lead to write-offs and
loss of business when they become no longer sustainable. 
Tangible: Poor Earnings Quality
If earnings appear to grow but you don’t see matching growth in cash flows
or book value, that’s a sign that earnings are being generated on the back of
accounting gimmicks. (Dividend payouts can also reduce cash flow and book
value growth, so be sure to account for a high dividend payout.) With conser-
vative accounting, cash flow should run consistently ahead of earnings with
normal depreciation and amortization expenses.
Tangible: Inconsistent Results
Value investors like consistency and avoid surprises in top-line and bottom-
line figures and everything in between. Companies prone to large write-offs
raise questions about asset value and business decisions made over time.
Good management teams react well to changes in market conditions and
manage their businesses accordingly, while inattentive management teams let
market conditions dictate their results — or worse. Look for steady margins,
return on equity (ROE), asset productivity and valuations, expenses, and
cash flows.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Tangible: Good Business, but 
Stock Is Too Expensive 
Generalizing about these topics is hard, but price to earnings (P/E) ratio,
price/earnings to growth (PEG), price to sales (P/S), and price to book (P/B)
well in excess of market and industry averages spell trouble in making the
numbers, as does overdependence on abnormal margins.
Look at P/E compared to the market and the industry. Or, think of it in terms
of earnings yield. A P/E over 40, or an earnings yield below 2.5 percent, is
hard to justify in any case, and over 25 is hard to justify unless the growth
story is there and intact. PEG greater than 3, P/S greater than 3, and P/B
greater that 10 are signs of overcooked prices and raise questions of vulnera-
bility and value. 
Intangible: Acquisition Addiction
Acquisitions can be made for a variety of reasons, and many of them are valid.
Plugging a product line gap or removing a key competitor from the market-
place can justify an acquisition. But when a company makes acquisition after
acquisition, seemingly just to grow the business (that is, keep the top line
moving), beware.
Acquisitions are almost always difficult, consuming company focus and
resources and causing at least some customer confusion. These short-term
ramifications can usually be dealt with, but occasionally the resulting struc-
ture and culture clash can bring down otherwise viable businesses. When
management is focused on making and digesting acquisitions, it’s not focused
on the core business, which can drift quickly out of control. And every acqui-
sition adds a little more air to the goodwill balloon on the balance sheet, per-
haps causing it eventually to pop. 
Look at a company’s acquisition history and see whether the company makes
good acquisitions. Look at the resulting product line, market acceptance, and
corporate culture. Also look at the history and growth of goodwill. If this
makes you nervous, stay away.
339
Chapter 20: Ten Signs of Unvalue

Intangible: On the Discount Rack
A company continually discounting or incentivizing its products is clearly
having trouble in the marketplace. Airfare wars, computer price wars, car
wars, and the like are a bad sign. And although many of the companies
involved hang the limited-time-only justification on such activities, they tend
to be chronic. If a company appears to always depend on price gimmicks to
grow — or worse, maintain — sales, look out. Has anyone paid full price for 
a 12-pack of Coke lately?
Intangible: Losing Market Share
Some companies seem to continually beat their heads against the wall just to
preserve market share, and sometimes, a very small market share to start
with. Chronic market share erosion is disastrous. Companies lose economies
of scale and pricing power and may have to resort to expensive campaigns
just to stem the tide. And it doesn’t do much for internal morale, let alone
shareholder morale. Signs are everywhere: from what you see on the shelves
to what you read in the press to what the companies (sometimes) tell you
themselves.
As a general rule, avoid companies under siege in the marketplace.
Intangible: Can’t Control Cost Structure
The inability to control the cost structure may sound the same as the deterio-
rating margins discussed earlier in this chapter, with emphasis on control
and management of costs and expenses. But this one goes deeper — into the
very cost structure of the business itself and the resources used to produce
its products. Companies requiring tight resources over which they have little
to no control are in a vulnerable position with little chance for above-average
performance. Companies with expensive, frequently replaced, capital-intensive
cost structures requiring continuous capital infusion also have bad field posi-
tion with respect to value.
The airline industry is the classic example. Fuel, labor, airplanes, and airport
slots make an airline work and together comprise perhaps 80 to 90 percent of
an airline’s cost structure. Yet, airlines have zero control over the price of any
of these inputs. You know the oil story. Airlines are labor intensive and union-
ized, and their relationships with the unions have hardly been a strength.
Airplanes are made by two companies and have long lead times with compe-
tition for the best models. And airport slots and air routes are controlled by
governments. Need we say more?
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Airlines thus have almost no influence or control over the inputs vital to their
business, and they’re subject to dips and wide swings in profitability when
one or more factors go out of control. They can’t easily adjust or control their
business. And if they do find a way to be successful and achieve higher
returns, one of these constituents will want a piece of the action. Success 
is not impossible (witness Southwest Airlines), but the odds are against it.
Intangible: Management in Hiding
It happens over and over. Management teams, once exuberant in talking up
their successes, simply disappear when things start to go bad. Anyone seen
much of Jeff Bezos or Michael Dell or Jamie Dimon lately? One could launch
the argument that they’re busy and focused on dealing with their business
problems, but at the same time, one wonders. This is the opposite of manage-
ment candor. Instead of publicly identifying and facing problems and articu-
lating clear strategies for a return to success, they simply go into hiding. Now,
you may not expect them to appear on CNBC every day to be considered
candid, and you may not really care for celebrity managers. But if there’s some-
thing important to say about the business, they should be around to say it.
And if they do come forth, it sounds like something you could have said your-
self. “We’ve had a real tough quarter with this downturn blah, blah, blah . . .
an unusually warm weather which cut into retail sales (when has the weather
ever been good for retail?) . . . blah, blah . . . and have limited visibility to the
immediate future . . . blah, blah, blah . . . but we’re expecting things to improve
by the end of Q4.” Managers who admit mistakes, discuss what parts of the
business are hurting, explain the customer context, review specific financials,
and articulate strategies to revitalize demand in certain businesses and exit
others get a higher score with value investors.

Chapter 21
Ten Habits of Highly Successful
Value Investors
In This Chapter
 Doing your homework
 Relying on your own instincts
 Investing for the long term
 Staying informed
W
arren Buffett once said, “All there is to investing is picking good
stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain
good companies.” Keeping this in mind, this chapter presents ten things to
remember as you evolve your value investing style.
Do the Due Diligence
As a value investor you must walk the walk — consistently, continuously, and
with good form and focus. A value investor is rational and doesn’t jump into
an investment without knowing why. In business, you can’t know everything,
but you do need to examine the important stuff. Diligence continues beyond
the purchase, keeping up with industry trends and company performance. 
Think Independently and Trust Yourself
Be your own analyst. Do your own research and figure out what works for you.
Don’t listen to sales pitches, gossip, and hype. Be different and be proud to
be different. The more different you are, the more you’re likely to make in the
market — in the long run. Think and act independently.

You’ve all heard this or that portfolio manager or talk show host espousing
the virtues of his favorite stock. Few give solid fundamental reasons for their
picks, and in many cases, they may actually be pumping positions they’re
already in to make a sale. Remember, portfolio managers, Wall Street firms,
and brokers are in the business to make money. Remember who’s who and
what they’re likely to want.
As a value investor, you should do your own research founded on real num-
bers emerging from the business. Chat rooms, TV, and industry and analyst
forecasts are dangerous replacements for your own thinking.
Ignore the Market
Smart, well-equipped investors continually try to time the market. That
approach been generally proven to be a waste of time. But more than that,
buying a stock because of its price moves — particularly upward — is usually
the worst reason to buy. Focus on the business and fundamentals and look at
the market simply as a place to execute the transaction.
Always Think Long Term
This advice goes along with ignoring the market. A good business is a good
business in the long term. Otherwise it isn’t a good business. And never, ever
forget the value of compounding and how negative performance negates its
effects.
Remember That You’re 
Buying a Business
Approach a stock purchase as though you were buying a company for your-
self, even if you’re buying only a millionth of it. Look at it as a business, not a
stock. Think inside out. Become an expert on the company and the industry —
understand the business. Know how it makes its money. Be able to explain the
business, the industry, and your rationale for buying the stock to a 10-year-old
kid or any other bystander. By doing that, you’ll get better at explaining it to
yourself.
And don’t forget that it’s your own money. This applies to all investing, not
just value investing. It’s amazing how people throw good, hard-earned money
at almost anything, spending as little as a couple of minutes to analyze and
execute an investment. 
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Always Buy “On Sale”
As a value investor, you want to own a good business, but value investing
goes further than that. You want to own a good business at an attractive price.
Sticking to this rule expands the potential return and creates the margin of
safety, sort of a “moat” around your investment. When you buy at a favorable
price, you create room for error and greater room for growth and tie up less
capital. The excitement and satisfaction that you feel when getting a bargain
in real life also applies to investing — with much greater long-term benefits.
Keep Emotion Out of It
A Southwest Airlines flight attendant once admonished passengers who were
apparently taking too long to select a seat, “You aren’t buying furniture, folks,
just picking a place to park it for the next 50 minutes.”
The wisdom shared is about avoiding emotional attachments to stocks and
the businesses they represent. If you “LUV” Southwest Airlines, don’t invest
in it until you like the numbers. And if the numbers look good and you invest,
but they start to look bad later, be able to recognize that. Value investors con-
tinuously look for the good and the bad and keep their rational wits about
them as they decide to buy and keep their investments. The purpose of an
investment is to achieve a greater financial goal and not to become a member
of the family.
Don’t hesitate to admit your mistakes. As we want our management teams to
do, so must we do for ourselves. Value investors admit their mistakes and
learn from them. They take the time to understand what changed (or was
overlooked in the first place), and they move on. They have a rational “sell”
model and aren’t afraid to sell a business when underlying reasons to own it
have changed or if the price is way out of line with value. 
Invest to Meet Goals, Not 
to Earn Bragging Rights
Your investing should be aimed at one purpose: to earn money and build a
secure long-term financial future. Other goals and objectives bring danger.
Don’t try to be better than everyone else, and bragging about your two-baggers
at the water cooler is bad form and bad practice. Sound, consistent objectives,
with a sustained, consistent approach for meeting them, work best. Be the
tortoise, not the hare.

Chapter 21: Ten Habits of Highly Successful Value Investors

Swing Only at Good Pitches
If something looks good, wait. There may be something better. This is one of
the harder pieces of advice to follow. You see a company you like, and it’s
selling at 75 percent of intrinsic value. Fundamentals look good, but there
may be a question about intangibles. Should you buy? It depends. If you
pulled a screen of 20 companies, look at them all. Try a different screen. And
if the ones you find are a good value today, chances are, if you’re really play-
ing for the longer term, they’ll be a good value tomorrow and even a few days
from now. Patience is a core virtue of the value investor.
Keep Your Antennae Up
Stop, look, and listen. Always be on the lookout for signs, large and small, of
opportunity. Be equally aware of what’s going on with companies you already
own. Own Starbucks? Visit the place and have a latte once in a while. Own
Ford? Rent one the next time you rent a car. Hilton Hotels? United Airlines?
You get the picture. If you own a business that makes air compressors and
tools but have no need for these tools yourself, ask someone who does, such
as your next-door neighbor/contractor. And if you wish to hang out in the rail
yard counting tank cars as Mr. Buffett once did, remember to stop, look, and
listen there, too.
