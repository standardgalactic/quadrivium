EDITOR’S NOTE
2018: AN 
AWESOME 
YEAR FOR 
VIDEOGAMES
Editor’s Review pg.60
I
t’s already February and the title is written like that?! Indeed! 
The world is going into 2018 but there is so much to talk about in 
terms of trends. Let’s focus on the digital games space this round. 
How did 2018 turn-out to be an awesome for games? Well, 
it’s going to be outstanding because of all the major games that are 
set to launch throughout the coming months of 2018. Curious? Then 
checkout the GameTime Special Feature (Pg 104) to find out what is 
locked in for the coming weeks and months of 2018.
CES 2018 is also big on games as various vendors put out their 
latest and greatest in terms of hardware and finished goods. Highlights 
include the new MSI Optix Curved Panels (Pg 116), NVIDIA Big Format 
Gaming Displays (Pg 119) and a plethora of gaming laptops. All the 
details can be found in the Wire and GameTime News pages.
Special mention must go to Razer, who had its fair share of 
reveals at CES 2018 and then some. This includes Project Linda (Pg 
114), a notebook that is fully powered via the Razer Phone. It uses a 
unique docking system that has the smartphone jack in and operate 
as the touchscreen and secondary display. Other Razer products that 
showed up include the Razer Nommo Speakers (more on liveatpc.
com) and the Razer Hyperflux Mamba and Firefly (Pg 115). Each, of 
course, amp up the user experience with its advanced offerings.
On the games developer front, it is equally as exciting as 
Malaysia’s first-ever games developers incubator – LEVEL UP Inc – has 
received further recognition when the Minister of Communications 
and Multimedia dropped in for a tour (Pg 42). Not only did he leave 
very impressed, he is very heartened by what he saw too. 
There is certainly loads and loads more to share about – check 
out the Valentine Gift Guide 2016 that makes a return to the pages 
of PC.com. There are a couple of big reviews as well like the Huawei 
Mate 10 Pro (Pg 60), ASUS ROG Strive GL503VS (Pg 82), OnePlus 5T 
(Pg 68) and Sony WH-1000X Wireless In-Ears (Pg 78).
Indeed, there’s plenty to look forward to in this month’s PC.com. 
So – happy reading one and all!
Cheers

LETTER 
OF THE 
MONTH
Now that’s a question many have been writing in frequently. Like yours, many are worried their browsers are 
acting as gateways to their PCs and smart devices that threat actors prey upon and use as indirect crypto-miners.
Well, SophosLabs put together some useful tips on what how to look out for signs of a device hijack taking place. 
Just flip over to Pg. 100 and you’re set!
Now that’s a good question. First, it all depends on how you want to enjoy the audio from movies and music, or 
even games, in your home. If a 2.1 or 3.1 set up works, then a decent soundbar will do. A 5.1 can be on the cards 
too but those are pricey depending on the brand and type of equipment used. Even better, go with a soundbar 
that offers Dolby Atmos!
Second, how big is the home theatre space? If it is a tiny condo unit or studio apartment, then the soundbar works 
best since it’s small enough to fit and still deliver punchy audio. This is also applicable to a dedicated space in a 
two-storey house. Any bigger, and if you have cash to spare, then go all out with a proper 5.1 or 7.1 arrangement.
It really depends on how you want your photo-taking experience to be like. With a smartphone, it’s fast and simple 
to snap and share whatever you took on social media. If it’s a camera, then you’ll get better control over balance 
adjustments and be able to print in whatever size you want.
This is a debate that is still being worked out between many folks, sometimes peacefully and heated at other 
times. Best you try both to see what works for you.

Samsung’s Gone 
Over the Top
The Korean electronics giant covers all 
the bases it can manage at CES 2018
hen it comes to CES, 
Samsung is not one to pass 
on the opportunity to show 
off what its plans are. It’s at Las Vegas, 
this year, that the Korean tech powerhouse 
truly steps up as it shares how it wants to 
create a connected world.
Curvy Panel
Let’s start with a more stylised, 
yet traditional, entry. At CES 2018, 
Samsung confirms of its plans to expand 
the 
connectivity 
and 
performance 
capabilities of its signature curved 
display line-up. It hopes to do so with 
the new Samsung 34-inch CJ791 21:9 
Ultra-Wide QHD OLED curved monitor. It’ll 
be the first to feature Intel Thunderbolt 3 
connectivity and is specially designed for 
entertainment and business audiences. 
With Intel Thunderbolt 3, users will 
be able to link and dock their monitor and 
laptop without the usual extensive wiring.
Being Internet of Things Ready
Next, Samsung shares of its plans to make 
all its products ‘Internet of Things (IoT)’ 
ready by 2020. It will achieve this plan 
through its on-going work on the open, 
consistent and intelligent platform and 
its relationships with deepening industry 
partners like Open Connectivity Foundation 
(OCF) to set common industry standards. 
OCF is the largest IoT standardisation 
body in the world and Samsung’s ARTIK 
chip, air conditioner and Family Hub 
refrigerator 
have 
already 
received 
certification from this association.
Part of the roll-out will include 
uniting IoT apps into its Samsung 
SmartThings platform. This includes 
linking up Samsung Connect, Smart Home, 
Smart View and SmartThings Cloud.

AMD Family Ties
Besides the brand-new AMD Ryzen 3 series, 
the current entries also get major updates. 
It’s clear as day that AMD will not be resting 
on its laurels since it is looking to really step 
up its game in the processor space. 
The other next-gen processors that 
will show up this year include the following:
• February 2018: AMD Ryzen Desktop 
2018 APUs
• April 2018: 2nd Generation AMD CPU 
and Ryzen PRO Mobile APU
• 2h 2018: 2nd Generation AMD Ryzen 
PRO and Ryzen Threadripper
Those keen on getting AMD Ryzen 
desktop APUs that now come with 
Integrated AMD Radeon Vega, they 
needn’t wait too long since it’s set to 
launch on February 12 2018.
For folks who are unfamiliar with this latest addition to AMD, it basically 
takes the AMD Ryzen Desktop APU platform and augments it to something even 
better. Mostly, it will see the latest AMD Zen core architecture being integrated 
with the AMD Radeon Vega graphics engine. 
In doing so, it would result in the creation of a high-performance graphics engine 
that operates in close-tandem with a desktop processor. This allows for 1080p HD+ 
gaming performance to be achieved without needing a discrete graphics card. It can 
even natively support AMD Radeon FreeSync. 
These new AMD Ryzen Desktop APUs will also benefit from AMD Radeon software 
driver features, including AMD Radeon Chill, Enhanced Sync, and Radeon ReLive.
Specific breakdown of the next-gen AMD Ryzen Desktop APUs, which also come 
in two variants, are as per below:

Mobility Importance for Next-Gen 
AMD Ryzen PRO Mobile
As for the professional performance type 
offerings, the next-gen update for the 
AMD Ryzen PRO Mobile processors take 
it a few notches higher. Besides being 
loaded with the AMD Radeon Vega GPU 
architecture, it is fully optimised to tackle 
its direct rival – the Intel 8th Generation 
Core i7-8550U. In fact, AMD further 
claims its next-gen entry offers 150% 
more competitive graphics performance 
than the Intel 7th Generation i7-7500U. 
With the AMD Ryzen Pro Mobile, 
AMD is targetting up to 13.5 hours of 
battery life. This will be further improved 
with AMD SenseMI features. This offering 
includes Precision Boost 2 technology and 
Mobile Extended Frequency Range (mXFR).
AMD will also be playing big 
on the desktop front as it rolls-out its 
2nd Generation AMD Ryzen Desktop 
CPU line. This will feature AMD’s 
first 12nm FinFET processor using 
the Zen+ architecture. AMD confirms 
that the 2nd Generation entries will 
come with a higher clockspeed and 
feature Precision Boost 2 Technology. 
Su: AMD is now working on 7nm architecture, codenamed as AMD Zen 2 and a 7nm+ architecture known as AMD Zen 3.
Along 
with 
the 
processor, 
AMD will also be releasing a 2nd 
Generation chipset, the AMD X470. 
Optimised for lower power outputs, 
it is set for launch in April 2018 as 
well. The processors will be using 
the same AM4 socket, meaning 
it is compatible with selected 1st 
Generation CPUs and APUs.

come on stage to reveal how AMD is now 
working on 7nm architecture, codenamed 
as AMD Zen 2 and a 7nm+ architecture

Overwhelming with 
Raw Power 
Thinner, smaller, yet still packing with high-spec 
potential – all hail the new AMD Radeon Vega
ltra high-performance delivery 
usually means being overly 
large and unwieldly. With 
AMD, that is no longer the case with 
the newly unveiled AMD 2018 Radeon 
Vega Mobile Discrete GPU. Now smaller 
and thinner, the GPU is truly suitable for 
ultra-thin performance gaming as well 
as equally slim workstations. Even when 
measuring at 1.7mm for its Z height, it still 
packs in loads of new features like HBM2. 
While the tiniest of details are 
out, there are loads of information about 
the graphics processor that have not 
seen the light of day yet. 
Even so, what AMD did reveal at its 
GPU extravagant in CES 2018 is equally 
as attention grabbing!
First, the AMD Radeon Instinct 
Vega. It will run on 7nm core architecture 
– the very first AMD graphics entry to 
operate with a 7nm-based AMD Radeon 
Vega architecture. Made with Machine 
Learning (ML) in mind, it is ideal for 
production level ML Software Stacks and 
related functional demands.
Next up, the AMD Radeon Software 
for all new GPU platforms from Team Red. 
This update will add in support for HDMI 2.1 
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) Technology, 
ensuring all GPUs, including the upcoming 
AMD Radeon RX, will be better managed. 
The improvements will be available in the 
upcoming driver release. According to 
AMD, these additional support features 
come under the AMD Radeon FreeSync 
technology umbrella and are ready for 
displays with HDMI 2.1 VRR support most 
of which are expected to arrive soon.
In conjunction with the AMD Radeon 
updates, Ubisoft has announced that Far 
Cry 5 will support AMD Radeon RX Vega 
specific features. Among them are Rapid 
Packed Math and AMD Radeon FreeSync 
2 technologies. The game will be available 
from March 27 2018 and will make full use 
of these progressive functions that AMD 
and its partners developed.
AMD also teased the coming of 
Intel 
Semi-Custom 
Chips, 
featuring 
AMD Radeon GPUs. This concept will 
see the complete integration of Intel 
chips with embedded AMD GPUs. While 
unprecedented, the move is something 
a few had foreseen and anticipated 
some years back. 2018 is likely the 
years of GPUs, with AMD Radeen 
clearly taking the lead.

Innovation Load Outs
CES 2018 is packed loads and loads of ideas and innovations 
– here are the must-see products from the floor.
here are plenty of stuff to see 
at the CES 2018 showfloor. So 
much so, it cannot possibly be 
covered from end-to-end. Aside from the 
critical announcements and reveals that 
are made, here are some of the hardware 
that are on display in Las Vegas. These are 
the ones that will have a lasting impact, at 
least a proper marketspace impression, in 
the months to come.
Hewlett Packard
Mention HP and the first thing that comes to 
mind is premium innovation. At CES 2018, 
it is all that and more as a new line of PC 
concepts from HP are shown at its booth.
Among others, there are two new 
laptops and a smart home digital system. 
There is also a new HP Omen entry that 
leverages on the NVIDIA Big Format 
Gaming Display (BFGD) concept.
Of the two laptops that HP 
revealed, the HP Spectre x360 15 2-in-1 
is the more top-line entry. Packed 
within 
its 
ultra-premium 
chassis, 
which is made of high-grade aluminium 
that is CNC machined, is an Intel 8th 
Generation Core i7 8705G processor 
that comes paired with AMD Radeon 
RX VEGA M graphics. There is also 
an NVIDIA GeForce MX 150 variant 
as well. Both fully complements the 
15.6-inch 4K display used.
The other laptop is the HP ENVY x2, 
featuring an Intel 7th Generation Core Y-Series 
processor and WUXGA+ touchscreen. 
As for the smart home concept, it is 
called the HP Pavilion Wave. Powered with 
Amazon Alexa, it is the first for this series 
to have voice command and full control 
over all smart devices in the home. Looks 
like it’ll be getting crowded in the smart 
home space in the coming months of 2018.
Lastly, the HP OMEN oversized 
panel that uses NVIDIA BFGD. Measuring 
at 65-inches, the HP OMEN X 65 will sport 
NVIDIA G-SYNC and 4K UHD capabilities 
to ensure maximum visual delivery for any 
content that it displays. 
All devices, except for the HP 
OMEN X 65, will hit retail in Spring 2018. 
As for the NVIDIA enabled panel, it will 
come out in Q3 2018.
Kingston HyperX
The renowned memory and portable 
storage maker is making in-roads in 
the gaming peripheral space. For CES 
2018, it has released trio of entries: the 
Kingston HyperX Cloud Flight Headset, 
Alloy Elite RGB Mechanical Keyboard and 
Pulsefire Surge RGB Mouse.
All 
three 
sport 
various 
user 
innovations that Kingston is known for, 
such as long battery life performance 
and optimised mechanical switches for 
both mouse and keyboard. All three will 
come with proper RGB lighting modes and 
enhanced software functions.

It uses a one-hand controller system, 
a world’s first. For something meant to be 
so simple, users can perform three axis 
and spin movements by only using the 
thumb and index finger. 
According to TI_E, SHIFT is a new 
drone control system that improves the 
existing two-hand controls. Since the SHIFT 
Family Drone retail price is competitive 
enough and can also be intuitively 
controlled by kids, the SHIFT Family Drone 
will stand as the most affordable and 
proper drone in the market.
Philips Hue
Lighting for homes are always associated 
with brands like Philips, moreso when it 
is associated with smart home systems. 
While Philip Hue has been around for a 
while, it steps up its game with a new 
partnership with Razer.
This partnership will see the 
integration of the Razer Chroma lighting 
ecosystem with Philips Hue Entertainment 
API and tools. That means all 16.8 
million colours of RGB goodness can now 
pulsate and bebop to the user’s liking 
throughout their home.
It is with this partnership that Razer 
Chroma-enabled devices can now sync 
with the Philips Hue smart lighting series 
of lightbulbs and light-strips. It works with 
the Philip Hue lamps too. What makes it 
even better – games like Overwatch and 
Quake Champions are already compatible 
with in-game lighting effects – so the 
smart lighting for the home can now be 
in-sync with game time! 
Western Digital
Portable storage is a big deal at CES 
2018 and major contributor to that is WD 
as it showcases the latest from its 2018 
line-up. Comprising two WD and a pair 
of SanDisk entries, each offer their own 
unique flavour of functions to managing 
and storing data.
First, let’s check out WD. For those 
who want a smart home device with 
massive storage capabilities, there is 
the WD My Cloud Home. Beyond the 
big storage space, from 2TB to 4TB, this 
ultra-slim WD can pair up with Amazon 
Alexa and other smart home devices. It 
even works with Google Chromecast. 
As for pure portability, there is the 
WD My Passport Wireless SSD. Not only

Deeper Immersion
Sony raises user experience bar for all next-gen products
ure immersion is what Sony 
is aiming for at CES 2018. 
From TVs, to projectors as 
well as sound systems – all of them are 
represented at the Las Vegas showcase, 
each playing up their strengths in 
maximising the user experience.
For TVs, there is the next-generation 
Sony 4K HDR range – the Sony X900F 
Series and A8F BRAVIA OLED Series. 
Both are designed to raise the immersion 
through visual delivery. With the Sony 
A8F Series, it builds upon the success of 
the Sony A1E via Sony 4K HDR advanced 
processors – the Sony 4K HDR Processor 
X1 Extreme and Sony TRILUMINOS 
Display. These two are certainly familiar 
to most. Complementing them is the 
Sony Acoustic Surface concept for 
sound. The last one is more unique as 
it uses rear-based actuators to produce 
sound through the display panel. Sony 
assures all that there will be zero

visible vibration. It will come in two size 
variants – 55- and 65-inch.
As for the more premium Sony X900F 
4K HDR TV Series, which uses the same 
Sony X1 Extreme processor, it will come in 
larger and smaller sizes – 85-inch, 75-inch, 
65-inch, 55-inch, and 49-inch Class types.
TVs are just one aspect of Sony’s 
next-generation AV offerings. For its 
home-based 4K projectors, there is the 
Sony 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector 
(LSPX-A1) – a new entry to the Sony 
Life Space UX line-up. 
Beyond being able to produce 
120-inches 4K HDR projection that offers 
stunning visuals, this 2,500 lumens laser 
projector integrates the Sony Glass 
Speaker concept to generate crystal 
clear 360-degrees surround sound. This is 
achieved via the pairing of Sony Advanced 
Vertical Drive Technology with tweeters 
made of glass that are placed in the front 
legs. Further enhancing the audio delivery 
is the bundled 3.1 speaker array that adds 
on their subtle capabilities to create an 
immersive sound field.
More traditional designs aren’t 
ignored too as Sony also introduces 
the Sony 3.1ch HT-Z9F and HT-X9000F 
Soundbars. Feature wise, the former 
is the world’s first 3.1ch Dolby Atmos 
soundbar and the latter, beyond being a 
companion to new oversized TVs, pack 
in enhanced wireless functions and 
design innovations. Both receive tuning 
from Dolby to optimise overall sound 
delivery to ensure next-gen audio/video 
experiences can be properly produced.

More Surfaces
An in-depth look at latest the Microsoft Surface entries
fter all the teasing and 
showcasing at the end of 
last year, Microsoft finally 
put together a proper demo for the entire 
Microsoft Surface family. While there are 
other opportunities to check out Redmond’s 
next-generation innovations, there hadn’t 
been a major exhibition at this scale.
Thus, when the opportunity came to 
check out all the new Microsoft Surface 
entries, it’s a no-brainer that this is a 
must-go-to session. 
The mainstay of the event, of course, 
are the duo variants that Microsoft had 
on hand – the Microsoft Surface Book 
2 13.5-inch and 15-inch entries. Let’s go 
over the basics first: specs. Both models 
come in two Intel 8th Generation Core 
flavours – i5 or i7. Paired to that are 8GB 
or 16GB RAM configurations and up to 
1TB storage capabilities.  
Next, the GPU. Just like the 
processor, Microsoft offers the choice of 
selecting the best GPU option to users 
who chose the larger SKU. They can pick 
between the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 
or GTX 1060 graphics. The smaller entry 
comes with Intel HD Graphics 620. 
In terms of battery performance, both 
will be using improved power management 
features, something that Microsoft worked 
together with Intel and NVIDIA.
The Microsoft Surface Book 2 are 
not the only ones on site for the demo 
sessions. The other members are also 
present, namely Microsoft Surface 
Studio, Surface Laptop as well as the 
up-to-date Surface Pro. Having tried 
them all in the short time Microsoft 
has allotted, there is no doubt these 
innovative products are true leaders in 
their respective classes.
It’s unfortunate that Redmond could 
not reveal if any of these awesome devices 
would make it to Malaysia anytime soon. 
Only the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is 
confirmed to hit shelves for Malaysia 
throughout March and April 2018.

More Focused on 
Mobility 
It’s all about continuing the portable narrative for ASUS
ince ASUS had a couple of big 
reveals at CES 2017, many 
went to its keynote thinking 
there would be some fancy inventions 
appearing. While that didn’t turn out to 
be the case for 2018, ASUS did bring out 
some of its very best mobile systems 
for the year. It’s a message ASUS is 
sharing extensively as it continues its 
big push for brand-new innovations in 
mobility and networking.
This is best exemplified with 
the new laptops it showcased at the 
Las Vegas IT extravagant. 
First, the ASUS NovaGo. With the 
help of Qualcomm, ASUS has developed 
the world’s first Gigabit LTE-capable 
laptop. 
Promising 
an 
always-on, 
always-connected 
experience, 
it 
is 
suitable for users who are looking for 
mobility and easy connectivity.
Ultra-light 
yet 
versatile, 
the 
ASUS NovaGo features a Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC processor 
alongside the Gigabit Snapdragon X16 
LTE modem. There is also a built-in eSIM 
or Nano SIM tray that gives consistent 
connectivity throughout. Software wise, 
there is Microsoft Windows 10 S that 
comes bundled with Microsoft Windows 
Ink, Windows Hello and Cortana.
Next are the ASUS ZenBook 13 
and X507UA laptops that are shown 
side-by-side with the new ASUS Vivo 
All-in-One (AiO) PCs – ASUS Vivo AiO 
V272 and V222. Of the four, only the ASUS 
X507UA rocks an Intel 7th Generation 
Core. The rest pack in an Intel 8th 
Generation Core CPU. Both laptops sport 
a discrete NVIDIA GPU to power their 
respective 13.3in Full HD (or 4K UHD) and 
15.6in NanoEdge Full HD displays along 
with an extensive array of I/O ports. 
The AiOs, both of which use similar 
specs, target those who don’t have 
much desk available. Users who want 
that over-sized screen look can consider 
the ASUS Vivo AiO V272 as it uses a 
27-inch IPS touchscreen.
ASUS hasn’t released any pricing or 
availability details yet.

Exploring Boundary 
Limits
Dell continues to push itself to see how far innovation can really 
go, especially with its newest devices and services
t all CES, Dell will make it a 
point to always go in with the 
very best in mind. This year is 
no different as the newest innovations for 
mobile computing and its related services 
from Dell are put in the spotlight.
Among the major announcements 
made, most important are the all-new 
Dell XPS entries – the Dell XPS 13 
(2018) and XPS 15 2-in-1; Dell Mobile 
Connect platform; and the latest 
Dell Latitude units.
Let’s get into the feats of design 
engineering that Dell revealed at CES 
2018. These two laptop wonders – the 
Dell XPS 13 and XPS 15 2-in-1 – are 
the accumulation of innovation and 
development that Dell achieved since 
the first Dell XPS appeared. Both are the 
slimmest entries, for their respective size 
classes, in the Dell XPS family. Of course, 
the pair are the most powerful as well, 
featuring an Intel 8th Generation Core 
CPU along with optimised innards. 
The Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 (2018) 
stand out more due to it sporting an 
AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPU that 
pairs up with the 15.6-inch InfinityEdge 
4K Ultra HD Display. 
More interesting is how both 
are the first to feature the Dell Cinema 
Experience, immersive audio and visual 
experience that Dell put together via 
extensive testing and optimisation.
The concept of immersion also 
takes a step up with Dell as it introduces 
the Dell Mobile Connect service. Unlike 
other smartphone command and control 
efforts that focus on proprietary functions 
made to be brand exclusive, this Dell 
app is compatible with Google Android 
and Apple iOS. Thusly, users need not 
be distracted with two devices and can 
manage them all with Dell.
As for workspace entries, the 
next-gen Dell Latitudes are equally as 
powerful and choke-full of innovations. 
Coming in laptop and 2-in-1 design types, 
they are both refreshed with the latest 
15W Dual-Core and Quad-Core Intel 8th 
Generation Intel Core vPro processors. 
Beyond the dramatic performance boost, 
new features like the active steering 
antenna (only on Dell Latitude 7490), 
Full HD super low power display as 
well as improved battery life, make 
these new business entries a force 
to be reckoned with.
These devices should reach Malaysia 
soon enough, it’s only a matter of when.

Immediate 
Touchdown
From CES to Malaysia, Dell keeps up its product release momentum
ight on the heels of CES 
2018, and in wanting to 
demonstrate on the proper 
usages of technology when it comes to 
work, lifestyle and passion, Dell Malaysia 
hosted a workshop with its latest line-up 
of Dell laptops. This includes the XPS 13 
and Vostro series with the 8th Generation 
Intel Core processors.
One of the latest products to appear 
at the Dell workshop, with it debuting 
first at CES 2018, is the latest Dell XPS 
13 (2018). As per revealed at Las Vegas, 
this new ultra-thin Dell XPS sports the 
next-gen InfinityEdge 4K Ultra HD display 
alongside brand-new colour-ways – Rose 
Gold and Alpine White. These intricate 
hues are woven into fibreglass chassis.
The 
usual 
high-spec 
innards 
from Intel are there. As for other 
improvements go beyond aesthetics. 
Most interesting is how the new Dell 
XPS 13 has 80% more thermal headroom, 
thanks to the space-tech sourced GORE 
Thermal Insulation that is used. These 
updates ensure the Ultrabook remains 
cool and quiet consistently. 
Next up 2018 updates for the Dell 
Inspiron 13 5000 and Vostro 13 5000 with 
Vostro 14 5000. While all three are not 
shown during the keynote, they did make 
their appearance on the showfloor. 
With 
the 
first 
next-gen 
mid-ranger, an Intel 8th Generation 
Core is used along with 32GB DDR4 
RAM and 128GB SSD. It’s made even 
thinner than its predecessor but still 
delivers on its promise on being 
seamless and speedy.
As for the new Dell Vostro units, 
both are similar in only one aspect – the 
Intel 8th Generation Core they use and 
its related hardware. Apart from that, 
respectively, the two come in 13.3-inch 
and 14-inch displays and stand apart 
from each other due to their distinctive 
offerings and user focuses.
The all-new Dell XPS 13 starts 
at RM5,999 and will be available at 
the end of January 2018. Meanwhile, 
the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 starts off 
at RM2,899 while both the Vostro 13 
5000 and Vostro 14 5000 starts off at 
RM3,199 and RM2,899 respectively.

The Big Data Push
Intel wants to leverage on ever expanding data
he big stage is set for Intel at 
CES 2018 and all it wanted to 
talk about is how data will truly 
transform the world. The narrative isn’t 
new yet Intel manage to make it insightful 
and interesting. While more and more 
data are being generated, or churned 
as Intel calls it, the concern is no longer 
about managing this explosive growth. 
Instead, the goal is to figure out 
how to best harness what the data can 
offer. While Intel is already working with 
various partners to analyse the raw data 
that is being generated and collected from 
all over. For Santa Clara, the next step is 
doing more with Big Data and empowering 
the processes with artificial intelligence.
Hence, it’s all about working with 
key partners if it wants to pull-off what 
it has in mind. Sectors that Intel confirms 
it is dabbling with includes automotive, 
drones, deep learning, and 5G connectivity. 
All efforts focus on one thing: using and 
engaging the data as a vital resource.
According to Brian Krzanich, CEO of 
Intel, almost everything tech generates 
data. This fact rings true ever since 
devices and services started connecting to 
the Internet and communicating with each 
other on various fronts.
“Every email, picture, podcast – even 
blogs – have data and are creating new 
data. Today, the Cloud is filled with billions 
of bytes, all of which is data. We’re not 
creating a flood – we’re in it! By 2020, 
the average person will create 1.5GB of 
data per day. That’s double of what folks 
are producing today!” exclaims Krzanich 
during his keynote at CES 2018.
It’s not just the people, Krzanich 
went on to share how cars are producing 
4TB of data while aeroplanes are doing 
40TB a day. Smart factories, a fast 
growing 
transformation 
process 
for 
the manufacturing sector, are already 
punching out 1PB of data each day. 
For Krzanich, these accumulative 
data have the potential to provide value 
as it is the foundation of innovation. 
“Today, AI need data to achieve new 
breakthroughs. We’re even using data 
to create art and automate processes 
like never before. As is, every sector can 
reimagine the way data is generated 
and used,” he shares.
How data is perceived now will 
truly transform the way the world works. 
Krzanich personally believes this will be 
the likely case as he moves Intel deeper 
into data-driven spaces.
Intel certainly is looking to do 
more than just make new CPUs and 
2018 looks like it will be the year it 
plays up this role. Let’s see how it will 
be in the months ahead for both Intel 
and the digital economy.

Hades Cometh
Intel isn’t done with its NUC
ntel needs to prove to the world that it 
is very serious with the AMD Radeon 
relationship. So much so, that the 
latest Intel Next Unit of Computing (NUC) 
– the Intel Hades Canyon concept – makes 
a surprise reveal at CES 2018.
Roaring inside is the latest Intel 8th 
Generation Core processor that pairs up 
with the AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPU. 
This not only confirms the collaboration 
between both rivals, it also reinforces the 
notion that the Intel NUC line isn’t going 
away. In fact, there will be a next-gen 
Intel Skull Canyon entrant alongside the 
two Intel Hades Canyon SKUs – Intel 
NUC8i7HVK and NUC8i7HNK.
Interestingly, the CPU used within 
the new Intel Hades Canyon is definitely 
a new Intel 8th Generation Core 
design. Even so, both are remarkably 
different. The more powerful of the 
two, featuring Intel 8th Generation 
Core i7-8809G, rocks the AMD Radeon 
RX Vega M GH. More importantly, it 
comes unlocked and has virtual reality 
(VR) capabilities. The other Intel Hades 
Canyon entry has Intel 8th Generation 
Core i7-8750G with AMD Radeon RX 
Vega M GL graphics.
Rightly so, both focus on gamers. 
The specs alone make it clear that the new 
Intel NUC concepts are all about producing 
an excellent gaming experience. 
Full HD resolution delivery is a 
definite and so having the ability to 
run AAA games. That is a true feat for 
something so small, all thanks to the 
next-gen specs within that 1.2l case.
While there is no confirmation yet, 
both Intel Hades Canyon will hit retail 
sometime in March 2018. Pricing wise, 
it will likely be in within what Intel Skull 
Canyon is asking for at launch.

Always Connected
Lenovo pushes the envelope for connectivity with two new devices
hile there are plenty to 
report on what Lenovo 
introduced on the Las Vegas 
showfloor for CES 2018, two specific 
reveals stood out. Both, remarkable in 
their own way, showcase how much 
further Lenovo can go with its need to 
remain uniquely innovative.
Starting with the Lenovo Miix 630, 
the result of Qualcomm teaming up with 
Microsoft, it is the latest Windows 10 S 
2-in-1 detachable. It is designed to provide 
the power and productivity of a laptop 
and the ‘always on, always connected’ 
mobility of a smartphone.
Always connected is not just about 
Wi-Fi in this case – it also encompasses 
the 4G LTE feature the Lenovo Miix 630 
offers. This means users don’t have to 
keep on searching for Wi-Fi hotspot to 
hang out at. Just like a smartphone, this 
versatile system will always have Internet 
access. It’s a big plus that it comes with a 
full-sized keyboard and digital pen.
Powering this 2-in-1 collaboration 
is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile 
processor 
that 
ensures 
Microsoft 
Windows 10 S runs silky smooth. 
As for its battery operational time, 
Lenovo promises 20 hours of video 
playback after a full recharge.
The other device that caught 
the attention of many at the CES 2018 
showfloor is the Lenovo Smart Display. A 
third-party platform that come with Google 
Assistant built-in, it is one of the rare 
entries that sports a proper Full HD display.
Having the screen alone is a huge 
step up as it can immediately display 
whatever content or information is asked 
of Google Assistant. Powering this 10-
inch entry is Qualcomm Snapdragon 624 
System-on-Chip and the newly announced 
Qualcomm Home Hub. 
While the are no confirm dates on 
when either device will release, its pricing 
range hovers around US$799 for the next-
gen 2-in-1 and US$249 for the Google 
Assistant operational core.

Continuous Push for 
AI, 4K and OLED
LG is not stopping its drive for innovation
G TVs are getting a leg-up in 
the innovation department as 
its latest line-up of premium 
TVs come with its proprietary LG ThinQ 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology. 
The TVs in question will be its OLED and 
Super UHD TVs alongside a new Alpha 
9 (α9) intelligent processor.
This 
is 
part 
of 
the 
smart 
home 
ecosystem 
that 
LG 
has 
developed over the years.
LG’s new intelligent processor 
promises intricate details like never 
before, 
providing 
richer 
true-to-life 
imagery as well as sharpness and depth 
for more realism. Noise reduction is also 
an area of focus for the α9 processor; its 
four-step process boasts twice as many 
functions as compared to conventional 
techniques. This will improve the clarity of 
the images shown, allowing you to enjoy 
what’s in front of you in life like detail.
This year at CES 2018, LG introduces 
nine new 4K AI OLED TVs to its already wide 
range of OLED TVs. The new additions will 
range from 55- to 77-inches with different 
design configurations. The AI Super UHD 
TVs on the other hand, will feature seven 
new models, ranging from 55- to 75-inches.
As for its AI capabilities, LG ThinQ 
will be compatible with various voice 
requests that utilises webOS, LG’s own 
open smart platform. Also integrated into 
the TVs are Google Assistant and deep 
learning technology. This enables users 
to control these next-gen TVs with their 
voices. Searching for new content through 
the TV has never been this easy.
Other new innovations and features 
that will appear in the latest line-up of 
LG OLEDs and Super UHDs includes the 
usage of high dynamic range (HDR). 4K 
Cinema HDR is added to support all major 
HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, 
Advanced HDR by Technicolor, Hybrid Log 
Gamma (HLG) and HDR10.
For those who want even bigger 
displays and have no need for the AI 
element, then the next-gen LG 4K UHD 
projector and Rollable TV concept 
should turn up on the radar. The former, 
especially, is a real head-turner as the LG 
HU80KA 4K UHD projector does away with 
the traditional bulky and heavy design for 
an ultra-slim and highly portable chassis. 
While its only half the size of other 4K 
projectors, it does not compromise on 
picture quality. 
Enhanced specs include 2,500 lumens 
projection that can go up to 150-inches, 
HDR10 support and Bluetooth connectivity 
to sync with wireless speakers.
As for the rollable TV, not much 
details have been released. At press time, 
there are no details if these will reach 
Malaysia anytime soon.

were the first 3LCD laser ultra-short throw 
projectors, the EB-1470Ui and EB-700U 
projectors, other projection technologies 
and smart glasses for commercial and 
industrial applications.
During the conference, Epson 
demonstrated Epson Town – a concept 
that showed off projection innovations 
that this community uses. The idea here 
is to show how the application of these 
holistic integrated solutions have an 
impact on critical areas like education, 
corporate, home and public spaces.
According 
to 
Daisuke 
Hori, 
Managing Director of Epson Malaysia: 
"When it comes to developing new 
technologies 
and 
innovations, 
we 
believe that it's our attention to 
detail that makes a fundamental 
difference and sets us apart from 
our competitors. In terms of Epson's 
projection innovation, every component 
in our projectors are created with the 
same obsessive attention to detail. 
By ensuring spectacular performance, 
we're confident that our innovations are 
able to stun even the biggest crowd."
With the projecter landscape 
continuing its persistent evolution, 
Epson 
believes 
that 
projection 
innovations 
are 
developing 
into 
important 
communication 
tools. 
Specifically, 
those 
that 
engage 
audiences in new and exciting ways.
The newest entry into the Epson 
projector family is the world’s first 
3LCD Laser Ultra-Short Throw Projector 
– the Epson EB-1470Ui. Combining 
cutting-edge 
laser 
light 
source 
technology 
with 
ultra-short 
throw 
interactivity, it can produce Full HD 
videos of up to 100-inches in size. Unique 
to this next-gen Epson entry is how users 
can pair both to produce an ultra-wide 
interactive screen of up to 177-inches.
As for the EB-700U, it can project 
up to 130-inches in portrait or landscape 
mode. With its ultra-short throw, 
multi-direction projection capabilities 
and PC-less functionality, it is ideal to 
be used as a digital signage. 
Besides these laser ultra-short 
throw projectors, Epson also launched 
its Epson EB-L1700 series, the most 
compact series of 3LCD laser projectors 
in its class, as well as the Moverio

Core 7885 System-on-Chip, 4GB RAM 
(up to 6GB) with 32GB storage (up to 
64GB) and 3,000mAh battery (up to 
3,500mAh) to power it all.
The display used is up-to-spec too 
– 5.6-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED with 
Infinity Display (up to 6-inch). What is 
with the need to 'up-to' addendum - well, 
there are two SKUs for this new Galaxy A8 
(2018): Galaxy A8 and Galaxy A8+.
Both will feature new innovations, 
like Live Focus, video digital image 
stabilisation 
(vDIS) 
and 
enhanced 
hyperlapse video recording capabilities. 
As for internals, updated features include 
LTE Cat. 11, enhanced sensor suite and 
Bluetooth v5.0. All these advanced 
hardware and features are super-secure 
due to the IP68 protection used.
“Samsung has always pushed the 
boundaries of smartphone design and 
function. Understanding the wants and 
needs of millennials, especially how they 
enjoy documenting and sharing experiences 
on social media, inspired the development 
of the Galaxy A8 (2018). With its dual-lens 
front camera, both variants – the Galaxy 
A8 and A8+ - are suitable for these next-
gen users,” says Yoonsoo Kim, President of 
Samsung Malaysia Electronics.
Hardy, stylish, and not too expensive, 
the Galaxy A8 (2018) Series is certainly for 
those who need to take awesome selfies. 
It is also suitable for those who are on 
the lookout for those who prefer not to 
overspend on next-gen smart devices.

Bundle of 
Autonomous Joy
honor View10 will have cross promotion bundles with selected DJI products
ow can one be different from 
the rest and do more to keep 
customers 
excited? 
New 
designs and better specs can only do so 
much. For honor, creating new bundles 
with exclusive partners is on the cards, 
the first of many being DJI.
The cross-promotion bundle between 
honor and DJI – called honor + DJI – will 
see the latest flagships from both brands 
being sold as combo deals. The packages, 
which will go live in February 2018, will 
feature the new DJI OSMO Mobile 2 and 
updated SPARK Fly More Combo. The 
honor View10 alone is now available for 
purchase at selected authorized dealers 
and on vmall.my for RM2,099.
Having made this combo with DJI 
clearly shows honor is looking out to 
do more for its customers and create 
new engagements that will continue 
to excite and build up the hype. It’s 
interesting to see that these bundles 
feature flagships from both parties, 
reinforcing the notion that both are keen 
to tap into the demand for high quality 
products that offer superb performance.
While not significant in terms of 
price cuts, both bundles are especially 
designed for those keen on getting 
either the honor View10 or DJI devices. 
Coincidentally, the DJI OSMO Mobile 
2 first appeared at CES 2018, meaning 
Malaysia will be one of the first countries 
that DJI has locked for launch.
This honor + DJI promotion 
campaign 
will

Last-Minute 
Shoppers Rejoice!
11street Energises CNY Shopping with 
Gong Xi Wang Wang Campaign
ith a few weeks left, Chinese 
New Year (CNY) planning is 
now going into full swing; 
11street knows this and wants to play 
a critical part with its Gong Xi Wang 
Wang campaign. Beyond the massive 
upcoming deals 11street will offer for this 
promotional period, there will be special 
accommodations for last-minute shoppers.
Take note, this new campaign is 
already running and will finish its course 
by end-February 2018.
Let's delve into some numbers 
before going into the 11street Gong Xi 
Wang Wang campaign. According to a 
nationwide survey that 11street conducted 
at the end of 2018, Malaysians are prone 
to last-minute shopping. From the 1,854 
respondents that took part, about 96% 
confirm they prefer shopping online before 
any major celebration takes place.
Interestingly, about 60% begin 
preparations for CNY two weeks before 
the auspicious event. From that group, 
about half admit to planning for the 
festivities just three days before.
By 
understanding 
this 
common 
Malaysian habit, 11street has developed the 
campaign to address this specific need. This 
includes offering a 48-hour delivery window 
for Klang Valley customers and introducing 
the newly added 'Click & Collect' option for 
those who prefer not to wait.
Beyond 
these 
customer-centric 
services, the Gong Xi Wang Wang 
campaign will also be giving away over 
RM20 million in Ang Pow coupons. They 
can be used to reduce the price of the 10 
million products or so that are on sale in 
11street. These overall discounts can go 
up to 88%. There will also be 'Good Luck 
Flash Deals' with selected products.
"It's no secret that we have 
a large and growing pool of online 
shoppers in Malaysia. Typically, they 
are the ones who drive up online sales 
during festive periods like Chinese 
New Year. What we have introduced 
with the Gong Xi Wang Wang 
campaign are off the back from the 
survey. Both services will certainly be 
beneficial to customers who need their 
orders in a hurry. We hope that these 
conveniences will continue to spur 
shoppers to see online marketplaces 
as the go-to-channels; moreso when 
they want to shop for necessities," 
says Bruce Lim, Vice President of 
Merchandising, 11street Malaysia.
The campaign will also see 
11street selling PETRONAS e-vouchers 
at up to 30% discount off the original 
pricing-of-the-week for fuel.

Speedy Launch Run
Sony Xperia mid-tiers are coming to Malaysia soon
hile the phrase 'fresh from 
CES' is rarely used for device 
launches, it is immediately 
applicable to the next-gen Sony Xperia 
mid-tier entries. In fact, pre-orders for 
them have opened in mid-January 2018. 
The upcoming campaign specifically 
focuses on the newly launched Sony 
Xperia XA2, XA2 Ultra and L2.
By far, this is the fastest of devices 
to appear outside of the US. Moreso, they 
are now available to general consumers in 
this part of the world.
All three – Sony Xperia XA2, XA2 
Ultra and L2 – smartphones replace the 
previous entrants that came out last year. 
Of course, each come with spiffy next-gen 
specs and product designs, proving Sony 
mobile is no longer the industry laggard.
“Sony Mobile is now seen as a 
market innovator and, with these mid-tier 
entries, we want to take that perception 
and further reinforce it. This is proven with 
the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra, where we do 
more than just use a dual-lens front-facing 
camera,” says Jason Lam, Channel 
Specialist, Sony Mobile Malaysia.
For the Sony Xperia XA2 and XA2 Ultra, 
both share a specific aspect – roaring inside 
is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630. Everything 
else, like RAM and storage configuration, 
screen size and camera array, are different. 
With the Sony Xperia XA2, its 3GB 
RAM and 32GB storage pair with the 
Qualcomm mobile processor, with all of 
them powering the 5.2-inch IPS Full HD 
screen. A rear-facing 8-Megapixel snapper, 
which can record 4K videos, is included 
and parked below a fingerprint sensor. A 
3,000mAh battery also resides within. As 
for the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra, the specs 
packed under the 6-inch IPS Full HD LCD 
panel includes 4GB RAM and 64GB storage, 
along with a 3,580mAh battery. Up-front is 
a 16-Megapixel +8-Megapixel dual-shooter 
for wide-angle selfies, while behind is a 
23-Megapixel lens that rocks a Sony Mobile 
Exmor RS system.
Pricing and availability are as follows:
• Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra: RM1,999 
(pre-orders opening from January 20 to 
January 31 2018, available for purchase 
from February 9 2018)
• Sony Xperia XA2: RM1,299 (available 
for purchase from February 9 2018)
• Sony Xperia L2: RM999 (available 
from February 9 2018)

for general customers and audiophiles 
like no other. What makes the experience 
worthwhile is being able to try out the 
Sennheiser HE 1, the world’s most 
expensive – and what Sennheiser claims 
to be the best ever – headphones.
The insane price-tag alone justifies 
the first claim as it retails at a cool 
€50,000 (approx. RM241,420).
It is at the flagship store that 
Sennheiser offers the largest collection 
of headphones, earphones, microphones 
and amplifiers for purchasing. Its target 
– the wide range of consumers who 
are keen to get a pair of headphones. 
As it is the only Sennheiser store in 
Malaysia, it will also house the widest 
range of Sennheiser consumer and 
professional audio products.
Besides the Sennheiser HE1, one 
other particular pair of headphones that 
will be available at the new Sennheiser 
store is the Sennheiser MOMENTUM HD 
1 Pink Floyd Edition. Retailing at RM2,649, 
this unique entry commemorates the long 
standing relationship between Sennheiser

Doing More with Less 
HTC puts in the right touches for its updated flagship
fter 
its 
successful 
2017 
comeback with the HTC 
U11, 
HTC 
decided 
to 
kick-off 
2018 
with 
the 
equally innovative HTC U11+.
Beyond upsizing the display and 
battery, it takes what HTC is famous 
for and pushes it to the next level. This 
includes improved audio capabilities 
via updated HTC BoomSound as it 
receives further optimisation. This 
specific 
improvement 
promises 
30% boost in volume levels with, 
what HTC claims, is richer and more 
dynamic sound. Complementing this 
is the equally as high-performance 
HTC USonic earbuds, now featuring 
pro-active sound cancellation.
For the camera department, HTC 
has put in even more effort to raise 
the bar from its previous flagship. The 
full-sensor phase detection autofocus 
supposedly rivals many Digital SLRs, 
offering ultra-fast focusing speeds. The 
main snapper for the innovative HTC 
U11+ still uses a 12-megapixel camera. 
Just like its predecessor, 4K video 
recording capabilities is part and parcel. 
Interestingly, unique to this single-lens 
system is the 3D Audio and Acoustic 
Focus recording functions it offers.
Up front is a 6-inch Quad HD+ 
18:9 display which uses the DCI-P3 wide 
colour-gamut system. According to HTC, 
the combination promises vivid visual 
capabilities and HDR10 image processing. 
Parked above that is an 8-megapixel 
front-facing shooter with HDR Boost feature.
Like the original HTC U11, this new 
iteration sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 
835 mobile processor. While there are 
multiple variants, HTC is only releasing the 
6GB/128GB SKU for Malaysia. This not only 
makes full use of the 3,930mAh battery, it also 
ensures the HTC Edge Sense won’t ever lag.
As for pricing and availability, the 
HTC U11+ will sell at RM3,099 and hit 
shelves after 22 January 2018. In terms 
of looks, the HTC U11+ will only come 
in the highly sought Translucent Black 
variant. It is, literally, a semi-transparent 
design. Shocking somewhat.
Pre-order will open soon, specifically 
from 15 January till 21 January 2018.

Malaysia On Track to Become 
Creative Powerhouse 
The spotlight now shines on Malaysia as national interest in 
the creative content and technology sector accelerates
t’s hard to get proper recognition 
for developing an industry and 
ecosystem that many cannot just 
cannot grasp or comprehend. This is 
doubly true for the creative content 
and technology industry. Equally as 
challenging is getting the government’s 
executive arm to understand the 
potential this sector offer.
The Malaysia Digital Economy 
Corporation (MDEC) succeeded in doing 
both. First, since it embarked on this 
arduous journey of growth, various 
institutions have emerged. This includes 
opening Malaysia’s first games incubator, 
LEVEL UP Inc. Second, the Minister 
of Communications and Multimedia 
Malaysia, Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said 
Keruak, made time to visit this platform. 
During the visit, Dr Salleh met with 
representatives from MDEC including 
its CEO, Datuk Yasmin Mahmood, and 
Hasnul Hadi Samsudin, Vice President of 
the Creative Content and Technologies 
division. Both sides discussed about the 
development of Malaysia’s creative content 
industry and how it has already generated 
positive revenue for Malaysia.
“Malaysia’s 
ICT 
industry 
has 
developed into one of our most important 
economic sectors and we are confident 
that the trends we observe in this industry 
today will continue to expand. I’m pleased 
to see how more of young Malaysians are 
already making their marks through games. 
As we all work towards growing the 
digital economy in Malaysia, this colourful 
industry - with the inclusion of the still 
growing eSports scene - promises a variety 
of opportunities to all. My visit to LEVEL 
UP Inc is about reaffirming our support for 
the games industry, with the hope that we 
may someday see new IP being produced 
here. Be it casually or in competition, 
these ‘Made in Malaysia’ games have the 
potential to be played globally,” he notes.
Dr Salleh’s visit to LEVEL UP Inc 
saw him and KKMM personnel being 
taken on a tour of the games incubator 
and meeting the various games studios 
that call the incubator their home. 
“Malaysia has become a premium 
location for games and creative content 
development in recent years thanks 
to a growing interest in the industry. 
With the government acknowledging 
games-related sectors as an economic 
contributor, Malaysians can now look 
forward to turn their passion for games 
as a career path. As an agency fronting 
the shift, we aim to provide all the 
assistance and support necessary to 
aspire our youth and creative talents to 
help them become a part of a successful, 
sustainable and accessible creative 
content ecosystem,” adds Yasmin.

that by introducing its own take – the 
Apple iPhone and iPad, respectively. 
These devices opened the floodgates of 
innovation for these market sectors and 
brought about the ongoing transformation 
that the world is now witnessing.
Before that all took place, old-style 
smartphones have been the domineering force 
and reinforced the sector with its embedded 
QWERTY keyboard and candy-bar design. 
What’s worse, no one wanted to budge from 
what they’re familiar with, while surprisingly 
successful upstarts – the likes of HTC and 
Palm – carved a small niche for themselves. 
Ontario-based 
BlackBerry, 
a 
long-time favourite for business users 
and those who need advance business 
solutions, falls in that category as well.
Plenty of device and design 
evolutions within the mobile space have 
taken place over the last decade, with 
some becoming industry trends that 
affect and influence rivals and other 
markets in various ways.
Of the many that have come 
and gone, four specific transformative 
trends remain as constants as they 
have wide-ranging impressions. They’re 
now industry cornerstones that all look 
towards as they enact changes and inspire 
innovation that have global impact.
These four mobility trends are – mobile 
cameras, smartphone designs, eWallets and 
Internet of Things (IoT) – have been defining 
how things work and the processes that are 
being adopted worldwide.
Let’s focus on the boring bits first.
Rise of IoT
The concept of everything being 
connected has been bandied about for 
years. Terms like convergence, unified 
communications, smart connectivity, 
active networking and other buzz 
words that have appeared and died a 
quick death – all of them didn’t really 
gain much traction and rightly so. No 
one, not even the industry players who 
S

created and advocated these ideas, 
could properly define them.
Everything quickly changed when 
basic connectivity between devices, and 
the Internet as a whole, improved as 
and when innovation for the networking 
and telecoms industries took place. In 
the last five years, there have been 
less connectivity failures, while service 
and hardware downtime dropped to 
zero. Even devices became smarter 
thanks to deeper studies with artificial 
intelligence and machine learning.  
Things started linking up and 
communicating with each other in ways 
that, at one time, aren’t possible. Experts 
coined terms like Internet of Everything 
(IOE) or Internet of Things (IOI) to label this 
new trend; the latter managed to stick. 
Since then, products that have any remote 
capability to go online and contact other 
devices is called an IoT device. 
Besides routers and networking 
systems, which are connected to stuff 
by default, other electronics that can and 
need to be jacked to the Web are now 
given the IoT label. This includes things 
with some modicum of electrical functions 
and demands to go online.
Even without market research, 
the biggest chunk of such platforms 
will, undoubtedly, be smartphones and 
mobile devices. As is, laptops and 2-in-1 
convertible PCs with SIM slots are 
making a huge comeback, all thanks to 
5G. The concept of not needing Wi-Fi for 
IoT is now attainable and it didn’t take 
years of research to get here.
While it may sound like a wonderful 
idea to connect just about everything, 
there are plenty of concerns to consider 
and how one should properly address 
them. This, also, taps onto next-gen 
innovations that are coming into play. 
One other industry movement is aptly 
tied to these issues: eWallet.
Dabbling into 
Mobile Payments
Let’s be clear here – this is focused on just 
one aspect of digital currencies: the digital 
wallet. It’s not an explosive trend yet, though 
many hope for it to be. Long time online 
payment players like PayPal never really got 
into it fully, oddly enough. Hence the lack of 
attention this space is now experiencing.
It took the sudden interest of 
smartphone players, namely Apple and 
Samsung, to start-up the ‘arms race’ that 
is now happening for mobile wallets. The 
ongoing fight is, well, two-sided to say the 
least since it is very much focused between 
both smartphone makers. Banks and similar 
financial institutions wanted an in too but are 
pretty much locked out from the warring pair. 
Of course, that really didn’t stop 
them from trying since, barely months 
after Apple and Samsung revealed their 
strategy to usher in the truly cashless 
era, many major banks worldwide have 
introduced their own digital wallet apps.
Is this the way forward? The banks 
and smartphone duopoly believe that is the 
case. Adding their voices to that are very 
unlikely stakeholders, the first of many 
being Alibaba and WeChat. Line got into 
the game soon after and even Southeast 
Asia’s fastest growing ride-hailing service, 
Grab, jumped in as well.
By the looks of it, eWallets are now 
the rage it seems and, whether consumers 
and merchants like it or not, it’s here to stay. 
How about those pertaining issues 
that plague both eWallets and IoT? 
Malicious activities take the bulk of 
these worries as both trends have no real 
protective measures beyond what vendors 
are offering as add-ons. Even next-gen 
countermeasures are reactive to current 
and oncoming threats.
There are many solutions in place that 
can deal with these problems, but that is for 
another time and article to produce. Now, 
let’s get to the more fun bits.
Ever-changing 
Designs
Before it mattered, smartphones pretty 
much use the same form-factor. They’re 
relatively thick and equally as hefty. 
Even the displays used are smaller and 
come with large bezels. 
From legacy devices, such as the 
Samsung Galaxy S2 and Sony Xperia Z or 
even HTC Desire, the design language of 
smartphones took a 180-degree turn, for both 
better and worse. It’s now come to the point 
where it is more competition than innovation. 
As is, manufacturers are practically 
racing each other to see who is going 
to make the first bold move and put out 
something totally different. For now, it’s all 
about taller displays where all are fighting 
to see how much more bezel space can be 
removed, or what else can be done to reduce 
the weight further. Changing the form-factor 
is a constant consideration as well; this is 
the same for the materials used. 
In other words, the on-going trend 
is to be sleeker and taller. That is the 
unfortunate interpretation for ‘innovation’. 
It gets even weirder when capacitive 
buttons are being phased out in favour of 
more screen real estate. 
As for the chassis, there is a 
massive divide between boxy and curvy. 
Curved designs took the spotlight when 
the Samsung Galaxy S6 series introduced 
COVER STORY

the idea of expanded sleekness by adding 
displays to the sides of the device. As 
for boxy, brands like Apple – at one 
time, now Sony Mobile and Razer still 
follow a strict design language where a 
boxy body is used for a better grip and 
offer that familiar design. 
To-date, 
the 
world’s 
thinnest 
smartphone hails from Chinese phone-maker, 
vivo, specifically the vivo X5 Max model. 
The device, released in 2014, achieved 
a chassis thinness of 4.75mm and only 
weighed in at 156g. Its bezels are traditionally 
large, while the materials used consist mostly 
of aluminium and plastic mix. As for the, still, 
world’s lightest phone, it is none other than 
the boxy Apple iPhone SE from two years 
back. It’s only 113g, confirming that it is the 
lightest smartphone ever made. Yet, within 
that 4-inch screen and premium fullmetal 
build, are so many advanced user features.
Now compare that to the latest and 
greatest of today. Like the Apple iPhone X, 
the screen is bigger and so are the overall 
size and weight. Would former Apple 
CEO, Steve Jobs, turn in his grave? Likely, 
especially since everything he stood for is 
pushed to the way side. 
Inspired by 
Innovation
The growth of the smartphone camera is 
so rapid that newer and better cameras are 
featured on almost every new smartphone 
that launces. Initially, it had been all about 
pushing the megapixel count. Back then, it 
only encompasses innovation as vendors 
chase each other to see who can break past 
the theoretical limit for higher pixels packed 
into a singular sensor. Factually, Megapixels 
do matter, but only to a certain degree. It is 
only when vendors started paying attention 
to the quality of each pixel that mobile 
devices suddenly became proper contenders 
with point-and-shoots. 
Where the original concept would 
push the Megapixel count to the highest 
it can go, pixel quality has never been 
considered. This results in images that will 
sport some minute flaws. If vendors put 
proper focus on the pixel quality, there is no 
real need to go after larger sensors. 
The best example would be the Sony 
Xperia XA1 going against the Google Pixel 2. 
The former features a 23-Megapixels camera 
whereas its immediate rival sports a shooter 
with 12-Megapixels. Even with nearly double 
in the megapixels count, Google’s flagship 
emerges victorious due to better pixel quality 
and the optimisations used. While this isn’t 
a spec-to-spec comparison, the point here is 
to give a simplistic example of the difference 
between chasing after bigger pixel sensors 
and improving those pixels. 
In other words, higher Megapixels 
does not necessarily translate to better 
image quality. Besides, software plays an 
important role too where image quality is 
concerned. The ability for RAW capture 
is slowly becoming the trend on some 
smartphones and this will begin affecting 
the need for bigger and faster memory 
storage as RAW needs more time to be 
saved as compared to JPEG images.
One development that all are looking 
forward is the continued push for dual-lens 
cameras, featuring high Megapixel count 
and enhanced pixel quality. 
A tri- or even quad-lens setup 
would be a little impractical, and a lot 
more expensive, so it may not come to 
us anytime soon. Rumours of Huawei 
making a tri-lens is making its rounds so 
let’s see how that’ll turn out.
Right now, the dual-lens format is 
trending with smartphone flagships. On 
some level, it is not true innovation, since 
both lenses only work simultaneously to 
capture an image. In the long run, users will 
begin to expect better innovations for the 
sharp-shooters, like simultaneous capturing 
or improved AI that help make micro 
adjustments to both pictures and video-calls. 
Ideas like interchangeable camera modules 
for each occasion will be a desirable feature.
That idea, and the advancement 
of cameras on smartphones in general, 
has one significant drawback. The size 
of the lens behind the device will grow 
as demands for better progression are at 
an all-time high. Likewise, the enclosure 
would only get bigger too. It’s hard to say 
the up-sizing will grow by how much, but 
it will certainly out-class what’s current. 
This would make it extremely impractical, 
unless a new and better approach can be 
developed to address these demands to 
deliver better quality without affecting 
compromising the form factor.
Should these mobility trends continue 
to accelerate, it will bring about a future 
where everything – including personal 
services – will be truly connected. In fact, 
with the way things are currently, the 
saying ‘The future is now’ seems very apt. 
It’s only a matter of when and how this 
high-impact industry trend will revolutionise 
how consumers and businesses interact 
and communicate with each other and 
their respective surroundings.

Polished Performer
Huawei Mate 10 Pro
Dual Shot
This is something only Huawei has ever 
excelled at and is leading on all fronts 
– the 20-Megapixls + 12-Megapixels 
shooter is definitely not a pushover.
Lost Jack
Indeed, there is no 3.5mm audio on the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. 
Personally, this decision is extremely frustrating. While I do enjoy 
using Bluetooth headphones, I personally like having a wired one 
since I don’t have to worry about battery life and charging them.
All Day Use
Having a 4,000mAh 
battery ensures the 
Huawei Mate 10 Pro 
will able to run all day. 
A little more if one 
knows how to manage 
the power use. Heavy 
engagement will, of 
course, drain it out 
pretty quick.
All About Colours
When Huawei introduced its newest 
oversized flagship – the Huawei Mate 
10 Pro – the first thing that came to mind 
is how awesome the dual-lens camera 
could be. Forget the unboxing, let’s dive 
right into that innovative 20-Megapixels 
+ 12-Megapixels RGB rear-facing camera-
array. True to its specs, images come out 
crisp and clear. They’re very bright too, 
perfect for low-light situations as every 
nuance and detail can be detected. 
This is where it became slightly 
disappointing as shots taken in daily or 
brightly lit places look fake somehow. The 
colours seem to be blown out and feels like 
someone decided to put a neon filter over it 
or shine massive spotlights on the subjects. 
If not for that, the main dual-camera set 
could’ve been great.
Too Bright
The over-saturation isn’t just confined to 
the camera performance. It’s a slight issue 
that can be managed with minute controls 
in the settings. However, on the main 
6-inch display, there is no such adjustment 
capabilities. While the visuals do pop on 
the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, it does feel as if 
someone decided to colour over everything 
on the screen with an extra paint can.
On the Huawei Mate 10 Pro, colours of 
all shades tend to take over the screen, 
resulting in pictures and visual content 
losing their visual depth and textures. It’s 
like experiencing the sights and sounds of 
Alice in Wonderland, only everything feels 
a bit unrealistic and 2D-like.
Proper optimisation, with whatever 
settings that can be tinkered with within 
the settings, would usually make it better. 
For this review, I could only do so much.
Solid Build
Like the front, the back is done up in all-
metal and rocks a mirror finish. Classy yet 
sturdy, which offers a comfortable grip, 
this is something I would support fully…
provided the mirror effect isn’t there. The 
latter ensures the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is 
susceptible to fingerprints and smudges. 
Matte all the way, please!

Missing Expandable
For something so big, one would think there 
would be room for everything. That isn’t the 
case with the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. 
While flagships and mid-rangers that 
are smaller in size use a hybrid-SIM tray 
to offer dual SIM capabilities or swap out 
SIM 2 for microSD expansion, this Huawei 
flagship doesn’t have that by design. 
That means, there is options for dual SIM, 
but there is no option for external storage.
Perhaps, Huawei is confident that 
128GB is more than enough for any 
smartphone user. Perhaps.

Robust Frame
While the Huawei

impervious to drops 
and bumps, it can 
dive into bodies of 
water, thanks to its 
IP67 rating.
Speedy on Delivery
With the HiSilicon Kirin 970 roaring 
within, along with 6GB RAM and ARM 
Mali-G72 MP12 GPU, there is no denying 
that the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is extremely 
fast. Even if its graphics rendering isn’t 
comparable to some of the other flagships, 
it can hold its own very easily. From firing 
it up to running all sorts of apps that have 
different load demands, this flagship 
did not lag at all. There is the occasional 
slow-down 
when 
multi-tasking 
is 
borderline crazy, but it doesn’t get bogged 
down to make it noticeable.
If anything, this flagship for Huawei 
is no pushover as it packs in enough 
innovations to show it can perform as 
per written on paper. If only the colour 
didn’t pop out so much.

Thick yet Attractive
Like most entries in its class, the Lenovo Tab 4 10 Plus 
looks prim and proper with the bezels taking on a more 
dated look. Even so, its slim chassis complements its 
lightweight design and easy-handling.
Solid All-Rounder
Mention tablets and most people would 
immediately refer to the Apple iPad. Rarely 
are there brands that have been able to 
topple Cupertino or even share similar 
context in the same sentence. While Lenovo 
is mostly known for its consumer laptops, 
the Lenovo Tab 4 10 Plus is an eye-opener. 
This is mostly due to its 10.1-inch display 
with long-standing battery life, solid build 
quality and stable performance.
Standing Tall
At 10.1-inches, the Lenovo Tab 4 10 
Plus has an IPS LCD panel with 1200 x 
1920 pixels with a 16:10 aspect ratio. 
This is suitable for watching movies and 
playing games. Personally, this tablet 
provided great comfort whilst streaming 
Netflix and various video content. While 
colour reproduction isn’t too vibrant, 
its price-tag is significantly lower. It’s 
an equivalent trade-off.
Using on the Daily
As a daily driver, the tablet is snappy and 
efficient without running the battery down. 
Even when browsing through social media 
and streaming video constantly, the tablet 
keeps up with most of the load. Slow-downs 
only show up when app switching became 
too frequent. Thankfully, it isn’t enough to 
deter the experience by so much. The only 
downside is the slow fingerprint scanner 
response time as it took a while to register 
and react. It’s unfortunate as most would 
consider the faster response when using 
pattern security.

Zero Cancellation
Noise-cancelling is, surprisingly, not

SOUND DRIVERS: 40mm with advanced 
acoustic technology
WIRELESS: Bluetooth, up to 10m connection 
strength
BATTERY: up to 18 hours of listening and talk

Long Range
The Bluetooth option on the 
Plantronics BackBeat has a 
surprisingly long range. That 
is, once it does connect to the 
smartphone or laptop. It took a 
while for the latter to work.
Alright Impression
When the Plantronics BackBeat 505 arrived 
for review, I expected a classy experience. 
It’s Plantronics after all. The reality of it: 
it feels like a toy somewhat. The build is 
shoddy; the materials used – plastic and 
rubber – would leave the impression that 
it’ll break after several months. 
However, it will last somehow. For this 
review unit, there are signs of yellowing 
on the edges and the ear-cups feel tacky 
too, obvious signs of wear and tear but 
still amazingly holding up very well.
User Friendly
Even with the warning signs, I put it on 
anyway and – wow – it’s a seriously 
comfortable pair of headphones. As it’s 
very lightweight, having it on the whole 
day is a non-issue. 
This makes-up for all that not-so-good 
early impressions. Comfort is not the only 
thing it offers as easy-to-access controls 
– parked on both sides of the cans – are 
good indicators too. 
Boom-y Performance
Despite all the initial shortcomings, the 
Plantronics BackBeat 505 manages to put 
out a good soundstage. Beyond having 
nice audio clarity, these headphones 
lean a little more towards the bass. It’s 
awesome for those who love deep thumps 
in their music. 
For the more balanced tracks, it falls 
short a little. The highs and the mids 
are slightly lacking and detrimental to 
classical music where the arrangement 
becomes unbalance.

Divine Experience
Samsung Galaxy A8
Big Screen
Samsung makes the 5.6-inch 
Full HD+ display feel bigger 
than it should be thanks to 
the near bezel-less design.
Infinity and Beyond
Much like the premium flagships, the 
Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) sports the 
latest screen design, featuring the Infinity 
Display. Being a Samsung smartphone, 
it comes with a 5.6-inch Full HD+ Super 
AMOLED display screen as well. 
This ensures visual production is 
vivid and rich in detail while remaining 
comfortably bright. It’s not overdone.
Good Fit
In my hand, the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) 
has a nice handheld experience thanks to 
the curved sides and glass back it uses. It’s 
thin bezels along with the smaller forehead 
and chin, gives way to the bigger screen that 
rocks 18:9 aspect ratio – a welcomed sight. 
Front Dual Shooter
Another big trend of 2017 had been the 
introduction of dual cameras at the back 
of the smartphones. Plenty of brands did 
that and the Samsung Galaxy Note8 is 
no stranger to this move as well. What 
makes the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) 
stand out is having the same concept being 
done for its front camera.
At the rear, of course, is a singular 
16-Megapixel f/1.7 lens. The ones in 
front sport a 16-Megapixel f/1.9 Live 
Focus system paired with an 8-Megapixel 
f/1.9 wide-selfie sensor.
Back Scanner
The Fingerprint Scanner on the 
Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is now 
parked at the back, directly below 
the rear-mounted camera. Personally, 
that’s a big plus point though it could 
do without being too close to the lens.

Camera Work
As far as smartphone photography goes, 
Samsung has done no wrong in that 
department as each smartphone to come 
out has a decent snapper. While the 
Samsung Galaxy Note8 receives praise 
for its exceptional photo-taking abilities, 
the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is capable 
in its own right as it produce photos with 
detailed results, even in low-light.
The rear shooter is a reliable partner, 
able to get the most out of your subject in 
a single shot. Auto mode is a beast on its 
own, capable of reading its surroundings 
and making the necessary adjustments to 
give your subject justice.
However, the more important feature 
to the Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018) is its 
front-facing camera, where both work 
together to give you a blurred background 
effect that Samsung calls Live Focus. A 
function first introduced in both Samsung 
Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note8, it’s nice to point 
out that even Samsung’s more affordable 
models come with its latest innovations.
In good lighting conditions, the Live 
Focus works tremendously well. A neat 
touch to Live Focus is how Samsung makes 
the blurred background effect look natural, 
something plenty of other smartphones are 
still trying to accomplish.
More than One
Beyond the USB Type-C 
port, the Samsung Galaxy 
A8 (2018) has an audio 
jack – an element that is 
now slowly becoming an 
uncommon inclusion on 
smartphones. Kudos to 
Samsung for doing this.
Side Speaker
There is one flaw with 
the 
Samsung 
Galaxy 
A8 (2018) – how the 
speaker is parked on the 
side, specifically below 
the power/lock button. 
Thankfully, it’s loud enough 
and doesn’t undermine the 
user experience.
Desirable Daily Driver
In a nutshell, the Samsung Galaxy A8 
(2018) is decent enough for everyday use. 
It houses a Samsung Exynos 7885 Octa-
Core processor with 4GB of RAM to boot. 
For storage, it comes in two flavours: 32GB 
or 64GB. There is also a microSD slot that 
can hold up to 256GB.
Running it for an entire day through 
social media, Spotify, YouTube, Netflix 
and the occasional map navigation like 
Google Maps and Waze, it did run the 
3,000mAh battery down quicker than 
most. It also tends to get bogged down 
when I multi-task between apps too much, 
causing the device to freeze for a bit before 
getting back to normal.
Of course, that isn’t a regular occurrence 
and it only happened to me a handful of 
times during my couple of weeks of usage.

Sleek Looks
Lifting off the box lid reveals, in the 
usual protective sheath, an ultra-slim 
tablet that exudes pure class with its 
8.8mm fullmetal build. 
It’s a no-nonsense look that is very 
welcomed since other brands started to 
saturate the marketplace with pop-colour 
designs and eye-popping mechanisms. The 
build material gives it that nice heft too.
Decent Experience
Turning it on and getting it to run basic 
apps is a cinch, thanks to the Intel Atom x5 
and 8th Generation HD Graphics that roars 
within. From boot-up to opening Gmail on 
Google Chrome, all that took less than a 
minute. 
Doing basic work on Microsoft Office 
and some simple Adobe Photoshop 
did not slow down the JOI 11 Pro 
– that alone is impressive.
It Makes Do
The JOI 11 Pro does not have its accessories. 
They’re all optional. I’d love to give the JOI 
Active Pen or any of the two keyboards a 
go with the tablet just to see how it works. 
Even so, I did jack in my Logitech Bluetooth 
Multi-Keyboard K480 just to get a proper 
feel while writing this review. 
In summary: it connects seamlessly 
and working with responsive touchscreen 
on the JOI 11 Pro is good. If anything, this 
tablet is suitable for those who are always 
on-the-go. Just get the accessories too. 
Still Going
Having covered JOI for two years now, it is very heartening to see that the local technology manufacturer is still doing what it can to keep 
its head above the water. Indeed, it has come a long way from putting out its very first tablet. Its latest – the JOI 11 Pro – is supposedly 
the best entrant to-date.

NVME and Optane-ready
The two M.2 slots on the motherboard 
are NVME and Optane ready, so you can

to turbo-charge the system in a flash. 
Reliable and Robust
The TUF branding on this motherboard is 
no accident. It is certified to be stronger 
and more reliable than other motherboards 
in the market, thanks to its high quality 
components as well as protection around 
the PCIe slots. Plus, it looks like it is ready to

Performance at The Ready
Thanks to a bevy of features built-in the 
motherboard, the TUF Z370-Pro Gaming 
can take on just about any tasks thrown

The True Flagship Killer
OnePlus 5T
Reinforced Body
The premium look of the OnePlus 
5T is further reinforced with its 
metallic unibody chassis. This 
gives off a sleek and smooth touch, 
although it will take some time to 
get used to since it’s a bit slippery.
Face Unlocked
This is now a thing for all 
premium flagships - facial 
recognition. For the most 
part, it works like a dream. 
Simply place the screen 
to your face and press the 
unlock button, you will 
see how fast it responds; 
literally in a blink of an 
eye. It even works great 
with glasses on, which for 
me, is always.
Popular Upstart
While being under the same umbrella 
with brands like OPPO and vivo, OnePlus is 
arguably the more popular of the three with 
its no-nonsense approach. 
As is, OnePlus 5 is only a few months 
old and already, the OnePlus 5T came out 
just a month ago. To be fair, I have never 
gotten my hands on a OnePlus smartphone, 
though I have heard the stories.
There 
are 
significant 
differences 
between the OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T, 
though both are equally as aggressive 
with their price-points. This makes 
it a real threat to many flagship 
smartphones, and rightfully so.
Bigger is Always Better
The OnePlus 5T isn’t just an upgrade for 
its predecessor, it’s also a replacement, and 
a very good one at that. It carries a 6.01-inch 
Full HD Optic AMOLED display with an 18:9 
aspect ratio. This is the first ever OnePlus 
smartphone that carries such a large panel, 
a surprising move from the Chinese brand. 
However, when comparing the screen 
size against other premium flagships, 
the OnePlus 5T does fall short as it’s still 
stuck with Full HD resolution, at 1080 
x 2160 pixels, and 401ppi density. This 
is far less than what both Apple and 
Samsung are offering.
Top-Notch Quality
The OnePlus 5T is perfect at its 
price-point, even with its slightly dated 
display. Compared to other smartphones 
at its price level, the OnePlus 5T 
completely stumps them. 
Colour reproduction and consistency 
are amazing as it gives off a full life-like 
look without looking over-done. There are 
also plenty of ways to adjust the display 
in the settings menu. One such feature 
is Adaptive Brightness, an option that 
alters the screen brightness level, based 
on its detection of harsh light, to provide 
the best view possible.
Varied Screen Calibrations
To make full use of the 6.01-inch Full 
HD Optic AMOLED panel, the OnePlus 
5T comes with multiple pre-optimised 
screen settings. This includes the default 
Adaptive Brightness, sRGB, DCI-P3, 
Adaptive Mode and Custom Colour.

Premium All Around
Like all top-tier flagships, sans those who 
don’t see the light, the fingerprint sensor of 
the OnePlus 5T is placed at the back. 
Full disclosure: I’m a strong advocate 
of this design as it just feels more natural, 
instead of having to awkwardly place one‘s 
finger on the front-mounted home button. 
With this design, you can hold the 
device like you normally would and rest 
your pointing finger at the back, since 
it’s a natural spot to do so! Why can’t 
all brands see that?!
Insane Daily Driver
The OnePlus 5T is one of the better 
smartphones to have as a daily driver. 
With 6GB of RAM, you can literally blaze 
through an entire day with it and not feel 
any sluggishness. The OnePlus 5T also 
houses the Snapdragon 835 with 64GB of 
internal storage. Oddly, there is no storage 
expansion option.
From 
various 
social 
media 
to 
map navigation, Spotify, Netflix and 
YouTube streaming, the OnePlus 5T is 
capable of playing the heavyweight 
without feeling the pinch. 
What a Shooter!
The camera performance more than makes 
up for its weird bulged shape. Much like its 
younger sibling, the OnePlus 5T comes with 
a 16-Megapixel + 20-Megapixel dual lens 
snapper with an increased aperture of f/1.7 
and a focal length of 27.22mm. 
To assist both the sensors, which are 
Sony sourced, is OnePlus’ Intelligent Pixel 
Technology – a concept that merges four 
pixels into a single shot to improve clarity, 
while reducing the overall blurring and noise. 
This assures the OnePlus 5T is a contender 
in the smartphone camera market.
In terms of low-lighting shots, the 
OnePlus 5T does live up to its name in giving 
you the best shots possible. Colours look 
great while the visual contrast between 
light and dark is a lot better than what its 
predecessor produced. 
Audio Jack Present
The OnePlus 5T comes with a 
3.5mm headphone jack, because 
why should it fall in line with the 
other premium rivals.
Full Day Use
The 3,300mAh battery used can last a full day without needing a 
recharge. Of course, if Waze and Spotify is used at the same time, 
consistently even, the battery will run down quicker. Fret not as 
the OnePlus 5T does come with quick charging capabilities.

Honourably Great
honor View10
Advanced Intelligence
Huawei drives innovation as far as 
it can again with the honor View10. 
It boasts a new HiSilicon Kirin 970 
Octa-Core processor and an advanced 
neural-network processing unit (NPU), a 
world’s first for mobile devices. 
This NPU is touted to make the 
smartphone more intelligent as it learns 
the user’s patterns and optimise it for 
maximum engagement.
Smooth Styling
Out of the box, it is immediately 
noticeable that the honor View10 looks 
outstanding with its 5.9-inch edge-to-edge 
bezel-less screen design. 
It sounds unwieldly, but this next-gen 
smartphone is superbly slim even when 
it has an over-sized screen. Somehow, 
it feels good in my hand. Even the 
back has a nice premium touch thanks 
to its all metal chassis.
Snappy in Hand
It cannot be shared enough that the 
HiSilicon Kirin 970 System-on-Chip (SoC), 
paired with 6GB RAM and ARM Mali-G72 
12-Core graphics, is insanely fast. Heavy 
graphic rendering, multi-tasking processes, 
opening various apps in quick sequence 
and using them simultaneously, are 
managed with relative ease.  Everything 
I threw at the honor View10 had been 
completed in quick order.
Full Display
The 5.9-inch is massive for 
many yet suitable for all since 
its 18:9 Full HD+ promises 
enhanced colour reproduction and 
larger-than-life content visuals.
Empowered 
Performance
The honor View10 is no 
push-over and can hold 
its own against other 
flagships. The Geekbench 
4 results are a good 
example – scores for 
Single- and Multi-Core 
are very commendable.
Optimised Battery
Powering the honor View10 is a 3,750mAh battery 
that, with normal use, manages to last a couple of 
days on a single charge. This is all thanks to the 
NPU and optimised HiSilicon Kirin 970. Reducing the 
screen resolution – a rare option – works too.

Deep Learner
Why did honor call its most powerful 
smartphone to-date an artificial intelligence 
(AI) smartphone? At the heart of it is the 
NPU. This advanced AI processor is what 
makes the honor View10 smarter, powering 
elements that enable it to auto-optimise 
processes, learn what users want or even 
work out how to balance power usage. 
Honestly, these are all on paper. It’ll 
take weeks as a daily driver before the 
honor View10 can figure out my usage 
patterns. However, I can vouch for what 
the NPU offers right out-of-the-box. When 
taking pictures, the AI will automatically 
activated its intelligent-scene recognition 
feature and detect – almost always 
correctly – what kind of subjects or scenes 
is in front of the lens. It even adjusts the 
camera settings correctly.
Good Shot
There is no doubt the honor View10 
packs in awesome optics. Comprising the 
20- and 16-Megapixel lens array for the 
rear-mounted camera, it is the best of what 
honor offers. Hands down. It’s the second 
snapper in my hand during the recent 
ESL One Genting 2018 event. Every shot 
taken came out exceptionally sharp and 
full of vibrant colours. Pro-tip: in manual 
mode, the aperture can be pushed to f/16 
for maximum clarity or bumped down to 
f/0.95 for superb bokeh.
The NPU helps too as it can discover 
low-res shots – mistakes that occur 
when the manual setting is configured 
wrongly – and scale it up to make it look 
better. It achieves this by automatically 
sharpening the blurry and smudgy pixels, 
saving most of the details that would have 
been lost otherwise.
Fast Juice
Heavy use will drain the battery fast as 
per the norm. With honor View10, that is 
not a cause for concern as it can recharge 
from flat to half-full under 30 minutes. The 
fast-charger power adaptor is necessary.

Pairing a great design with decent size

View10 is undoubtedly a top-tier player. 
Kudos to Huawei for creating this and 
putting in a plethora of innovations that, 
I’m certain, other manufacturers will 
emulate down the road. 
Zippy Unlock
The elliptical home button, 
parked below the screen, 
doubles up as a fingerprint

unlocks

Affordable HDR
BenQ EW277HDR
Gorgeous Sight
BenQ, a veteran when it comes to display 
monitors and projectors, is looking to ramp 
up its efforts in the high dynamic range 
(HDR) space since that is all the rage these 
days. The latest entry, in its bid to provide 
the best in picture production but keep 
prices down, is none other than the BenQ 
EW277HDR monitor.
I hooked up this gorgeous beauty, which 
packs in a 27-inch Vertical Alignment (VA) 
Full HD panel, to my Sony PlayStation 4 to 
see how it would fare. This is specifically, 
in terms of gaming and movies via Netflix 
since many of the shows on the streaming 
platform are now HDR compatible.
Pleasant Assembly
Straight out of the box, the BenQ EW277HDR 
27-inch VA panel is exceedingly simple 
to setup. The stand splits into two pieces 
and can be easily put together to keep the 
display in place. 
The T-shaped design of the stand 
ensures the monitor will be taking 
up less space than other monitors. 
Personally, that is a nice touch since 
such considerations are rare.
Simple Cable Collection
Along with its power socket is a HDMI 
cable, with the latter allowing you to plug 
it into a PC desktop or games console of 
course. I went with HDMI because I am a 
console plebian who can’t afford to be part 
of the PC Master Race. 
In terms of ports, there are two HDMI 
2.0s and one D-Sub. Parked right next to 
them is a 3.5mm with audio line-in combo.
All three are capable of HDR output 
and offer 93% DCI-P3 wide colour gamut 
outputs. Both are the major features that 
BenQ is banking on for this flagship.
Thin Sides
One thing that stands out for 
the BenQ EW277HDR is its 
extremely slim bezels, paired 
with a matte black paintjob. 
Front Buttons
Sitting underneath the panel, 
which is done up in metallic 
grey, is a host of buttons. 
It’s parked on the right of 
the BenQ logo. I prefer the 
buttons to be placed behind 
the monitor to retain that 
seamless look upfront.
Rigid Fixture
A downside to the monitor is its lack of adjustment. Aside 
from its 20° vertical tilt, it cannot be moved upwards or 
downwards or swivel. This lack of basic movements do not 
downplay the awesomeness of this BenQ display.

Perfect for HDR
As BenQ is one of the leading experts 
for monitors, the BenQ EW277HDR is no 
different to the image quality it produces 
under BenQ the brand.
Sadly, I don’t own a Sony PlayStation 4 
Pro, so I can’t get the most out of its HDR 
goodness for games. However, that doesn’t 
mean the monitor is a letdown. Instead, 
it has made my gaming experience better 
than a conventional TV. As for my previous 
TV, well…I have since laid it to rest or it 
could’ve died out on its own because I rage 
a lot…who knows…  
I fired up Destiny 2, GTA V and Ghost 
Recon: Wildlands on the monitor and 
it handled each game brilliantly. Colour 
reproduction looks great, while giving 
out resounding clarity in great detail. 
The contrast between light and dark 
colours is excellent, making a town 
blanketed in darkness all the more eerie 
and inviting than usual.
Watching 
Netflix 
on 
the 
BenQ 
EW2277HDR is a totally different story. 
With most of Netflix’s content already 
HDR compatible, it made staying in to 
binge-watch stuff all the more better. After 
re-watching Bright for the umpteenth time, 
it looks so much better on this HDR panel 
that I had to watch it again a few days later.
Beyond Conventional 
The BenQ EW277HDR has a host of 
features for you to play around with. 
One is Low Blue Light technology, a 
function that filters out harmful blue light 
that causes eye strain and fatigue. The 
monitor provides four preset modes for 
it: Multimedia, Web-surfing, Office and 
Reading. While there isn’t a PC to test this 
out, it definitely worked when I’m gaming 
or binge-watching as I didn’t notice the sun 
rising until it’s really late.
Another critical feature the BenQ 
EW277HDR offers is Brightness Intelligence 
Plus technology (B.I.+). It allows the display 
to adjust its settings based on colour 
temperature. If the sun’s out, it switches 
to a cool white to ease your eyes into the 
day. During the night, which is when it’s 
normally on, it changes to warm white 
light, adjusting itself to its surroundings.
Great Buy
All in all, my experience with the BenQ 
EW277HDR has been nothing short 
of amazing. Sadly, like many of my 
relationships, my time with the monitor 
came to an unfortunate end. I will probably 
never see it again, unless I start stalking it 
on other websites until I make the impulsive 
decision to splurge and get my hands on it. 
Flicker Free 
A main-stay function for 
BenQ, it ensures users eyes 
aren’t ruined when they stare 
too long at the screen when 
gaming or binge-watching.
Audio Ready
There are speakers on this monitor 
– two 2W types to be exact. It’s 
rare to such an option on panels 
these days, especially 4K ones.

An Ultra Comeback
Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra
Rounded Edges
The 6-inch screen is 
curved slightly, going all 
the way to the edges. 
When paired with the 
similarly curved corners, 
it looks seamless – giving 
the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra 
an almost bezel-less look.
Pumped Battery
Inside the Sony Xperia XA2 
Ultra is a 3850mAh battery, 
promising full-day use for 
at least a day and then 
some. During the course 
of this review, the battery 
managed to last for few 
days before needing to be 
plugged in. This is no mean 
feat since the large Full HD 
display does have a huge 
power draw.
Mid-range Hulks Up
Sony is celebrating the new year with the 
introduction of a number of additions to 
its Sony Xperia smartphones line-up. The 
stand out model among the new entries 
is, undoubtedly, the Sony Xperia XA2 
Ultra. Based on the previous Sony Xperia 
XA1, this larger take features a number 
of improvements for an already decent 
mid-range phone.
The Big Show
There is nothing better than making a first 
impression and Sony Mobile definitely has 
that in spades. The Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is 
striking when taken out of the box. Its long 
rectangular design, complemented with 
rounded edges, link up the front and back of 
the chassis, giving it a sleek yet classy look. 
The premium look carries over to 
how the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra feels as 
well. When paired with the 6-inch Full 
HD screen, more on that shortly, that sits 
up-front on this smartphone, this Sony 
Mobile next-gen mid-range flagship does 
not look or feel like a device that can play 
for keeps in the high-performance sector. 
Weighing at 221g, which gives it a certain 
heft, creates that satisfaction of putting out 
a decent and well-built smartphone. 
Stunner of a Screen!
Personally, the 6-inch Full HD LCD display 
on the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is a sight to 
behold. Images and other visual content 
look crisp and colourful on it, confirming 
that it is a great medium for video 
streaming. Obviously, it is for Netflix and 
iflix. Gamers can rejoice too since the colour 
reproduction is top-notch, as per what the 
developers intended. Keep in mind, this is 
right out of the box with no personalised 
calibration at all.

System-on-Chip with an ARM Adreno 508 
mobile GPU. Paired to that are 4GB RAM 
and 32GB storage – the review unit sports 
the larger SKU variant, featuring the 64GB 
load-out. As for the operating system, 
Sony Mobile has hit it right-off-the-bat as 
it preloads Google Android 8.0, ensuring a 
zippy device performance.
Personally, seeing Sony Mobile opt for 
a near-Vanilla take on the Google Android 
8.0 as the base for the custom launcher is a 
huge plus point. For very long, there is this 
fervent hope that a Sony Xperia flagship 
will stop pretending to be special and take 
the lead in going full-on stock Android. The 
closest to that hope is none other than the 
Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra. 
For all intents and purposes, I am 
very comfortable with using the Sony 
Xperia XA2 Ultra out of the box. This is 
all thanks to Sony Mobile for pairing the 
heavily optimised performance of this 
new smartphone with the proper Google 
Android 8.0 experience.
Show-Stopping Camera
Let’s not forget the real reason the Sony 
Xperia XA2 Ultra is doing the review run at 
PC.com Tested Labs. Indeed, it’s all about 
the photography capabilities for this brand 
new mid-range entrant. This being Sony 
Mobile, there is no such thing as falling in 
line with popular opinion. 
Thusly, the rear-mounted main camera 
is a single lens type that offers a plethora 
of features that most enthusiast and 
professionals are familiar with. Amateurs 
would, equally, be as excited.
Since this is a Sony product, the 
hardware is definitely top-notch as the 
23-Megapixels shooter the Sony Xperia 
XA2 Ultra uses can take exceptionally sharp 
and vibrant pictures. Outdoor and subjects 
with good lighting exposures are all 
captured with just the right colour balance 
and hue/saturation levels. Low-light is 
decent too but only after some adjustments 
are done in Adobe Lightroom. 
Pinfall Win
Is this the mid-range champ that Sony 
Mobile fans have been waiting ages for? 
Can it hold a candle to the segment rivals 
that use dual-lens camera array or run on 
proprietary mobile processors? Honestly, 
even if they’re in the same class, their main 
cameras are not literally apple-to-apple. 
Again, the big screen is a huge plus and the 
gimmicks used are true keepers. 
Fast Snaps
One aspect of any Sony Xperia flagship is how 
there is a dedicated camera shutter button 
placed on the right side’s bottom corner. Not 
only does it allow for fast photo-taking with 
just a quick press to call up the app, it also 
encourages users to hold the smartphone 
like a proper camera. This ensures a steady 
hold before the shot is taken.

Strixly Out of this World
ASUS ROG Strix RX VEGA64 O8G 8GB
Up to Speed
It had been mid of last year when AMD 
launched to the masses its most powerful 
graphics card yet – the AMD Radeon RX 
Vega 64. While it did take a while for some 
kinks to be ironed out, it seems the world 
will  finally get to see these GPUs hitting the 
shelves of various IT retailers in short order.
One of the cards that will be sold here 
is ASUS’ latest take – the ASUS ROG Strix 
RX VEGA64 O8G 8GB OC Edition, from 
ASUS Republic of Gamers (ASUS ROG). It 
finally reached PC.com Tested Labs after 
making its rounds at other publications. 
Thus, it’s time to plug it in and see 
how well it performs.
What a Looker!
When taken out of the 
box, the ASUS ROG Strix 
RX VEGA64 O8G 8GB OC 
Edition feels bland at first. 
Except for the metallic 
aluminium heatsink and 
big ASUS ROG logo 
splashed on the back in 
white, this GPU is done 
up completely in black. It 
looks totally low key, that 
is until its powered up. 
The ASUS ROG logos light 
up in RGB, fully powered 
with ASUS Aura. 
Massive in Size
ASUS does it again with going big. Once 
again, this being the ASUS Strix – ROG 
variant or otherwise, this GPU is large in 
every possible sense. It measures 300mm 
– a full-sized long school ruler! – from 
end-to-end, 140mm wide and 60mm in 
height. Please check if the casing in use can 
fit something of this size first, otherwise 
get another casing for zero angst.
Being so big is not just for show, as ASUS 
revamped pretty much everything from the 
original factory design of the AMD Vega 64 
base design. Most obvious is having the 
singular fan design, which AMD always 
favours, for a trio set of air-coolers. Parked 
below are a pair of over-sized heatsinks. 
This is how ASUS ROG makes sure every 
ounce of heat is removed instantly.
The makeover doesn’t stop there as 
ASUS has opted for a 12+1 power-phase 
design – 10 for GPU, 2 for graphics memory. 
The design always had overclocking in 
mind and then some. Too much? With 
ASUS ROG, more is always good.
Coolly Silent
For all the big innovations that ASUS 
loaded out onto this next-gen graphics, I’d 
expect to hear some audible humming at 
least. On minimum load, nothing could be 
heard. That is the same for mid-processing 
loads and when things get pushed hard.
Only at max load, with games or 
multiple 4K video streams, did the ASUS 
ROG Strix RX VEGA64 O8G 8GB OC 
Edition started making a low-level buzz. 
Even then, it’s nearly inaudible unless 
one purposefully strains the hearing and 
knows what to pick out.
Running quiet is just one critical aspect 
for this ASUS ROG Strix GPU. Using 
a large cooling block, which is further 
upsized from previous designs, it’s really 
no surprise that the fans only start working 
hard when performance temperature 
reached 60-degrees Celsius. This is also 
due to, ASUS claims, its newly developed 
heat spreader that it calls MaxContact 
Technology. Kudos to ASUS ROG for 
creating a cooler that is this efficient, 
moreso one that can effectively manage 
such a power-hungry graphics card. 
8-Pin Pairing
To ensure the ASUS ROG Strix RX VEGA64 
O8G 8GB OC Edition has enough juice, two 
8-pin power connectors are put together at the 
front for easy access. Of course, it is optimised 
to run at 300W under full load just so it won’t 
burn out the power supply via overloading.

Performance Innovator
The concept of High-Bandwidth Memory 
(HBM) isn’t new as AMD dabbled with 
it years ago, specifically with the AMD 
Radeon R9 Fury X. For the AMD Radeon 
RX VEGA64, AMD packs in the latest of 
its efforts – the HBM 2, specifically the 
8GB graphics memory variant – to deliver 
better performance on all fronts, especially 
with 4K processing and heavily immersive 
virtual reality content.
Having HBM 2, when paired with a 
number of advanced features that both 
AMD an ASUS worked on to make the 
ASUS ROG Strix VEGA64 O8G 8GB OC 
Edition, makes this next-gen GPU entry a 
powerhouse in its own right. This is the 
primary reason its cooling capabilities are 
made to be top-spec from the get-go.
Max Ports
This being a flagship, ASUS ROG made sure 
the ASUS ROG Strix O8G 8GB OC Edition has a full 
load-out of I/O ports. This includes two DisplayPorts 
1.4 along with a pair of HDMI 2.0 jacks. For legacy 
sake, there is also one Dual-Link DVI.
Made for Games
In terms of performance, please keep in 
mind that I did not work with such a top-line 
GPU for a long time. Professionally, it is as 
per the expectations on paper – meaning, 
it lives to all the hype. Personally, it is 
a pure mind-blowing experience, even 
when I knew this would be a full-swing 
home-run. What the ASUS ROG Strix RX 
VEGA64 O8G 8GB OC Edition produced 
is absolutely jaw-dropping.
I paired up this powerhouse GPU 
with the best CPU on hand, the Intel 6th 
Generation 6700K with all the necessary 
overclocking that could be mustered out of 
it. It’s a bottle-neck that limits this review 
to some degree, but it’ll have to do. Even 
so, the games that I fired up, like Grand 
Theft Auto V (GTAV), Battlefield 1 and 
Rainbow Six Siege, did nothing to slow 
down this mix-mash review rig. This is 
done at max settings and with a 2560 
x 1080 monitor attached. 
Even GTAV, known for being a 
punishing game for GPUs when run at 
the highest settings, didn’t run down this 
next-gen graphics card at all and never 
managed to make the video output dip 
below 60fps. Not even once.
Best so Far
With what it has done with this take on the 
AMD Radeon RX VEGA64, it is very clear 
that ASUS ROG is not one to be content 
with what it has done so far. Moreso 
with the Strix range. Besides being a 
true makeover, this next-gen graphics is 
truly something to behold.
It’s, to-date, one of the best GPUs that 
I had the pleasure to review. While it has 
a equally as huge price-tag – just shy of 
RM4,000 – it is one that is definitely worth 
spending on if funds are readily available.

Perfect Isolation
Sony WI-1000X Wireless Noise 
Cancelling In-Ear Headphones
It’s a Sony
It’s been a very long while since I had the 
chance to put together a gadget review. 
This is doubly so for a pair of premium 
headphones. The long absence would have 
some adverse influence on how this review 
would turn out surely. Thankfully, this review 
entry came from Sony so it should work out 
for me. Hang on, my last headphone review 
had been a solid pair from Sony too.
Indeed, this is the perfect way to restart 
and reinvigorate the review process for 
someone who has been out of the scene. On 
a personal level, this could be a ‘Welcome 
Back’ salute. That may be the case when I 
put on the Sony WI-1000X Wireless Noise 
Cancelling In-Ear Headphones, AKA the 
Sony WI-1000X. Upon turning it on and 
putting in the sound-test list, positive vibes 
and feelings of nostalgia immediately 
surged forward. Without any doubt, 
this is a flagship entry that is very much 
filled with Sony DNA. 
Seamless by Design
How much can Sony do to make a pair 
of in-ear headphones with a neckband 
look and feel like a premium product? 
Plenty, 
since 
the 
electronics 
giant 
took into consideration every minute 
detail it could meddle with. 
The packaging alone exudes a touch 
of class as the all-black case, once taken 
out of the box, is seamless and free of 
markings. Only the brand name – Sony – is 
printed in the centre of the top-lid. Within, 
the Sony WI-1000X is nestled on protective 
soft-foam and stored underneath are 
the basic accessories. This includes the 
soft-pouch, in-flight adaptor, 3.5mm audio 
jack, and micro-USB charging cable.
In terms of looks, it is definitely a few 
notches higher than the average neckband-
type in-ears. While most brands would use 
plastic with some metal accents thrown 
in, Sony took the road less travelled. The 
housing for the electronics and noise-
cancelling system is made of hardened 
plastic, the neckpiece is a polished 
gunmetal. Soft leather is paired to that for 
maximum comfort.
The use of lightweight materials and 
putting user comfort first are big plus points 
as I had no issue going about my day with 
the Sony WI-1000X on me. Most times, I 
even forget the in-ears are even there.
Physically Friendly
Materials are not the only aspect Sony 
thought of when it made the Sony WI-1000X. 
Even the user experience is considered as 
every aspect of the in-ears, design wise, 
has a function. User controls are placed 
on the left side of the neckband with large 
embeds to make it easy to identify by touch. 
This is where the micro-USB port is hidden 
too. Only the noise-cancelling soft-toggle is 
placed on the right side. 
Knowing how the in-ears, when left 
dangling around the neck, can get in the 
way, the Sony WI-1000X has grooves 
placed on the ends of the neckband for 
easy-storing of the cables. It’s a matter 
of tucking the wires into the slots and 
taking them out with a simple tug when 
the in-ears are needed.
Lightweight Feel
Sturdy metal and hardened 
plastic do not compromise 
how feather-light the Sony 
WI-1000 can be.
Minimalistic Design
Straightforward looks that spell 
out that this is a Sony device.

Silence is Golden
While the Sony WI-1000X is not the first 
noise-cancelling in-ears entry for the 
electronics giant, it’s the latest in its segment 
to offer more than a fair bit of functions. 
On the in-ears itself, the noise-cancelling 
is exactly like the previous Sony headset I 
tried on years ago, the Sony MDR-1000X. 
It’s the very first entry from Sony and that 
left a lasting impression on me.
With the Sony WI-1000X, there 
are two modes that can be engaged 
for 
noise-cancelling. 
Full-on, 
this 
feature knocks-out all sound that can 
filter through the ear-buds. Only the 
deepest of frequencies make it in and, 
even then, they’re suppressed to the 
point of non-existence.
The second mode – Ambient Sound – opens 
the way for external sound to filter in. This 
is to ensure I am not totally lost in the music 
and is suitable for walks and driving. It is, 
of course, not recommended to take calls if 
at all possible when driving. 
Week Long Use
The battery life for the Sony WI-1000X is 
truly impressive. With the way I have been 
using it for this review saw the battery life 
chugging for close to a week. The usage 
experience consists of occasional full-day 
of music listening mixed in with sporadic 
usage while on the road. It did better than 
what is stated on paper.
Keep in mind that the noise-cancelling 
aspect switched from full to Ambient 
Sound 
and 
back 
throughout 
the 
review. This contributes somewhat to 
how the battery performed.
Superb Sound
Using it to play music streams from 
Spotify and YouTube videos, I can boldly 
declare that the audio delivery packs a 
punch. Every nuance from instruments 
and minute vocal elements in the songs I 
tested on the Sony WI-1000X can be picked 
up and given added clarity. 
This is achieved via the 9mm 
dynamic drivers with Balanced Armature 
design and proprietary Sony audio 
innovations used within.
All-in-all, I expected studio-grade sound 
delivery and got more than what I asked 
for. The performance stepped up when the 
noise-cancelling engages, adding more 
audible depth that are usually achieved 
with proper sound-proofing.
Personally, 
this 
would 
be 
my 
go-to-headphones if I didn’t manage to get 
my hands on the dated Sony MDR-1000X or 
brand-new Sony WH-1000XM2. 
Comfortable Plugs
In-ears with a good fit that boost 
passive noise-cancelling when 
the active system is switched off
Open Yet Closed 
Rarely do in-ears use 
an open sound-stage 
though 
Sony 
says 
otherwise. Sitting inside 
are embedded mics that 
are part of the active 
noise-cancelling.

Easy like Sunday Morning 
As home users are getting more and more 
comfortable with storing their data on the 
cloud, the reality is that most of these cloud 
services means it’s not really ‘your’ cloud. 
Web services can be the target of breaches 
and hacks, which means your data could 
end up as collateral damage to these 
issues. WD’s latest personal cloud storage 
drives, the My Cloud Home, aims to fill that 
gap by offering a personal cloud solution 
for home users that is so simple to set 
up, I had mine up and running within five 
minutes. All you have to do is plug it into 
your router, load up either the My Cloud 
website, desktop or mobile app and log in. 
That’s really all there is to it. From there, it’s 
up to you on how you’d like to manage your 
file directories and folders.
Performance Anxiety
Despite having the device well within the 
confines of your home, the performance of 
the My Cloud Home does suffer a little bit 
due to the amount of backend work done by 
the device. Functionality and performance 
of the device is pretty much similar to 
what you’d expect from most cloud-based 
solutions. It’s pretty much a drag-and-drop 
affair across the board and the whole 
process is pretty smooth. The one pitfall 
I noticed was that if the My Cloud Home 
desktop app is disabled for any reason, the 
drive would fail to show up in your network. 
So in that sense, this device is really for 
those who don’t want to muck around too 
much with settings and simply just want 
to use the device for what it is, a simple 
personal cloud storage solution. 
Family Secrets 
You 
can 
create 
individual 
accounts for your friends and 
family so they can set up their 
own private space on the device.

VERDICT: 
“Sony Mobile hasn’t really changed much in the Sony Xperia XZ1 compared to its other flagships. 
Undoubtedly, it is a solid smartphone, though it’s no longer a stand-out like before.” - Satoko 
Powerhouse Specs
The Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with 
additional hardware optimisation 
promises some serious heavy-lifting.

Considerably Superior
While it may not be as speedy as other 
flagships, the Sony Xperia XZ1 is still 
considerably 
fast. 
Heavy 
graphics 
rendering is a non-issue, while multitasking 
is a breeze. Even proprietary apps run 
smoother and the device isn’t as prone to 
overheating like before.
Dull Design 
Most smartphones are moving towards 
narrower bezels or go full bezel-less, but 
this Sony Mobile Xperia entry still sports a 
huge forehead and chin. 
Even with the minor design changes that 
promises a more comfortable handheld 
experience, the basic look and feel 
hasn’t changed much. 
It’s really time for a design upgrade, 
Sony. 
Oh, 
but 
keep 
the 
stereo 
speakers – those are amazing!
Usage Innovation
Sony is sticking to its guns with the 
single lens configuration it still favours. 
While the Sony Xperia XZ1 uses a slightly 
downgraded rear-shooter – 19-Megapixels, 
instead of 23-Megapixels, it still produces 
awesome photos. Indeed, it’s all in the 
details! The super slow-mo video capture 
and 3D Mapping functions are nifty too.
Even the front is given a face-lift with 
additional enhancements being added 
onto the front shooter like better optics 
and updated filters.

If it’s all about music streaming and 
texting while on social media, it’ll 
last for a day, give or take.

ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS Scar 
Edition Gaming Laptop
Scar(e) Away the Competition
Portability Performance
While most PC gamers prefer a dedicated 
gaming machine, some crave for a system 
that is easier to take around. Think of all 
those convention-size LAN parties! It 
could also be the lack of space or needing 
it to double up as a work machine – both 
roles are well-suited for gaming laptops. 
Considering the need for portability 
years ago would mean sacrificing a lot 
of performance power. Well, no more as 
gaming laptops in this era did a great job 
of catching up with their desktop brethren. 
ASUS Republic of Gamrs (ROG) believes 
this is the case as it has been putting out a 
number of gaming laptops under its ROG 
and ROG Strix lines. One of them, the 
awesome ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS Scar 
Edition, came in to prove a point. 
Reflection in Design
The ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS comes in a 
neat package that is slightly larger than a 
typical high-end gaming GPU box. Opening 
it up immediately reveals the Aluminium 
Black chassis of this gaming laptop. The 
gleam of the metal is stark even when 
under the protective sleeve. Amazingly, 
this powerhouse has a sleek profile of 
just 2.3cm when closed. Emblazoned on 
the top-lid is a large ASUS ROG logo that 
glows a dull red once it’s fired up.
Opening the lid will reveal a nearly 
full-sized chiclet keyboard, complete with a 
somewhat squeezed numpad on the right. 
The surface features a carbon fibre like 
texture that feels smooth to the fingers. 
Packs a Punch
The ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS gaming 
laptop packs in powered innards that most 
PC Gamers could only dream of owning. 
An Intel 7th Generation Core i7 770HQ 
is used alongside an NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1070. While a little dated and using 
mid-to-high-end graphics, this configuration 
should be powerful enough to run most, if 
not all modern games on high settings.
For the display, ASUS opted for a 
15.6-inch Full HD IPS monitor, with a 
144Hz refresh rate and running on NVIDIA 
G-Sync. Paired with the NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1070 GPU ensures a buttery smooth 
gaming experience. Rightly so, the IPS 
display on the ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS 
is superbly vivid. Those who worry about 
NVIDIA G-Sync draining out the battery 
while on the go, fret not as ASUS ROG 
made sure that feature is turned off when 
the laptop is unplugged.
Perfect Cooling
Keeping cool under heavy loads has 
always been an ASUS thing. On the 
ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS, updates, like 
92% higher air pressure and 41% better 
airflow, are included, promising better 
thermal management like never before.
Seamless Action 
On high settings, the ASUS ROG 
Strix GL503VS has no difficulty 
churning out high frame-rates, 
even when the action is getting 
heavy on screen. 
Wire Free 
The dual band MIMO Intel Wireless 
adapter embedded onboard works 
as promised, taking full advantage 
of the Gigabit speeds on my 5Ghz 
Wi-Fi band. So long dropped 
packets and screen-lag!

Fuss-free Typing
Having a mechanical keyboard as a daily 
driver, I must confess how I felt sceptical 
about the chiclet keyboard on the ASUS 
ROG Strix GL503VS. Thankfully, it became 
comfortable to use after a few days of use. 
It offers decent key travel and, despite 
being chiclets, it uses bigger-than-usual 
keys, certainly a plus for me as I have 
large hands. I typed out this review in its 
entirety on it and, personally, the flow 
feels natural and I didn’t encounter any 
additional typing errors when compared to 
using my own keyboard. 
My only gripe – the squished numpad 
that take some time to get used to. 
Thankfully, the large touchpad makes up for 
it as it offers precise and smooth tracking 
as well as a solid click when pressed.
Powerhouse Gamer
I’ve been using the ASUS ROG Strix 
GL503VS as my main gaming machine for 
the past few days and it certainly lives up 
to its name. While the smaller display is a 
slight drawback, I am totally in love with 
the smooth gaming experience, especially 
with multiplayer FPS games like Battlefield 
1 and Rainbow Six Siege. 
To-date, the ASUS ROG GL503VS is 
one the best gaming laptops to enter our 
labs. Packing powerful hardware in a 
compact chassis, this is a must-get for 
those who attend multiple LAN parties or 
prefer to game-on-the-go.
Mixed Deliverables
Oddly, the ASUS ROG Strix GL503VS uses 
a hybrid storage drive. This not only causes 
slowdowns for specific tasks, it also adds 
in unnecessary heft. Other concerns that 
come to mind are the chassis tendency to be 
fingerprint magnet and how the microphone 
is placed too close to the speakers. Chatter 
from Discord can be picked up and echoed 
back, causing loads of confusion. 
Lightweight Cruiser
At around 2.5kg, it might not be the 
lightest gaming laptop in town. Even so, 
after days of carrying it around, I don’t feel 
uncomfortable lugging it around. Amazing!

The First
Illegear Fang
SPECS
8.9
VERDICT: “Reasonably priced and performs better than expected.” - Wi-Liam
PRICE: RM189
SENSOR: Pixart 3325 Gaming Optical Sensor
RESOLUTION: 800 – 10,000dpi
ACCELEARION: 50G
POLLING RATE: 1000Hz (1ms)
BUTTONS: 8, including polling switch
First Timer
When it comes to gaming mice, there’s a 
wide selection to choose from. Of course, 
there are gaming companies that create 
their own peripherals to match with their 
gaming laptops and such. Illegear is one 
such brand and the Illegear Fang is its very 
first gaming mouse.
Mean and Clean
One great aspect of the Illegear Fang is its 
clean aesthetic; it doesn’t come with any 
bells and whistles. The soft black matte UV 
coating gives the mouse a minimalist look 
and feel, while the sides come with long 
rubber strips. This gives your thumb and 
pinky fingers a good grip with the body, 
ensuring it doesn’t slip so easily.
Swiftly Silent
While the Fang can be used as your 
everyday mouse for work, it excels in 
gaming. More specifically, MOBA, FPS and 
RTS games are its forte. Having it by my 
side while going through countless games 
of Dota 2, Overwatch and PUBG is pure 
joy. Mouse precision is top-notch and the 
soft buttons produce a nice click due to the 
durable Omron switches used within.
These functions have proven the Illegear 
Fang is one of the better gaming mice I’ve 
had in a long while. As I am in a long-term 
relationship with my Razer DeathAdder, it 
became a real scandal with Illegear Fang 
and I’m proud to say it’s worth it. 
Discrete RGB
With plenty of gaming devices throwing just 
about anything with RGB lighting, it does get 
boring very quickly. Thankfully, the Illegear 
Fang is nothing like that as it plays the 
more subtle strategy with this high demand 
feature. This is achieved via a simple layer 
of lighting placed around the base of the 
mouse. The scroll wheel also features RGB 
lighting and even the tiny gaps around the 
mouse has the lighting oozing out.
Polling Switch
Those 
who 
prefer 
to 
personalise the polling rate of 
the Illegear Fang, can easily 
do so with a switch located at 
the base of the mouse. It gives 
you between three choices of 
250Hz, 500Hz and 1,000Hz. 
Casual Focus
Even if the Illegear Fang is a 
gaming peripheral through 
and true, it feels very suited 
to casual gamers due to the 
features it offers. It’s adequate, 
making it just right for most. 
Anything more and it’ll be 
overkill and I doubt that is what 
Illegear is going after.

Fit for the King of Tablets
STM Ridge Sleeve Case
Takes Some 
Getting Used To
Seeing as its made out 
of 100% polyester, the 
material of the sleeve case 
does take some getting 
used to. It is kind of rough 
with a bit of an itch after 
holding it for some time.
Simplistic Design
The design of this sleeve case 
is pretty straightforward with 
its no-nonsense design; you 
get what you pay for.
SPECS

VERDICT: “Affordable and with great inner padding, the STM Ridge Sleeve Case is a great tool to store 
devices.” - Wi-Liam
PRICE: RM99
DIMENSIONS (WXHXD): 320 x 215 x 20mm
WEIGHT: 0.22kg
CAPACITY: 2L
MATERIAL: 100% Polyester
Versatility at its Best
The STM Ridge Sleeve Case is capable of 
holding plenty of different sizes of tablets. 
The review unit we received was a 13-inch, 
so you can even fit both sizes of the Apple 
iPad Pro. There are also two other models, 
which is capable of fitting an 11-inch as 
well as a 15-inch device.
Even with the 15-inch sleeve case, it is 
capable of fitting the 15-inch MacBook as 
well as Ultrabooks. However, you will be 
tight on space after that as you won’t be 
able to fit the charger.
Added Interior Padding
To keep your device protected at all times, 
the innards of the sleeve case comes with 
an extra layer of 8mm quilted padding 
to provide extra cushion in the case of 
accidental drops or bumps. 
While we weren’t brave enough to 
put a device to the test inside the sleeve 
case, the padding does feel thick and 
secure enough to protect your tablet or 
laptop in case of a fall.
Not Much Space for 
Anything Else
There is only one extra compartment to the 
Ridge and that is located at the front of the 
case. Thankfully, this small space is perfect 
for smaller items like power banks, external 
hard drives, thumb drives and such. 
You can fit a number of items in the 
smaller compartment without eating into 
the space of the main compartment. 
Say No to Water
It’s 
water 
resistant, 
meaning you can even 
have this on you in a 
downpour and your device 
inside will still stay dry.

It’s very uncommon to see a stylish case

Elements made it work somehow with its

designs – the Element Formula – came 
to PC.com for quick review run. It’s a 
good thing there is an Apple iPhone X on 
hand to throw about.
Hardy Experience
Drop after drop along with some smashing 
thrown in and the Elements Formula did 
not sport any dint or dents. Scratches 
are visible though but it’s invisible if one 
doesn’t know what to look for.  
Smooth Surface
Rugged designs usually mean a rough 
surface that does not slip so easily. It 
also means the handholding experience is 
rough. Not so with the Element Formula 
as it sports a smooth metal surface at the 
back, surrounded with a hardened plastic 
shell. No more slippery Apple iPhone X!

but only in small doses. Generally, a good pair of headphones for anybody on the go.” - Satoko 
Secure Fit
Having a well-built chassis 
goes a long way. For the 
Plantronics 
BackBeat

305, its ear-loops are ideal 
as they sit securely on the 
ear-lobe. It’s suitable for short 
workout sessions. As a work 
companion – not so.
PRICE: RM449
WEIGHT: 14g
LISTEN/TALK TIME: Up to six hours
STANDBY TIME: Up to 10 days,

after spending 90 minutes in idle mode
Balanced Music
Sports-type in-ears seem to fall into the 
questionable category, but Plantronics 
proves that notion wrong with its newest 
sports entry, the Plantronics BackBeat 
FIT 305. Having used it for the past 
week, it’s easy to tell that these in-ears 
are very wall-balanced. 
Bass, mids, and treble – all are rendered 
clearly, promising an enjoyable experience 
for various music genres. 
Silent Advocate
This being Plantronics, passive noise 
cancelling is included by default. All in all, 
it’s done very well as the in-ears manage 
to cut out almost all outside sound. That 
earned a few thrown pens at me (Ed: 
since when?!) during the review run. It 
would’ve been perfect if not for grating 
noise that appears whenever I move my 
head or neck. The loud rustling sounds 
travel very well within the earphones. 
Pairing that with noise isolation results in 
annoying audio interference.
Truly Versatile 
What I’ve always enjoyed with Plantronics 
BackBeats is the really huge coverage 
range it offers. Unlike other Bluetooth 
headphones I’ve tested, these are the best 
when I’m walking all around the office. 
The music doesn’t drop, there is no static 
and it’s still as clear when I move to different 
rooms. Battery life is, undoubtedly, just as 
good as I managed a solid workday with 
this in-ears when they’re fully charged. 
DEEPSLEEP: Up to six months
SPEAKER DRIVERS: 6mm
FREQUENCY RESPONSE: 20Hz – 20KHz
RANGE (TEST TO FAILURE, NOT BASED-ON-SPEC): Up 
to 10m
WATER PROTECTION: IPX5, sweat-proof rated
Convenient Design
A secure clip is included to 
ensure the double-strengthened 
wires don’t move too much, 
though 
it 
won’t 
prevent 
interference caused through 
external forces. 
Seamless

It’s quick to sync with 
my smartphone and

MDEC: Grow Fast by Going Global
Start-ups need a bigger goal than just being 
profitable – they need to scale-up
hen it comes to accelerating 
businesses, 
most 
would 
consider reaching out to 
financial institutions, public sector support 
arms and private investors. Most would not 
consider engaging initiatives that are in place.
One such programme, the Malaysia 
Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) Global 
Acceleration and Innovation (GAIN), raised 
the stakes for 2018 with its first ever GAIN 
Re-connect & Networking Dinner (GRAND). 
MDEC Chairman, Tan Sri Sidek Hassan, 
recently welcomed a full house in Kuala 
Lumpur for the GRAND [GAIN Re-connect 
& Networking Dinner] event, an initiative 
designed to further encourage local 
companies to ‘grow fast and go global’.
Together with his New Year wishes, 
Sidek also shared on success stories from 2017 
and congratulated the guests, comprising 
senior executives, founders and CEOs, 160 of 
which came from 110 companies that worked 
with the GAIN platform.
MDEC CEO, Datuk Yasmin Mahmood, 
continued the conversation as she 
discussed what to expect in the coming 
year. This includes growing more young 
talent and inspiring youths to contribute to 
innovation and the growth of the nation.
Speaking of the importance of 
public-private 
collaboration, 
Yasmin 
added: “We want to create wealth for 
Malaysians, to become a net exporter 
of technology: this requires a strong 
ecosystem to foster rapid growth.”
She later joined a discussion panel 
featuring some Malaysian shakers and 
movers, Patrick Grove, Co-Founder and 
CEO Catcha Group; Joel Neoh, Co-founder 
of Groupon and Fave; CC Puan, Founder of 
Green Packets; Andrew Tiang, Founder and 
Managing Director for N2N; and Vishen 
Lakhiani, Founder and CEO, Mindvalley. 
This powerhouse discussion delved 
further into the MDEC GAIN event’s theme 
– Grow Fast and Go Global.
Among 
the 
strategic 
issues 
discussed includes wide-ranging concerns 
and 
achievements 
for 
accelerating 
growths, 
such 
as 
transforming 
mind-sets linked to business culture 
and businesses needing to transform 
their self-perceptions and take it to even 
greater heights. It is not impossible for 
Malaysian-based enterprises to take 
on the global stage and become global 
icons equal to or be better than the best 
American digital giants. 
Some companies did just that and 
are currently mentors to up-and-coming 
start-ups and scale-ups.
Datuk 
Yasmin 
agreed 
and 
commented: “Our KPIs are about helping 
to build your success. MDEC, through the 
GAIN programme and other initiatives, will 
continue to grow and work as a beacon 
this year to guide and support the digital 
transformation of the economy and light 
pathways to global expansion.”

now 
gaining 
traction, 
the 
Ministry of Youth and 
Sports (KBS) has partnered with 
Microsoft Malaysia to enhance its 
Institusi Latihan Kemahiran Belia dan 
Sukan (ILKBS) technical institutes.
Called the Digital ILKBS, it 
is designed to prepare Malaysian 
talents for Industry 4.0, ensuring 
they become future-ready. 
With this collaboration, Microsoft 
technology and learning tools will be 
introduced in eight institutes under 
KBS, specifically to students enrolled 
in 
the 
mechanical 
manufacturing 
course. The selected schools are 
IKTBN Sepang, IKTBN Dusun Tua, 
IKTBN Bukit Mertajam, IKTBN Pagoh, 
IKTBN Temerloh, IKTBN Chembong, 
IKBN Jitra and IKBN Miri. 
All the learning modules are taken 
from Microsoft Imagine Academy (MIA), 
an e-learning system that helps teach 
students how to efficiently use a variety of 
Microsoft products and other technology 
tools. While ILKBS institutes are the first 
vocational training facilities to adopt 
this, MIA has already been incorporated 
into the curriculum of over 52 educational 
institutions across Malaysia.
Digital ILKBS will roll out in 
phases, from now until 2020, and will 
provide access to all tracks under 
MIA. This includes Data Science 
Pathway, Computer Science Pathway, 
Cloud 
Fundamentals, 
Mobility 
& 
Devices Fundamentals and Security 
Fundamentals 
subjects. 
All 
these 
modules will be introduced during the 
first phase from February 2018 onwards.
Beginning July 2018, the second 
phase will see technical training 
delivered through Live Sessions, online 
materials and using 3D tools. Phase 
three, which kicks-off in 2019, will 
see the application of Industry 4.0 
through the Smart Factory module. This 
specifically covers CNC Machining, 
Smart Machine Control and Online 
Monitoring & Supervision.
K Raman, Managing Director of 
Microsoft Malaysia shares: “This is a 
landmark event for the education sector 
in Malaysia as it will be the very first 
time that vocational training institutions 
are geared to utilise MIA. This newly 
incorporated curriculum will empower 
students to achieve even greater heights 
than ever before, nurturing them with 
the skillsets to compete globally.”
This move is in line with the 
Transformasi Nasional 2050 Youth 
Engagement Initiative and an important 
step for promoting Technical and 
Vocational Education and Training in 
Malaysia. The goal is to ensure over 
10,000 students benefit from the 
initiative over the next three years.

Glueck Technologies Leverages AI to Ensure Happiness for Customers 
THE DATA ON 
HAPPINESS

here are difference in 
valuation for primetime 
TV ads and front page ads, 
but there aren’t the same 
kind of analytics available for out of home 
advertisements.”
That is the initial gap in the market 
that Alberrt Alexander, Founder and CEO 
of home-grown Glueck Technologies, 
identified. Founded in 2014, Glueck 
(pronounced as Gluu-ck) means happiness 
in German, exactly the emotion that 
the company aims to achieve for all its 
customers and clientele.
Glueck specialises in intelligent video 
analytics, a system that leverages artificial 
intelligence (AI), computer vision and 
machine learning capabilities to analyse 
human emotions as well as objects. 
Having first explored the advertising 
industry, Glueck’s system relies on rule 
engines to run facial analytics that push 
targeted ads in real-time based on a 
person’s age, gender and emotions.
Tough market to crack
While it sounds good on paper, in 
practice, the market is tough to break. “The 
technology is already developed. That’s 
the easy part. The tough part is getting 
into the market and gaining people’s 
acceptance,” Alexander points out. 
In the early days, the advertising 
industry has been a lucrative business 
with no concrete numbers to back it up. 
“They’ve been selling the rate cards 
four times the value. Our system is able 
to count the number of people looking at 
the screen, and for how long,” he shares. 
“The advertising industry didn’t want 
to adopt this technology because they 
might lose business.” 
Eventually, clients started asking 
for the numbers to be backed, and Glueck 
started gaining good ground. Despite the 
initial hurdle, Glueck has found success 
in several other industries, with the retail 
industry warming to their systems quickly. 
“Feedback is more obvious in 
retail-related 
industries 
compared 
to the advertising industry, because 
it is more apparent in customer 
satisfaction,” explains Alexander. 
Partners in processing power
Glueck created a system that detects 
gender, emotions, age and attention 
span in real-time by collecting data via 
cameras. The data is then processed and 
sent to a hosted cloud for analysis. 
Processing 
up 
to 
15 
frames-per-second 
(FPS), 
Glueck’s 
system is what the industry considers 
as high performance computing, relying 
heavily on chip maker NVIDIA’s graphic 
processing units (GPUs). GPUs were only 
introduced into the market in 2012; while 
other companies were still relying on 
CPUs (central processing units), Glueck 
quickly saw the potential of GPUs, thus 
leveraging its speed and power. 
Currently, Glueck’s system runs on 
a 16-core CPU, along with a GPU card 
with 3,840 cores. As reference, the latest 
available consumer GPU comes with up to 
32-cores, made for video processing, gaming 
and professional workstations. This kind of 
processing power does not come cheap.
While it may have been a pricey 
investment at first, Glueck soon forged a 
strong partnership with NVIDIA. Initially 
working together as inception partners, 
Glueck has recently been inducted into 
NVIDIA’s global partner program – the 
only Malaysian company to achieve this 
feat, and one of 16 companies worldwide. 
Beyond NVIDIA, Glueck also has 
strong partnerships with Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise, Tech Data and Gigabyte.
Beyond advertising
While Glueck currently focuses 
only in advertising and retail, Alexander 
reveals that they are looking to expand the 
capabilities and explore the potential of 
implementing the systems for different use 
cases.  He gave us examples of other use 
cases that could possibly save human lives. 
“We had discussions, but we 
didn’t really pursue it. With two 
neuro- recognition scientists on the team, 
we were looking at picking up signs of 
people who are depressed,” he envisages.
“Using cameras to pick up the 
visuals, then alerting relevant services and 
caregivers. There are many people who 
need help but don’t know how to reach out.”
Alexander 
also 
elaborates 
on 
another project which looks at pain index, 
i.e. measuring pain intensity. According to 
him, these are the things they can train 
on the neural networks. Despite his best 
efforts, he knows there are limits to what 
he could explore at the moment.
“These are very expensive hobbies,” 
he quips. “We’re not big like Microsoft, 
but NVIDIA is very supportive of us.” 
Moving toward Industry 4.0
Alexander further observes that 
many people are talking about industry 
4.0, but not many people know what 
industry 4.0 entails.  
In this regard, he opines that 
Malaysia is still quite far behind in 
terms of mindset and implementation. 
He sees better results in neighbouring 
countries including Singapore, Indonesia, 
Thailand and Vietnam. 
While AI and analytics can be 
implemented in every industry, no country 
is able to specialise in every industry. 
Alexander suggests that the Malaysian 
government should have a clearer focus in 
approaching Industry 4.0.
“For example, Singapore has a very 
clear idea of what they want to do for 
the next 10 years, with a specific focus. 
We don’t see the same thing here,” he 
assesses. “They are looking at everything, 
but they are not focused on one area. They 
must have in mind a clear vision and they 
have to engage with the relevant industry.”
To Alexander, Malaysia needs a clear 
strategy as to which direction the country is 
heading. While technology can be applied 
anywhere, at the end of the day, there is a 
dire need for more nurturing spirit. 
“The government should evaluate 
companies that not only take the 
technology to the next level, but also be 
able to give back to society,” he urges.

recent 
Bitcoin 
frenzy 
has stirred the attention 
of 
Malaysian 
regulators 
and industry players. As is, many 
organisations, especially those from 
the financial and services industry (FSI), 
have since raised their concerns on 
crypto-currency security and demanded 
for stricter regulations to prevent 
criminals from abusing the system. 
As digital currencies are quickly 
becoming the norm, it calls for all relevant 
players to put their heads together and 
ensure the stability and integrity of this 
new financial system. 
In fact, acting fast is necessary and 
important as there are now an increasing 
number of cyber-thieves working their 
way into the system. They are using 
crypto-miners to make money through 
malicious methods such as infecting 
websites with malicious software.
Crypto-miners = Malware
Crypto-mining is a process used to 
discover Bitcoin, Monero and other such 
crypto-currencies like Ethereum and 
Litecoin. It requires massive amounts of 
computer processing power - a constant 
demand on resources that slow down 
performance and leaves wear and tear.
This has not always been a 
problem because the activity is largely 
limited to those who chose to do it. That 
began to change as crypto-currency 
prices skyrocketed over the last six 
months. A single Bitcoin had a net 
worth of US$1,000 at the start of 2017 
and received a valuation of around 
US$17,000 by year’s end.
Legitimate and proper crypto-mining 
programs ask users for permission to run; 
malicious versions do not. The latter 
instead opts to quietly leech a computer’s 
resources. SophosLabs is seeing more of 
this virulent variety and it now comes 
with a new twist:
Instead of showing up as executable 
files, they take the form of scripts hidden 
on websites, mining for crypto-currency 
in the browser. Visitors to these sites see 
no evidence of the mining. The only clues 
that something may be amiss are their 
computer slowing down as the CPU and 
GPU cooling fans rev up.
A clear example of this is 
Coinhive, a Monero miner that first 
appeared in mid-September 2017. 
The number of sites hiding it has 
steadily increased in recent weeks, as 
crypto-currency values have taken a wild 
trajectory skyward. For instance, recent 
visitors to a Buenos Aires Starbucks 
experienced a 10-second delay as they 
connect to the coffee shop’s ‘free’ Wi-Fi. 
At that very second, their laptops’ power 
secretly went to mining crypto-coins.

Crypto-mining Takes 
a Sinister Turn
Security regulators are now mindful to the virtual FSI frenzy
By Sumit Bansal, Managing Director of ASEAN and Korea, Sophos

FEB 2018
Given their parasitic nature, Sophos 
decided to start tagging Coinhive and other 
JavaScript-based crypto-miners as malware 
that must be blocked when users stumble 
upon a site harbouring them.
More studies reveal how Coinhive is 
also working on mobile devices and only over 
short periods will users notice the device’s 
temperature increasing dramatically.
Coinhive Rises with Crypto-currency 
Value
As 
crypto-currency 
rates 
soar 
in 
the last half of 2017 and thereafter, 
SophosLabs also noticed a steady rise in 
sites using malicious Coinhive scripts.
Here’s what the rise of Coinhive 
looks like compared to rising Bitcoin 
(BTC) and Monero (XMR) values:
Coinhive markets itself as an alternative 
source of revenue to advertisements. 
Infamous torrent sites, like The Pirate 
Bay, are among those to have used its 
code and neglected to tell visitors it used 
their browsers to mine crypto-currency. 
The site embedded Coinhive JavaScript 
code on search pages to mine for Monero.
What to do
To remain protected against JavaScript 
cryptominers hosted on a website, 
such as Coinhive, please follow these 
steps when there are suspicions of a 
crypto-mining rat.
1. Watch the CPU. Check Activity 
Monitor for Mac or Task Manager in 
Windows. If your laptop has fans, you 
might hear them revving up to deal 
with the extra heat generated when 
the CPU is heavily-loaded.
2. Consider 
a 
plug-in 
to 
control 
JavaScript. NoScript is a popular 
free tool that lets you keep control 
over intrusive JavaScript, Flash and 
Java in your browser.
3. Find out if your anti-virus detects 
coinmining tools. Consider products 
that classify browser-based coinminers 
as potentially unwanted applications 
(PUAs). PUAs are not malware – it can 
be blocked or allowed as you choose.
4. Patch promptly. Hackers who can break 
into your servers will add crypto-mining 
codes to leech ‘free money’ from all 
your website visitors, leaving you to 
bear the brunt of any complaints.

By Jason Bissell, Senior Vice President and General Manager, APAC
oogle has been using machine 
learning (ML) to improve its 
business analytics for years. 
Judging from all the recent excitement 
about this technology, it’s easy to assume 
businesses everywhere would follow suit. 
Yet, the reality is somewhat 
different. According to some studies, 
22% of surveyed companies are using 
ML’s analytical power. This is done via 
implementing algorithms in their data 
management platforms. 
So why aren’t more organisations 
taking advantage of the science that can 
make them ‘Google smart’?
It’s probably because they believe 
it’s too complicated. They might think 
their data is too voluminous or unreliable, 
require additional preparation or resources 
that are intensive and even assume only 
data scientists have the skill sets needed 
to leverage on ML. While those concerns 
may have held true a few years ago, all 
those objections can now be dealt with.
The Renaissance of ML
In the past, using ML algorithms is known 
to be complex and the outcomes could be 
perplexing and unpredictable. As is, it’s 
difficult to understand how the technology 
classifies data, so nobody is never sure 
what type of results they might get. 
However, 
the 
rapid 
adoptions 
of the Cloud and its new tools have 
combined to help simplify ML and 
make it more accessible to a broader 
base of IT professionals. 
G
You just need some learning – machine learning that is
Your Company can be 
Google Smart Too

97
FEB 2018
Let’s take a quick look at how some 
of these tools help.
ML is data driven, meaning you 
need a lot of data to make it work. For 
actionable acts – like deploying it for uses, 
such as personalising real-time customer 
experiences – you also need to process 
the data in real time. Furthermore, ML 
requires a LOT of computational power, 
especially when it focuses on learning. 
Fortunately, the Cloud is ideally 
suited for such requirements and can even 
play an integral role in simplifying the use 
of ML and making the technology more 
affordable and manageable. Additionally, 
there are now various commercial 
tools that lower the barrier of entry 
for ML while still providing support for 
respective Cloud frameworks. 
Some examples include:
• Providing pre-packaged math and 
statistics ‘routines’, like boilerplate 
coding, that only statisticians could 
prepare previously
• Assist in preparing or featuring data 
that operate with numerical values 
and are able to convert strings into 
numbers, schemes or assigned ranges
• Help training and validating models, a 
process that previously requires deep 
knowledge in methodology and math
The Many Machine Learning 
Advantages 
Of course, while ML has considerable 
raw power that can be used more easily 
for data insights, most are not yet at 
the point where they can simply plug in 
data and get instant results. Raw data 
still need cleansing to weed out flaws 
and exceptions, because trained ML still 
can’t recognise them. 
While ML is still being trained, the 
most effective method for deployment 
is to combine it with human expertise 
that can recognise data issues and 
exceptions that machines can’t. This 
approach ensures businesses will take 
full advantage of ML unique ability to 
become smarter over time.
In fact, to gain a true competitive edge 
with ML, it’s essential to put some control 
into the hands of business users – the 
people who really know the data and 
can bring their human insights to bear. In 
doing so, companies can quickly push their 
analytics forward. Once they begin the 
process of making the ML smarter, they’ll 
start to experience exponential gains. 
Operational Insights 
Once the complexities are stripped away 
and companies deploy more resources 
to train this technology, a broader base 
of business and IT professionals can 
leverage it to analyse larger and more 
varied data volumes. Businesses can also 
easily employ ML for operational insights 
to uncover patterns that humans can’t find 
and look at countless data variables. 
Massive data libraries can be more 
easily deployed to explore operational 
analytics, such as: 
• Which products are likely to be bought 
together? (Collaborative filtering)
• Will an event happen in the future? 
(Classification) 
• How much, what will be the number 
of…? (Regression) 
• Who 
are 
my 
gold 
customers? 
(Clustering) 
• What will be the price of this stock in a 
month? (Gradient boosted tree) 
• Is fraud occurring? (Decision tree) 
• Is that image a known intruder? 
(supervised learning)
Proper Governance
Of course, it goes without saying that 
ML is only as good as the data you feed 
it, so those using it need to create a solid 
data governance plan. While it is capable 
of automating good decisions, it can also 
dramatically increase the negative impact 
of bad decisions when it uses inaccurate 
data. In fact, data can also be intentionally 
used to infer alternative facts. 
Establishing guard-rails against these 
potentially negative impacts is a must, 
particularly in the light of growing data 
privacy concerns within the US and abroad. 
For example, General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR), an impending EU 
regulation intended to strengthen and 
unify data protection for individuals, is 
established for the right of explanation. 
Under GDPR, a European citizen has the 
right to ask for an explanation regarding 
the output from an algorithm that’s been 
employed to make an automated decision 
or act, such as being refused a loan or 
being disqualifiedas a job candidature.
Not Far Off
Thanks to advances in technology, 
infrastructure frameworks and the rise 
in Cloud adoption, companies no longer 
need to rely exclusively on data scientists. 
They just need the right tools to become 
truly ‘Google smart’.

One of the original contributors for the first issue of photography magazine,

FISHEYE WONDER
THE BASICS OF USING A FISHEYE LENS
BY TEPPEI KOHNO
99
FEB 2018

PIXELS
PIXELS
isheye lenses are specialised 
equipment that are characterised 
via its ability to capture an 
overwhelmingly 
wider 
range 
than 
wide-angle types. They can capture photos 
with a 180° range, allowing you to achieve 
photos with a greatly distorted periphery. 
In this article, we learn about the 
two types of fisheye lens effects and how 
your camera sensor size and focal length 
affect your fisheye image.
There are two types of fisheye 
effects that can be obtained using fisheye 
lenses: circular fisheye and diagonal 
fisheye. The type of fisheye effect that 
you want to achieve fully depends on 
your camera sensor size. For example: 
the Canon EF8-15mm f/4L Fisheye USM 
lens – a basic fisheye zoom lens – supports 
both full-frame and APS-C size sensors.
Circular Fisheye VS Diagonal Fisheye
The circular fisheye effect gives a 
180° angle of view across the whole 
periphery (horizontally, vertically, and 
diagonally) with a barrel-like distortion. 
Vignetting occurs in the corners of the 
image frame, resulting in a ‘tunnel 
vision’ effect where the scene seems to 
be contained within a round circle.
You can get a circular fisheye 
effect at a focal length of around 8mm 
when using a fisheye lens on a full-frame 
camera. However, on an APS-C camera, 
you will not be able to obtain a distinctive 
circular fisheye effect even if you shoot 
at 8mm because your actual 35mm film 
equivalent focal length would be 13mm.
On the other hand, a diagonal 
fisheye effect captures a roughly 180° 
diagonal angle-of-view and a greatly 
distorted view of the image periphery. 
It is obtained at a focal length of around 
15mm on a full-frame camera and 
10mm on an APS-C camera. This effect 
is also known as a ‘full-frame fisheye’ 
effect due to the resulting image that 
covers the entire frame.

Full-frame camera + 8mm = Circular fisheye
This shot had been taken on a full-frame camera with a fisheye lens at 8mm, looking up 
toward the centre of the group of skyscrapers. When using this circular fisheye effect, 
some vignetting will appear in the periphery of the image, making the scenery feel as if 
it is contained within the circle.

FEB 2018

Full-frame camera + 15mm = Diagonal fisheye
This picture had been captured with a full-frame camera at 15mm on a fisheye lens. The 
trees in the periphery of the image are greatly distorted towards the top centre, making 
them look particularly strong and robust. To further exaggerate the distortion and make 
the image look more surreal, place your subject at the edge of the frame.
EOS 5D Mark III; EF18-55mm 
f/4L Fisheye USM; 8mm; 
Aperture-priority AE 1/100 
sec, f/7.1, EV-1.0; ISO 800
APS-C camera + 10mm = Diagonal fisheye
When paired with an APS-C camera, the fisheye lens – at 
10mm – created a diagonal fisheye effect with a high 
degree of distortion. The photographer went as close 
as he could to the water’s edge and the result is an 
image that highlights the spherical nature of this Earth.
Distortion: How are fisheye lenses and wide-angle 
lenses different?
Generally, the shorter the focal length, the more 
susceptible the lens is to distortion at the image 
peripheries. However, wide-angle lenses are designed 
to suppress distortion by using a special corrective lens 
element, such as an aspherical lens element.
In contrast, fisheye lenses do not suppress 
distortion that occurs in the peripheries. You 
can take advantage of this to create images 
with highly exaggerated distortion.

Fisheye lens at 10mm: High degree of distortion
This is taken using an APS-C camera at 10mm (16mm 
equivalent) on a fisheye lens, resulting in diagonal distortion. 
The water’s edge appears greatly distorted due to the fisheye 
effect and this is very apparent when you compare it against 
the horizon in the centre of the image.
EOS 750D; EF18-55mm f/4L Fisheye USM; 
10mm (16mm equivalent); Aperture-priority 
AE 1/320 sec, f/13, EV+1.0; ISO 100

equivalent); Aperture-priority AE 
1/250 sec, f/13, EV+1.0; ISO 100
Wide-angle lens at 10mm: Almost no distortion
As for this image, it is snapped with an APS-C camera at 10mm 
(16mm equivalent) on a wide-angle lens. This had been taken using 
the same focal length as the fisheye lens example. The wide-angle 
lens corrects distortion so the depiction of the water’s edge remains 
as a straight line, aligned with the horizon in the image. 
When you compare this with the fisheye lens image, you can 
see that the wide-angle lens captures a narrower range and gives a 
more exaggerated sense of perspective.

o long, 2017! To celebrate the start of 2018 with a bang, 
let’s look at the long list of upcoming and potentially 
awesome games that will be out for PC and consoles. 
From anime fighting games to long-awaited sequels, 
they’re all listed here for your reading pleasure! 
We’ll break it down into quarters so that it’s easier for us 
to refer to. As for games that don’t have anything more than a 
‘2018’ stamp on it, we’ll just take a guess on which season it’ll 
most likely be out on.
To-date, this 2018 Games List is as comprehensive as it can get.

DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ  
It’s got a silly name, even by Dragon Ball standards. Still, this 2D 
fighting game takes all the visual cues from the most influential 
shonen manga out there and is sure to turn heads with its frenetic 
3 VS 3 gameplay, colourful cast and gorgeous 2.5D cel-shaded 
graphics. It came out on January 26 2018.
TUNIC  
It’s a Zelda-inspired adventure game, featuring pixelated blocky 
polygons, an isometric camera view, real-time exploration, loads 
of puzzle solving, and a fox as the main hero. What’s not to love? 
Releases sometime in 2018.
LOST SPHEAR  
The spiritual sequel to I Am Setsuna, this Tokyo Factory-developed 
RPG has hit all the old-school RPGing notes: turn-based combat with 
team-up attacks, short-but-sweet game that goes straight to the 
point and charming top-down aesthetics. It has been on shelves 
since January 23 2018.
JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH
GOD OF WAR  
The next action-adventure game 
in the God of War series focuses 
on a wiser and older Kratos going 
through a Norse-influenced world and 
teaching his son, Atreus, the ropes. 
The game will be drastically different 
and re-worked this time around: 
no multiplayer, no morality choices 
and no QTE sex mini-games. Sony 
Interactive Entertainment reveals it’ll 
be out in a few months, give or take.
CRACKDOWN 3  
The original open-world super-powered protagonist action game 
that paved the way for titles like inFamous and Prototype will be 
making a huge comeback. Let’s hope the multitude of delays is 
truly worth the wait. Out Spring 2018.
YAKUZA 6: THE SONG OF LIFE  
The next instalment in the Yakuza series 
focuses on an older Kiryu Kazuma as 
he finds out what’s going on since his 
incarceration. Expect gripping drama, lots of 
fisticuffs and a ton of unnecessary-but-fun 
mini-games and karaoke sessions. Oh, 
there’s also selfie-taking urges and Beat 
Takeshi for some reason. Hitting you in the 
face this March 20 2018.

MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD  
As Capcom’s real deal money-maker, Monster Hunter will 
continue its awesome relationship with home consoles for now 
and is looking pretty and meaty, gameplay-wise. This entry might 
be the friendliest of all for newcomers, though that remains to be 
seen and play-tested. 
Players are already gearing up for the next monster hunt 
since January 26 2018.
BATTLETECH (2018)  
Battletech creator, Jordan Weisman, is leading a crack-team to 
create a turn-based strategy game of the same name – like all 
those years ago. Being a proper throwback, this game will feature 
a tonne of mechs from the franchise. It’s been a while since we’ve 
played a new Front Mission-style game, eh? Re-visiting 31st 
Century combat never felt this exciting for the longest time!
While there is no definite date, BattleMechs will come online 
with weapon systems going hot sometime 2018.
KIRBY STAR ALLIES  
It’s been ages since we’ve had a mothership Kirby title. This 
one features 4-player platforming and co-op action; should 
be fun on the party-savvy Switch. Party time starts for the 
pink mascot come Spring 2018.
NI NO KUNI II: REVENANT KINGDOM 
Ni no Kuni has a proper sequel and, so far, it looks glorious. 
We’re not sure how the story will be like, since there is no 
person from Earth entering this awesome fantasy world or 
on a quest to learn a huge moral lesson. Still, with Ghibli 
character designer, Yoshiyuke Momose, and music composer, 
Joe Hisaishi, back for Part 2, the game’s aesthetics will be the 
main highlight in this Level-5 designed RPG. The magic will ignite 
once more on March 23 2018.
FAR CRY 5  
The sixth Far Cry game – 
indeed, we’re counting Blood 
Dragon too – is set in rural 
Montana where a giant church 
group is toting guns and 
weapons of mass destruction. 
You must sort them out with 
just as much firepower too. 
The bonus: you have the option 
of co-op and an AI-controlled 
dog at your side. 
The wild outdoor tour 
starts from March 27 2018.
A WAY OUT  
From the guys who did Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons comes this 
co-op required affair about two convicts doing a prison break 
and are on a lam. It is a split-screen game that focus on deep 
emotional elements and full concentration from the two players. 
Also, the director of this game is a rather outspoken individual 
who really wants to see this indie title come to light. Passion 
is real here. Breaking out will commence on March 23 2018.

FE  
A pretty indie game from EA and its partner developer, Zoink. An 
action-adventure, it features a fox-like creature that explores the 
forest setting it is in. Players can climb, glide, and dig their way 
through the dark Nordic forest as they visit, learn, and encounter 
the living, breathing ecosystem within and uncover its secrets. 
Side-quests and mystical creatures are part of the experience 
too. Personally, it might be this year’s Journey or Ico. 
Indie-made in the purest sense, this adventure is set to 
appear on February 16 2018.
APRIL, MAY, JUNE
FIST OF THE NORTH STAR/ HOKUTO GA GOTOKU  
The Sega team that developed the Yakuza games is also taking 
the helm for this action-adventure. It will be based off the hit 
80s post-apocalyptic anime/manga, featuring a badass named 
Kenshiro and his exploits in Eden. Much like the Yakuza games, 
there’ll also be loads of ass-kicking and mini-games aplenty. 
The original machine-gun puncher will hit PS4s on March 4 
2018 with an English version appearing a few months after.
VALKYRIA CHRONICLES 4  
The turn-based pseudo-World War II steampunk series 
is going back to its roots following the left turn Valkyria 
Revolution took last year. You control Squad E, led by captain 
Claude Wallace, as you pull off Operation Northern Cross 
to end the Second Europan War. The squad will be waylaid 
during its mission due to harsh weather conditions and bad 
snowfall. This new element of uncertainty will add some 
interesting gameplay mechanics. If anything, it will challenge 
and/or help players before, during, and after battles.
Operation go time for this game is March 21 2018 (JP) 
and sometime 2018 for worldwide release.
DARKSIDERS 3  
Yes, we need more action-adventure Legend of Zelda clones with 
edgy 90s aesthetics, please! The next Darksiders game features 
Fury, sister to War and Death, as she is tasked with taking down the 
Seven Deadly Sins using her magic and her sword whip. This next 
chapter in the Darksiders series will start sometime in 2018.
METAL GEAR SURVIVE  
This action game will be the first new 
Metal Gear title to not feature Hideo 
Kojima following the messy divorce that 
happened in 2015. This co-op survival 
shooter takes place in an alternate reality 
where Big Boss’ military group from Metal 
Gear Solid V fight against crystallised 
zombie things in an unknown wasteland.
Bullets are set to fly from February 
20 2018 onwards for the US, and the 
following two days for Japan and Europe 
respectively.

SPIDER-MAN  
As the world knows, Insomniac is going to take that awesome 
Sunset Overdrive game engine of theirs and make a Spider-Man 
game out of it. Going by the recent trailers, it will have its own 
in-line-with-the-comics continuity and a tonne of swinging-and-
parkour-and-web-slinging action. 
We’re guessing it’ll be out in the second half of 2018. Let’s 
hope the Parker luck is NOT with us on this.
DREAMS  
Media Molecule, the folks behind the LittleBigPlanet series, are 
coming back with their own brand of user-generated content 
spiel in this new adventure game. Instead of Sackboy, this 
time players follow an imp that must solves puzzles, traverse 
ephemeral landscapes, and come across and befriends various 
characters.
The game’s real kicker will be its community-created levels. 
Hopefully no phallic-shaped ones this round.
This new open world that encourage pure creativity will start-
up within 2018.

OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER (AND THE REST)
MECHWARRIOR 5: MERCENARIES  
The team behind Mechwarrior Online will be creating a brand new 
single-player campaign for the BattleTech universe. It will features 
up-to four-player in co-op mode and will provide loads upon loads of 
BattleMechs from the beloved eras of this long-running franchise.
All of this just to give Mechwarriors one more chance to saddle up 
and blaze their way into the glory of 31st Century combat.
2018 is certainly the era for fans to live up to the catchphrase: No 
Guts, No Galaxy!
METRO: EXODUS  
Well, let’s start with this one first. Basically, this is the sequel to 
Metro: Last Light. The heroes from the last game leave Moscow 
to explore new, and possibly dangerous, territories to expand and 
continue surviving.
Exploration time is unconfirmed but it’s certain it’ll in this 
late-half of 2018.
MEGA MAN 11  
Now here’s a lovely surprise: a new Mega Man 2D platformer 
from Capcom is being released. It will feature 2.5D graphics and 
gameplay, just like the last few Mega Man X entries, a slew of 
new Robot Masters, and game design work from long-time Mega 
Man developers, Koji Oda and Kazuhiro Tsuchiya. Hopefully, it 
won’t make you cry like an anime fan on prom night.
Most expectations are high that Mega Man 11, Rockman 11

ANTHEM  
EA and Bioware are attempting an action-adventure shooter with 
RPG and loot-hoarding mechanics set in a far future. Obviously, it 
will be on alien world(s). Only in this instance, they’re using the 
power armour hook. Personally, it’ll more than likely come out at 
the tail-end of the year with the other AAA blockbuster games 
that are set to come out then. Will it be a big deal? Well, let’s see!
KINGDOM HEARTS III  
Yeah, we’re confident that this long-awaited action RPG, 
featuring the Magical Kingdom and Square Enix’s universe, will 
finally appear this year. With brand-new worlds and universes 
like Big Hero 6, Tangled, more Toy Story, and Monsters Inc, this 
Disney and Square Enix mash-up is sure to please fans who have 
been waiting since god-knows-how-long. Key-blades will have 
meaning again in Q4 2018.
ONE PIECE: WORLD SEEKER  
The pirate-filled story of One Piece will finally have its first 
open-world action adventure game, with Luffy being the main 
character. Should be fun for the fans out there since they get to 
visit the towns and meet the colourful folks that populate the 
manga and anime.
End-2018 feels more awesome already with the chance 
to properly interact with the Straw Hat Pirates will be a true 
experience of awe and wonder.
THE LAST OF US PART 2  
Set five years after the original 
storyline, this game will play from the 
perspective of the first game’s heroine, 
Ellie. Naturally, we don’t know much 
about the game’s plot but we can expect 
the same stealth-based gameplay along 
with an equal amount of violent action 
sections from the first game.
There is no fixed date yet but many 
are guessing it’ll be by the year-end.
YOSHI  
Yoshi’s Wooly World for the Wii U had been an adorable and 
deceptively tough platformer; pity no one really paid any 
attention to that console. Hopefully, with the Nintendo Switch’s 
success worldwide, at least outside of Southeast Asian regions, 
this sequel will get the love and adoration it deserves.
While long awaited, 2018 is more than appropriate for Yoshi 
to shine!
MY HERO ACADEMIA: ONE JUSTICE  
As if Naruto fighting games aren’t enough, 
now the world will see the launch of a 
game based on the hit superhero manga/
anime series about a boy trying to make it 
big in a superhero school without powers 
of his own. This has all the power beat’em 
up aspects the show of the same name is 
known for and then some. 
It’ll be pretty awesome to close off 
2018 with some DETROIT SMASH!

SKULL AND BONES  
Well, the Ubisoft Singapore team HAD to do something with that 
awesome naval combat engine from Assassin’s Creed IV: Black 
Flag and Assassin’s Creed: Origins, right? Point is, any new IP 
dealing with pirates and swashbuckling is very much welcomed 
in our books. Open sea gunfights and clashing of swords any day 
over dreary adventuring. 
This may be a turning point for Ubisoft Singapore if this game 
does well. 
Skull and Bones Set sails for the high-seas in late 2018.
SOULCALIBUR VI  
The tale of souls, eternally retold, is now storied again to make 
amends for the fifth game. Bandai Namco is taking another stab 
(or slice, heh) at its 3D swords-filled fighting game franchise by 
going back to the past; Mitsurugi and Sophitia in that end-of-year 
trailer did look like their Soul Edge counterparts, don’t you think?
Also, while they’re at it, here’s to hoping they can bring back 
the awesome Chronicles of the Sword single-player mode from 
past titles too! It’ll certainly be a hack and slash fest for 2018!
TRAVIS STRIKES AGAIN: NO MORE HEROES  
Welcome back, Travis Touchdown. We’ve missed you. The beam 
katana action-adventure meta-narrative game is back for the 
third time. If that trailer last year is of any indication, we’re in for 
an insane ride once more into the mind of its creator, Suda 51.
Even if there is no release date yet, fans and eager gamers 
will be able to go back into action with Travis this year.
LEFT ALIVE  
This Square Enix shooter features art and concepts from 
renowned Metal Gear artist, Yoji Shinkawa. Apart from a lot of 
shooting, players can explore a new sci-fi world and even pilot 
mechs. That’s pretty much all we know so far.
Details will likely show up in the coming months and will do 
away with the ‘In 2018’ placeholder.
PROJECT OCTOPATH TRAVELER  
The folks who did the Bravely Default series is turning heads 
with this new RPG. Featuring 2D sprites with a stylised 3D 
perspective and eight protagonists with their own stories and 
gameplay mechanics, this one is for the RPG fans who yearn for 
an experience akin to the SaGa games.
The adventuring will begin for these eight in 2018…
sometime.

ith Dissidia Final Fantasy 
NT launching on January 
30 2018, Square Enix 
deemed it appropriate to hold a media 
gathering as a precursor to the game’s 
debut. It is here that the game developer 
shared on some interesting local details 
for Singapore and Malaysia.
Game Producers, Hazama Ichiro, 
along with Director, Kujiraoka Takeo, 
reveals some in-depth details about the 
game in conjunction with the launch of 
the Final Fantasy Cafe in Singapore. 
Featuring 28 initial characters, Dissidia 
Final Fantasy NT (Dissidia FF NT) 
will feature both heroes and villains 
as playable characters in a three vs 
three group battle. Made exclusively 
for the Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4), 
players can choose to play as any of 
the characters, all of whom are split

Available for play online for three vs

the offline mode, Dissidia FF NT will feature 
characters and stages previously seen in 
various Final Fantasy (FF) franchises. This 
will range from the original FF right up to 
FF XV. Indeed, that means Noctis Lucis 
Caelum is on the roster.
Teams can also perform summons

fights alongside your three-man team. 
The game will also feature music from 
the original games, as well as newer 
arrangements that takes its inspiration 
from the original FF franchise.
Beyond the battle arena, the 
gameplay will also include cut-scenes 
that can be unlocked through different 
fight stages. These plot devices add to the 
storyline of the Dissidia universe. There are 
also boss fights that force players, along 
with two AI-controlled teammates, to do 
battle with summoned bosses. Beating 
them will unlock more nodes in the game.
Although starting with an initial list 
of 28 characters, Hazama and Kujiraoka 
confirms that there will be DLCs released 
with more characters and content added. 
Kujiraoka has hinted that the release 
includes characters from later FF releases 
that has not debuted in Dissidia yet.
In conjunction with the launch, 
Square Enix also confirms that Final 
Fantasy XIV Online for pre-orders are 
now open in Singapore, with the release 
date set for 27th February. Of course, 
that means a dedicated server will be 
operating on the island nation.

his isn’t Razer’s first CES 
rodeo and it will certainly not 
be its last. Last year, Razer 
introduced Project Ariana and Project 
Valerie, with the latter being stolen 
just days later. That didn’t put Razer 
down as it came back to Las Vegas this 
year with Project Linda.
While Project Linda explores this 
not-so-new concept, it still isn’t that sort 
of everyday run-of-the-mill gaming laptop. 
This is even if it has the same aesthetics 
of previous Razer Blades. The Razer Phone 
plays a pivotal role here as it primarily 
powers the laptop. 
Just place the Razer Phone in 
the docking bay, which is parked on 
the bottom-half of Project Linda’s 
shell, and the laptop will power up 
and essentially mirror the content 
of the flagship smartphone. 
Of course, it’ll be pushed onto a 
bigger screen and provide the necessary 
user interfaces of a laptop like physical 
keyboard, USB ports and trackpad.
This hybrid concept reaffirms how 
Razer is no stranger in causing huge waves 
of attention to come its way, especially during 
CES. As the Razer Phone houses a Qualcomm 
Snapdragon 835 SoC with 8GB of RAM, 
Project Linda will offer top performance as 
soon as the smart device juices up the dock.
Aside from being the main source 
of content for the laptop, the Razer Phone 
also acts as a touchpad as well as a 
second screen. Users can also engage 
other apps on the Razer Phone while it is 
still docked in the Project Linda shell.
Specs wise, Project Linda carries a 
13.3-inch Quad HD touch-display, full-size 
keyboard with Razer Chroma and 200GB 
of internal storage. The cooler aspect – it 
can also act as a charger for the Razer 
Phone when both are docked together. 
As for I/O, Project Linda features one 
USB-A port, a USB-C charging slot 
and a 3.5mm audio jack. There is 
also a 720p webcam and dual-array 
microphones that amps the video calling 
experience of the Razer Phone. 
With Project Ariana, Valerie and 
even Christine still in their concept 
phases, it may take some time before 
Project Linda ever reaches storefronts. 
Of course, this hasn’t stopped Razer 
from 
unleashing 
great 
products 
time and time again.

esides Project Linda, Razer – in 
typical Razer fashion at CES 2018 
– takes current gaming tech to 
the next level once more. For its next-gen 
gaming mice range, Razer introduces the 
newly developed Razer HyperFlux Wireless 
Power Technology. Two new peripherals 
will sport this new feature – the new 
battery-free Razer Mamba HyperFlux and 
the Razer Firefly HyperFlux RGB mousepad.
Using a magnetic field, the Razer 
HyperFlux Wireless Power Technology 
directly transfers power to its companion 
mouse. This truly eliminates the need 
for a battery within the mouse, though 
it maintains the traditional heft. 
Specs 
wise, 
beyond 
being 
equipped with the new HyperFlux 
technology, 
the 
Razer 
Mamba 
HyperFlux is just like the original. 
Critical features included on this 
next-gen wireless entry are the Razer 
Adaptive Frequency Technology (AFT) 
that promises better signal strength 
on the 2.4GHz frequency band; a 5G 
optical sensor that offers DPI settings 
of up to 16,000; and has up to nine 
programmable Hyperesponse buttons.
Like other Razer gaming mice, 
this new Razer Mamba Hyperflux uses 
Razer Mechanical Mouse Switches 
and tactile scroll wheel. Unfortunately, 
like its predecessor, it doesn’t have an 
ambidextrous design, meaning it’s only 
for right-handed gamers.
As for the Razer Firefly HyperFlux 
RGB – well, it’s an RGB mousepad. 
Of course, this is nothing new. Razer 
HyperFlux, this next-gen mousepad pair 
Razer Chroma lighting with the dual-
type hard and cloth matte surfaces.
Both the Razer Mamba HyperFlux 
and Firefly HyperFlux RGB are slated to 
be released in Q1 2018 on both the Razer 
online marketplace and in selected 
retail partners around the world. The 
two, coming as a set, will be priced at 
US$249.99 (approx. RM1,000).

s gaming became a huge 
staple for CES, MSI has been 
keeping in-line. For CES 2018, 
it introduced tonnes of new products and 
innovations to its current line-up. Among 
them are a gaming monitor, a gaming 
motherboard, a GPU, a new gaming 
laptop, and even a new gaming desktop.
Here’s 
the 
extensive 
recap 
of MSI goodies that showed up:
MSI Optix MPG Curved Monitors
Let’s start with the new entries 
into the MSI Optix MPG range.
Both 
new 
monitors, 
by 
all 
accounts, are more of an expansion 
for the MSI Optix MPG Curved Gaming 
Monitor line-up. While the two rock 
a 27-inch curved VA panel with 180R 
curvature and 144Hz refresh rate, the 
panel type used is the key difference 
here. The MSI Optix MPG27C houses 
a 1080p display, while the MSI Optix 
MPG27CQ carries a 1440p WQHD.
These MSI Optix MPG pair will also 
be the first gaming monitors to come with 
SteelSeries GameSense hardware built-in. 
As for RGB lighting, it is included not 
just for the back but also the front. This 
comes in handy as the five RGB zones can 
be programmed through the SteelSeries 
engine, enabling more intimate controls 
of enhanced features like display in-game 
timers and skill cooldowns.
Both monitors also come with VESA 
mounting capabilities and an adjustable 
stand, making it even easier to decide 
on how it should be installed. There is 
also a healthy dose of ports, like a pair 
of HDMIs (2.0), one DisplayPort (1.2), a 
USB 3.0 Type B, two USB 3.0 Type As, 
and an audio combo jack.
MSI GAMING Z370 GODLIKE GAMING 
Motherboard
With the latest Intel 8th Generation 
processor already available for purchase, 
MSI introduces its next-gen MSI GAMING 
Z370 GODLIKE GAMING motherboard 
as the CPU’s perfect companion. The 
Z370 support triple Turbo M.2 with M.2 
Shield V2, Turbo U2 with Steel Armor and 
features an Xtreme Audio digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) with Nahimic 2.
With the Steel Armor, the MSI Z370 
is capable of housing up to four DDR4 
RAM slots and provide physical and static

protection to the DDR4 modules. Whether 
it’s Team Red or Green, MSI GAMING 
is ready for both as this motherboard 
supports multiple GPUs through NVIDIA 
SLI or AMD CrossFire.
MSI GAMING GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 
Lightning Z GPU
Graphics are a core element in 
a customised rig and MSI GAMING 
truly understands this notion with the 
introduction of its latest MSI GAMING 
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Lightning Z GPU. 
Obviously, 
it 
comes 
with 
extreme 
overclocking capabilities. 
The thermal design of this massive 
GPU features Tri-Frozr cooling, using the 
award-winning TORX 2.0 fans with double 
ball-bearings. Beyond thermals, the MSI 
GAMING GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Lightning 
Z also utilises close quarters heat pipe 
cooling – an infusion of both Close Quarters 
Heatsinks and Hardened Backplate for 
optimum thermal performance.
MSI GAMING GT75VR Titan Pro
While this is more like an upgrade 
instead of a new gaming laptop on its 
own, the MSI GAMING GT75VR Titan 
Pro is one of MSI’s most popular entries 
to-date. The latest iteration comes with an 
all-new Killer Wireless-AC 1550. Dubbed 
as the world’s fastest 2×2 11ac wireless 
networking adapter and developed in 
partnership with Intel, it can deliver up to 
1.73Gbps of throughput.
Another feature that will also be 
introduced to MSI GAMING powered 
gaming laptops is its new innovative 
Gaming Mode software. This gives users 
better overall performance, interactive 
backlighting and in-game optimisations.
MSI GAMING Trident 3 Arctic and 
Infinite X
While many believe that building 
your own gaming rig is much better than 
purchasing it pre-made, MSI has managed 
to make its gaming rigs stand out from 
the crowd. One, in particular, is the MSI 
GAMING Trident 3 Arctic, a platform that 
appeared in March 2017. This time round, it 
comes with the latest Intel 8th Generation 
Core processor alongside the NVIDIA 
GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. Of course, the 
main selling point of the Trident 3 Arctic is 
its smaller than usual footprint, making it 
perfect for gamers with space restraints.
The other rig MSI GAMING is the 
MSI GAMING Infinite X. While it adopts 
a more traditional tower design as 
compared to the Trident 3, it does carry 
some unique features of its own, like the 
MSI Silent Storm Cooling 3 Pro liquid 
cooling. The MSI GAMING Infinite X also 
gives users the choice between dual steel 
or tempered glass side panels. The latter 
is specially made to provide an awesome 
inside look to all the inner workings of 
this gaming rig. It also sports MSI Mystic 
Light RGB LEDs for some much-needed 
lighting visuals because…well, RGB.
Specs wise, the MSI GAMING 
Infinite X houses the latest Intel 
8th Generation Core processor with 
an MSI optimised GPU.

ASUS ROG pushes design and performance boundaries for new entries
n tried-and-tested fashion, ASUS 
Republic of Gamers (ASUS ROG) 
shows-off its latest gamer products 
at CES 2018, including a new 
concept for the ASUS ROG Strix family. 
Also present as part of the all-new ASUS 
ROG Strix range are the ASUS ROG Strix 
SKT T1 Hero Edition laptop and Strix 
GL12 desktop platforms. A host of ASUS 
ROG gaming peripherals, all focused on 
elevating gameplay, are also on show.
Let’s dive directly into the new 
ASUS ROG Strix flaghip – the ASUS ROG 
Strix SK T1 Hero Edition.
This collaboration, from the get-go, 
proves that both are very serious in pairing 
up. On the cover of this limited-edition 
entry are both SK Telecom T1 and ASUS 
ROG logos. Similarly, the right-hand 
palm-rest of the laptop features the 
signature of SK telecom T1’s mid-laner, 
Faker, a famous eSports name that is, 
arguably, one of the world’s best League 
of Legends player.
Specs wise, it comes with the latest 
Intel Core i7 processor, NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1060 GPU, 15.6-inch IPS display panel 
with 120Hz refresh rate, and 100% sRGB 
colour gamut. Of course, a RGB-backlit 
keyboard with N-key rollover technology is 
a must-have. Each key offers a 20-million 
keystroke lifespan to keep up with the 
rigorous demands that eSports is known for.
Next up is the ASUS ROG Strix GL12. 
While many may prefer building their own 
gaming desktop, this ASUS ROG Strix stuffs 
in an overclocked Intel 8th Generation Core 
i7 Hexa-Core that can be over-clocked up to 
4.8GHz. It also packs in an NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1080 GPU, expansion bay that operates 
as an ‘eSports-ready’ easy-swap SSD tray; 
water cooling; and ASUS Aura Sync.
Sadly, at press time, there is no 
available information on when these 
gaming PCs and laptops will be available 
in the market. No details on global or 
Malaysia’s release.

ne of the big announcements 
from CES 2018 comes from 
NVIDIA as it introduces its 
sensibly crazy BFDG 4K HDR Monitor 
technology. This a true testament to insanely 
large gaming displays and is the world’s 
first attempt to specifically aims at gamers.
While you may be thinking the 
abbreviation stands for something else, 
it is the shortform for for ‘Big Format 
Gaming Display’. NVIDIA and its other 
partners – ASUS, HP and Acer – will be 
building their own iterations.
Standing at 65-inches, the NVIDIA 
BFGD 4K HDR Monitor concept is the size 
of your modern-day TV. This is something 
most will take some getting used to. All 
NVIDIA BFGD 4K HDR monitor units will 
also feature NVIDIA G-Sync technology, 
promising to eradicate screen tearing 
and stuttering to obliteration. This works 
through Variable Refresh Rate Technology, 
a feature that synchronises the display’s 
refresh and frame-rates. The result is 
ultra-low latency while making your games 
and videos seamlessly smooth.
Other advanced features include 
native support for 120Hz refresh rate. 
It’s much lower as compared to many 
other gaming monitors that feature 
either 144Hz as the standard. However, 
how many other gaming monitors do 
we know stands at 65-inches?
Of course, for all this to work, the 
monitor must pair with a PC running a 
compatible NVIDIA GPU. 
NVIDIA also confirms that its 
NVIDIA BFGD 4K HDR Monitor concepts 
will support true HDR for videogames 
and other video sources. Its direct-backlit 
LED display can get up to 1,000-nits of 
brightness, ensuring your picture quality is 
bright, sharp and crystal clear. 
Interestingly, the NVIDIA BFGD 4K 
HDR Monitor will also come with the NVIDIA 
Shield. This companion system is capable 
of streaming 4K HDR content directly from 
Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming 
platforms. It will come with remote and 
game controller for the monitor as well as 
a far-field mic. The last add-on allows for 
hands-free access to Google Assistant.
No news has come out yet on the 
exact release date of NVIDIA BFGD 4K HDR 
Monitor line-up. However, word around 
puts its release around the Summer 2018 
with Acer Predator, HP Omen, and ASUS 
ROG taking a crack at it at their respective 
batting plates.

n a move that is still shocking 
after its unveiling, Evil Geniuses 
(EG) 
off-lane 
player, 
Saahil 
‘UNiVeRsE’ Arora, is officially replacing 
long-time Fnatic player, Khoo ‘Ohaiyo’ 
Chong Xin. This means that the 
Malaysian-based team will no longer 
have 
a 
Malaysian 
representative, 
with Djardel ‘DJ’ Mampusti and Abed 
‘Abed’ Yusop making up the rest of the 
Southeast Asian contingent.
This comes after a string of mixed 
results for Fnatic, with the latest being its 
elimination in the Bucharest Major SEA 
Qualifiers. Before, Fnatic qualified for ESL 
One Katowice 2018, defeating TNC Pro 
Team, the team that knocked them out of 
the Bucharest Major. This switch comes 
just in time before the roster lock period.
On the other side of the continent, 
EG has been through mixed results as 
well, crashing out to Team Secret in the 
quarterfinals of Captains Draft 4.0. One 
question that should be raised: why EG 
decided to kick UNiVeRsE, especially 
seeing as he is one of their most 
consistent performers? Another weird 
decision for EG is throwing their mid-laner 
Sumail ‘Suma1L’ Hassan into the off-lane 
while both Artour ‘Arteezy’ Babaev and 
Clinton ‘Fear’ Loomis swap between the 
carry and mid positions.
Even with TI6 runner-up, Rasmus 
‘MISERY’ Filipsen, joining the fray, it does 
seem strange that he didn’t go straight 
to the off-lane instead. For those who 
can remember, MISERY excelled in that 
position during his time at Team Secret.
What’s beneficial to Fnatic is that 
all the points UNiVeRsE has gained 
in the DotA 2 Pro Circuit with EG will 
now be translated into points for 
Fnatic. This pulls up the team to ninth 
place at 390 points, ahead of the 315 
for Natus Vincere. This means, that for 
now, Fnatic are just shy of the top 8, a 
position that guarantees them automatic 
qualification going into TI8.
