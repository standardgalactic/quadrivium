Understanding 
the Challenge:    
The Need to 
Begin
Wealth and the PADD Approach
You need to understand one thing up front: this is not a book about how to 
get rich quickly (although if you follow the advice given in these pages, you may 
very well become rich). Rather, this is a book about slowly and consistently 
becoming wealthy.
Wealthy, as defined by Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, is the state 
of “having wealth” or becoming “extremely affluent.” There is no mention of 
actual money in this definition, but most people can’t become wealthy without 
also being rich. In other words, the amount of dollars you have (either in your 
pocket or invested in financial or real assets) is equivalent to wealth. This book 
attempts to go beyond the standard definition of monetary accumulation (or 
what most people think of when they hear the word “rich”) to characterize 
wealth as a process of achievement involving not only financial independence, 
but also an emotional and psychological state of looking forward to and being 
comfortable with the future. Indeed, when we substitute the word “successful” 
1
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 1 | Understanding the Challenge:   The Need to Begin 
4
for “wealthy,” we see that what most individuals want is a successful and fulfilling 
future that involves much more than purely monetary riches!
So how do you achieve wealth? There is both a hard (monetary) and a soft 
(psychological) answer to this question, but certainly if your financial affairs 
are not in order, it complicates the summative belief that you’ve achieved a 
wealthy life. Thus, implementing a financial plan to manage the future is very 
important. If you have not assembled such a plan, or even if you have not 
thought about how best to manage the future, don’t worry—you’re not alone! 
Americans are notoriously bad planners (and notoriously good procrastina-
tors), but the important point to understand is that financial planning and 
wealth accumulation are a journey and not a destination.
You need to begin the financial planning process and then (hopefully) continue 
it as best as possible, with or without professional assistance. This book is 
designed to help you to do both—that is, as a do-it-yourself planner, as many 
individuals are inclined to be (either by conscious decision or by default of 
circumstances), or by becoming an educated consumer when seeking the help 
of a financial planner. In addition, the book introduces you to a simple way of 
thinking about the financial planning process: the PADD approach to achieving 
lifetime wealth. The steps in this approach are as follows:
• 
Protect your assets.
• 
Accumulate monetary wealth.
• 
Defend your wealth.
• 
Distribute this wealth during your lifetime for the benefit 
of yourself and your family (and for the benefit of your 
heirs after your death).
Let’s begin!
The Steps in the Financial Planning Process
As put forward in the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Financial 
Planning Practice Standards, there are six steps in the personal financial  
planning process:
1.	 Establishing and defining the relationship with the financial 
planning client
2.	 Gathering client data and determining goals and 
expectations

Plan Your Financial Future
5
3.	 Determining the client’s financial status by analyzing and 
evaluating client information
4.	 Developing and presenting the financial plan
5.	 Implementing the financial plan
6.	 Monitoring the financial plan
Although these steps are intended for the professional Certified Financial 
Planner (CFP) certificant, there are several tasks that you, as an individual 
intent on beginning the financial planning process, should also undertake.
The first task is to gather your financial and personal records. A formal, very 
detailed data-gathering form and personal financial planning questionnaire 
are included in Appendix A to help you with this undertaking. Keeping good 
personal records has one very obvious advantage: it lets you know where 
and how you are currently spending your money. In turn, these records will 
assist you in constructing a budget for your monthly income and expenses—a 
critical money-management tool for most individuals. (We talk about budgets  
shortly.) Record keeping also assists you in determining where you are  
financially today. You can’t begin the journey of personal financial planning 
without knowing your starting point.
What type of financial and personal records should you keep, and for how 
long should you keep them? In most instances, there is no single answer to 
these questions, because the type and number of records you need really 
depends on personal preference. Some of us keep everything (for as far back 
as we can imagine), whereas others try to rid ourselves of paper almost as 
soon as we receive it. However, documents like copies of insurance policies, 
brokerage account statements, mortgage statements, deeds and leases, notes 
receivable, and current statements of vested amounts in 401(k) plans or other 
company-sponsored retirement plans should be kept indefinitely. In addition, it 
is important to keep personal income tax returns for at least three years.
No single document can tell you more about your financial life than your annual 
income tax return. Think about it: this return forces you to not only disclose 
the amount of your income, but also identify the source of that income—
an extremely important part of the budgeting and financial planning process. 
Under law, you are required to keep (unless you’re committing fraud) your 
income tax return and supporting details for only three years from April 15 
of any given year. However, because of the wealth of information provided by 
the return and its importance as a guide to your financial past, you may wish 
to consider retaining it for much longer.
Once you have determined what type of financial and personal records you 
should keep, the next step is to determine where to keep them. Again, there 
is no single answer to this question, but I tell my estate planning clients (for 
more on wills and estate planning documents, see Chapter 19) to keep these 

Chapter 1 | Understanding the Challenge:   The Need to Begin 
6
documents somewhere in their home where they can easily be obtained in 
the event of an emergency. The reason that I advise them in this way is to 
encourage them to consider the disadvantages of a safe-deposit box. In addi-
tion to the often high fees charged for safe-deposit box rentals, many individu-
als make the mistake of listing only their name as a signatory for access to the 
box. In the event of an unanticipated injury or death, no other individual can 
access the important documents stored in it. You should consider instead a 
locked desk or fireproof case kept in your house or apartment for storing all 
your important records.
Another critically important task to launch you on the path toward financial 
independence is to specify in writing your long-term (more than ten years), 
medium-term (five to ten years), and short-term (one to five years) financial 
goals. Be as specific as you can with respect to these goals. For example, “to 
become wealthy” not only is hard to quantify for most people but, as men-
tioned previously, may not even mean the accumulation of actual dollars. If 
monetary wealth is important to you (as it is for most people), determine 
how many dollars you need to accumulate in order to satisfy your written 
financial goals.
Here are some of the most common financial goals mentioned to financial 
planners:
To retire early or at normal retirement age with an ade-
• 
quate level of income
To fund a child’s (or children’s) college education
• 
To buy a house or vacation home
• 
To make home improvements
• 
To take a dream vacation
• 
To reduce debt service (for example, to pay off credit 
• 
cards with an outstanding balance)
To buy a luxury car
• 
To minimize income or transfer (estate) taxes
• 
To start my own business
• 
You may add other objectives to this list, depending on your own personal 
and financial situation, but it is important to recognize that these goals should 
be quantified and monitored. In other words, you should establish a plan to 
meet these goals and then track how you are doing. As with determining an 
investor’s “time horizon,” it is important to match your goals to a specified 
time frame and categorize them according to a long-term, medium-term, or 
short-term planning period.

Plan Your Financial Future
7
What about the possibility that your goals cannot be achieved with your cur-
rent financial resources? In that event, you have one of three (or a combina-
tion of three) choices:
1.	 You can prioritize away the meeting of some financial 
goals (in other words, recognize that only some, but not 
all, of your specified financial goals are achievable in the 
specified time frame).
2.	 You can attempt to increase cash inflows (your income 
potential).
3.	 You can reduce your cash outflows (adjust your standard 
of living).
Until you have determined your financial goals and specified a time frame for 
their achievement, you likely won’t know how to begin planning, which may 
keep you from planning at all!
Determine Where You Are Now
One of the primary assumptions of the financial-planning and wealth-building 
process is that your net worth (assets minus liabilities) should experience a 
steady increase as you continue to invest. There is no benchmark percentage 
increase (or dollar amount) by which your net worth should grow annually, 
only the suggestion that you should strive for as great a percentage increase as 
possible given your current financial resources. For example, if you are in your 
peak wage-earning years (typically age 45 to 55), you should establish a goal of 
at least a 10 percent increase in your net worth annually. When we apply the 
Rule of 72 to this increase (72 divided by 10), your net worth will double in 
a period of only 7.2 years.
You should monitor and track the increase (or decrease) in your net worth 
at least once a year. (Many individuals calculate this number at year-end). How 
do you go about tracking and determining this very important number? By 
preparing the first of two personal financial statements that you should keep 
among your important financial records: the statement of personal financial posi-
tion, commonly referred to as the personal balance sheet.
An example of a statement of personal financial position is produced next. 
Before you examine it closely, there are a couple of considerations that you 
should keep in mind when preparing and interpreting such a statement:
1.	 Be sure to list all assets at their current fair market value 
without reducing them to reflect any outstanding indebted-
ness; for example, list your personal residence at the value 
you believe it will sell for in the local market without taking 
into account the mortgage balance you may currently owe.

Chapter 1 | Understanding the Challenge:   The Need to Begin 
8
2.	 Break down your assets into cash equivalents, invest-
ments, and use assets. Cash equivalents are those assets 
that you can access quickly to pay ongoing expenses (bills) 
or, in the event of a financial emergency, without fear that 
they may be worth less than when you purchased them. 
Alternatively, investments are longer-term assets (greater 
than one year in maturity or holding period) that may 
experience a fluctuation in daily value.
3.	 List liabilities at their current balance or what you owe to 
the creditor as of that given point in time.
There is no right or wrong answer when preparing your statement of finan-
cial position. Certainly, as you proceed along the path of wealth building, the 
objective is that the value of your assets will exceed the balance of your liabili-
ties (thereby increasing your net worth), but do not become too judgmental 
of yourself as you construct your first statement. The danger is that you will 
become discouraged (or even give up), which runs counter to why you are 
preparing the statement in the first place—as a tool to help you assess your 
current financial situation and what you want to see happen in the future.

When planning your estate, it is helpful to identify on the statement of personal 
financial position how each asset is titled. For example, if your primary residence 
is held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship between you and your spouse, 
place a (JT) for joint tenancy next to Primary Residence. Note, however, that 
retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs), may only be 
owned individually, even in community property states like California.
In addition to preparing a statement of personal financial position, you need to 
track your ongoing expenses and sources of income. A second reference docu-
ment, the personal cash flow statement or worksheet, should be completed at least 
once a year (better done monthly, if possible). Here are the reasons why:
The cash flow statement lets you see where you are actu-
• 
ally spending your money (it will tell you whether you are 
living within or beyond your means).
It gives you an idea of your ability to save.
• 
It pinpoints your financial strengths and weakness with 
• 
respect to your current standard of living.
It can serve as a practice document before preparing a 
• 
budget for future cash flow management (the cash flow 
statement reviews past financial performance or looks 
backward, whereas the budget looks forward).
Just as the statement of personal financial position has three general catego-
ries (cash equivalents, investments, and use assets), so does the personal cash 
flow statement. On the cash flow statement, you should separately identify 
cash inflows (sources of income), cash outflows (ongoing expenses), and any 
resulting cash surplus or cash deficit. A cash surplus or deficit is merely the 
difference between your cash inflows and cash outflows. Of course, what you 
want at the end of the year (or month) is a cash surplus, sometimes known 
as discretionary income, because that amount is available for saving. A little 
mental trick to help you save: include a fixed savings amount or percentage 
of income on the first line of the Cash Outflows column. In other words, pay 
yourself first, and treat the savings amount the same as you would any other 
fixed expense.
An ongoing issue with respect to the preparation of the cash flow statement 
is whether to show income and social security taxes as a separate expense or 
cash outflow (alternatively, you would show the after-tax amount among your 
cash inflows because your paychecks reflect this). The better practice is to list 
these taxes as a cash outflow, because (again) one of the purposes of the cash 
flow statement is to show you how you are spending your money. If you include 
a separate line item for income and social security taxes among the cash out-
flows, it forces you to account for what may be an otherwise invisible expense.
The following is an example of a properly prepared personal cash flow statement.

CASH SURPLUS (OR DEFICIT)
$___________
You may be wondering how both statements (the statement of personal finan-
cial position and the personal cash flow statement) tie together. A cash surplus 
from the cash flow statement at the end of the year (or for whatever period 
you choose to list your income and expenses) increases your net worth, as 
reflected on the statement of personal financial position. Conversely, a cash 
deficit decreases your net worth. Increasing net worth is a financial strength, 
whereas decreasing net worth (particularly if the decrease continues over a 
long period of time) is a financial weakness. In other words, if a cash deficit 
continues (you are spending more than you are earning), you need to do 
something to reverse the situation. If you don’t, your financial goal of future 
wealth accumulation is impossible.
Budgeting
For many people, putting together and sticking to a budget is one of life’s little 
burdens. Sometimes the thought of limiting their spending (and therefore their 
lifestyle) is so threatening that people refuse to even think about preparing a 
budget. I have heard it said, “What budget? I spend what I make, so that’s my 
budget!” However, living without a budget damages your long-term financial 
health. Look at a budget as an opportunity to prove your own financial self-
discipline. You could even pay yourself (and add to your savings) if you come 
in under budget each month and show that you can live within your means. 
Over time, that practice will significantly increase your net worth.
As mentioned, a budget looks forward and is a benchmark for what you plan 
to spend. It may take you a few months to get it right, but get it right you must! 

Plan Your Financial Future
13
If you are just starting to prepare (and comply with) a budget, be conservative 
in the assumptions you make. For example, an underlying assumption of any 
budget is that your current employment is secure; if it is not (if you anticipate 
a job change or layoff), you probably need to set aside even more savings 
and (hopefully) spend even less. This will help you build up an emergency or 
contingency fund—another financial planning practice that is critical to your 
long-term financial well-being.
Normally, a budget is developed in several steps. First, it is very helpful to 
have determined your financial goals and the amount of savings necessary to 
accomplish them. Next, be as realistic as you can when estimating your future 
income and forecasting your anticipated expenses for the budget period. 
Finally, a well-developed budget should be flexible enough to accommodate 
financial emergencies or one-time major expenses (hence the need for the 
emergency fund).
A sample of a very detailed budget is included in Appendix B, but take this to 
heart: a budget has value only if you intend to use it. If you do not use it, you are 
likely better off attempting to meet your short- and long-term financial goals by 
focusing on some other planning technique (say, by hoping to win the lottery).
Cash Flow and Debt Management
As a matter of financial prudence, you should maintain an emergency or  
contingency fund for unanticipated expenses. This fund should be kept in liquid 
assets (those that may be converted quickly to cash without a significant loss 
in value) and equal in amount to three to six months of expenses. (For exam-
ple, if your monthly expenses average $5,000, you should have a contingency 
fund of at least $15,000—$5,000 times 3—in a checking, savings, or money  
market account or mutual fund.) The size of this fund will vary depending 
on the nature of your employment and the constancy (or variability) of your 
income. A self-employed individual who has no employer to provide benefits 
to serve as a safety net (such as sick or personal days) should consider an 
even larger fund to compensate for lost income.
There is an investment trade-off, however, when establishing a contingency 
fund. This trade-off is a lower investment rate of return from money kept in 
more conservative cash equivalents. For this reason, you may wish to consider 
establishing an unsecured line of credit with a bank or a home equity line of 
credit to substitute as emergency fund assets. Be careful: if you do this, you must 
arrange for the credit line before the financial emergency occurs. For example, 
if you lose your job (for whatever reason), the bank is unlikely to extend you 
any credit. Plus, if you are using a credit line as your emergency fund and you 
need to access the line once you have lost your job, you will incur even more 
debt—probably the last thing you need when you are no longer employed.

Chapter 1 | Understanding the Challenge:   The Need to Begin 
14
Let’s move on to a great tragedy or success story (depending on how you 
look at it)—the amount of debt carried by the average consumer.
We read a great deal in the media about the negative savings rate of many 
Americans. Is that bad? It depends. There is both good and bad debt. Good 
debt is generally any debt incurred for the purchase of an asset that is likely 
to appreciate—for example, your home or real estate in some parts of this 
country. More specifically, good debt is any interest rate assumed on an obliga-
tion where you are paying less than what you can make, in terms of investment 
return, on the asset for which you have borrowed the money. Another exam-
ple (in a rising stock market) is the margin interest incurred on the purchase 
of an individual stock or mutual fund from which you can potentially earn a far 
greater return than what you must pay the broker to make the purchase.
Bad debt is any debt incurred on an asset that is likely to depreciate in value, 
such as a new car or automobile. Another type of bad debt is credit card 
debt, which not only carries extremely high rates of interest (18 to 21 percent 
annually, on average), but also “revolves” from month to month so that it is 
very difficult to completely satisfy the obligation. Both automobile and credit 
card debt share the income tax disadvantage that they are considered per-
sonal or consumer debt, which means that the interest paid generally is not 
deductible in reducing your annual income tax liability.
So how do you go about reducing bad debt? The obvious answer is not to 
incur it in the first place (by paying cash for a new car, for example), but often 
this is impractical. Here are some tried-and-true debt reduction techniques:
Focus on one type of bad debt to the exclusion of others. 
• 
For instance, adopt a payment schedule and amount to pay 
off on your credit card debt—and stick to it! Consider 
it another form of paying yourself: if the interest rate on 
the card is 18 percent annually, it is similar to earning  
18 percent on an investment. (That does not mean, 
however, that credit cards are a good investment.)
Consolidate or restructure your debt. The most com-
• 
mon example of this is a college or graduate student 
who consolidates several smaller loans into one larger 
loan. Although this does not eliminate the debt, it often 
reduces the total amount of debt service (interest).
Borrow from your cash-value life insurance or 401(k) 
• 
plan. The advantage of these alternatives is that you are, 
in essence, borrowing from yourself. But be careful: you 
need to repay this money in a timely manner, or you will 
reduce the amount of your life insurance coverage and 
retirement plan benefits payable in the future. If you die 
and still owe a balance on the life insurance policy loan, 

Plan Your Financial Future
15
the insurance company will only pay the policy proceeds 
less the outstanding loan balance to your named benefi-
ciary or beneficiaries. Similarly, if you leave your employer 
with an outstanding 401(k) loan balance, the company 
will likely pay only a net amount in your final paycheck or 
severance payment.
Switch to debit cards. Debit cards work much like ATM 
• 
machines, because the money comes out of your check-
ing account immediately. Although a debit card does 
not stop you from excessive spending, it does make you 
reckon with the cash-flow consequences much more 
quickly than would a traditional credit card.
Finally, it cannot be stressed enough that poor cash-flow and debt manage-
ment can put you on the path to financial ruin. Fortunately, credit counselors 
and some financial planners can assist you in reducing your debt load. If you 
think you have a problem with debt, you probably do! If you can’t solve the 
problem, the wealth-building techniques discussed in this book will take much 
longer to work for you—if they work at all.
Monitor Your Progress and Life-Cycle Planning
How often you review your financial progress depends on your age and the 
time frame you have specified to meet your financial goals. In most cases, an 
annual review is sufficient. This may be done with or without the assistance of 
a professional financial planner. (The question of whether you need a financial 
planner is addressed in the next chapter.) If you go it alone, ask yourself the 
following questions:
What life cycle or life stage are you in? Are your short- 
• 
and long-term goals representative of peers in the same 
financial planning cycle or stage? In other words, are your 
financial goals realistic?
Have these goals remained the same throughout the 
• 
review period?
Are you living at or below your means?
• 
How much money did you save during the review period?
• 
With respect to your savings, are you earning the invest-
• 
ment rates of return you need to meet your goals?
Has anything changed in your personal and financial situa-
• 
tion that may cause you to reconsider either the priority 
of the financial goals you established or the time frame in 
which you anticipate meeting them?

Chapter 1 | Understanding the Challenge:   The Need to Begin 
16
It is generally agreed that there are four financial planning life cycles. Although 
there are no hard-and-fast ages at which an individual transitions from one 
life cycle to the next, during each, certain financial goals are typically more 
important than others.
The first of these stages is the accumulation stage (between ages 25 and 45 for 
most consumers). In this stage, individuals are usually in the early-to-middle 
years of their employment career and, if married, are raising young children. 
Typically, their net worth is relatively small and their debt load may be exces-
sive, normally due to student or personal loan obligations. Their major finan-
cial goals are likely to be reducing their debt, buying a house, and beginning the 
financing of their children’s education.
The next of the financial planning life cycles is the consolidation stage (ages 45 
to 62 or other normal retirement age). In this stage, individuals are typically 
past the midpoint of their careers and are likely approaching their peak wage-
earning years. Most, if not all, of their debts have been paid off and their net 
worth is growing rapidly. Their children are in college or graduate school, 
and those expenses have also been satisfied or are in the course of payment. 
Financial goals for individuals in the consolidation stage of life are likely to 
include making home improvements, taking a dream vacation, buying a luxury 
car or vacation home, and minimizing income taxes.
The third life-cycle stage, the spending phase (ages 62 to 85), is sometimes 
combined with the fourth phase, the gifting phase. The spending phase is 
characterized by the individual’s approaching retirement or the early years of 
retirement. In this phase, their peak earning years have likely concluded and, 
from an investment perspective, the focus turns from growth to income. The 
individual’s children have likely begun their own careers and have moved from 
the family home. Financial goals for individuals in the spending stage shift to 
early retirement, retirement with adequate income, and, perhaps, the starting 
of their own business.
Finally, the fourth and final life-cycle phase, the gifting phase, is synonymous 
with an individual’s retirement years. Excess assets, if any, may be used to ben-
efit family members during life or in the event of the individual’s death. Estate 
planning becomes very important in this phase, and as such a primary financial 
goal is the minimization of transfer (estate and gift) taxes. Also characteristic 
of this phase is a very conservative investment approach and withdrawal rate, 
due to the fear of outliving the amount of retirement monies the individual 
has saved.
Now, let’s proceed to an often-asked question: Do I need a professional finan-
cial planner to help me get control of my financial life, or can I do it myself? 
The answer to this question is the focus of the next chapter.

Do You Need 
a Financial 
Planner?
A Word About Self-Help
Now that you know about the basics of the financial planning process, do you 
think you can do it yourself? Only you can answer that question, but here are 
several important factors to consider as you attempt to do so:
Financial planning is a lot like preparing your own income 
• 
tax return. As a matter of fact, income-tax planning is one 
of the subjects covered by the Certified Financial Planner 
(CFP) certification examination, so CFP certificants must 
demonstrate competence in that area. Like income-tax 
planning, financial planning is a dynamic process that 
requires the planner to stay abreast of many laws and 
regulations that may impact the planning result.
Retirement income (and other) computations require 
• 
knowledge and application of time value of money 
(present and future value) principles. Although you can 
learn how to apply these principles with the use of a finan-
cial function calculator or computer software program, a 
learning curve is still involved for the average consumer.

Chapter 2 | Do You Need a Financial Planner?

Certain financial planners, like CFPs, must comply with a 
• 
professional code of ethics that requires them to act at 
all times in your exclusive best interest. Of course, you 
will not hesitate to act at all times in your own best inter-
est, but without extensive knowledge of the economic, 
legal, and regulatory environment in which we all live and 
work, you may not be aware of what your best interest 
actually is.
Finally, like a New Year’s resolution, many individuals vow 
• 
to get their financial life in order, but due to common, 
everyday pressures, fail to actually do it. Will you be the 
exception to the rule?
Assuming you have made the decision to seek the assistance of a profes-
sional financial planner, the question becomes a matter of when you should 
seek assistance. That question, like so many others in financial planning, has 
no definitive answer, but one determining factor is the complexity of your 
financial life. Generally, the more money people make, the more complicated 
their financial life is. This is certainly true of corporate executives and self-
employed individuals. In addition, higher-net-worth individuals (such as busi-
ness owners) are more likely to recognize the need to have a financial planner 
as part of their advisory team.
Beyond all that, middle-income America is quickly appreciating the need for 
more detailed guidance with respect to their financial lives. As you will learn, 
the two biggest obstacles to a lifetime of wealth accumulation and distribution 
are inflation and taxes. Although the former is a fact of economic life that the 
average Joe (or Jane) can do very little to prevent, a professional financial plan-
ner can help to minimize the deteriorating effect of inflation on your overall 
portfolio return. The latter (income taxes) can also be managed with the 
assistance of a skilled professional.
One significant warning: seeking professional assistance does not absolve you of 
responsibility for your own financial future. It is your financial life, and the goals you 
establish are your financial goals. A financial planner can ideally direct you on 
a path to wealth (in the fullest sense of the term), but you must still make the 
necessary decisions with respect to your financial well-being.
Types of Financial Planners
You should seek a financial planner you trust and with whom you can establish 
a rapport. From a compensation standpoint, there are three types of planners 
in today’s marketplace.

Plan Your Financial Future
19
The first type of planner is paid solely by commission from the sale of financial 
products. These products include insurance (usually life insurance), mutual 
funds, stocks and bonds, and fixed and variable annuities. Typically, the com-
mission received by the planner is taken off the top of these products and, at 
least to you, is invisible. However, it does add to the cost of the product you 
are buying. Commission-only planners are prevalent at banks, broker/dealers 
(securities firms), and insurance agencies.
There is a great deal of controversy within the financial planning profession 
with respect to whether a commission-only planner can be objective. In other 
words, does the planner have an inherent conflict of interest? After all, the 
more the planner sells of a particular product, regardless of whether it is actu-
ally suitable for your needs, the more money they make. This question has 
no definitive answer (inherently, just because a planner is paid by commission 
only, that does not automatically mean the planner is not acting in your best 
interests), but it is something to consider as you decide what type of planner 
to work with.
The second type of planner is a fee-and-commission planner, sometimes 
referred to as a fee-based planner. These planners are paid in two ways. 
First, for their planning activities (an example would be the preparation of 
a statement of personal financial position), the planner charges an hourly 
or fixed fee. In addition, they receive a commission for any products you 
buy from them, such as mutual funds with a service charge or load. Some 
fee-and-commission planners offer investment advisory services based on a 
percentage of the amount of money they manage for you. This fee, known as 
a wrap fee or advisory fee in the trade, typically ranges from 1 percent to 2.5 
percent of the money managed annually. Although arguably the fee is not a 
commission, because it is paid by you to the planner and does not come off 
the top like a product sale, you will likely think of it as constituting a com-
mission all the same.
The third (and rapidly growing) type of planner is a fee-only planner. These 
planners typically do business independently and accept no commissions. 
Rather, they charge an hourly fee for financial planning advice and, usually, a 
fixed fee for developing a comprehensive financial plan. Like fee-based plan-
ners, they also charge an annual percentage fee for assets under management 
(again, 1 to 2.5 percent annually), but they do not sell securities and are not 
normally employed by or associated with a broker/dealer. As such, the fee-
only planner works only for the client. Historically, this type of planner has 
tended to work primarily with high-net-worth or higher-income clients, but 
recently these planners are reaching out to more middle-income clients.
As you will see in the list of questions to ask a financial planner provided 
later in this chapter, one of the things you want to know before engaging the 
services of a planner is how they are paid. However, more important than this 
is your level of comfort with the planner and defining the scope or range of 

Chapter 2 | Do You Need a Financial Planner?
20
services they will provide. Many a professional engagement or relationship has 
been made more difficult by not reaching a clear initial understanding of the 
respective responsibilities of the client and the planner. Remember, this is your 
financial life and future, so use the planner as an advisor and not as a substitute 
decision-maker.
The Certified Financial Planner Professional 
and Other Financial Planning Designations
Although other financial planners have distinguished themselves in today’s 
marketplace with one or more professional designations, probably the best-
known financial planning credential is the CFP certificant. Individuals who 
have achieved this credential are subject to a mandatory Code of Ethics and 
Professional Responsibility that is enforced by the Board of Professional Review, 
a subsidiary of the CFP Board of Standards responsible for awarding the CFP 
license. As a part of this code, the planner must agree to assume a fiduciary 
duty under law, meaning they must act at all times in the exclusive and best 
interest of the client. In addition, a planner who achieves this credential must 
participate in mandatory continuing education in the specified subject areas 
of financial planning, as well as complete a separate refresher course in the 
principles and rules of the ethics code. CFP planners must also have graduated 
from college, have at least three years of financial planning experience, com-
plete a formal education program covering specified financial planning topics 
(including, beginning in 2012, comprehensive case studies), and successfully 
pass a rigorous, comprehensive, ten-hour examination in these topics.
Another meaningful credential for a financial planner is the Chartered Financial 
Consultant (ChFC). This designation is awarded by the American College in 
Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, to individuals who have completed an eight-course 
curriculum, some of which can substitute for the CFP educational program 
requirement. The American College was originated and first funded by the life 
insurance industry, so its education probably tends to emphasize insurance 
matters more than broad-based financial planning. However, the designation is 
well respected among financial planners generally.
A third highly recognized financial planning professional designation is one 
available only to Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and is offered by the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). A CPA who also 
holds the designation of Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) has passed a writ-
ten examination covering the personal financial planning subject matter and 
also has practical experience in the area. Currently, there are only approxi-
mately 6,000 CPAs with this designation, although personal financial planning 
is a much-sought-after service requested by clients of CPAs.

Plan Your Financial Future
21
In addition to these three broad-based financial planning credentials, there are 
a number of other specialized credentials in today’s marketplace. These other 
credentials indicate that the financial planner has completed some particular 
course of instruction and commands specialized experience, such as in retire-
ment or estate planning.
You may wish to consider including a CFP certificant or other financial plan-
ning professional among a team of financial advisors. (High-net-worth indi-
viduals and small business owners have been doing this for years.) Specifically, 
financial advising teams have traditionally consisted of a financial planner, a life 
insurance or property and casualty insurance agent, an accountant (usually a 
CPA), an estate-planning attorney, and, sometimes, a bank trust officer. Each 
fulfills the following roles:
• 
The financial planner: Typically, this individual has the broad-
est knowledge of your financial life and as such is often 
considered the quarterback of the financial advising team. 
They often prepare paperwork and financial documents 
used by other members of the team in properly advising 
you, the client. The financial planner also normally handles 
money management and investments for the client.
• 
The life insurance or property and casualty agent: Because 
separate state licenses are required to sell life insurance 
and homeowners/automobile insurance policies, you 
often need to contact two different professionals to buy 
each respective policy. The life insurance agent or bro-
ker can obtain needed life insurance protection, and the 
property/casualty agent can do the same with respect to 
protecting your important property. Sometimes insur-
ance agents have both state licenses, but not often.
• 
The accountant: Normally, the accountant performs 
income-tax-related tasks, including the preparation of 
your annual income tax return. However, this profes-
sional can also work closely with your financial planner in 
advising how best to organize and operate a small busi-
ness and when it may be most appropriate to sell assets 
(such as appreciated stock and mutual funds).
• 
The estate planning attorney: The role this professional ful-
fills as a member of the financial advising team is in their 
title. The estate planning attorney is responsible for the 
proper drafting of wills, trusts, and power-of-attorney 
documents with respect to your financial life, as well as 
certain business-planning documents if you are also a 
small business owner.

Chapter 2 | Do You Need a Financial Planner?
22
• 
The bank trust officer: This member of the financial advis-
ing team is generally only involved in the event that you 
(a) have drafted a trust with the assistance of the estate 
planning attorney/team member and (b) have elected to 
use a professional trustee to manage and distribute the 
trust assets. However, you may also be the beneficiary 
of a trust established by someone else and might interact 
with the bank trust officer in this manner.
It is possible that any of these professionals may perform several roles. For 
example, many accountants not only advise clients with respect to taxes, but 
also have broadened their services to include traditional financial planning 
advice. To provide both services, they must hold and maintain not only the 
CPA state license, but also the CFP professional credential.
Questions to Ask a Financial Planner
As you can likely appreciate by now, if you choose to work with a financial 
planner, selecting the planner is not an easy task. This is complicated by the 
fact that, unlike that for doctors and lawyers, there is no formal licensing, 
and accompanying regulation, of financial planners. Right now, anyone can call 
themselves a financial planner—even a taxicab driver in New York City! If you 
work with an unqualified advisor, your financial future may be at risk.
How do you protect yourself against this possibility? One answer is to work 
only with someone who demonstrates considerable financial services experi-
ence and expertise, such as an individual with an advanced business degree 
or a well-respected financial planning designation. However, in addition to this 
preliminary screen, you should also ask the planner or advisor certain basic 
questions, such as those listed next from the Financial Planning Association 
(FPA), the major professional association of personal financial planners. The 
FPA’s website is www.fpanet.org.
The FPA suggests that you ask the following ten questions of any prospective 
financial planner with whom you are considering working. I have added com-
mentary to each to assist you even further in deciding which planner might 
be best for you:
1.	 What experience do you have? Experience in any industry 
or profession is important, but in the rapidly changing 
world of financial services, such experience may be con-
sidered invaluable. If the planner has not spent at least 
five years advising and working with clients, you may wish 
to keep searching until you find a planner who has.
2.	 What are your qualifications? Qualifications mean educa-
tional and professional designations that you can trust with 
respect to expertise in the financial planning process.

Plan Your Financial Future
23
3.	 What services do you offer? In most instances, a financial 
planner offers investment advisory services when imple-
menting the financial plan for a client. Therefore, they 
must either have a Series 65 or Series 66 Financial Industry 
Regulatory Association (FINRA) securities license or have 
been waived from this requirement by virtue of earning 
an approved designation, such as the CFP certification. In 
addition, most planners offer additional services that may 
require separate state or federal licensing.
4.	 Can I have your engagement agreement in writing? The first 
step in the personal financial planning process for the  
professional planner is to establish and define the client-
planner relationship. As a part of this step, the planner 
should offer to define for you in writing the scope of the 
engagement, which is the universe of services that the plan-
ner and client agree is necessary and appropriate, and that 
the planner is qualified and willing to provide. A CFP certi-
ficant must define the scope of the engagement in writing. 
In mutually defining this scope, the client and planner may 
agree to only parts of the financial planning process (seg-
mented financial planning or goal-specific planning) or the 
completion of a comprehensive financial plan.
5.	 What is your approach to financial planning? This question 
usually involves a discussion of the planner’s investment 
approach (for example, does the planner adopt a more 
conservative or aggressive approach when investing a cli-
ent’s money?), but some planners adopt more of a financial 
life planning approach than others. Financial life planning is 
difficult to define but generally tries to anticipate life events 
and prepare for them at a point much earlier in time than 
does traditional financial planning. Financial life planning 
also explores more fully the psychology of money and 
attempts to complement more completely the merging of 
an individual’s financial goals with their lifestyle needs.
6.	 Will you be the only person working with me? Like any profes-
sional, the practicing financial planner usually has staff who 
work in the same office. These individuals may or may not 
have the same expertise as the planner, not to mention 
the same rapport with you. If this is a concern to you, you 
should ask the planner how much time they will personally 
spend on your particular case file. In addition, if the planner 
works as a member of a financial planning advisory team, 
you may wish to ask for the names of the other team mem-
bers and investigate their qualifications and background.

Chapter 2 | Do You Need a Financial Planner?
24
7.	 How much do you typically charge? The total amount that 
the financial planner will charge for their services depends 
on the nature and extent of those services. Nevertheless, 
the planner should be able to provide you with an hourly 
fee (if they charge in that manner) or flat fee or the per-
centage of commissions or investment assets under man-
agement that is standard for their practice.
8.	 How are you paid? As discussed, financial planners are paid 
on a commission-only, fee-and-commission, or fee-only 
basis. As a part of the written engagement letter that the 
planner should provide at the beginning of the relation-
ship, the planner should explain how they are paid. Some 
planners also provide an estimate of the total amount of 
fees or commissions that will be due.
9.	 Have you ever been publicly disciplined for any unlawful or 
unethical actions in your professional career? This is a very 
important question to ask. Although public discipline of a 
planner is a matter of record, you probably do not know 
where to find such information. If you know (or ask) what 
licenses are maintained by the planner, you can check the 
records of those particular regulatory bodies or agencies, 
but it is better to have a simple conversation with the 
planner about any past disciplinary problems. If the plan-
ner objects to this conversation, it may be because they 
have, indeed, incurred regulatory sanctions.
If the planner provides investment advice and is regis-
tered as an investment advisor with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) or the state securities com-
mission, under securities law they must provide you with 
a disclosure form entitled SEC Form ADV Part II or the 
state equivalent. If the planner is employed by a securities 
firm that is registered as an investment advisor, the firm’s 
disclosure form must be given to you.
10.	 Can anyone other than me benefit from your recommendations? 
(Stated another way: Do you have any potential or current 
conflicts of interest?) Another big question! This is perhaps 
even more important than the public discipline inquiry.
If a planner has a current conflict of interest (for example, 
if they are on the board of directors of a company whose 
stock you are considering purchasing), it should be dis-
closed to you initially—preferably, in writing. In addition,  
if during the course of the engagement a potential conflict 

Plan Your Financial Future
25
of interest arises for the planner, it should be disclosed 
to you as well. An advantage of working with a CFP cer-
tificant is that, under their applicable code of ethics, both 
current and potential conflicts of interest must be dis-
closed to you in writing. It is then your decision whether 
you wish to begin working with (or continue working 
with) the CFP certificant.
In addition to these questions, I would ask two more:
11.	 What is the typical net worth and annual income level of your 
clients? Unfortunately, many financial planners and invest-
ment advisors prefer to work with individuals who have 
already made money or accumulated assets and want to 
increase their net worth even further. If this is not you, do 
not despair. More and more planners are focusing on mid-
dle-income Americans and their need for financial security.
When searching for a financial planner, ask the candidates 
you are considering to draw you a mental picture of their 
clients with respect to income level and net worth. You 
may want to ask about the financial goals and life-cycle 
status of a typical client and compare their situation to 
yours. If there is a great disparity, or you feel conde-
scended to in some manner, you may wish to consider 
another planner.
12.	 Do you construct an investment risk profile for your clients? 
And, if so, can you explain to me in simple terms how you 
evaluate and use this profile? It is likely that among the first 
issues you will address with the planner is how to build 
your wealth through investment in real or financial assets 
or both. To properly analyze this issue, it is necessary to 
determine your tolerance for assuming investment risk 
(your risk tolerance). This is a complicated determination 
for many individuals. Many people consider themselves 
conservative investors and expect their investment advi-
sor to know what this means. Skilled financial planners 
and investment advisors know how to probe for the real 
meaning of the term conservative (and its polar opposite, 
aggressive) by providing real examples of investment situ-
ations and asking how you would react if these situations 
happened to you.
For example, consider this question: “If you had $50,000 
invested in the stock market, how much of this amount 
could you tolerate losing—and over what time period—and 

Chapter 2 | Do You Need a Financial Planner?
26
still sleep at night?” If the answer is none or a very small 
amount, you are likely a conservative investor. However, 
be aware that this answer means your investment return 
(reward for risk) is also likely to be very small. Generally, 
as we age, we become more conservative in our invest-
ment outlook, although as you will learn later, this does 
not mean you should avoid investment risk altogether. 
Indeed, there are many forms of investment risk, and just 
because you may avoid the risk of loss to the principal of 
an investment, you may instead assume the loss of future 
purchasing power due to inflation. A skilled financial plan-
ner can assist you in determining what level of investment 
risk you are comfortable with and, accordingly, how well 
you are able to sleep at night.
Since the recent severe decline in the stock market (or 
bear market, to use the most common description) 
beginning in October 2007, many investors have come 
to more properly appreciate their assumed level of risk. 
Until October 2007, many younger investors had never 
experienced a market in which a consistent decline in the 
market value of securities was the norm. As a result, some 
investors are reevaluating the allocation of their portfo-
lio and moving into financial assets that are deemed to 
be safer (defined in the investor’s mind as shorter-term 
U.S. government securities). As such, we now have the 
somewhat illogical result of investing in securities whose 
nominal or stated rate of interest is less than the accom-
panying inflation rate. In normal circumstances, this is not 
a prudent rule of investing, but such is the behavior of 
individuals who fear for the future value of their portfolio 
and the ability to satisfy their financial goals.
The next chapter addresses personal financial planning and the wealth man-
agement process. Wealth management is an extension of personal financial 
planning and focuses on high-income and high-net-worth clients. Wealth 
management also emphasizes the investment process within financial planning, 
because high-income clients typically have a larger amount of discretionary 
income than middle-income investors. This book is designed to show you 
how to reach the status of a higher-net-worth individual by increasing your 
current wealth.

Elements of  
Personal Financial 
Planning and 
the Wealth 
Management 
Process
Academic studies have shown that following a financial plan will help you build 
wealth more rapidly than is possible without one. This is because a financial 
plan enforces self-discipline, the key to any future accumulation of wealth. 
People earning between $20,000 and $100,000 per year who follow a financial 
plan typically have up to twice as much savings as those in the same income 
bracket who have no financial plan. For those earning more than $100,000 per 
year and following a financial plan, the savings rate is some 60 percent greater 
than that of their peers. Clearly, people who adhere to some form of a ­financial

plan—either in writing or informally by matching their savings practice to a 
predetermined set of financial goals—have a significant advantage. Bottom 
line: you have to convince yourself of reasons to save, or you will probably not do it. 
One of the purposes of this book is to provide you with those reasons.
Personal Financial Planning and Wealth 
Management
The concept of personal financial planning has had an interesting and somewhat 
complicated past. Although financial planning has always been about the 
process of determining whether and how individuals can meet their financial 
goals through the proper management of financial resources, planners have 
occasionally been sidetracked and focus too much on the resources component 
of the definition instead of the process component. In other words, financial 
products—such as an attractive stock or the newest insurance product—that 
are necessary to implement the planning process become predominant.
Alternatively, some financial planners prefer to think of themselves as wealth 
builders or wealth managers to differentiate themselves from the product side 
of the business and, hopefully, attract the client with a higher net income or 
net worth. There is likely no subject in the personal financial planning process 
more important than the others, but planners who think of themselves as 
primarily wealth builders tend to place a large amount of emphasis on invest-
ment selection and investment management. As a result, those planners prefer 
to work only with high-net-worth clients and specify a minimum amount of 
investable assets (usually in the high six figures or even in the low seven fig-
ures) that can immediately be put to work in the capital markets. But wealth 
managers and financial planners are really beginning at the same place: the 
client’s financial goals. It is only the amount of financial resources a client can 
bring to bear in accomplishing their goals that distinguishes a financial planner 
from a wealth builder or wealth manager.
Regardless of whether these financial professionals think of themselves more 
as wealth managers or planners, they typically provide six main services for 
their clients:
Insurance and risk management
• 
Employment benefits (often simply referred to as fringe 
• 
benefits)
Investments
• 
Income tax planning and management
• 
Planning for retirement
• 
Estate planning
•

I suggest that you use these general categories to examine and review your 
own financial life. Keep in mind that numerous issues need to be addressed 
within each of these areas. Determining your own status in each category 
may help you begin the process of record keeping. Additionally, a professional 
financial planner will orient their work around each of these areas, and some 
will demonstrate a specialty in one or more of the subjects.
Is there any importance to the order in which I have listed the general areas of 
financial planning? In terms of thinking about your financial life, there is. Your 
employment status determines whether you have any employment benefits to 
consider, but think of these benefits as nothing more than a temporary safety 
net that you can use to protect your financial well being. When you change 
jobs, these benefits may or may not be portable (they probably will not be). 
This is why it is much better to build a permanent safety net constructed from 
individual life insurance and other benefits that you purchase on your own 
and that are intended to remain with you throughout your lifetime, regardless 
of your employment status. Because both temporary and permanent benefits 
are primarily secured so as to provide protection against possible future finan-
cial loss, they should be thought of sequentially as first in the financial planning 
process.
The PADD approach to building and managing wealth places the general 
categories of personal financial planning in a real-life context that can be used 
as a blueprint to financial independence:
• 
Protect yourself against the risk of catastrophic financial 
loss.
• 
Accumulate wealth through investments.
• 
Defend that wealth through prudent income tax planning 
and management.
• 
Distribute that wealth for your retirement and as part of 
your estate at death.
First, however, because of their importance in the overall financial planning 
process as the “engine” in generating substantial wealth, we need to spend 
some time discussing investments and investment strategies. This begins with 
the need for a well-thought-out investment policy statement.
The Need for an Investment Policy Statement
Many planners refer to the investment policy statement as the third manda-
tory personal financial statement (in addition to the statement of personal 
financial position and the cash flow statement discussed in Chapter 1 of this 
book). The investment policy statement helps the investor specify realistic 
investment goals while also forcing them to consider the risks and costs of 

Chapter 3 | Elements of Personal Financial Planning and the Wealth  
  Management Process
30
investing. For example, specifying that you wish to obtain an average 15 percent  
annual rate of return on an investment in an individual stock begs the ques-
tion of whether you also expect the stock to increase in price by this same 
amount consistently every year. If so, you need to engage in a reality check! Such 
thinking ignores the risk of stock investing, because the market price of stocks 
can fluctuate dramatically from year to year. This is known as volatility, which 
you need to understand and accept as a risk prior to investing in the stock 
market.
Any well-developed investment policy statement has four basic sections. 
With allowances for the specific wording of any customized statement, these 
sections are:
1.	 Statement of the Investor’s Objectives: The formulation 
and statement of these objectives are your primary input 
to the statement and should explain your investment 
goals in terms of investment risk and return. A careful 
analysis of your risk tolerance should precede any discus-
sion of return objectives. As we have discussed, typically, 
you will not know how to adequately define your risk 
tolerance; accordingly, this is one of the benefits of using 
a financial planner, who will help assess and clearly specify 
the amount of risk you are willing to assume.
A person’s return objectives may be stated in terms 
of a percentage, but they may also be stated in words. For 
example, capital preservation means investors seek to main-
tain the purchasing power of their investment—therefore, 
the necessary return must be no less than the rate of annual 
inflation. Alternatively, capital appreciation is an appropriate 
objective when the investor wants to achieve growth of 
their investment through capital gains (a return consider-
ably more than annual inflation). A current income objective 
means the investor wants the manager to invest in dividend-
paying stocks or interest-earning bonds to generate income. 
Finally, a total return strategy implies that the investor seeks 
to increase the value of investments by taking advantage of 
both capital gains and reinvesting any current income back 
into the investment for future growth of principal.
2.	 Statement of Investment Constraints or Limitations: In 
this section of the statement, you need to specify your 
investment time horizon, or the time period in which you 
intend to invest. Concomitant to this time period is your 
need to access the money without a significant loss to

principal (also known as liquidity). Investors with longer 
investment horizons, such as an investor who is saving for 
retirement, generally require less liquidity and can thus 
tolerate more investment risk. Investors with shorter 
time horizons, such as an investor already in retirement, 
generally seek greater liquidity and less risky investments 
because losses cannot be overcome nearly as quickly.
Additional factors or limitations that you will typically wish 
to consider when developing a policy statement are the 
current and expected state of the overall economy and 
sectors of the economy in which you may be consider-
ing investing (for example, technology). The current tax  
status of any previous investments should also be taken into 
account. For example, an individual who is saving for retire-
ment and is taking advantage of the tax-deferred nature of 
an individual retirement account (IRA) may engage in more 
frequent investment transactions than someone who holds 
these investments in a taxable portfolio where capital gains 
must be recognized at the date of sale.
A final, often-included limitation covers the unique circum-
stances or preferences of the investor. Here is where you 
should state any preference to invest only in socially respon-
sible companies. Similarly, you should give some thought 
to your current or anticipated cash flow. For example, if 
one of your goals is to purchase a vacation home during  
a shorter, specified time period, you will need to invest in 
relatively liquid assets. Alternatively, if you expect to receive 
a large inheritance during the time period (thus providing 
additional money for investment), you should discuss what 
you want to do with this money.
3.	 Meeting the Investor’s Objectives and Allocation of 
Investment Resources: Although the typical investment 
policy statement does not indicate specific stocks or 
bonds the investor should purchase or sell, it should 
provide guidelines with respect to which asset classes 
to include and the relative percentages of each. In other 
words, the investment policy statement should provide 
an asset allocation strategy.

Chapter 3 | Elements of Personal Financial Planning and the Wealth  
  Management Process
32
The assets you may wish to invest in may not be the 
same as the typical investor based on your risk-tolerance 
level, desired rate of return, and investment time horizon. 
However, most investment policy statements use only 
three categories or classes of investment assets:
Stocks
• 
Bonds
• 
Cash or cash equivalents (savings accounts, short-
• 
term certificates of deposit, money market funds, and 
any asset that is relatively liquid)
Investment percentages are assigned to each class. (Note: 
Sometimes a fourth category, referred to as alternative 
investments, is also used as an asset class. These are any 
assets other than stocks, bonds, and cash, such as gold or 
silver.)
Many methods are used to allocate the investment per-
centages, including some involving computer software. 
There are also a few rules of thumb. For example, one 
commonly cited rule is that you should subtract your 
age from 100 to determine the percentage amount that 
should be devoted to stock or stock mutual fund invest-
ments. The rest should be split between bonds and cash 
or cash equivalents, with only a relatively small percentage  
allocated to cash given its lack of relative return. Here 
are four sample asset-allocation scenarios for a young, 
mid-life, pre-retiree, and retired investor of moderate 
risk tolerance:
a.	
Young investor (aged 25 to 44): 75 percent stocks;  
20 percent bonds; 5 percent cash or cash equivalents
b.	 Mid-life investor (aged 45 to 55): 60 percent stocks;  
30 percent bonds; 10 percent cash or cash equivalents
c.	 Pre-retiree investor (aged 55 to 64): 50 percent 
stocks; 35 percent bonds; 15 percent cash or cash 
equivalents
d.	 Retired investor (age 65 plus): 40 percent stocks;  
40 percent bonds; 20 percent cash or cash equivalents

Plan Your Financial Future
33
Once the asset-allocation process has been determined, 
you should consider a mix of assets that have the high-
est probability of meeting your financial goals at a level 
of risk with which you are comfortable. As you get 
closer to meeting your financial goal, you should adjust 
this asset mix. For example, if you are several years away 
from meeting your goal, safety of principal should become 
more important to you than growth of that principal; 
accordingly, you should adjust the percentage of asset 
mix toward short-term bonds and cash equivalents and 
away from stocks.
Asset  allocation generates portfolio diversification, 
which is the key to reducing your investment risk. We will 
talk more about diversification later in this chapter, but 
for now you should understand that a well-thought-out  
asset-allocation strategy is the foundation of any effective 
investment policy statement.
4.	 Monitoring the Performance of the Investment Plan: The 
drafting of a policy statement will assist you in judging  
the performance of your investment manager. Typically, 
the statement should include a model or benchmark 
portfolio against which the performance of the manager 
may be judged. For example, if you choose to invest in 
large-capitalization stocks (companies that have a large 
amount of outstanding public stock), you will likely want 
to compare the performance of the manager against the 
benchmark annual return of Standard & Poor’s Index 
of 500 stocks. Alternatively, if you choose to invest in 
smaller-capitalization stocks, a benchmark portfolio of 
similar stocks, such as the Russell 2000 Index, should 
be used. Because benchmark portfolios set an objective 
performance standard, the investment policy statement 
acts as a starting point for periodic portfolio review and 
assessment of investment manager performance.
The Basics of a Diversified Portfolio
A diversified portfolio should be diversified in two respects: between asset 
classes and within asset classes. Therefore, in addition to allocating your assets 
among stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents, you need to mix your investments 
within each of these three asset classes. The key to doing this successfully is 
to identify investments that may perform differently under different market 
conditions. For example, you should locate a stock that does not go down 

Chapter 3 | Elements of Personal Financial Planning and the Wealth  
  Management Process
34
(or does not go down much) in a declining or bear market. The search for 
a stock that behaves in this manner, also known as correlation, is not easy; in 
essence, finding such a stock is how portfolio managers earns their money. 
Investment textbooks available at public libraries can tell you how this can 
be done. A word of advice, however: leave this to the pros! If you choose to 
go about trying to select lower positively correlated or negatively correlated 
stocks on your own, you will quickly expend a lot of research time and pos-
sibly money and probably still not pick the stocks correctly.
Because achieving effective diversification is not easy, you may prefer to pur-
chase a number of mutual funds. Mutual funds are a type of professionally 
managed asset, regulated by an investment company, that pools money from 
many investors and invests in stocks, bonds, and financial assets. Such a fund 
makes it easy for the individual investor to own a small portion of a great 
number of investments. Be careful: a mutual fund investment does not neces-
sarily guarantee instant diversification. For example, the mutual fund may be 
investing only in stocks issued by companies involved in the same industry 
(called a sector fund). Thus, if you purchase a sector mutual fund, you have 
diversified between asset classes but not within asset classes. A mutual fund 
investing only in the stocks of technology companies is not participating in the 
broader market, which includes the stocks of many more types of companies 
and industries.
There are also ways to purchase mutual funds that are automatically diversi-
fied based on your age and life stage. A life-cycle fund is a diversified mutual 
fund that automatically shifts toward a more conservative mix of investments 
(more bonds, fewer stocks) as it approaches a particular year in the future, 
known as its target date. Given a considerable boost by pension plan legislation 
passed in 2006, life-cycle funds are frequently used by investors who prefer to 
hold a prepackaged number of investments to meet their financial goal—usually,  
saving for retirement. The managers of life-cycle funds make all decisions with 
respect to the asset allocation, diversification, and rebalancing of the fund. Such 
funds are easy to recognize, because they usually have a target retirement  
date (the year 2015, 2020, 2025, and so on) included in their name.
The Basics of Rebalancing
Rebalancing is a fundamental aspect of the initial asset-allocation decision and is 
necessary to bring your portfolio back to its original asset mix or percentages.  
Why is this required? Over time, some of your investments and asset classes 
will grow more quickly (or decline more) than other classes, thus deviating 
from the original percentages you specified as a part of your investment policy 
statement.

Plan Your Financial Future
35
Let’s say the stock market had a “good year” (a year in which the asset values 
of the majority of stocks increased in price). As a result, your initial stock  
allocation of 60 percent has now increased to 75 percent of your total portfolio. 
 (This also means your percentage allocations to bonds and cash equivalents 
have decreased.) You are faced with either selling off some of your stock 
investments or purchasing more investments from the bonds and cash or 
cash equivalents asset classes, assuming that you wish to remain true to the 
asset allocation you established when the investment policy statement was 
prepared. This is not a bad thing. One of the steps in the financial planning 
process that often is not done well is step 6: the monitoring part of the plan. 
Portfolio rebalancing is an automatic trigger that will assist you in the practical 
accomplishment of this step.
How often should you rebalance your portfolio? Like many other questions in 
financial planning and wealth building, this one has no definitive answer. If you 
have engaged the services of an investment advisor or professional financial 
planner, and a separate account has been established to hold your assets, the 
advisor will notify you when it is time to rebalance. Alternatively, if you are 
proceeding on your own, this decision is yours to make, although an annual 
rebalancing is likely prudent. Whatever the time frame, before you rebalance 
your portfolio, consider any transaction fees or income tax consequences that 
may result from the rebalancing.
If you have invested in a taxable account and experienced a loss on the value 
of your stocks or bonds, consider selling those assets now and using the loss 
against your income taxes. By doing so, you also avoid one of the biggest 
mistakes of the average investor: refusing to let go. Some securities will never 
return to their original value. Even if they do, think of what you could have 
made with your money in the meantime. The opportunity cost of what you 
could have done with your money—but did not—is rarely considered by the 
average investor.
Investment Strategies
The number of investment strategies that may be pursued to build your wealth 
is probably limited only by the constraints of your own imagination and secu-
rities law, but let’s talk about a few of the most common strategies.
Dollar-Cost Averaging and Share Averaging
Dollar-cost averaging is sometimes euphemistically referred to as “the poor man’s 
method of saving.” Using dollar-cost averaging, an investor purchases additional 
shares of stock in a mutual fund at regular intervals, usually in equal amounts, 
regardless of market conditions. Often, this is done through the use of an automatic  

Chapter 3 | Elements of Personal Financial Planning and the Wealth  
  Management Process
36
withdrawal plan offered by the stock issuer or mutual fund company. When 
­withdrawals are made from your paycheck in order to make 401(k) plan 
­contributions, you are essentially pursuing a dollar-cost averaging strategy.
The practical result of dollar-cost averaging is to gradually increase the number  
of mutual fund shares you own over a long period of time. In the event that the 
current price of the fund is below its previous price, you have succeeded in 
purchasing more shares of the investment. Because more shares are acquired 
when the price of the fund declines, this has the effect of reducing the average  
cost per share. Subsequently, if the price of the fund rises, you earn more 
­profits on lower-priced shares, thereby increasing your overall rate of 
­percentage return.
For example, assume that you purchased a $5,000 portion of ABC mutual fund 
in January 2012, when its share price was $20. You purchased a total of 250 
shares ($5,000 divided by $20). Now, instead, assume that you made five sepa-
rate purchases of ABC mutual fund during 2012 using this same $5,000, but you 
did so in $1,000 increments, when the price of the fund fluctuated as follows:
Month
Share Price
# of Shares Purchased
March 2012
$22.00
45.45
May 2012
$19.50
51.28
July 2012
$18.00
55.55
September 2012
$17.50
57.14
December 2012
$20.25
49.38
Total: 258.80
Further assume that you plan to sell all the separately purchased ABC shares 
in January 2014, when ABC’s per share price will be $24. Your total sale price 
will be $6,211.20 ($24 times 258.80 shares), and you will have recognized a 
gain of $1,211.20 ($6,211.20 less $5,000). What if you had sold your original 
January 2012 shares? Your gain would have been only $1,000 ($6,000 less 
$5,000). Using dollar-cost averaging, you increased your annual compounded 
rate of return by almost 2 percent (from 9.54 percent to 11.46 percent).
As the previous example illustrates, dollar-cost averaging works best when 
markets are declining or fluctuating. It does not work well when the market 
is steadily increasing; in that event, you are better off buying as many shares as 
possible, as soon as possible, when the price per share is lower. If an experi-
enced investor learns one lesson throughout their years of investing, it is that 
markets rarely go straight up or straight down. Rather, fluctuation in share  
values is the rule and not the exception. Therefore, dollar-cost averaging 
should be a valuable wealth-building strategy for you, as it has been for millions  
of other investors.

Plan Your Financial Future
37
A variation of the dollar-cost averaging technique is share averaging. When an 
investor dollar-cost averages, the amount of dollars spent on stock or mutual 
fund purchases at regular intervals is held constant, but the number of shares 
purchased with these dollars varies. Conversely, when an investor share averages, 
the number of shares purchased remains constant, but the amount of dollars 
spent to make those purchases varies. With share averaging, the investor pur-
chases a fixed number of shares, regardless of how low the price falls. Thus, they 
do not obtain the reduction in the average cost of the shares to the same extent 
as is possible with dollar-cost averaging. This is why, as a wealth-building tech-
nique, more investors implement dollar-cost averaging than share averaging.
Averaging Down
As you can see from our example involving dollar-cost averaging, an investor 
can leverage their gain by buying more shares when the price of a certain 
asset declines (as long as the price eventually goes back up before the investor 
sells). Is there a strategy that results in buying additional shares only when the 
price goes down? Yes. It is referred to as averaging down. In our example, you 
would have bought ABC shares only in May 2012, July 2012, and September 
2012, when the share price fell below the original $200 purchase price, and 
not in March 2012 and December 2012, when the price was more than $20.
Is pursuing this strategy a good idea? The answer depends on whether you 
are more interested in purchasing the stock or the company issuing the stock. 
If you are interested only in the stock, share averaging may not be a good 
strategy, because (like dollar-cost averaging) the ability to make a profit ulti-
mately depends on the share price increasing. If the share price does not 
increase, you will have purchased more shares of a stock that you likely should 
have considered selling in the first place. In other words, you will now have 
more shares of a losing stock. Alternatively, if you are purchasing the com-
pany issuing the stock, presumably you have researched the prospects of that 
company and the industry in which it does business. Accordingly, you should 
have greater confidence in the possibility for an increase in the price of that 
company’s stock, as well as reasonable assurance that a decline in price is only 
temporary. Therefore, if you are using the strategy in this manner, averaging 
down may make more sense as a long-term investment technique.
In any event, proceed carefully. Unless you are an experienced investor, averag-
ing down is an investment strategy you should not try without the help of a 
professional.
Dividend Reinvestment Programs
Unlike averaging down, which is only for experienced investors, stocks that 
offer a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) should be considered by any 

Chapter 3 | Elements of Personal Financial Planning and the Wealth  
  Management Process
38
investor. With a DRIP, dividends declared are automatically reinvested in the 
stock, adding to the investor’s overall ownership share. If you want to build an 
ownership percentage in a company, this is the way to do it.
DRIPs offer some other advantages. If the dividends are reinvested  
automatically—instead of paid directly to the shareholder—the investor 
purchases the additional shares of company stock without having to incur a 
broker’s commission. Also, because the company tracks your purchases and 
keeps records of the purchase price, it can easily provide you with cost basis 
information in the event that you want to sell.
Many mutual funds have similar programs. If you are working with an invest-
ment advisor or financial planner who has positioned your holdings in some 
form of advisory account, ask them whether you can opt to reinvest any 
capital gain or dividend distributions (or both) into the purchase of additional 
shares of the fund. If this option is available, consider taking advantage of a 
DRIP as an easy way to save and build wealth.
Laddering
You can go about laddering or staggering the maturity of fixed income invest-
ments, such as bonds or certificates of deposit, in a number of ways. The most 
popular is to figure out the longest- and shortest-term maturities you want to 
assume and then sequence your purchases between those maturity dates.
For example, if you have $50,000 to invest, and you want to invest in bonds 
with a maturity of no longer than ten years and no shorter than one year, 
consider ten purchases of bonds in $5,000 increments with a maturity date 
each year from the end of year one to the end of year ten. This has the effect 
of minimizing the impact of the price changes in the bonds due to interest-
rate fluctuations, also known as interest rate risk. In addition, as the short-
term bonds mature, their principal may subsequently be invested at potentially 
higher market interest rates.
You can adopt the same approach with respect to bank certificates of deposit 
and also obtain the advantage of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) insurance on each certificate, as long as the total ownership in each 
bank and certificate does not exceed $250,000 per depositor.
Buy and Hold
Another phrase that describes the buy-and-hold investment strategy is passive 
portfolio management. In other words, the investor does not intend to actively 
trade the stocks, bonds, or other assets in their portfolio and instead chooses 
to own those investments for a relatively long time. Buy and hold, coupled 
with dollar-cost averaging, is a common strategy for building wealth to meet 
the average investor’s saving-for-retirement financial planning goal.

Plan Your Financial Future
39
The buy-and-hold strategy has several advantages:
You can minimize your acquisition and trading costs in 
• 
the trading of securities, leading to considerable savings 
over time.
It will assist you in managing your income tax obligations. 
• 
For example, if you do not sell a security in a given year, 
you do not need to recognize a capital gain or loss on 
your income tax return.
Academic studies have shown that the most significant 
• 
gains in the securities markets are made during several 
trading days throughout the year; a buy-and-hold strategy 
ensures that you will not be out of the market during 
those days.
A warning: many individuals say they are buy-and-hold investors when, in fact, 
they are not. Most of us allow changing market conditions to influence our 
buy-and-sell trading decisions. In other words, we let short-term emotions 
get in the way of our long-term investment decisions. Mega-investor Warren 
Buffett has made his investors rich in part by not permitting emotions to dic-
tate his investment philosophy. If you are a pure-buy-and-hold investor, you will 
remain in the market for a long time with little concern for market volatility.
Market Timing
Market timing is the behavioral opposite of the buy-and-hold strategy. It is an 
attempt to predict the overall direction of the securities market and to take 
advantage of the market’s volatility, whether that general direction is up (a bull 
market) or down (a bear market).
Market timing should not be confused with the rebalancing strategy discussed 
earlier in this chapter. You should rebalance your portfolio to maintain con-
sistent asset-allocation percentages over time. However, when you rebalance, 
you are responding to rules and conditions that you have established: through 
an asset-allocation strategy, included in an investment policy statement, that 
is intended to culminate in the meeting of your financial goals. Market timing 
responds to external market circumstances—rules and conditions that have 
been established by the market—over which you have no control. In actual 
practice, portfolio rebalancing is proactive, whereas market timing is reactive.
Does market timing work? Probably not, largely for the reason mentioned 
earlier—an investor needs to stay invested in the market all year long to 
experience the greatest gains. Nevertheless, if done properly, market  timing 
can have some value. For example, as an investor, you should pay  attention 
to reports that indicate whether a large number of market timers are either

buying or selling over a period of several weeks. This may give you some 
­perspective with respect to overall market sentiment (and, accordingly, 
whether the ­market is likely to go up or down).
Value versus Growth Investing
Value and growth investing are really just different sides of the same invest-
ment coin. In this case, the investment coin is the price to earnings ratio 
(P/E ratio) of stocks.
Value investing is an investment strategy that is concerned with the market 
price of stocks: specifically, finding stocks that are currently undervalued 
by the market. Thus, investors who practice value investing attempt to find 
stocks with high dividend yields and low P/E ratios. The strategy assumes that 
the current P/E ratio of the stock is below its proper level (or what the ratio 
should be, given current market conditions) and that an efficient market will 
soon accommodate for this discrepancy and drive the price of the stock up.
Growth investing, on the other hand, focuses on the potential earnings of the 
company that is issuing the stock. As a result, growth investors look for growth 
stocks—stocks of a company that has shown a proven ability to develop prod-
ucts quickly and efficiently with a minimum of marketplace competition. Such 
stocks usually have a superior rate of earnings growth (typically 15 percent a 
year or more), low dividend payouts, and an above-average P/E ratio.
There is some practical evidence that in a bull market, a growth investing 
strategy tends to outperform a value investing approach. Conversely, in a 
declining or fluctuating market, value investing may be more appropriate. As 
an investor, you should likely consider both strategies as appropriate methods 
of building wealth.
Investing in Real Estate
Most Americans have made an investment in real estate—whether they 
realize it or not—in the form of their own home. Is your home a good 
investment? Although the answer to this question depends on many factors, 
not the least of which is the geographical location of your home, studies 
have shown that the average annual real (after inflation) return on resi-
dential real estate historically lags that of stocks and bonds. According to 
a Fidelity Research Institute report, which used data obtained from Global 
Financial Data and Winans International that predated the Great Recession 
of 2007–2009, the average annual ten-year real (after inflation) rate of return 
on residential real estate is only 1.62 percent. This compares to an average 
annual real rate of return of 5.85 percent for stocks and 3.18 percent for 
bonds over the same period.

Plan Your Financial Future
41
Despite this low rate of real return, home ownership is very important in our 
society because it allows the investor to build equity, which is the difference 
between the fair market value of their home and the amount they owes on 
it. In addition, the financial obligation of making mortgage payments may make 
the investor or homeowner a better saver than an individual who rents. The 
ability to save (or, more accurately, the exercise of financial self-discipline) is a 
very important trait for any effective wealth builder. As a result, studies show 
that the net worth of homeowners is some eight times greater on average 
than that of renters, regardless of age or income level.
In Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 of this book, when discussing the accumulation 
step in the PADD approach to wealth, we will cover in more detail investing in 
financial versus real assets. However, as noted in the Fidelity Research report, 
the average investor should be wary of over-investing in real estate. This is 
especially true when certain financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, have 
proven their superiority as wealth-building vehicles over time.
We have now covered the basics of the financial planning process. Next we 
will go into detail about the specified subject-matter areas of the process, 
beginning with the protection of your lifetime earning capacity, your family, 
and your property.

Family, and 
Your Property

Insuring Yourself 
and Your Family
This section of this book introduces the first step in the PADD approach to 
accumulating and managing wealth: protecting yourself against the risk of cata-
strophic financial loss. In this chapter, we discuss the most important form of 
risk management: insuring your life (and protecting your loved ones from the 
resulting loss of income at death) by purchasing life insurance.
Before we begin, you should keep in mind the following guiding principles with 
respect to purchasing any type of insurance:
1.	 Never risk more than you can afford to lose. In other 
words, buy only the amount of insurance required to 
ensure that you and your family will be restored to the 
before-loss status quo.
2.	 Do not buy insurance you don’t need. This is particularly 
important when considering the purchase of an annuity,  
an insurance product providing for lifetime income, but 
also including a death benefit. If you do not need the 
death benefit, think twice before purchasing the annuity, 
because there are less expensive ways to provide for a 
lifetime income stream.
Do I Need Life Insurance? How Much?
Few financial questions are likely to be more troublesome than, “Do I need 
life insurance?” This is in part because it prompts the asker to confront their 
own mortality. In addition, the need for life insurance is a philosophical issue 
4
C H A P T E R

Chapter 4 | Insuring Yourself and Your Family
46
for some individuals. For example, historically, farmers and people who make 
their living off the land and intend to pass this land down to their families do 
not believe that a financial product such as life insurance can substitute for 
something God did not create.
Let’s accept for a moment that we are all going to die some day. Once you 
have accepted your mortality, figure out what you want to have happen in the 
event of your death. Most people with spouses and children want to protect 
the financial lifestyle of their heirs. In other words, they don’t want their fami-
lies to have to suffer financially because they have lost a source of income. 
It makes sense, then, that the amount of life insurance you need is primarily 
determined by how much income needs to be replaced after your death.
As a rule of thumb, many life insurance agents say that you should purchase 
a life insurance death benefit to replace between five and seven times your 
annual gross income. For instance, if your annual gross income is $100,000, 
you should purchase between $500,000 and $700,000 of life insurance  
coverage. But, like most rules of thumb (and contrary to the financial plan-
ning process that should guide your decision), nowhere in this rule is any 
consideration given to financial goals or particular individual needs and  
family circumstances. As such, two primary methods are used by most finan-
cial planners to determine the amount of life insurance that an individual 
should purchase.
The first of these two methods is the human life value approach. This approach 
estimates the amount of income your family would need, based on the finan-
cial loss they would incur, if you were to die today, anticipating the num-
ber of possible working years that remained. This amount is then adjusted 
downward for what you would have personally consumed or paid in taxes 
(referred to as the family’s share of earnings). Utilizing a rate of return known 
as a discount rate, the present value of your life to your family is estimated. 
For example, let’s say you currently make $70,000 per year in salary and 
have approximately 20 years left in your working career. Your amount of 
personal consumption and taxes due on this income is $20,000, resulting in 
a family’s share of earnings of $50,000 ($70,000 less $20,000). By applying a 
rate of return to these earnings of 5 percent annually and using a financial func-
tion calculator or software program, we can determine a life insurance need of 
approximately $625,000.
The human life value approach focuses only on your income-earning potential 
and the income loss to your survivors resulting from your death. As such, it 
is a relative method that assumes that your life only has value as it impacts 
the financial life of your survivors. It does not consider the recurring nature 
of your dependents’ expenses or any unusual expenses that may result from 
your death, such as the future need for college education for minor children. 
Rather, these expenses are part of the alternative computation known as the 
needs approach to life insurance planning.

The needs approach to determining the optimal amount of life insurance an 
individual should purchase is very sophisticated and usually computed via a 
computer software program. Very briefly, the approach considers your mari-
tal status, whether your spouse is employed outside the home, the size of 
your family, and any separate income earned by your dependents (children or 
elderly parents). For example, an individual who is single and has no depen-
dents has little need for life insurance coverage. As a result, life insurance for 
this person may only be necessary to repay debts and expenses related to 
their death. A married person or single working parent who supports depen-
dents has a need for life insurance to continue the flow of income to these 
dependents in the event of the person’s death. The needs approach is suitable 
to determine the amount of this need.
Here are some of the typical needs of an insured person and their family in 
the event of death:
Burial or cremation expenses, including funeral costs
• 
An adjustment fund, which is a short-term fund intended 
• 
to cover one-time expenses incurred by the family as it 
adjusts to the loss of the primary (or other) wage-earner
An income continuation fund, including an amount for 
• 
mortgage payoff (if the insured’s house is not paid off)
An educational fund for the college education of minor 
• 
children
An amount to provide a lifetime income for the surviving 
• 
spouse, the need for which arises if the spouse is unem-
ployed and does not have the necessary skills to enter the 
workforce or cannot otherwise earn sufficient income to 
replace the insured’s income
As the potential insured of a single-income family, you should consider that 
even if your surviving spouse could potentially generate sufficient income 
to cover the loss of your earnings, your spouse’s entry into the workforce 
might not be preferable to purchasing additional life insurance for this need. 
In other words, do you intend to require your spouse to work? The answer 
depends on what you have agreed on with your spouse, but if you do not 
wish to have this discussion, you should purchase the necessary additional 
life insurance.
Term versus Cash Value Insurance
Many life insurance companies offer various life insurance policies. All these 
policies generally consist of only two basic methods of providing life 
insurance: term (also known as temporary life insurance) and cash value 

Chapter 4 | Insuring Yourself and Your Family
48
(also known as permanent life insurance). Term insurance protects you only 
for a specific period; if you die during this period and are current in your 
premium payments, the company will pay your family the contractual death 
benefit that is due. Cash value insurance protects you for life and also offers 
a savings component in the form of a cash value buildup. Types of term life 
insurance policies include annual renewable term, level premium term, and 
decreasing term insurance. Types of permanent life insurance policies featur-
ing a cash value buildup include traditional whole life, universal life, variable life, 
and variable universal life (VUL) coverage.
Both term and cash value life insurance can be very valuable in protecting 
yourself and your family. You should not think of either term or cash value 
insurance as an all-or-nothing proposition; many thoughtful individuals pur-
chase both forms of coverage. But generally, as you age, term insurance cov-
erage will become more expensive, whereas the cost of cash value coverage 
will remain fixed. The reason is that cash value expenses are front-loaded 
as part of the policy structure, because some of the premium expenses 
(beyond the pure mortality cost associated with any life insurance policy) 
go to build a cash reserve or cash fund that you can potentially access for 
emergency needs.
Just as in determining the amount of life insurance that may be needed, there 
are rules of thumb pertaining to whether it is best to purchase term or cash 
value insurance. One of the most common is to buy term insurance and invest 
the difference. In other words, given the fact that term is at least initially less 
expensive than cash value (the younger you are, the longer your life expectancy 
and the less the mortality costs associated with term insurance), take the savings  
and invest it in higher-yielding financial investments, such as mutual funds. 
Although the appeal of this strategy is obvious, permanent insurance advo-
cates counter that the buy-term-and-invest-the-difference concept depends 
on several flawed assumptions:
The difference will always be diligently invested every 
• 
year the insured owns term insurance, regardless of the 
insured’s personal financial circumstances or ongoing 
standard of living.
The alternative investment will always be financially  
• 
superior to the incremental cash value buildup.
Somehow the need for insurance will magically disappear 
• 
as the insured ages.
Ultimately, the final decision with respect to how to best meet your life insurance  
needs is yours. In providing for these needs, you should remember that life 
insurance should be purchased to protect yourself and your family; investments, 
on the other hand, should be purchased to accumulate wealth. Although cash 
value policies have some investment characteristics (particularly the newer 

Plan Your Financial Future
49
forms of universal and variable universal life), life insurance is first and foremost  
a risk-management product and not a product designed to generate significant  
investment growth.
Types of Term Insurance
Today, most buyers of term insurance purchase either annual renewable term 
or level premium term. Historically, decreasing term insurance has been a 
popular form of temporary protection and has been used as a mortgage-payoff  
vehicle at the insured’s death. However, decreasing term has fallen out of 
favor in recent years, primarily because it does not reduce protection at the 
same rate as the typical mortgage balance, thus resulting in an unnecessary  
premium cost to the insured. With annual renewable term, you pay the  
premium each year, and the policy remains in force. As you age, the cost to the 
insurance company increases, and the premium goes up each year. But the level 
of protection—the death benefit—afforded your family remains constant.
Level premium term insurance, on the other hand, initially costs more per 
year than annual renewable term, but the premium remains level for a fixed 
period of time (generally anywhere from 5 to 30 years). Thus, as you age, 
presuming you still want a relatively inexpensive temporary life insurance 
policy, you should probably consider replacing annual renewable term with 
level premium term. But beware: as you approach the expiration date of your 
level term policy, you should begin to set aside some additional funds for pre-
mium payments once the policy expires. Typically, depending on your age and 
the length of your original level term policy, you will experience a significant 
increase in premiums when you purchase a new term policy.
An attractive feature of some term policies is the ability to convert from term 
or temporary coverage to cash value or permanent life insurance protection  
without evidence of insurability. This means you can obtain permanent protection  
without having to pass a medical examination. Accordingly, the opportunity to 
convert is particularly valuable for insureds whose health may have declined 
during the term. As such, if your health has changed for the worse and you 
currently own a term policy, you should probably consider converting to a 
cash value policy as soon as possible, because it is unlikely that you will be able 
to qualify for permanent coverage at a later date.
Types of Cash Value Insurance
There are three basic types of cash value policies: traditional whole life, 
universal life, and variable life. A fourth type, variable universal life (VUL), 
combines the features of universal and variable policies.
Traditional whole life is the standard form of cash value insurance that has been 
offered by life insurance companies for many years. It features a fixed premium for 

Chapter 4 | Insuring Yourself and Your Family
50
the life of the policy as well as a savings component that grows on a tax-deferred 
basis. The policy is initially very expensive and, unless you continue to make pre-
mium payments, will lapse, potentially causing you to lose coverage. In addition, at 
your death, your beneficiaries will receive only the death benefit payable from the 
policy and not the accumulated cash value. If you choose to access the cash value 
or savings portion during your lifetime, you must do so through a policy loan or 
withdrawal, which in turn reduces the amount of the death benefit paid.
Next, universal life takes the concept of “buy term and invest the difference” 
in a new direction. Yes, you are able to invest the premium amounts charged 
in excess of pure term coverage and generate some additional return, but you 
must do so by investing in what the insurance company chooses for you—which  
are usually conservative, fixed-income vehicles, such as investment-grade 
bonds. Thus, the return generated by a universal life policy, although higher 
than that of a traditional whole life policy, still lags that of a variable life policy, 
where equities (common stocks) are the primary form of investment. The 
primary advantage of a universal life policy is its flexibility with respect to pre-
mium payments. That is, the policy premium is not fixed or tied to the amount 
of death benefit protection purchased, except in the first year of the policy. 
The premiums are then deposited into an accumulation fund from which the 
insurance company withdraws monthly mortality charges. A minimum pay-
ment is required to keep the policy in force only when the accumulation fund 
is close to zero. The policyholder, subject to their continued insurability, may 
increase the death benefit of a universal life policy.
The third kind of cash value insurance, variable life insurance, differs from 
traditional whole life and universal life in one primary respect: you (and not 
the insurance company) are in charge of your investment choices. Variable 
life policies allow you to invest in various combinations of stocks, bonds, and 
mutual funds and feature subaccounts in which you can allocate your assets 
(very similar to the variable annuity form of insurance). Although the premium  
payments due on a variable life policy are fixed (as in traditional whole life), 
the death benefit may increase, as can the underlying cash value accumulated 
within the policy subaccounts. The VUL policy, finally, takes this concept one 
step further by combining a choice of investments and increasing death benefit  
protection with the ability to make flexible premium payments.
Which of these cash value life insurance forms is best? It almost invariably 
depends on your comfort level with assuming investment risk. If you consider 
yourself to be a moderately aggressive or aggressive investor (remember,  
a primary advantage of working with a financial planner is that the planner helps 
you determine your risk-tolerance level), a variable life or VUL policy may be 
preferable. If you are relatively uncomfortable with assuming investment risk 
or you do not like making investment decisions, a traditional whole life or 
universal life policy may be more to your liking.
The summary in Table 4-1 of the types of term and cash value policies available

Now that we have considered the types of life insurance policies that are 
available for purchase, let’s move on to choosing an insurance company.
Insurance Company Selection and Ratings
Before purchasing any type of life insurance policy, even a term policy, find out 
the financial strength of the insurance company underwriting (or insuring) it. 
Remember, the purpose of the policy—to provide for your family members in 
the event of your death—will not be realized until some time in the (hopefully)  
distant future. As such, you want the company from whom you buy the policy 
to be in business when it comes time for the death benefit to be paid. Moreover, 
should you need to access a portion of the death benefit during your life through 
one of the popular accelerated death benefit riders available today, you 
want to ensure that the company will be there to provide it.
The primary measure that most financial planners use to assess the financial 
strength of an insurance company is to consult an independent rating service. 
There are five primary insurance company rating organizations: A.M. Best, 
Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch Ratings, and Weiss Research. Their rating letters  
are different, but all use A+ or some variation thereof to rate the highest  
companies, and several use F as the lowest rating. Table 4-2 shows the top six 
ratings from each organization, as well as the lowest ratings.

None of these ratings organizations is any more preferable than the others; 
they all provide valuable information and basically review the same data on 
each insurance company. However, it is important to understand which orga-
nization’s ratings are being cited. For example, a company rated A by A.M. Best 
means the company is of the third-highest quality, whereas the same company 

Plan Your Financial Future
53
rating provided by either Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings indicates a level  
of only the sixth-highest quality. Regardless, with the number of insurance com-
panies in business today, you should likely seek out only those of the highest  
or second-highest rating using any rating measure. Typically, companies that 
deserve those ratings are very well known and have been conducting business 
for many years.
One final point to consider: some financial planners and insurance advisors 
believe that an insurance company’s financial strength is not as important a 
consideration for those who plan to purchase a variable life or VUL cash value 
policy as it is for those who plan to purchase a traditional whole life or univer-
sal life policy. This is because the insurance company uses its general assets to 
stand behind a claim filed with respect to a traditional whole life or universal 
life policy but does not with the variable forms of life insurance. In these latter 
types of policies, the cash value accumulates in a separate subaccount that is 
not subject to the claims of the insurance company’s other general creditors. 
As such, the financial viability of the company to pay your claim on a variable 
form of life insurance policy may not be quite as critical.
Another form of insurance protection—much in need today—is that of 
health insurance. Whereas most health insurance is offered, if at all, on a 
group level basis, the primary emphasis of “Obamacare” is directed toward the 
mandatory purchase of health insurance at the individual level. By providing for 
increased competition among insurers in the form of state health insurance 
exchanges, it is hoped that the number of uninsured individuals will decline, 
thus forcing down health insurance costs. Although this remains to be seen 
(state insurance exchanges are not available until October 1, 2013 and do not 
go into effect until the year 2014), the next chapter reviews the provisions of 
Obamacare as well as indemnity and managed care options.

Insuring Your 
Health and 
Long-term Care
The issues of health insurance and health insurance coverage are controversial 
and politically charged, particularly given individual preferences about national 
health insurance versus a private-payer system. The potential necessity for 
long-term care insurance, however, is not nearly as well known or discussed. 
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, individuals 
reaching the age of 65 have an approximately 40 percent chance of entering a 
nursing home and requiring chronic, custodial care. Candidates for long-term 
care suffer from chronic or disabling conditions that require nursing home 
care or other constant supervision. The cost of this care can be expensive—
even catastrophic—for many individuals and their families.
One way to provide for the cost of this care is to purchase long-term care 
insurance while you are still healthy and young enough to qualify for it. But 
there are other alternatives, as discussed later in this chapter. Let’s look first at 
the factors that should be considered in selecting an individual health ­insurance 
policy and the types of policies available in today’s marketplace.

Considerations in Selecting a Health  
Insurance Policy
The following are five general considerations to keep in mind when selecting 
the right health insurance policy:
1.	 Health insurance costs a lot, but not having it costs a great deal 
more. Quite by accident, as a result of a recruitment tool 
used to entice veterans returning from World War II, the 
United States has an employer-based health ­insurance 
system. Accordingly, a majority of Americans are ­covered 
through group health insurance policies ­provided by their 
employers. However, many self-employed individuals and 
their employees do not have health insurance, given 
the prohibitive cost of coverage. The same is true for 
­salaried individuals who are laid off as a result of a weak 
economy.
 	
When it comes to health care expenses, studies show 
that if one family member is not covered by health 
­insurance and suffers an accident, the resulting medical 
bills will have an impact on the future economic health of 
the entire family. The obligation to pay high medical bills 
is the number-one reason for personal bankruptcy filings 
today. As such, the need for group or individual coverage 
is very important. If you are not covered by an employer 
or individual health plan, follow these steps as recom-
mended by health care advocates and consultants:
Get in touch with your state’s insurance department 
• 
to find a list of health care plans that provide coverage 
in your state. Because of the extensive cost of health 
care to the uninsured, and the continuing inability of 
some individuals to qualify for health insurance, many 
states have established health insurance pools that offer 
coverage for high-risk individuals.
Contact the top-ranked plans in your state for details 
• 
regarding premiums and costs for major medical 
procedures.
Find out whether any preexisting conditions are 
• 
excluded from coverage. If you have previously been 
covered by a group policy, recent health legislation 
may assist you in obtaining individual coverage, even 
if you have a preexisting condition as specified by the 
insurance carrier.

2.	 If your employer offers a group health plan, you are likely 
­better off participating in that plan than purchasing individual 
health insurance. This can be a tough lesson to learn if you 
are young and healthy. As a young person in good health 
covered by a group plan, you may be over-insured, given 
that you are paying for a great deal of coverage that you 
may never use. You can minimize this cost by selecting 
as high a deductible and co-payment as the plan permits. 
You are still probably ahead cost-wise by participating in 
the group plan rather than purchasing individual ­coverage. 
In addition, you need to establish coverage under a group 
plan so as to exercise certain continuation rights that 
may be necessary in the event that you change or lose 
your job (otherwise known as COBRA rights, after the 
Consolidated Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 
1985 that provided for these rights).
3.	 Review the co-payment and deductible provisions under health 
insurance plans carefully. Under most managed care plans 
(including health maintenance organizations [HMO] and 
preferred provider organizations [PPO]), the insured pays 
a fixed charge each time they see a medical ­doctor or fill 
a covered prescription. This is known as a co-payment 
and should be distinguished from co-insurance, where the 
plan provider and the insured share the cost of covered 
medical expenses once the plan deductible has been met. 
Generally, you want the co-payment to be as small as 
possible, unless you do not anticipate using the ­insurance 
policy heavily during the year (if you are young and healthy, 
for example). In this case, you may want to opt for as high 
a co-payment as possible, which in turn should reduce 
your premium cost.
 	
Many health care plans, particularly in recent years, as 
the cost of health insurance has skyrocketed, require 
each insured to retain a certain portion of their health 
care expense risk in the form of a deductible. This is an 
­out-of-pocket amount that the insured must pay before 
any insurance coverage is afforded. Once the covered 
medical expenses equal the plan deductible (usually 
on an individual or family basis), further expenses then 
­qualify for the co-insurance provision. Typically, after the 
­co-insurance provision is triggered, the insured must then 
pay 20 percent of the expenses until a certain maximum 
amount is reached (known as a stop-loss), at which point 
the insurance company pays 100 percent of the excess.

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
58
 	
If your employer offers a flexible spending account 
(FSA) to help you with the payment of any deductibles 
or co-payments associated with its health insurance plan, 
put as much money into this account as you can afford 
or as allowed under current law. An FSA is a special form 
of employee benefit that allows you to pay for certain 
­medical expenses (such as deductibles and co-payments) 
with before-tax dollars, thus reducing your taxable income. 
We will talk more about FSAs later; but as a general rule 
of tax planning, whenever you can pay for an expense 
with before-tax rather than after-tax dollars, doing so will 
usually prove advantageous.
4.	 The more flexibility you have in selecting health care ­providers, 
the more the plan will cost you. Many insureds do not need to 
concern themselves with this consideration, because their 
employer has already taken this flexibility away from them. 
For example, employers who offer only HMO ­enrollment 
to their employees have substantially restricted the 
employees’ right to choose their own ­primary care physi-
cians and specialists. But insureds who participate in other 
forms of health insurance plans, such as PPO plans, may 
typically see either an in-network ­physician or one who 
does not participate in the network (an out-of-network 
provider). This same concept also applies to participating 
and nonparticipating hospitals. If you want to see an out-
of-network doctor or hospital, you will likely pay more for 
the privilege, but at least your choice is preserved.
 	
As a result, if you are participating in a PPO managed 
care plan, one of the questions you should research is 
whether your preferred doctor or hospital is a ­member 
of the plan’s network of medical providers. Usually, you 
can check out the network physicians and hospitals 
­participating in the plan before signing up.

59
5.	 Make sure you know your legal rights if you leave your job 
(and the employer-provided coverage). In recent years, two 
­legislative acts—the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation 
Act of 1985 (COBRA) and the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)—have gone a 
long way to ensure continuing health insurance coverage 
for individuals who once had health insurance protection. 
Unfortunately, neither of these acts do much to address 
the ongoing problem of the uninsured or, just as important, 
the rising cost of health insurance premiums. (Note: See the 
subsequent discussion in this chapter of the 2010 Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred 
to as Obamacare, which was passed in part to address the 
problem of the uninsured and rising health care costs.)
 	
We will talk in more detail about both of these acts 
shortly, but you should be aware that if you once had 
health insurance coverage but lost or changed jobs, it is 
relatively easy to continue that coverage for a period of 
time. Although your share of the health insurance pre-
mium may increase (if you exercise your COBRA rights, 
you have to incur the portion of the group health insur-
ance previously paid by your employer), it is still much 
better than going without coverage. As mentioned earlier, 
no single event can threaten your future economic security 
or that of your family more than incurring substantial 
medical bills for which you have no individual, employer-
provided, or government-mandated insurance. 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care  
Act of 2010
On March 23, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (or PPA). The provisions of this act 
will change health care insurance and protection as we know it. Among its 
most important provisions are the following:
A mandate requiring all individuals and certain employers 
• 
to maintain or offer a minimum essential amount of health 
care insurance or face a penalty. The constitutionality of 
this mandate (as a penalty tax) was upheld in the very 
recent U.S. Supreme Court case of National Federation of 
Independent Business, et al. v. Sebelius, Secretary of Health 
and Human Services, et  al. (decided June 28, 2012) and 

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
60
will first be effective beginning January 1, 2014. The 
requirement of automatic enrollment provisions for all 
employees covered under group health insurance, subject 
to certain specified opt-out rights, will also be effective 
beginning January 1, 2014, and impacts all employers who 
employ more than 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees. 
Even part-time employees who work 30 hours or more 
per week are counted among the 50 FTEs.
The prohibition of waiting periods to be covered under 
• 
a health insurance policy of more than 90 days, effective 
January 1, 2014.
The prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions, 
• 
first made effective in 2010 for children under the age 
of 19 and, subsequently, made effective for all individuals 
­beginning January 1, 2014.
The requirement that all new policies issued cover 
• 
­preventive services, such as cancer screening, with no out-
of-pocket costs to the insured, effective for policies with 
plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010.
Extended coverage for dependents up to age 26, ­effective 
• 
for policies with plan years beginning on or after 
September 23, 2010.
A cap on health care contributions to FSAs of $2,500 per 
• 
year beginning January 1, 2013, which will be indexed for 
inflation thereafter.
The PPA also includes several provisions to help finance health care reform. 
Among the most important of these is an increase in the threshold for medical 
expense deductions from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted 
gross income (AGI) for individuals under the age of 65; a new 3.8 percent 
surtax on unearned income (such as dividends and interest) for taxpayers 
with annual modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $200,000 (single 
filer) and $250,000 (joint filers); and an increase in the Medicare payroll tax 
from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent for taxpayers with an annual gross income 
over $200,000 (single filers) and $250,000 (joint filers). All of these provisions 
became effective January 1, 2013.
Types of Health Insurance Policies
Historically, there have been only two basic types of health insurance ­policies: 
indemnity or fee-for-service policies and managed care policies. In recent years, 
however, a third type of health insurance coverage—the health ­savings account 

Plan Your Financial Future
61
(HSA)—has come onto the scene, spurred by Congressional ­legislation.  
The first two types of policies dominate the employer-provided range of 
coverage, whereas the HSA represents a new way of looking at the individual 
health insurance problem. The HSA is designed to make the individual—rather 
than their employer—the party responsible for making financial decisions 
related to health. For this reason, the HSA and its predecessor, the medical 
savings account (MSA), are part of what is now referred to as consumer-driven 
health care.
Indemnity (Fee-for-Service) Policies
True indemnity policies do not include a deductible or co-payment and as 
such are sometimes referred to as first-dollar coverage (because they pay from 
the first dollar of expense). Over time, indemnity policies, which historically 
have included separate first-dollar coverage for hospital, surgical, and physi-
cian’s expenses (often known as basic medical insurance) have evolved into the 
comprehensive major medical policy. The major med policy, as it has come to 
be called, includes both a deductible and a co-insurance provision, as well as a 
maximum dollar limitation of coverage, which usually amounts to at least $1.0 
million in lifetime medical expenses.
As a rule, indemnity policies, including major med, cover only accidents and 
­illnesses and do not cover preventative care. In addition, they pay a benefit 
based only on the usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) rates in your area, 
not on the actual bill or expenses incurred. Individuals insured under indem-
nity policies are often billed by their medical providers, submit claims to the 
insurance company, and are subsequently reimbursed for expenses. Insureds 
usually have complete freedom with respect to which medical providers they 
use, which thereby drives up costs for both the insured and the employer-
sponsor. Primarily because of the cost implications, indemnity policies have 
largely been replaced by managed care policies in recent years.
Managed Care Policies
In the mid to late 1990s, managed care became the most popular form of 
health care, and some of its benefits were integrated into major comprehen-
sive medical policies. Notably, managed care introduced the concepts of co-
payments (rather than annual deductibles) and the primary care physician, also 
known as the gatekeeper physician or PCP. Another innovation of managed 
care was the coverage of routine physical exams and other forms of preventa-
tive care, in furtherance of the belief that it is less expensive to treat disease 
in its early stages of development rather than waiting until more extensive 
treatment is warranted. There are three primary managed care approaches: 
HMOs, PPOs, and point-of-service (POS) plans.

62
An HMO offers medical services to its subscribers for a monthly fee 
(commonly referred to as a capitation fee). The members of the organization 
must use the HMO’s on-site doctors unless they are referred to a specialist 
by their assigned primary care physician. The organization provides all medical 
services and administrates all medical claims filed by the insured. As such, an 
HMO is not technically an insurance company, because there is no third party 
to whom the insurance risk is transferred. Rather, the organization provides 
only prepaid medical services.
A PPO, on the other hand, is most often administered by an insurance 
company that is acting as an intermediary between medical care providers 
and the health care consumer. Generally, the various providers affiliated with 
the PPO, referred to as in-network providers, accept reduced fees in exchange 
for the insurance company paying their fee more rapidly and for guaranteeing 
payment. Many PPOs allow consumers to receive care outside of the network 
of preferred providers; however, if an out-of-network provider is used, the 
insured pays a higher co-payment or deductible.
Finally, a POS plan combines attributes of the HMO and PPO. If contracted 
providers in a POS plan are used, their services are available for a low  co-payment 
or are covered completely (as with an HMO). However, if an out-of-network 
provider is used, the insured pays a higher co-payment, and some preventative 
care may not be covered (as with a PPO). Newly enrolled policyholders are 
required to choose a primary care physician to direct their medical treatment. 
This physician becomes the insured’s point of service and is chosen from a list 
of preapproved physicians in the plan’s medical care network.
Health Savings Accounts
The HSA, a policy that any individual who does not participate in an employer-
sponsored plan may establish on their own, is the latest entry in the health 
insurance marketplace. An employer may also contribute to an HSA that 
was established by an employee if it so chooses. Today, many HSAs offer 
investment options, ranging from money market accounts to mutual funds to 
individual stocks. Most of these investment options are currently underuti-
lized because participants have historically favored only cash to fund HSAs.
An HSA is set up more or less like an individual retirement account (IRA), 
except that the tax-deductible contributions made to an HSA may only be 
used to reimburse the account owner for qualifying medical expenses. If they 
are not used for this purpose prior to the owner reaching the age of 65, 
a 20 percent penalty is imposed. As in an IRA, earnings generated by HSA 
investments accumulate income-tax-free. Therefore, if the distributions from 
the HSA are used to pay for qualified medical expenses (including long-term 
care insurance premiums), the account is never taxed—not when contribu-
tions are made, not while these contributions are generating earnings, and not 
when the contributions and earnings are withdrawn.

63
Generally, any individual below Medicare age (age 65) who is not covered by 
any group or individual health plan can establish an HSA. A high deductible 
(for example, $1,250 for a single individual and $2,500 for a married couple in 
2013) is required on the health insurance policy, and limitations are specified 
on the annual amount of tax-deductible contributions that may be made to the 
account. However, unlike with an IRA, there are no income caps for individuals 
claiming the HSA deduction, nor is the claiming of the deduction dependent 
on whether the individual itemizes their tax deductions at year end.
Who should implement an HSA? Certainly any younger, healthier individual 
who is unlikely to have large medical bills in the near future and does not 
participate in an employer plan should consider the option. In addition, older, 
self-employed individuals who will not have the advantage of retiree health 
insurance should look very closely at the savings opportunities presented by 
the HSA. Upper-income and relatively healthy persons may also find HSAs 
attractive if they switch to a high-deductible insurance policy and then take 
advantage of the deduction for contributions to offset their taxable income. 
An often-overlooked benefit of establishing an HSA is that you can roll over 
money from an IRA to an HSA without incurring income tax and avoid a tax 
bill altogether if you then use the money for qualifying medical expenses.
Continuation of Health Insurance Coverage 
After You Have Left Your Job
Many health care consumers are not aware that if they lose their job 
­voluntarily or involuntarily, they can continue their previous group health 
insurance ­coverage. Under the federal COBRA law, employers with 20 or 
more employees must let you remain enrolled in their policy at your own 
expense. Typically, this right must be afforded for a period of up to 18 months 
after you leave your job.
Although it may require some new cash-flow planning to pay not only your 
previous share of the employer group policy premiums but the employer’s 
share as well, it is still probably wise to pursue your COBRA rights. Most 
group policies (including those of your potential new employers) have ­waiting 
periods before you are entitled to coverage. In some cases, the waiting period 
may be as long as six months. (Of course, with the implementation of the 
­prohibition on waiting periods beyond 90 days under Obamacare, this will 
change in 2014.) Taking this into consideration, as well as the possibility that 
it may take you some time to find another job, flexing your COBRA rights is 
prudent cash-flow management.
Other COBRA qualifying events include the death of a covered spouse, 
divorce or legal separation that causes an employee’s spouse or dependent 

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
64
children to lose coverage, and attaining Medicare age. In these events, the 
term of ­coverage afforded under COBRA may be as long as 36 months after 
the so-called triggering event.
Portability of Health Insurance Coverage
The phrase portability of health insurance coverage is a bit of a misnomer. It does 
not mean that you can literally transfer the same group policy from your 
previous employer to your new employer. However, it does mean that, under 
HIPAA, as long as you have been covered under a group policy for a ­specified 
period of time, an insurance company cannot deny you coverage, even if you 
have become seriously ill in the meantime. Specifically, HIPAA states that there 
cannot be enforcement of a preexisting medical condition clause by the new 
insurance company if
You were covered by a prior employer’s health insurance 
• 
plan for at least 12 months.
Fewer than 63 days have elapsed since you lost coverage 
• 
under the prior employer’s plan.
Again, however, these limitations will change with the prohibition, generally, of 
refusal of coverage to anyone because of preexisting conditions in 2014 under 
the provisions of Obamacare.
How do you know that you have lost coverage under your prior employer’s 
plan? Your previous employer must provide you with a certificate of coverage 
that states the length of your insurance coverage and the date when you lost 
it. Keep this certificate! Should you enroll in a new group health insurance plan 
that applies a preexisting condition exclusion, proof of prior coverage often 
guarantees that you can avoid the application of this exclusion. Unfortunately, 
HIPAA does not regulate premium costs, so there is no guarantee that you will 
actually be able to afford the new insurance to which you are legally entitled.
Medicare and Medigap
Medicare is a federal government health insurance plan that covers individuals 
once they reach the age of 65. Historically, Medicare consisted of two major 
parts: Part A, hospital insurance; and Part B, supplementary medical insurance. 
In 2003, Congress passed a third major part of Medicare: Part D, prescription 
drug coverage. Part D became fully effective on January 1, 2006, but unlike 
Parts A and B of the plan, Part D coverage is not included within the tradi-
tional Medicare program. Instead, beneficiaries must elect to enroll in one of 
many hundreds of Part D plans offered by private insurance companies, with 
the U.S. government providing premium support to these policies.

Plan Your Financial Future
65
Medicare Part A coverage is provided at no premium cost to eligible 
­participants and covers four broad categories:
In-patient hospital care up to 90 days. The patient pays 
• 
a deductible for the first 60 days and a co-payment after 
this up to the 90 maximum.
Skilled nursing care benefits.
• 
Home health services.
• 
Care in a hospice for the terminally ill (defined as a ­person 
• 
with a life expectancy of six months or less).
Perhaps the most misunderstood part of Medicare Part A coverage is that 
long-term nursing-home coverage (referred to as custodial care under most 
long-term care insurance policies) is not provided. Rather, a very short-term 
limited benefit known as the skilled nursing care benefit is available. Notably, this 
benefit means the patient must enter a skilled nursing facility at the ­direction of 
a medical doctor within 30 days after leaving a hospital where the patient was 
treated for a serious illness for three or more consecutive days. In addition, 
the patient’s condition must be expected to improve as a result of entering 
this facility. Many medical diagnoses involving dementia, including Alzheimer’s 
disease, are not covered under Part A of Medicare because of this limitation.
This leads to the question of how to financially provide for an aging parent 
who needs continuing care. We will address this issue when we discuss long-
term care alternatives later in this chapter; but, speaking as someone who 
has personally wrestled with the problem, there are three basic choices: you 
can attempt to self-fund, using either your own money or that of your parent; 
you can investigate whether it is still possible for your parent to qualify for 
coverage under a long-term care insurance policy; or you can attempt to take 
advantage of the very strict requirements to qualify the parent for Medicaid 
assistance. The practical problem is that most of us either do not have the 
money to self-fund the coverage or wait so long that our parent no longer 
qualifies for or can afford the purchase of a long-term care policy. Thus, the 
purchase of a long-term care insurance policy for yourself or for aging parents 
is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of proper wealth management.
In contrast to Part A, Medicare Part B coverage is not free to the participant; 
rather, it entails the payment of a specified monthly premium by the insured 
and, further, is means tested, meaning those with higher incomes pay a higher 
premium. In addition, a deductible must be paid by the insured as well as 
co-insurance toward covered expenses in any calendar year. Currently, this 
co-insurance percentage is coordinated with the percentage share of most 
indemnity medical plans, or 80 percent on the part of the government and 
20 percent on the part of the insured. You can opt out of Medicare Part B 

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
66
coverage, but at the time you qualify for Medicare Part A coverage, you must 
tell the Social Security Administration (which also administers Medicare) that 
you do not wish to participate in Part B coverage.
As you can likely appreciate, individuals who are eligible for Medicare may 
have substantial medical costs for which they are responsible in excess of the 
covered expenses. The reimbursement of these excess expenses is why you 
(or your parent) should purchase a Medicare supplemental health insurance 
policy, colloquially referred to as a Medigap policy.
Medigap policies consist of 14 supplemental policies that have been standard-
ized by federal legislation and are identified by the letters A through N for 
the types of benefits provided. (Effective June 1, 2010, Plans E, H, I, and J are 
no ­longer sold, although if purchased before this date, they are still valid.) 
Generally, you must have both Part A and Part B coverage under Medicare 
before a Medigap policy may be purchased. Under law, seniors (defined here as 
individuals aged 65 or over) may be sold only one Medigap policy at a time. The 
policy must accept all applicants within the first six months of their ­qualifying 
for Medicare, regardless of any preexisting conditions. Medigap ­policies can be 
obtained through a variety of companies and organizations, including the most 
popular source, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), which 
is headquartered in Washington DC.
Seniors may also wish to consider a second form of Medicare coverage: the 
Medicare Advantage plan, which is private insurance subsidized by the federal 
government that offers the same basic coverage provided by Medicare but 
also includes the most important features of Medigap policies. There are 
two types of Medicare Advantage plans: those that include the attributes of 
­managed care plans as well as private fee-for-service plans (or PFFS plans), 
which feature open access to health care providers with few restrictions. PFFS 
plans are currently the fastest growing type of alternative Medicare coverage 
and are provided for under Part C of the Medicare Act of 1965.
The Importance of Long-Term Care Insurance 
in Protecting Your Wealth
The need for long-term care can mean a variety of different things to ­different 
people, but generally it results from any chronic or disabling condition that 
requires nursing home care or constant medical supervision. Long-term care 
insurance policy provisions cover not only care in a nursing home facility, 
but also nursing care in your own home. Payment for care received in your 
own home is the number-one reason you may want to consider purchasing a 
­long-term care insurance policy for yourself or your parent.

Plan Your Financial Future
67
Long-term care is very expensive, no matter where you or your aging parent 
resides, and most people cannot afford to cover the cost of this care for very 
long. For example, the average cost of a nursing home for a private room in 
the United States in 2013 is approximately $90,000 per year—and it may be 
considerably higher, depending on the level of care that is received and where 
the nursing home is located. Fortunately, the average stay in a nursing home is 
less than 3 years (2.7 years, to be exact), but this is the average. You or your 
parent may reside in such a home for much longer than 3 years, sometimes 
even as long as 15 to 20 years. You should keep this statistic in mind when 
deciding how long a benefit period you wish to purchase as part of a long-
term care policy. As a general rule, the greater the benefit period, the higher 
the long-term care insurance policy premium.
Since 1996, when the HIPAA legislation was passed, most long-term care 
­policies have been issued as qualified policies. Although the primary advantages 
of a qualified long-term care policy are the accompanying income-tax benefits, 
another real advantage is the fact that it must be guaranteed renewable. This 
means you have the right to continue the policy for as long as the premiums 
are paid. Thus, the insurance company cannot cancel the policy if your health 
declines, nor can it increase the policy premiums, unless it does so for all 
members of the same class of insureds covered by the policy. In addition, long-
term care policies may be issued on a non-cancelable basis, meaning they must 
have a fixed, guaranteed level premium throughout your lifetime. However, 
given the rapidly increasing cost of providing long-term care, no insurance 
company is currently underwriting a policy where the premiums cannot be 
increased. Indeed, in recent years, some big insurance companies, such as Met 
Life, have stopped underwriting long-term care insurance entirely!
If a long-term care policy is tax-qualified, premiums paid by the policyholder 
are deductible as itemized medical expenses up to a dollar limit that depends 
on the policy owner’s age. Also, benefits paid from a qualified policy are 
income-tax-free without limit. If an employer pays for long-term care insur-
ance ­coverage for its employees (a group long-term care policy), the premiums 
are tax-deductible to the employer and are not considered to be taxable 
income to the employee. (Note: There is also a non-tax-qualified form of 
long-term care policy that does not provide any tax advantages. However, 
non-qualified plans require only “medical necessity” as an acceptable condi-
tion to be eligible for benefits, whereas tax-qualified plans require the failure 
to perform certain activities of daily living [ADLs] for benefit eligibility.)
From an income tax standpoint, it has just been mentioned that qualified 
long-term care premiums are deductible as medical expenses within certain 
limits. What is this limitation? Specifically, all medical expenses are deductible 
only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of your AGI for any given year 
(10 percent of AGI for most individuals beginning in 2013). This means that 
you probably will not be able to deduct the premium until after you enter a 

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
68
nursing home and begin incurring substantial medical expenses. The primary 
advantage the policy affords you is the income-tax-free nature of the benefits 
paid. Remember, though, that most long-term care benefits received are likely 
to be paid in reimbursement of medical expenses and therefore are not 
subject to income tax under current law.
Seven basic types of coverage are afforded by a qualified long-term care policy, 
only a few of which (such as skilled nursing care) are covered under Medicare. 
Even so, the qualifying conditions under the policy are likely to be much more 
favorable than those under Medicare law. In addition, as mentioned, the major 
benefit of custodial care coverage in a long-term care policy is not included 
among Medicare coverage provisions. The basic types of long-term coverage 
(in order of level of care) are as follows:
• 
Skilled nursing care: This is the highest level of medical 
care available and is provided in traditional nursing homes 
on a daily basis, typically to those individuals recovering 
from a severe life-threatening illness such as a stroke. 
Such care has to be given at the direction of a physician.
• 
Intermediate nursing care: This is similar to skilled nursing 
care, except that the care is provided only occasionally 
and not on a daily basis.
• 
Custodial care: This is traditional nursing home care and 
does not have to be ordered by a physician. It is provided 
to individuals with a chronic condition that does not per-
mit them to take care of themselves.
• 
Assisted living: These are facilities that provide apartment-
style housing (often including meals) and support services 
for individuals who need only intermittent assistance with 
the tasks of daily living.
• 
Home health care: This is care that allows the patient to 
remain at home and receive part-time skilled nursing care 
or other rehabilitative assistance.
• 
Hospice care: This is care for terminally ill patients and 
may be administered daily or less frequently. The care 
usually occurs at the patient’s home, but it may also be 
delivered at a hospice care center.
• 
Adult day care: This care is provided for persons who 
need assistance and supervision during the day at home 
and whose spouse or family members work ­outside 
the home.

Most long-term care policies have two criteria that must be met before 
­benefits are payable. The insured must meet either one of these two criteria:
1.	 The insured must be chronically ill as defined in the policy. 
Chronically ill is defined as being unable to perform, without 
substantial assistance, two of the six ADLs for at least  
90 days. The six ADLs are
Eating
• 
Bathing
• 
Dressing
• 
Transferring from bed to chair
• 
Using the toilet
• 
Maintaining continence
• 
2.	 Substantial services are required to protect the insured 
from threats to health and safety because of brain 
­damage resulting from, for example, strokes, dementia, or 
Alzheimer’s disease.
Usually, in proving that you meet either of these criteria, written verification 
by one or more physicians is required, but some policies will pay benefits 
upon the submission of a claim and an internal investigation (no doctor’s 
­letter is required).
Let’s now address some of the more common exclusions and limitations 
on benefits that you should be aware of before purchasing a long-term care 
­policy. The most important of these are the following:
• 
Daily benefit amount: Each policy typically guarantees a 
daily benefit amount or dollar amount payable per day 
based on the level of care being provided by the facility. 
A good place to begin in determining what this amount 
should be is to check the daily rate of nursing homes in 
your area. You may wish to consider an inflation rider to 
account for future increases in this rate.
• 
The elimination or waiting period: This period is the number 
of days you must wait before benefits are paid under the 
policy. During this time, you have to pay for the cost of 
care you receive out of your own private funds or those 
of your family. As may be expected, the shorter the elimi-
nation period, the higher the long-term care insurance 
period. The standard elimination period for most policies 
is 90 days.

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
70
• 
The benefit period: As mentioned earlier, the average time 
spent in a nursing home facility is 2.7 years. As such, you 
may wish to consider a three-year benefit period (or less). 
Because this is the average time spent in a nursing home 
facility, you may also wish to consider a longer period. 
Policies are available for lifetime benefit, but the longer 
the benefit period, the higher the policy premium.
• 
Preexisting-condition limitation: A preexisting condition is 
a condition for which a physician recommended medical 
treatment within six months before the effective date of 
insurance coverage. Some long-term care policies include 
a preexisting condition limitation. If they do, it means  
benefits will not be payable for long-term care related 
to the medical recommendation. (It is possible to find 
policies without any preexisting condition limitations, but 
they are more expensive.)
• 
Policy exclusions: The most common exclusion is for long-
term care that is necessary because of alcohol or drug 
addiction. Almost uniformly, policies do not cover this 
condition.
Alternatives to Long-Term Care Insurance
The first question that should come to mind with respect to long-term care 
insurance alternatives is whether you are likely to require long-term care during 
your lifetime. For some people, the answer is relatively simple, based on prob-
lematic family medical history or current poor health. For others, the answer 
is much less clear-cut. However, statistics bear out that approximately four out 
of ten people aged 65 or over will require long-term care assistance at some 
point during their lifetimes. These are relatively good odds! Thus, the question 
becomes not so much a matter of if, but rather when long-term care will be 
needed, and how it will be paid for.
Historically, three choices have been available with respect to paying for long-
term care: pay for such care yourself or rely on the financial resources of family 
members; attempt to qualify for government assistance in the form of Medicaid; 
or purchase a long-term care insurance policy. Recently, a fourth method has 
become available in the form of the purchase of an accelerated death benefits or 
living benefits rider as part of your life insurance coverage. This rider acceler-
ates payment of the death benefit if the insured contracts a terminal disease 
or becomes chronically ill. In other words, the insured must be certified by a 
physician as unable to perform, without assistance, certain ADLs.
There is a difference in the income tax treatment of a policy cashed in using 
this rider. If an insured is terminally ill (generally defined as being expected to 
die within 24 months from the date of the onset of disease), they can use the 

Plan Your Financial Future
71
proceeds for any purpose during their lifetime. Thus, there is no taxable gain 
to an insured who is terminally ill. However, if the insured is only chronically ill, 
they must use the proceeds only for long-term care to avoid taxation on the gain 
(defined as the cash value of the policy less any premiums paid to date).
For example, assume you are terminally ill but previously purchased a $250,000 
universal life insurance policy with an accelerated benefits rider. To date, you 
have paid $50,000 in premiums and the policy has accumulated a cash value of 
$75,000. You have $25,000 ($75,000 less $50,000) of potentially taxable gain 
(ordinary income and not capital gain). Because you are terminally ill, you 
can use the $75,000 cash value for any purpose free of income tax. However,  
if you are only chronically ill, you must use the cash value of $75,000 only for 
long-term care expenses if you want to avoid paying taxes on the $25,000 gain.
Many individuals—either intentionally or by reason of financial circumstances—
choose to self-fund the payment of long-term care.  A savings or investment plan 
may help you do so. However, this option requires financial self-discipline, a trait 
that some of us do not possess in considerable quantity. You may also rely on 
the equity in your home to cover your long-term care costs. For example, you 
can either downsize to a less expensive home and use the savings to fund pos-
sible long-term care costs, or you can enter into a reverse mortgage, whereby 
the lender pays you a monthly income based on a percentage of the amount of 
equity in your home. But given the vicissitudes of residential real estate mar-
kets in many areas of the country, this option entails some risk as well.
If you are unable to self-fund the payment of your long-term care, you might 
consider turning to Medicaid, which is a joint federally and state-funded 
­program for low-income and net-worth individuals providing for both health 
and long-term care. In order to qualify for coverage, applicants must meet 
income and asset tests as determined by the state where they live. Some 
relatively wealthy individuals have attempted to deliberately qualify for long-
term Medicaid coverage by “spending down” their assets and income to 
the specified level. However, a series of laws dating back to the 1980s have 
­curtailed this activity, notably through the implementation of a look-back 
period in which most assets that are gifted to others (“spent down”) are 
not ignored. For example, individuals who transfer assets to family members 
­(usually members other than their spouse) during a period of 60 months 
prior to applying for Medicaid may find themselves penalized and prohibited 
from receiving Medicaid assistance for a significant period of time. For this reason, 
if you can afford to self-fund your long-term care, relying on government 
assistance to help you with these expenses may not be the most prudent  
planning alternative. On the other hand, if you have otherwise been ­attempting 
to qualify for Medicaid assistance but find that you must unexpectedly enter 
a nursing home, consider purchasing a long-term care insurance policy to 
cover the requisite look-back period. This means that the applicable benefit 
period of the policy will likely have to be at least five years before you apply 
for Medicaid coverage.

Chapter 5 | Insuring Your Health and Long-term Care
72
As a final alternative to long-term care insurance, check to see if your 
state of residence has adopted a so-called filial support law with respect to 
long-term care expenses. Such a law may be used to require reimbursement 
by a patient’s family for unpaid long-term care expenses incurred by a family 
member. Currently, 29 states have such a law, but the laws are becoming more 
prevalent, given the rapidly increasing Medicaid expenses paid out by states on 
behalf of insured individuals.
This leads us back to the possible purchase of a long-term care insurance 
policy. If you believe that family or personal circumstance might warrant the 
purchase of such a policy, here are some factors you should consider:
• 
When (at what age) should I buy the policy? The guide-
line is that you should purchase a long-term care policy 
while you are still relatively healthy and young, but not 
so young as to pay premiums for an inordinate period 
of time. Generally, the optimal time to purchase a long-
term care insurance policy is around age 55, as you are 
approaching your retirement years but can still qualify for 
policy  coverage without major health questions.
• 
What type of long-term care are you likely to need? Certainly, 
skilled nursing care is not desired by anyone, but payment for 
home health care services is likely an objective of most pro-
spective purchasers. You may wish to purchase a long-term 
care insurance policy just to provide for this possibility.
• 
How much can you afford to pay for long-term care? The 
answer to this question usually determines what the 
elimination period under the policy will be and how long 
you can make payments before the private insurance 
coverage becomes effective.
• 
What is your attitude with respect to leaving an estate for 
your spouse or children? Nothing can decimate the size and 
distribution of your accumulated estate to others more 
quickly than a prolonged stay in a nursing-home  facility. 
Accordingly, the purchase of a long-term care  insurance 
policy may be thought of as a stopgap measure to  
preserve at least some portion of your estate.
We have now covered one of the biggest potential threats to your ability to 
accumulate wealth: unanticipated medical expenses for which you have no 
means of payment. The next chapter deals with another major threat to your 
ability to become wealthy: the threat of losing your earning power. This type 
of risk can be managed by the purchase of an individual disability policy, likely 
the most needed (but at the same time most neglected) form of insurance in 
the current-day marketplace.

Insuring Your 
Earning Power
Ask any financial planner or insurance agent what the most neglected or 
underinsured financial risk is, and they are likely to say the risk of losing your 
ability to earn a living. Most individuals simply do not give sufficient attention 
to this possibility and, if they do, believe that they are adequately covered. In 
other words, they believe they will never lose their earning power. However, 
according to the Commissioner’s Individual Disability Table A, one in 
three working Americans will suffer some form of disability that lasts at least 
90 days before they reach the age of 65. In addition, one in seven employees 
will be disabled for five or more years prior to their retirement. You are two 
to three times more likely to become disabled during your working career than 
you are to die during this same period. These are impressive (and somewhat 
frightening) numbers.
Many individuals believe they are adequately insured against the loss of future 
earning power because they are covered by a group disability income policy at 
their place of employment. However, there are two major flaws in this thinking:
1.	 Most employer policies replace only 50–60 percent of 
your monthly income.
2.	 The replacement income provided by this benefit is likely 
income-taxable, since the employer paid the cost of the 
insurance premium while you were working. In turn, this 
means you will receive less than the 50–60 percent of 
monthly income promised to you.
How can this often-forgotten risk be adequately covered? Most commonly 
through the purchase of an individual disability income policy.

Chapter 6 | Insuring Your Earning Power
74
Is the Loss of Your Earning Power Already 
Adequately Covered?
There are other forms of insurance that you may rely on to protect your 
earning power in the event that you are unable to work. Among these is 
supplemental income insurance, which is designed to pay your living expenses 
while you are disabled. The best known of these policies is issued by American 
Family Life Assurance Company—better known as AFLAC. Quack, quack!
In addition to supplemental policies, employee benefits from your employer 
are typically available, as mentioned previously. For short-term illness, your 
employer may provide sick leave, short-term disability income protection, 
or both. Furthermore, all employers are mandated by the state to provide 
worker’s compensation benefits in the event of a serious injury while on the 
job. Keep in mind, however, that most employers only provide group long-term 
disability policies. Benefits from these types of policies begin when short-term 
benefits, if there are any, stop. Long-term benefits then generally continue until 
you reach age 65, until your full retirement age under Social Security, or until 
you return to work. Group policies include a cap or limitation on the amount 
they will pay—usually no more than 60 percent of your monthly income. Plus, 
as with most employee benefits, once you leave your current place of employ-
ment, the disability income coverage is terminated.
Social Security income protection, on the other hand, is a disability benefit 
provided under the Social Security system, but qualifying for it is not easy 
(some would say impossible—at least for a first-time application). Specifically, 
to qualify for a disability benefit under Social Security, you must
Have been disabled for at least five full calendar months
• 
Have a disability expected to last at least 12 months or 
• 
end in death
Be unable to engage in any substantial gainful occupation 
• 
and not just your own occupation at the time your dis-
ability begins
Like funding for possible long-term care needs, many individuals (if they have 
given any thought to their chances of becoming disabled) attempt to self-
fund for disability through investment. To determine what you would need 
to self-fund for this possibility, review the basics of what we have discussed  
so far—most notably, how to prepare and analyze a personal cash-flow  
statement—and see what your monthly expenses are. Then multiply this 
amount by 12 and determine the amount of your total annual expenses. Doing 
so gives you some idea of the funds needed to take you through one year of 
disability. Most long-term disabilities last more than a year, so you should now 
be able to appreciate the actual amount of savings needed to cover the risk 

Plan Your Financial Future
75
of loss to your earning power. Most people cannot afford to self-fund for very 
long, which brings us back to considering the purchase of an individual dis-
ability income insurance policy.
Definitions of Disability
The most important part of any disability income insurance policy (and the 
single most important consideration for you) is the language used by the 
policy to define disability. Fortunately, there are really only three definitions:
1.	 Own Occupation (Own Occ): This is the most favorable def-
inition of disability from the point of view of the insured. 
The definition states that the insured is considered totally 
disabled (and therefore eligible for benefits payments) if 
they are unable to engage in the primary duties of their 
own occupation. For example, a medical surgeon would 
be unable to engage in their own occupation if they suf-
fered an injury to the hands. This would be the case even 
if the surgeon were still able to diagnose illnesses as a 
general practitioner of medicine.
2.	 Modified Any Occupation (Modified Any Occ): This defini-
tion is slightly less restrictive than the Any Occupation 
definition but not as liberal as the Own Occ definition. 
Modified Any Occ defines disability as the insured’s inabil-
ity to engage in any occupation for which they are rea-
sonably suited by education or experience and for which 
they could easily become qualified. Applying this defini-
tion to the medical surgeon example, if the surgeon could 
become a general practitioner reasonably easily after the 
injury to their hands, the policy probably would not pay a 
benefit.
3.	 Any Occupation (Any Occ): This is the practical opposite 
of the Own Occ definition and requires the insured to 
be unable to perform the duties relating to any gainful 
occupation before they are considered to be totally dis-
abled. It is not unlike the Social Security definition of dis-
ability, except that there is no five-month waiting period 
and expected length of disability. The Any Occ definition 
is usually limited to blue-collar workers, although white-
collar workers and professionals may also obtain a policy 
with this definition. The reason these individuals would 
want to do so is to achieve premium cost savings.

Chapter 6 | Insuring Your Earning Power
76
Group long-term disability policies usually use a combination of the Own Occ 
and Modified Any Occ definitions (called a split-definition policy). Such 
policies permit the insured to receive benefits for a period of months or 
years under the Own Occ criteria; then, after the insured has been retrained 
for another position, the policies apply the stricter Modified Any Occ defini-
tion. Why? By design, the split definition encourages the worker to return to 
work and remain with the company, even though it may be in a new position 
or occupation.
It is also possible to write an individual disability income policy with a loss-
of-income definition. With this kind of policy, the type of disability is not 
defined; rather, if, as a result of injury or sickness, the insured suffers a loss 
of income, benefits based on that loss are payable regardless of whether the 
insured returns to work in the same or a related occupation. Given that it 
does not usually provide as great a benefit, the loss-of-income policy is not as 
popular among professionals or other workers as the Own Occ definition. But 
insurance companies like the loss-of-income standard because it establishes a 
simple benchmark from which to measure the amount of benefits payable.
Additional Important Provisions in an 
Individual Disability Policy
Many of the same provisions that are included in a long-term care insurance 
policy are found in an individual disability income policy. For example, like 
long-term care policies, disability insurance includes an elimination or waiting 
period, a benefit period, and a benefit amount.
The elimination period in disability insurance essentially works the same way as 
that included in a long-term care policy. In other words, an elimination period 
is the period of time after the insured has met the qualifying conditions to 
collect under the policy but before any benefit payments are actually made. In 
the case of disability insurance, an elimination period of 90 days is probably 
optimal when considering the trade-off between covering the required pay-
ments from personal funds for a number of days and the need for as low an 
insurance premium as possible. Longer elimination periods naturally reduce 
policy premiums, but the longer this period, the greater the need for personal 
savings or other alternatives to cover the insured’s ongoing living expenses.
A somewhat novel and increasingly popular alternative that insurance agents 
are recommending to cover the elimination period is the separate purchase of 
a critical illness insurance policy. Critical illness insurance is an insurance policy 
that makes a lump sum cash payment if the insured is diagnosed with one of 
the critical illnesses listed in the policy and survives a minimum number of 
days (typically 30) from the date of diagnosis. Such a policy may be underwritten 
to require payment for the same illness or condition that prompts the insured 

Plan Your Financial Future
77
to make a claim under their disability policy—and to make payment immedi-
ately rather than some 90 days later.
The maximum number of months or years that a disability income policy will 
pay a benefit is referred to as the benefit period. Most disability policies writ-
ten today provide benefits until the insured becomes eligible for Medicare or 
reaches age 65. Nonetheless, some insurance companies will write a policy 
that ensures disability payments are made throughout the life of the insured. 
The longer the benefit payment period, the higher the insurance policy pre-
mium. As such, you should think very carefully about whether this trade-off 
is financially worth it. During retirement, if you are looking for a financial 
product to make lifetime payments, some form of annuity policy is likely a less 
expensive way to ensure an income stream, rather than an extremely long 
disability insurance benefit period.
Finally, what most people are interested in when purchasing a disability income 
policy is the benefit amount that is payable. The general approach in the under-
writing of all disability income policies is to pay individuals slightly less than 
their net after-tax income if they were able to work, thus encouraging them 
to return to work as soon as possible. This typically works out to a benefit 
payable of somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of an employee’s previous 
monthly gross pay. If you are covered at work by a group long-term disability 
policy at the time you apply for individual coverage, the amount of new disabil-
ity insurance that you can obtain will probably be limited because of under-
writing restrictions. If this is the case, ask your insurance agent if the company 
will sell you a rider—an addition to the insurance policy with specified benefits 
or conditions—that allows you to increase the benefit amount without having 
to undergo a qualifying medical exam. Or, better yet, purchase and implement 
an individual disability policy before you participate in the group policy; then 
you can receive both benefits in the event that you leave the company.
You should also consider whether and how much of your disability insurance 
income may be taxable. In other words, how much of this income do you actu-
ally get to keep? Fortunately, unless you are self-employed, the answer is rela-
tively simple. If the employer pays the disability income insurance premiums 
on your behalf, the disability income payments are taxable. Alternatively, if you 
pay the disability insurance premiums yourself, the disability income payments 
are income-tax-free. Therefore, when coupling a group policy with individual 
disability coverage, the group payments are taxable, whereas those payments 
made from an individual policy are not. In summary, you are now in the same 
position you would be in if you had been able to continue working and were 
receiving a steady paycheck.
Let’s now address two other questions you should be sure to ask before pur-
chasing an individual disability insurance policy. Each of these questions has to 
do with continuing policy coverage in the future and the price you must pay 
to obtain it.

Chapter 6 | Insuring Your Earning Power
78
Policy Continuation Provisions
The first question you should ask with respect to policy continuation is 
whether the policy can ever be canceled. In contrast to group policies, indi-
vidual disability income policies may be underwritten as non-cancelable. This 
is a guarantee that not only can the insurance company not cancel the policy, 
but it also cannot increase the policy premiums unless otherwise provided for 
in your contract. This kind of guarantee does not come cheap, particularly in 
today’s inflationary society, but you want the cash-flow protection if you can 
get it.
The second question to ask with respect to policy continuation is whether 
the company can raise your premiums. Certainly, if you have been fortunate 
enough to secure a non-cancelable policy, the answer is no. However, what if 
you cannot or do not want to incur the additional cost of a non-cancelable 
policy? In that case, you have another option: you can purchase a guaranteed 
renewable policy. A guaranteed renewable policy allows the insurance com-
pany to increase the premiums but not to change the terms of the policy once 
written. The company also guarantees that you can renew the policy at the 
date of expiration as long as you have paid the premiums on a timely basis. In 
addition, the company cannot single you out for any rate increase; it may only 
increase the premiums for an entire class of similarly rated insureds.
Guaranteed renewable policies generally have lower premiums than non-
­cancelable policies. Once issued, insurance companies are loath to increase the 
premiums on guaranteed renewable policies for fear of creating ­disgruntled 
policyholders. As such, it may be possible for you to get essentially the same 
level of protection with a guaranteed renewable policy as with a ­non-cancelable 
policy but at a much lower cost.
Additional Policy Benefits to Consider
Many individual disability policies offer additional benefits, usually in the form 
of a policy rider. Here are some of the more important possible additional 
benefits:
• 
Cost of living adjustment (COLA) rider: The most common 
form of this rider increases the disability benefit paid after 
you start to collect benefits, thus protecting you against 
inflation. Another form increases the policy benefits by 
a specified percentage (usually five percent) each year 
before you become disabled, thus ensuring your constant 
purchasing power once you begin to draw benefits.

Plan Your Financial Future
79
• 
Return of premium: This benefit requires the insurance 
company to refund a portion of your premium if no 
claims are made for a specified period of time.
• 
Waiver of premium: This benefit allows you to stop paying 
the premium on the policy if you are disabled for a period 
of time, usually 90 days.
• 
Partial disability rider: This benefit is triggered when you 
are unable to perform some important duties of your 
own occupation but are able to perform enough other 
duties to allow you to return to work part-time. In this 
event, the policy pays a partial benefit, such as 50 percent, 
of the total that would otherwise be payable.
• 
Residual disability rider: This rider provides that if you are 
able to return to work full-time but at lesser pay than 
before due to a disability, the policy will pay the differ-
ence between your former pay and the current pay for 
the benefit period.
• 
Guaranteed insurability rider (also known as an increase-in-
benefits rider): This rider guarantees you the opportunity 
to increase the benefit amount payable under the policy at 
specified time periods, regardless of your physical or men-
tal health at the time. A usual requirement to obtain this 
rider is that you must have initially purchased a disability 
policy that is at least 80 percent of the maximum benefit 
amount that the insurance company would approve.
Policy Exclusions
Just as with other insurance contracts, it is important to know what is not 
covered under a disability income policy. These are known as policy exclusions 
and, with respect to disability income policies, refer to particular injuries or 
illnesses that may result in the insured not being able to work. Those that are 
most frequently encountered are disabilities resulting from
War or an act of war
• 
Pregnancy or complications from childbirth
• 
The insured committing or attempting to commit a crime
• 
A period when the insured was incarcerated
• 
An injury or disease that was self-inflicted, including those 
• 
related to or caused by drinking alcoholic beverages or 
the illegal use of drugs

Chapter 6 | Insuring Your Earning Power
80
Remember, if your disability results from any one of these exclusions, the 
policy will likely not pay benefits.
Questions to Ask Before Purchasing an 
Individual Disability Income Policy
1.	 What is the definition of disability in my policy?
2.	 What is the amount of benefit payable from my policy?
3.	 Do I have to pay taxes on that benefit?
4.	 How long are my benefits payable?
5.	 Is my benefit adjusted for inflation (and if so, in what 
amount)?
6.	 Is there an elimination or waiting period before I can 
begin to receive my benefit (and if so, how long is it)?
7.	 Is there a way I can ensure that payments are made  
during this waiting period?
8.	 Can I renew my policy without undergoing a medical 
examination?
9.	 Can the company increase my policy premiums?
10.	 What are the policy exclusions and do they affect me?
This chapter concludes our look at personal risk exposures. Now, let’s 
consider a risk exposure that most of us also have: the risk of loss or damage 
to our property, such as a home or automobile. Business insurance for 
self-employed individuals is also addressed in the next chapter.

Insuring Your 
Property
Typically, an individual’s most important possessions are their home and 
­automobile. Now that you have learned how to insure your life, health, and 
earning power, you want to be sure that your home(s) and automobile(s) are 
protected against significant financial loss as well.
As you prepare to read this chapter, keep in mind that, unlike homeowner’s 
­insurance, which generally is not mandatory unless you are required to ­purchase 
it by your mortgage lender, automobile insurance is required by many states. 
Specifically, states require all drivers to be financially responsible for damages 
or injuries caused to others as a result of automobile ­ownership. Liability 
insurance must be carried by every driver. However, insurance ­reimbursement 
for damage to your car or property (collision and comprehensive insurance) 
need not be carried. As such, you may choose to drop collision coverage and 
obtain only comprehensive (also known as other than collision) insurance for 
older automobiles. This is good cash-flow planning, because it makes little 
sense to ensure a car that is worth only $1,500 for collision coverage when 
the annual premiums for such coverage may be $300 or more after a $500 or 
more deductible.
What to Consider When Insuring Your Home
Homeowner’s insurance insures your home (commonly referred to as “the 
dwelling” in the insurance policy) and the personal belongings that are in 
the home. In almost all cases, insurance companies write a package policy, 
meaning the policy covers not only damages to the home but also liability for 
any ­injuries you or family members cause to others while they are on your 
7
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 7 | Insuring Your Property
82
property. There are various types of homeowner policies that insure  property 
based on the kind of dwelling you own, and most include the  following general 
forms of coverage:
Coverage A: dwelling
• 
Coverage B: other structures
• 
Coverage C: contents (personal property)
• 
Coverage D: loss of use
• 
Coverage E: personal liability
• 
Coverage F: medical payments to others
• 
You should also be aware that damage from some natural disasters is 
commonly excluded in the standard homeowner’s policy. Notably, damages 
caused to your home by flooding or earthquakes are not covered. However, 
federal flood insurance, underwritten as part of the National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP), may be purchased through your property and casualty 
insurance agent or broker. If the federal policy is insufficient for your needs, 
you should consider buying excess flood coverage from a private insurance 
company. Similarly, you can insure against earthquake damage by purchasing an 
earthquake endorsement to your standard homeowner’s policy. For example, 
in the state of California, an earthquake endorsement must at least be offered 
to the homeowner (although purchase of the endorsement is not required 
under state law).
Coverage A: Dwelling
Some homeowners make a huge mistake by only covering the fair market 
value of their home. Instead, your policy should cover the cost of  rebuilding 
in the event of severe damage or destruction, which is otherwise known as 
insuring your home for its replacement cost. To receive the full benefit of 
such coverage, you need to cover your home for at least 80 percent of its 
replacement cost. Otherwise, you will likely only be paid the actual cash value 
for your home, which is its replacement cost less a depreciation charge that 
the insurance company figures in based on the house’s age and condition. In 
other words, if actual cash value applies, you are only paid a percentage of the 
damage or  partial loss to your home. A total loss is paid without reference to 
this limitation as long as the loss is within the coverage limits of your policy.
Some insurance companies offer an extended policy rather than guaranteed 
replacement cost coverage. An extended policy pays a certain  limit—generally, 
20 to 25 percent over and above the fair market value of your home—for the 

Plan Your Financial Future
83
purpose of rebuilding. For example, if the fair market value of your home is 
$500,000, an extended policy would pay to rebuild your home up to a cost of 
$600,000 ($500,000 times 1.20).
How do you determine the replacement cost of your home? Generally, a local 
developer or construction expert can provide an estimated rebuilding cost. 
Sometimes local property appraisals may help, but be careful: appraisals of 
your property for property tax purposes may be undervalued or overvalued, 
depending on the need for revenue in your particular community. You can 
also go online to obtain an estimate of replacement cost at websites 
like ­www.insuretovalue.net. Additionally, as part of the annual insurance 
checkup that you should be doing with your property and casualty agent, ask 
the agent what they show as the replacement cost for your home.
Coverage B: Other Structures
This second type of homeowner’s coverage amounts to 10 percent of the 
dwelling coverage (Coverage A) and insures outbuildings on your property, 
such as an unattached garage or storage shed. For example, if your dwelling is 
insured for $500,000, you will see separate structure (sometimes referred to 
as dwelling extensions) coverage in the policy of $50,000 ($500,000 times 0.10). 
Typically, this amount provides adequate coverage, although if you have built 
a considerable structure not attached to your home but still on the property, 
such as a guesthouse, you may wish to consider purchasing a higher amount 
of coverage.
Coverage C: Contents or Personal Property
This type of coverage insures all the personal property included in your 
home unless the property is specifically excluded or limited in the amount 
of coverage. Coverage is generally 50 percent of Coverage A, and, unless you 
pay a higher premium and obtain replacement cost for personal property 
items, the policy will pay you only the actual cash value (or depreciated 
value) of the property.
Particularly valuable items usually are not adequately covered in a typical 
­homeowner’s policy. For example, jewelry and furs, if stolen, are typically 
­limited to a value of $1,500 per article lost. Any item that is worth more than 
the limits specified in the policy should be covered with an endorsement to 
the homeowner’s policy or through a separate policy known as a personal 
articles floater. If you do not know the replacement cost of the personal 
property but suspect it is considerably more than your current policy limits, 
have the property appraised before purchasing coverage.

Chapter 7 | Insuring Your Property
84
The advantage of a floater is that the listed property is insured at the 
appraised value for damage or loss, often without any deductible applied. 
However, once an item is insured via a floater, it is no longer covered under 
the basic limits of Coverage C. Therefore, if your jewelry is appraised at 
$10,000 (and “scheduled” for this amount), for example, you would not 
receive a reimbursement of $11,500 ($10,000 plus $1,500) if the jewelry 
was stolen; rather, coverage would be limited to only $10,000.
Would you remember all your personal property items if your home were 
destroyed by fire? Most people would not. For this reason, it is very likely 
time and money well spent to record your belongings and separately store 
the video footage on a personal computer. Put this video in a fireproof safe in 
your home and another copy in a safe-deposit box. You will be glad you did.
Coverage D: Loss of Use
If your home is damaged by fire or one of the other listed perils in the ­standard 
homeowner’s policy, Coverage D pays your living expenses during the time 
required to repair or rebuild your house. Usually, the amount is 30 percent 
of Coverage A or sometimes Coverage C, depending on the type of policy. 
You typically want the limitation tied to Coverage A, because it will result in a 
much higher reimbursement amount.
Coverage E: Personal Liability
Coverage E insures certain liability risks, including in the event of an invited 
guest being injured on your property, regardless of whether you are home 
at the time of the injury. If the injured individual was not an invited guest, 
under most state laws you are relieved from liability. Regardless, the amount of 
liability coverage you obtain is usually very important. Many people maintain 
a maximum of only $100,000 per occurrence for personal liability. In today’s 
litigious society, however, this amount generally is not enough, particularly 
if you are a professional, such as a physician or lawyer. To obtain additional 
supplemental liability coverage (referred to as umbrella coverage), many 
companies require you to maintain underlying liability coverage of at least 
$300,000 per occurrence in your homeowner and automobile policies. We 
discuss the possibility of obtaining umbrella coverage to protect you and your 
family later in this chapter.
Coverage F: Medical Payments to Others
This type of coverage is designed to pay the medical costs of individuals who 
are not residents of your home but are on the premises with your permission 
and are injured. Medical costs may also be paid for individuals who reside away 

Plan Your Financial Future
85
from your premises but are injured by the actions of your pets (for example, a 
dog that has temporarily left the premises). The coverage is usually limited to 
$1,000 per occurrence, but with today’s rising medical costs, it is not unusual 
to see higher limits (some as high as $5,000 per occurrence).
Types of Homeowner’s Policies  
(and the One You Want)
Although it is important to understand the various types of homeowner’s 
policies and what each insures you against (known as a peril in insurance 
­language), it is equally important to know what is not covered. We have already 
mentioned the two most common exclusions: damages caused by flooding or 
earthquakes. There are six other, very common exclusions (in other words, 
when your property is not covered against potential loss):
1.	 If your dwelling is condemned or does not comply with 
local building codes and has to be replaced or destroyed
2.	 Losses resulting from power failure or interruption of 
power from the utility company
3.	 Losses resulting from neglect by the insured (if you have 
not reasonably maintained your home and you incur a 
loss because of this, you are not covered)
4.	 Losses caused by war
5.	 Losses resulting from a nuclear hazard
6.	 Any damage resulting from an intentional act of the 
insured (if you burn down your own house, the insurance 
company will not cover this loss)
Now, let’s mention the perils that are covered under the standard 
­homeowner’s (HO) policy. This is where the types of policies diverge—
for example, the standard HO-1 policy covers only specified basic perils, 
whereas the HO-2 policy extends this coverage to additional and specified 
broad perils.
Basic perils are losses to your property resulting from
Fire
• 
Lightning
• 
Wind (tornado or hurricane)
• 

Chapter 7 | Insuring Your Property
86
Hail
• 
Riot or civil commotion
• 
Aircraft collision
• 
Vehicle collision
• 
Smoke
• 
Vandalism or malicious mischief
• 
Explosion
• 
Theft
• 
Volcanic eruption
• 
To these basic perils, the broad form of homeowner’s coverage adds losses to 
your property resulting from
Falling objects (for example, tree limbs)
• 
Weight of ice, snow, or sleet
• 
Accidental discharge from a sprinkler, heating, or 
• 
­air-conditioning system
Sudden and accidental damage toa hot water tank or 
• 
­air-conditioning, heating, or sprinkler system
Freezing of a plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, or sprin-
• 
kler system
Sudden and accidental damage from an artificially 
• 
­generated electrical current (for example, an electrical 
generator)
As a homeowner, generally, you do not want either an HO-1 or HO-2 policy 
that specifies named perils. Rather, you should ask for an HO-3 type of 
policy that provides for special or open peril coverage. Open peril ­coverage 
means you are protected against all losses (even from unknown perils) 
unless the cause of that loss is specifically excluded under the terms of the 
policy. In addition, many companies offer a rider to an HO-3 policy (known 
as an HO-15 endorsement) whereby you can also provide for open peril 
­coverage on all the personal property included within your dwelling. Still 
other ­companies have combined the HO-3 policy and HO-15 endorsement 
into one standard HO-5 policy. If you can obtain an HO-5 policy in your 
state, do so, because it provides you with the most protection for each 
­premium dollar you expend.

Plan Your Financial Future
87
You should also be aware that many insurance companies that write property 
insurance policies do not call them HO-1, HO-2, and so on, as developed 
by the Insurance Services Office, but instead market them under their own 
proprietary names. Nonetheless, all homeowner’s policies track the coverage 
and limitations that have been mentioned. If you are in doubt, ask your insur-
ance agent to enumerate the types of perils or causes of loss against which 
you are protected, and then check them off from the lists in this chapter.
If you rent an apartment or home, you should ensure that you have an HO-4 
(renter’s insurance) policy. If you are an owner of a condominium or co-op 
property, an HO-6 policy is preferable.
If a centuries-old, historic home is destroyed, insurance coverage is often 
­limited. This is because the cost to rebuild the home using new construction 
materials and methods will very likely exceed the home’s replacement cost. 
As such, only a modified insurance coverage policy, known as an HO-8 policy, 
is available in today’s marketplace. If you live in a much older home, you should 
make sure you have this type of homeowner’s policy.
In summary, Table 7-1 lists the types of homeowner’s policies, categorized by 
the kind and extent of losses covered (basic, broad, or open peril).

What to Consider When Insuring Your 
Automobile
Like homeowner’s insurance, many forms of automobile are available in 
today’s market insurance (four are provided by almost all insurance compa-
nies). However, most types of coverage derive from a standardized form of 
policy known as the personal automobile policy (PAP). The PAP has four 
general coverages for which it provides protection:

Chapter 7 | Insuring Your Property
88
Coverage A: personal liability
• 
Coverage B: medical payments
• 
Coverage C: uninsured motorist coverage
• 
Coverage D: physical damage or loss coverage
• 
Most states have laws that require drivers to obtain a certain amount of 
­personal liability insurance. Increasingly, however, these amounts are not 
generally viewed as sufficient. If you have obtained only the state-minimum 
amount of liability insurance, it is likely that you are underinsured. One way to 
remedy this situation is to purchase additional liability insurance as a part of 
your current policy. But another, often-overlooked solution is to purchase an 
umbrella liability policy from the same company that insures your car, your 
home, or both.
Coverage A: Personal Liability
Personal liability limits are quoted on the basis of either a split-liability limit 
or single-limit liability. If the liability limit is specified using a split liability and 
you are at fault in an accident, the maximum amount that is paid by your 
insurance company is partitioned among several individual limits of cover-
age. For example, if you are quoted a policy with liability coverage limits of 
50/100/25, it means you have protection of up to $50,000 for injuries to one 
individual resulting from an automobile accident, up to $100,000 for injuries 
to all ­individuals per accident, and up to $25,000 per accident for property 
damages to the car you hit and for which you were at fault. Alternatively, if 
the liability limit is a single limit, one maximum amount applies to all bodily 
injuries and property damages per accident, without regard to a per-person 
maximum. In either instance, if the injured party has expenses over and above 
your policy’s personal liability limits, generally they must sue you and hope you 
have sufficient assets to cover those expenses.
A common question about liability insurance concerns for whom this personal 
liability coverage is provided. For example, is liability coverage provided if 
someone borrows your car with your permission? Yes, and it applies whether 
the injured party is related to you or not. For instance, if you lend your car to 
your employer, who then is involved in an accident, your employer is covered 
under your policy for damages to another person or property. However, if 
your employer injures another person or damages property while using your 
car as a delivery vehicle (for a business reason), it is likely that the insur-
ance company will deny coverage under a prevailing liability exclusion in the 
­personal automobile policy. A commercial liability policy would be required 
in this instance.

Another frequently asked question about liability coverage concerns what 
qualifies as a covered automobile for the purposes of liability protection. 
The standard PAP defines a covered vehicle as follows:
Any vehicle shown in the declaration page of the policy 
• 
(that is, your car or cars)
A newly acquired vehicle—however, normally only for a 
• 
period of 30 days (in other words, you need to let the 
insurance company know to extend insurance coverage 
within 30 days of acquiring the new car)
Any trailer owned by the insured
• 
Any car that is being used as a temporary substitute auto-
• 
mobile (such as a rental car or loaner)
Be careful! Your insurance company may have a different, lesser time period 
under which it insures a newly acquired vehicle for collision coverage (for 
example, only 14 days). As a result, it is good practice to notify your insurance 
company agent or broker as soon as you purchase a new car and ask them 
how to optimally insure the car in your state.
Coverage B: Medical Payments
This type of coverage pays your medical bills and those of your family or any 
other occupant of the car if you are hurt in an automobile accident. It also cov-
ers any medical expenses that you may incur as a result of being struck by an 
automobile while you are a pedestrian. However, any payments that are made 
to you as a result of the liability coverage of another driver who is at fault 
reduce your medical payments coverage. Furthermore, if you collect under 
your employer’s group or individual health insurance policy, doing so may 
reduce pro rata the amount of benefits you can collect under Coverage B.
Coverage C: Uninsured Motorist’s Coverage
Uninsured motorist’s insurance is an agreement that pays the amount the 
insured could have collected from the insurance company of a negligent driver 
if the driver had maintained automobile insurance. Logically, given state laws 
requiring personal liability insurance on the part of all drivers, uninsured 
motorist’s coverage makes little sense. Nevertheless, practically, such cover-
age is necessary for your or your family’s adequate protection. The persons 
insured under uninsured motorist’s coverage might be you, your family mem-
bers, and any other occupant of your vehicle at the time of an accident.

Chapter 7 | Insuring Your Property
90
Like Coverage A of the PAP, the higher the bodily injury limits under Coverage 
C, the better. As a recommended limit, if you are quoted a split-liability policy, 
you should obtain at least $250,000 per individual and $500,000 per accident 
of uninsured motorist’s coverage. If you are quoted a single-liability policy, the 
higher limit of $500,000 is preferable. Given the fact that uninsured motor-
ist’s coverage essentially acts as a secondary liability policy, many insureds use 
their personal liability limits as the limit for uninsured motorist’s protection 
(without the property damage component).
Coverage D: Physical Damage or Loss Coverage
Physical damage protection for your car is available through two separate 
types of coverage under the PAP:
1.	 Collision coverage applies whenever your car hits another 
car, a fence, a telephone pole, a tree, or a building (essen-
tially, any inanimate object). Collision coverage pays for 
damages to your car regardless of who was at fault in an 
accident.
2.	 Other-than-collision, or comprehensive, coverage is for 
property damage to your car that results from some-
thing other than collision, such as a broken windshield, 
damage from fire or hail, theft, or damage from collision 
with animals.
Depending on the company issuing the policy, physical damage coverage may 
or may not apply for rental cars. Typically, for short-term rentals (less than  
30 days), coverage is afforded; however, the issue is much less clear for longer-
term rentals. You should check with your insurance company before rent-
ing a car for longer than a month, because you likely are not covered. As a 
­substitute (unless you are renting a car in certain foreign countries), you may 
be able to obtain coverage if you rent the car with a major credit card, such 
as MasterCard, Visa, or American Express.
You can reduce your car insurance premium substantially if you choose the 
highest deductible available with respect to collision and comprehensive 
­coverage. Better yet, if you can afford the loss of a car damaged beyond repair 
(totaled), purchasing physical damage coverage of any form probably is not wise. 
If your car is financed and pledged as collateral for a loan, the lender generally 
requires physical damage coverage, regardless of its estimated salvage value.

No-Fault Insurance
The traditional method of settling claims resulting from an automobile ­accident 
is through the tort system of state law. A tort is a civil wrong wherein one 
driver generally is found to be at fault in an accident. (Negligence is the most 
common example of a tortuous act.) Under the tort system of liability, the at-
fault driver’s insurance carrier is required to pay for damages suffered by the 
other parties to the accident. This means that if you are the driver at fault in 
an accident, your insurance company will likely either raise your premiums or, 
worse, cancel any further coverage.
An alternative method of settling claims is the no-fault insurance system. In this 
system, the insured’s insurance company pays the insured for their damages 
and then seeks reimbursement from the at-fault driver and their insurer. Most 
states that employ a no-fault system have adopted a modified form that permits 
a lawsuit by the injured party only when the insured’s policy limits are exceeded. 
However, to combat the rising costs of premiums, many states are abandoning 
the no-fault system altogether and returning to the tort liability system.
Umbrella Liability Insurance
Umbrella liability policies are extended personal liability insurance—that is, they 
supplement or add to your existing, or underlying, personal liability coverage 
under your homeowner’s or automobile policy. For example, if you are sued 
for negligence in an automobile accident and the plaintiff wins a verdict of  
$1.0 million in damages, an umbrella policy will cover you for this amount, even 
though the underlying maximum limit on your personal automobile policy for 
injuries to all individuals is only $300,000.
An umbrella liability policy may not only increase your liability coverage 
amounts, but also often broaden such coverage. Most automobile and hom-
eowner’s policies exclude the risks of libel or slander from liability protection; 
in contrast, an umbrella policy typically includes them. Additional risks may be 
covered by an umbrella policy, although, because most policies are customized 
to the needs of the insured, the covered risks may vary. Keep in mind that the 
nature of an umbrella policy limits the number of claims that the insurance 
company experiences and potentially has to pay.
The premiums charged for umbrella coverage are relatively inexpensive. This 
is primarily because an umbrella policy is written on an excess basis—the 
policy only pays when the underlying coverage limits from your automobile 
or homeowner’s policy or both have been used up. When the umbrella policy 
is the only coverage for a claim (for example, if slander is alleged and proven), 
the policy typically has its own deductible or self-insured retention amount, 
which may be as high or low as the insured chooses. Alternatively, if the liability 

Chapter 7 | Insuring Your Property
92
claim is covered by one of the underlying policies (for example, automobile 
negligence), the deductible for the underlying policy is also effectively the 
deductible for the umbrella.
You should think of an umbrella policy exactly as the name implies. The excess 
coverage provided by the “umbrella” protects you against sizable damage 
amounts that may be awarded as a result of litigation. Purchasing umbrella 
coverage is particularly important for individuals who are often the subject of 
lawsuits, including professionals (lawyers, doctors, accountants, engineers, and 
so on) and any person of higher net worth. Be aware that any claim arising 
out of a business activity in which you or any other insured are engaged is not
covered under an umbrella policy; rather, to be protected against these types 
of claims, a professional liability policy (typically, a malpractice or errors-and-
omissions policy) is necessary.
Business Property Insurance
There are two types of business property insurance: a commercial package 
policy (CPP) and a business owner’s policy (BOP). The type of policy you purchase 
depends on the size and organizational form of your business. For example, the 
CPP is usually required by larger businesses, typically corporations, whereas 
the BOP is designed for small to medium businesses, usually operating in an 
unincorporated form as a sole proprietorship or partnership.
The CPP combines commercial property, liability, and business automobile 
coverage into a single policy. As a result, each part of the CPP specifies 
covered business property, an applicable deductible, valuation provisions, and 
a requisite cause of loss. In practical effect, these types of property coverage 
are very similar to a homeowner’s policy, but they are much broader and 
comprehensive in scope. Hence, the advantage of listing and insuring business 
property in this manner is that there are fewer gaps in coverage. In addition, 
you may achieve administrative savings that can lead to lower premiums.
The general liability portion of the CPP protects the business against legal 
liability arising from business activities, excepting injuries incurred by employ-
ees while on the job, for which separate worker’s compensation insurance is 
needed. Typically, the CPP includes additional coverage for business automo-
bile liability, but all claims arising out of employee injury must be handled as 
part of the worker’s compensation policy that most businesses are required to 
maintain by state law. It is also possible to write a separate policy for commer-
cial general liability, although this may result in additional cost to the business.
The BOP, on the other hand, is specifically designed for the needs of small- to 
medium-sized businesses and covers all business-related real and personal 
property without a separate listing. There are two forms of this policy: basic 
and special. The basic form covers the possibility of loss from all listed  perils, 

Plan Your Financial Future
93
and the special form covers loss from all perils not excluded. All forms of the 
BOP cover liability for bodily injury and property damage caused by ­employees 
while engaged in an activity on behalf of the business.
If you are business owner, you should be aware that there is another type 
of policy that protects business property while that property is in transit 
to another location. This is known as an inland marine policy and covers 
domestic goods while they are being moved from one location to another, 
mobile equipment and property, and certain types of property that are still in 
the dealer’s store (such as inventory). The term inland marine has nothing to 
do with water or oceanic activities, as the name may seem to imply.
We have now concluded our look at personal and property risk exposures 
and how to insure them. However, if you are employed, additional forms of 
insurance benefits may be available to you in group form. Such forms, along 
with other benefits commonly offered by an employer, are the subject of our 
next chapter.

Optimizing Your 
Employment 
Benefits
Our discussion on how to protect your wealth concludes with this chapter on 
how best to take advantage of benefits offered by your employer. Unlike the 
humorous television commercial, benefits offered by your employer do not 
come from France (“French benefits”) but rather are commonly referred to 
as fringe benefits. The nature and amount of fringe benefits you receive from 
your workplace depends on your employer, its current and future cash flow, 
and its attitude toward providing (usually) tax-free benefits to its employees. 
Typically, employers offer fringe benefits not only for competitive reasons, 
but also because they receive an income-tax deduction for doing so, which 
thereby assists them with the management of their future cash flow.
Perhaps the most popular benefit for employees that has evolved throughout 
the years is employer-provided group medical and dental insurance. Other 
common benefits are group term life insurance coverage, accidental death 
insurance coverage, group long-term disability coverage, dependent care 
assistance (usually through some form of flexible spending account), educa-
tional assistance, and group long-term care insurance. In addition, employers 
recently have implemented retirement savings options, such as the Section 
401(k) retirement plan (so-named after the Internal Revenue Code section 
of the same number). Finally, executives of companies may have special or dis-
criminatory benefits established to encourage performance goals.

tage of these benefits to help meet your financial goals.
Group Medical and Dental Insurance
In Chapter 5, we discussed what an informed purchaser of health care ser-
vices should take into account before selecting a health insurance policy. 
However, most wage earners only have the option of selecting whatever 
group medical and dental plans are offered by their employer. Historically, the 
most popular type of group medical plan provided by employers has been 
comprehensive major medical coverage, sometimes known as fee-for-service 
programs. Recently, though, managed care plans such as HMOs and PPOs have 
come onto the scene; and more recently still, employers have begun to offer 
a close cousin of the health savings account (HSA): the health reimbursement 
arrangement (HRA).
An HRA is an employer-sponsored HSA that permits employees to accumu-
late funds for health expenses. Unlike with an HSA, however, there is no limit 
on the amount of money an employer may contribute to the employee’s HRA. 
Employers offering HRAs typically pair them with a high-deductible group 
health insurance plan in order to cover any sizable medical expenses incurred 
by the employee. Once the funds set aside in the HRA by the employer are 
used up in a given year, the employee’s health expenses are then covered by 
the high-deductible plan after the deductible and co-insurance requirements 
are met. If any funds remain in the HRA at the end of the year, these funds 
may be carried over to the following year, which allows employees to “save” 
for their future medical expenses.
A major advantage of an HRA from the point of view of the employee is that 
preventative care, such as routine physicals and child immunizations, is not 
charged against the fund. In addition, because of the savings element associ-
ated with the arrangement, HRA participants have an incentive to use their 
health care dollars wisely. Employers, for their part, like HRAs because they 
help minimize health-care insurance costs: the underlying policy providing 
coverage has a high deductible, and the policy may never be used by relatively 
healthy employees.
Unfortunately, most group dental insurance coverage plans have not yet 
adopted the HRA approach to payment of expenses. Most dental insurance 
uses managed care as a model, operating either as an HMO or PPO. If you 
have a dental HMO, the premium payments on your group coverage are sent 
directly to your dentist or specialist. If your plan is structured as a PPO, a net-
work of participating dentists has agreed to provide services for a reduced fee 
to group insureds. You may go out of the network to an unaffiliated provider, 
but you pay a higher deductible and co-payment to do so.

Plan Your Financial Future
97
In summary, unless you participate in an HRA at work, your group medical 
plan probably provides you with little incentive to save your health care dol-
lars. Further, the high cost of paying for your own medical care will likely dis-
suade you from purchasing an individual policy. As a result, you have to seek 
ways of paying for your share of the group medical costs (deductibles and 
co-payments) in as tax-efficient a way as possible, such as by participating in a 
flexible spending account (FSA). You should also turn your attention to other 
employment-provided benefits that may need to be supplemented with indi-
vidual coverage, such as life insurance and disability income insurance.
Group Life Insurance
The most common form of life insurance offered by employers is group term 
insurance. By its nature, this form of insurance is temporary and covers you 
only for a specific period, normally only as long as you work for the employer 
that is providing coverage. As such, you need to keep in mind that you will 
probably lose coverage when you leave your job. However, at that point in 
time, you typically will have the opportunity to convert your group term cov-
erage into some form of permanent insurance (either whole life or universal 
life) offered by the same insurance company. Generally, this conversion privi-
lege is available for only 30 to 60 days following the date the employee is no 
longer employed. But if you take advantage of it, the privilege of converting is 
usually a guaranteed benefit (you cannot be denied coverage regardless of your 
health status at the time).
Group term insurance is generally offered to employees as a multiple of their 
salary. For example, the death benefit provided by the policy is one or two 
times the employee’s current salary. Often, however, the employer portion of 
this benefit is capped at a specified amount, usually $50,000. This is because 
the employee is limited to a $50,000 cost-of-coverage exclusion under tax 
law before they must be attributed some cost of the protection as a taxable 
employee benefit. Stated another way, if the employer pays for more than 
$50,000 of group term life insurance on your life, you must report the eco-
nomic benefit of the extra insurance as income. (It is typically reported on the 
IRS Form W-2 at the end of the year.) Fortunately, this attributed amount of 
income is relatively small, and the cost that the employer pays for the insur-
ance is still probably much less than you would have to pay if you tried to 
obtain the insurance coverage on your own. Plus, as mentioned previously, you 
probably have the right to convert the group term insurance once you have 
left that employer.
Nevertheless, even with group term insurance coverage, you should analyze 
whether you have enough life insurance protection. Don’t assume you have 
enough coverage simply with what the insurance provides; and remember, 
unless you convert, you will lose the insurance when you leave the job. Rather, 

Chapter 8 | Optimizing Your Employment Benefits
98
look at the group term coverage only as a starting point to be supplemented 
with individual life insurance, either an individual term or a permanent 
policy—or perhaps both.
Another commonly provided group insurance is accidental death benefit  
(ADB) insurance, sometimes referred to as double indemnity insurance. 
Historically, this type of insurance has been purchased as a rider to a group 
life policy and doubles the death benefit payable to an employee’s beneficiary 
if death results from an accident while the employee is conducting employer 
business. Like group term insurance coverage, the ADB is typically limited in 
amount. However, this is to minimize employer cost and not to minimize the 
income tax consequences for the employee. If you have ADB insurance pro-
tection, consider yourself one of the lucky few, because increasing numbers of 
employers are dropping such coverage. Moreover, it is difficult to envision a 
situation in which your need for life insurance protection is greater in the case 
of accidental death than it is under normal circumstances of death. Therefore, 
the doubling of the benefit is essentially free money that you would not have 
otherwise provided for your heirs.
More and more employers are offering group permanent types of life insurance 
policies to their employees—notably, group universal life insurance. A group 
universal life insurance policy is very similar in structure and provisions to 
an individual universal life policy, except that the group coverage is provided 
(up to a limit) without any evidence of insurability. Therefore, an employee in 
poor health who may not be able to qualify for individual coverage may obtain 
insurance through group underwriting. Also, unlike group term policies, group 
universal life policies are portable, meaning you can take the coverage with you 
when you leave the job (although a higher premium may then be charged).
Group Disability Insurance
Individuals with disability insurance generally receive it through their employer 
in the form of group long-term coverage. (As has been discussed, if your 
employer does not offer you disability insurance, you are unemployed, or you 
are self-employed, the purchase of an individual disability income insurance 
policy is probably one of the best moves you can make to protect your future 
wealth.) A group long-term disability policy normally has an elimination period 
of 30 to 180 days before you can draw benefits, but this period may be even 
longer if the policy is coupled with short-term disability coverage. Therefore, 
you need to find some way to cover your expenses while you wait for the 
long-term benefits to take effect, ideally by maintaining an adequate emer-
gency or contingency fund.
If you are fortunate, your employer also offers short-term disability coverage. 
This coverage may have an elimination period that is as short as seven days 

Plan Your Financial Future
99
for illness and one day for injury. If written to cover illness, short-term 
policies generally function as a kind of sick leave from your job insofar as they 
pay you a specified dollar amount that is not tied to a percentage of your 
monthly compensation—as is the norm with long-term coverage. If written to 
cover injury or disability, the short-term definition of disability that is used is 
usually that of total disability, which precludes payment if you are only partially 
disabled or temporarily experience a loss of income.
Group disability coverage is often less expensive than individual coverage. 
However, it is important to realize that you cannot customize coverage in 
a group policy nearly as effectively as you can with an individual policy. For 
example, in an individual disability policy, you can purchase coverage that will 
pay when you are unable to perform your own occupation. This is generally 
not possible with a group long-term policy that uses a combination of Any 
Occupation and Modified Any Occupation definitions of disability. Additionally, 
the group policy may not provide you with a cost-of-living increase in benefits 
(as is possible with the purchase of a rider to an individual policy). Finally, you 
pay taxes on any disability benefits received from the policy if the employer 
pays the cost of the policy premiums during your employment years.
Group Long-Term Care Insurance
The offering of group long-term care insurance by employers is a relatively 
new phenomenon. As a result of the rising cost of long-term care (and the 
relative paucity of government-provided benefits to assist in the payment of 
this cost), more employers are encouraging their employees to plan for this 
need and are helping them do so through group insurance plans.
There are essentially three types of group long-term care plans, and the one 
that is right for you depends on the status of your current health. The most 
liberal and favorable type of these group long-term care policies (but also the 
most expensive) is a true group policy. This type of policy is underwritten as 
guaranteed issue, meaning no employee can be denied coverage, even if they 
already have a debilitating health condition that would preclude them from 
otherwise obtaining coverage. The price for this coverage is high, in part to 
discourage what is known in the insurance industry as adverse selection—
meaning the sickest and most disabled employees are most likely to want 
coverage.
A secondary form of true group long-term care policy is known as a modified 
guaranteed issue policy. This type of policy uses no medical underwriting but 
asks one or more disqualifying questions intended to eliminate the sickest 
and most disabled employees from the plan. The premiums are lower on 
modified guaranteed issue policies, and if you are relatively healthy (and could 
otherwise qualify for individual coverage), a policy of this nature could prove 
preferable to a true group policy.

Chapter 8 | Optimizing Your Employment Benefits
100
The third type of group long-term care plan—the individual long-term care 
plan—is offered to employers for group coverage to their employees on a 
discounted basis (typically, anywhere from 5 to 15 percent below the individ-
ual plan premium). Although these types of plans are medically underwritten 
(in other words, they are neither guaranteed issue nor modified guaranteed 
issue), they allow for more benefit options for employees. Employers like to 
“carve out” these policies for a select group of employees (usually executives), 
because the benefits are significant but the policies cost much less than true 
group policies. If you are an executive in a company, a discounted individual 
long-term care plan is probably best for you.
If you currently do not have a group long-term care policy available to you 
as an employee, ask your human resources department to investigate the 
possibility of offering such a benefit. It is possible to offer a group policy on a 
ten-year paid-up basis—something that is generally not available with an indi-
vidually obtained policy. Oh, and one last thing: the frequency of claims made 
on individual long-term care policies is relatively high—so high that many 
insurance companies are choosing not to enter the long-term care market 
or are getting out of the business of underwriting individual long-term care 
policies altogether. Accordingly, that is all the more reason you should be 
investigating whether your employer will offer a group policy for the benefit 
of all employees.
Dependent Care Assistance
Your employer can provide you with a substantial amount of dependent care 
assistance as a nontaxable fringe benefit. Currently, you can take advantage of 
up to $5,000 per year of such benefits per family (or the total amount of the 
lower-paid spouse’s salary, if less than $5,000) without having to include this 
assistance in your taxable income. If your employer does not provide you with 
dependent care assistance, you may alternatively wish to reduce your salary 
and contribute $5,000 to a FSA on your own behalf. Two primary reasons for 
doing so are
1.	 You can pay dependent care costs, such as full-time child 
care, after-school day care, or the cost of a nanny, out 
of this account and receive reimbursement on a tax-free 
basis.
2.	 You never pay any income or Social Security tax on the 
amount you contribute to the account; as such, you are 
contributing to the account from your paycheck on a 
pretax basis.

Plan Your Financial Future
101
You also need to be aware of two related income tax consequences as you 
consider whether to fund an FSA in order to pay for child care expenses:
1.	 You may not claim the child and dependent care tax credit 
for any child-care cost that is reimbursed out of the 
account (in other words, it is an either/or proposition).
2.	 You lose any amount contributed to the account that is 
not spent on employment-related child-care costs during 
the year. Unlike an HSA, where you can use the account 
as a savings vehicle for the next and subsequent years, an 
FSA is contributed to on a use-it-or-lose it basis.
As a general rule, the higher your taxable income, the more advantageous it is 
for you to use the FSA salary reduction in the payment of child-care expenses. 
Conversely, the lower your taxable income, the less advantageous the salary 
reduction and the more valuable the child and dependent care tax credit.
Do not overlook the possibility of dependent care assistance for more than 
your young child or children. Under current law, the tax exclusion is available 
not only for expenses incurred on behalf of a dependent child under the age 
of 13, but also for any individual who is physically or mentally incapable of 
caring for themselves and who resides with the taxpayer in their principal 
place of residence for more than six months out of the year. Therefore, the 
$5,000 exclusion from income is also potentially available to help pay for 
dependent elderly parents or a dependent spouse for whom you are the 
primary caregiver.
Employer Educational Assistance
Some employers, particularly those who need highly skilled employees, offer 
educational assistance benefits to their workers. In most instances, under 
employer rules to achieve reimbursement, employers offer payment assis-
tance only for educational expenses that are job-related. However, under cur-
rent tax law, an exclusion from employee income of up to $5,250 per year 
for educational assistance is permanently allowed, even for non-job-related 
educational courses. Further, the exclusion is not limited to continuing educa-
tion programs; the employer payment may be in reimbursement for either 
undergraduate or graduate degree courses. As a result, you may be able to 
obtain and be reimbursed for that doctoral degree in underwater basket-
weaving you have always wanted.
There is a second related educational benefit in tax law that you may be able 
to take advantage of without getting your employer involved. This is an item-
ized tax deduction for un-reimbursed educational expenses that you pursue 
in advancement of your career. As you might suspect, this education must 

Chapter 8 | Optimizing Your Employment Benefits
102
be related to your career. For example, if you are an accountant, pursuing a 
master’s degree in accounting qualifies as job-related education. The major 
issue here for many young fast-track employees is whether educational costs 
expended for a master’s degree in business administration qualify for the tax 
break. Generally, the answer is yes; however, if your current job is significantly 
unrelated to traditional business activities (say, you are a professional musi-
cian), you may find it difficult to make a strong argument that the deduction 
should be permitted. Regardless, if you do qualify and itemize your tax deduc-
tions, you may be able to offset some of the costs of advancing your career.
Saving for Retirement through  
Employer-Sponsored Plans
In recent years, employer-provided plans designed to provide for retirement 
have undergone major changes. Historically, employers promised their employ-
ees a pension (guaranteed retirement income) at a certain age (usually 65)  
as long as the employee completed a specified number of years of service. 
As such, the employer assumed the risk of investment performance on the 
retirement monies that were set aside with the intention of making good on 
its pension promise.
Beginning in the 1990s, the methodology of providing for an employee’s retire-
ment began to change from a guaranteed employer-provided pension to one 
where employees were made responsible for their own financial future. In 
other words, defined contribution retirement plans—in which the amount of 
retirement benefit is not guaranteed but rather depends on the employee’s 
own investment expertise to accumulate the needed savings—became pre-
dominant. According to Boston College’s Center for Investment Research, 
among workers with retirement plans, 83 percent had traditional employer-
provided pensions in 1980. This percentage was down to 21 percent in 2012, 
according to a survey undertaken by members of the Society for Human 
Resources Management.
However, there was a major problem in the shift away from pensions and 
toward defined-contribution plans: most employees did not possess the invest-
ment expertise to optimally plan for their own retirement. This is still the 
case today. Recent legislation has been passed to make it easier for employers 
to assist employees with their retirement investment decisions, but employ-
ees generally are not yet well-educated enough to take on the responsibility 
of making retirement plan investment choices. Hopefully, after finishing this  
book, you will feel more comfortable about making such choices. If not,  
I strongly urge you to seek the assistance of a Certified Financial Planner 
(CFP) professional.

Section 401(k) Retirement Plans
Many employees today are participating in one or more types of defined-
contribution retirement plans at work, but the Section 401(k) plan has 
become the savings plan of choice. Although many employees believe that 
employers match a percentage of their 401(k) plan contributions primarily 
for altruistic reasons, this is not usually the employers’ motivation. Rather, 
special nondiscrimination tests must be met before the employer can 
offer and maintain a 401(k) plan on behalf of any employee, including highly 
compensated employees, whose job satisfaction and performance are the 
employer’s primary concern. Because highly compensated employees are the 
kind of employees most likely to already contribute to a Section 401(k) plan, 
the employer needs to motivate non-highly compensated employees to con-
tribute to satisfy nondiscrimination tests under law. As a result, employers 
typically encourage non-highly compensated employees to contribute via a 
matching-of-employee-contributions program.
According to Fidelity Investments and its excellent publication Building Futures, 
the average 401(k) plan contribution (or salary deferral percentage) in the year 
2010 was 8.2 percent. However, only approximately 75 percent of employees 
actually participate in 401(k) plans, per the Center for Retirement Research 
at Boston College. This means the net employee-only savings rate was only 
6.15 percent (8.2 percent times 75 percent). Even with a 3 percent employer 
match of employee contributions (the most common matching-of-employee 
contributions in the United States is 50 percent of the first 6 percent of 
salary deferrals), the aggregate, total employer-plus-employee savings rate is 
only 8.4 percent (8.2 percent plus 3 percent times 75 percent). This is not 
nearly enough for most 401(k) plan participants to live adequately during their 
retirement years. Instead, the rate should be between a 10 and 15 percent 
annual aggregate savings rate.
If you are lucky enough to work for an employer that sponsors a Section 
401(k) plan, the first thing you must do is participate. You should then elect 
to defer on a pretax basis as much of your salary as possible into the 401(k) 
plan. (Note: Although there are annual dollar limits on how much you can 
defer, these limits are usually important only for highly compensated employ-
ees, such as corporate executives.) Certainly, you should be deferring at least 
3 percent of your salary (or whatever percentage your particular employer 
will match), because doing so results in a guaranteed 100 percent investment 
return on your money. But beyond that, a total annual contribution of at 
least 10 percent of your own money should be your goal. If you are closer to 
retirement and have wasted the prime saving years of your 30s and 40s, you 
will need to save an even greater percentage of your current income to fund 
retirement. Either that or you will need to consider one of two unpleasant   
alternatives: 1) work longer and extend your planned retirement date, or   
2) reduce your post-retirement standard of living.

As a result of the Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006, many 401(k) plans 
are adopting automatic enrollment plans. This alternative, also known as a 
negative election, allows an employer to enroll employees in its Section 401(k) 
plan without the employee’s consent, as long as the employee has the right 
to opt out of contributing. Some employers are also supplementing the 
automatic enrollment with a progressive savings feature, meaning they auto-
matically increase an employee’s savings deferral percentage by a set amount 
(for example, 1 ­percent) each year that the employee participates in the 
plan. These two features, when used together, may go a long way in helping 
­employees—and particularly those who have opted out in the past—save for 
their own retirement.
As an incentive for offering automatic enrollment, the PPA of 2006 included 
relief from employer liability if the employer provides investment advice to 
401(k) plan participants. To be eligible for this relief, however, the employer’s 
investment advice arrangement must include an unbiased computer model 
certified by an independent expert that creates a recommended portfolio for 
a participant’s consideration. As a result, life-cycle investment funds or target-
date retirement funds are now being adopted as an employer’s default invest-
ment option for employees who are automatically enrolled. Overall, this is not 
a bad thing, particularly if you are an employee who would not save otherwise. 
But if you are at all serious about saving for your own retirement (you’re 
reading this book, aren’t you?), you can probably invest your retirement plan 
contributions more wisely than the default option. At the very least, you—or 
your financial planner—should try!
Section 403(b) Retirement Plans
The Section 403(b) plan, also referred to as a tax-sheltered annuity, is the equiv-
alent of the Section 401(k) plan for employees who work for specified not-
for-profit employers, such as public or private schools, churches, and some 
hospitals. The maximum annual salary reduction contributions for the 403(b) 
plan are generally the same as those allowable for the Section 401(k) plan, 
as are the nondiscrimination rules that must be met by the employer. Today, 
more and more not-for-profit employers are matching the salary reduction 
contributions made by their employees (historically, many 403(b) plans were 
funded solely by employee salary reductions with no employer matching).
However, there are a few differences between the 403(b) and 401(k) retire-
ment plans. Only certain not-for-profit employers (called 501(c)(3) organi-
zations after the Internal Revenue Code section of the same number) may 
implement a 403(b) plan. As mentioned, these employers include schools 
and churches, so if you are a public school elementary or secondary school 
teacher, you probably have a 403(b) plan and not a 401(k) plan. I use the word 
probably here because increasing numbers of not-for-profit employers have 

Plan Your Financial Future
105
been implementing a Section 401(k) plan and adding it to or substituting it for 
a Section 403(b) plan.
Why are not-for-profit employers increasingly adopting Section 401(k) plans 
in lieu of Section 403(b) plans? For starters, a Section 401(k) plan generally 
has more investment choices than the Section 403(b) offering. For example, a 
Section 403(b) plan must be invested in either a fixed or variable annuity or 
mutual funds. It cannot be invested in individual stocks or bonds. Therefore, 
if you are a qualifying not-for-profit employee who likes to play the market, a 
Section 403(b) plan limits your investment options. Another advantage of the 
Section 401(k) plan is that it grants participants the ability to elect a special 
income tax treatment if they choose to take a lump-sum distribution. This 
special election, known as ten-year averaging tax treatment, allows 401(k) plan 
participants born before 1936 to pay income taxes on a lump-sum distribu-
tion in one year as if they were paying it over ten years, thereby significantly 
lowering their tax bill. This option is not available for Section 403(b) plan 
participants.
With the exception of these two advantages of the 401(k) plan, the 403(b) is 
probably the more favorable of the two. We will not discuss the other techni-
cal reasons why this is so, but the 403(b) plan generally beats the 401(k) for 
one big reason: you can contribute more money to the 403(b) plan, the closer 
you are to your planned retirement date. For example, if, as a not-for-profit 
employee, you have worked for the same or another qualifying employer for 
at least 15 years, you may be able to contribute as much as $15,000 per year 
to the plan in addition to the normal contribution limits. As such, you can 
attempt to make up for those years in your 30s and 40s when you did not or 
were not able to adequately save for your own retirement. You cannot do 
this with the 401(k) plan, because the special catch-up annual contribution 
exception doesn’t apply.
Other Retirement Plans
Chapter 16 discusses other employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs, 
when we address distributing your wealth at the time of retirement; but some 
employers offer plans in addition to the Section 401(k) and Section 403(b) 
plans. If they do, they may permit you to make contributions to these plans 
on an after-tax basis. This may not seem like something you want to do, par-
ticularly if you have already maxed out your before-tax contributions to the 
401(k) or 403(b) plan, but consider this: if you contribute after-tax money to 
any employer-sponsored plan, you do not have to pay income taxes on any 
distribution the plan makes of those same funds to you. That is not quite as 
good a deal as the Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), where the investment earnings 
from those after-tax contributions are also generally income tax-free—but it 
is close. As a result, if you have the opportunity to make after-tax contribu-
tions to an employer-sponsored plan and can afford to do so, you should.

Company Stock Purchase Plans
There are two basic types of company stock purchase plans: employee stock 
ownership plans (ESOPs) and employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Both 
plans permit employees to purchase and own employer stock, although, as the 
name implies, only the ESOP permits controlling ownership to be transferred 
to the employees.
If you work for a corporation or incorporated business, the employer may 
have established an ESOP. An unincorporated business, on the other hand, 
such as a sole proprietorship or partnership, cannot have an ESOP, because 
the business has no stock.
So, what is an ESOP? It is a retirement plan designed to invest primarily in 
employer stock. Some closely held (non-publicly traded) corporations also 
establish ESOPs to provide a market for employer stock that would otherwise 
not be very marketable. Thus, when a company establishes an ESOP, its employ-
ees become the market and ultimately the owners of the closely held business.
Aside from the perk of becoming a partial owner of the company for which 
you work, there is another major advantage to contributing to an ESOP: you 
now have a tax-favored retirement plan in which to save for your own retire-
ment. Moreover, once the employer stock is distributed to you at the time of 
retirement, you do not have to pay any capital gains tax on the appreciation of 
the stock (technically known as net unrealized appreciation [NUA]) until 
you sell the shares. This amount of appreciation is then taxed at favorable 
long-term capital gains rates (20 percent or 0 percent in 2013 and beyond, 
depending on your regular income tax bracket) if you have owned the stock 
for at least a year.
In contrast to an ESOP, an ESPP is simply a means for you to own stock 
in your employer under very favorable terms. Typically not structured as a 
retirement plan, but rather as an employee investment option, an ESPP gives 
the employee the right to buy company stock on a future date for an amount 
that is no higher than its current, publicly traded value. If the stock price 
increases between the time this right is granted and the time the employee 
purchases the stock, the employee may choose to buy the stock at the lower 
or discounted price. The tax advantages for ESPPs are generally the same as 
those for ESOPs.
Although company stock purchase plans can offer employees plenty of perks, 
there is a fundamental disadvantage to owning too much employer stock, as 
part of either an ESOP or an ESPP. This disadvantage is the inherent lack of 
portfolio diversification that accompanies ESOPs and ESPPs, so that if the 
company’s financial prospects decline (or, as was case with Enron, liquidation 
results), you are left with an asset of little value. To avoid this problem, you 
should return to the basic asset-allocation principles discussed in Chapter 3  

Plan Your Financial Future
107
and make sure you have diversified into other assets in addition to your 
employer’s stock. If you suspect you are not as diversified as you should be 
and are holding too much of your employer’s stock as a total percentage of 
your portfolio (say, over half of your net worth), I advise you to see your tax 
or investment advisor as soon as possible.
Stock Options and Other Forms  
of Incentive Compensation
This last section about optimizing your employment benefits probably best 
pertains to corporate executives, because they are most likely to be offered 
employer stock options and other forms of incentive compensation. If you are 
such an individual, you should know that two main types of ESOPs are used to 
compensate executives: incentive stock options (ISOs) and nonstatutory or 
regular stock options (also known as nonqualified stock options [NQSOs]), 
both of which are primarily used by larger, publicly traded corporations. 
Neither ISOs nor NQSOs are used much by closely held corporations, includ-
ing family businesses operated as corporations, because the few owners of a 
closely held corporation typically do not want or need unrelated outsiders or 
even executives as additional owners.
An ISO plan is a tax-favored, written arrangement for compensating executives 
by awarding them options to buy employer stock. Unlike regular stock options, 
ISOs generally do not result in regular taxable income to the executive either 
at the time of the grant or at the time the executive exercises the option (pur-
chases the employer stock for which the option was granted). In other words, 
there is no regular taxable consequence to the executive until they sell the 
employer stock, the timing of which is completely at the executive’s discretion.
The favorable income tax consequence associated with ISOs is not available 
with NQSOs, which are much more prevalent than ISOs. When the executive 
exercises a regular stock option (purchases the employer stock), they have 
taxable compensation income to the extent of the difference between the fair 
market value of the shares at the date of purchase and the greatly discounted 
option price. In addition, the employer must withhold and pay Social Security 
tax and Medicare tax with respect to this compensation income.
Why, if the tax consequences are much more favorable for the executive with 
an ISO than a regular stock option, is the regular stock option much more 
prevalent? There are two reasons:
1.	 At the time of exercising the ISO, the executive incurs 
an alternative minimum tax consequence—an exceed-
ingly disadvantageous tax where the taxpayer must pay a 
greater amount than the already high regular tax liability.

Chapter 8 | Optimizing Your Employment Benefits
108
2.	 Unless extraordinary circumstances occur, the employer 
or company that grants the ISO to an executive does 
not ever receive a corporate income tax deduction for 
the compensation, thereby potentially disrupting the cash 
flow of the company.
If you are an executive holding a regular stock option or numerous options, 
you can anticipate that, at the date of exercising these options, there will be 
income tax due. So, what do you do if you do not have the cash or other 
liquid assets necessary to pay this tax? A viable planning strategy is to under-
take what is known as a cashless exercise of options, which takes place in three 
steps:
1.	 Exercise the regular option or options at the specified 
date, and borrow from a stockbroker the money needed 
to exercise the options.
2.	 Simultaneously sell at least the number of shares neces-
sary to cover any costs, including taxes due on the exer-
cise of the options and any broker’s commission that is 
charged on the sale of the shares.
3.	 Ask your employer to pay you the net amount remain-
ing after the sale of the shares in cash or stock and then 
retain any additional shares for a subsequent sale date of 
your own choosing.
Another planning alternative is to defer the taxation of these options by 
combining the options with a subsequent agreement entered into with your 
employer that restricts your access to the shares purchased until a later time, 
such as your planned retirement date.
Restricted Stock
Recently, more executives have been receiving incentive compensation in the 
form of restricted stock instead of stock options. This trend is taking place 
partially because of the corporate abuses that have occurred with options, 
including the backdating of the exercise date of options to a more favorable 
time for the recipient. There is also a more technical reason for this trend: 
under general accounting rules, corporations must now account for the value 
of these options (known as expensing the options) on their income statements. 
In turn, this reduces corporate earnings and, ultimately, perhaps the value of 
the company’s publicly traded stock to its shareholders. As a result, if you 
are an executive, do not be surprised if you are now offered a restricted 
stock incentive-based compensation arrangement instead of stock options. 
Employers may also adopt a restricted stock plan to keep you from going to 

Plan Your Financial Future
109
work for a competitor, specifically providing that if you leave the company for 
a rival business, your right to receive the stock at little or no cost is lost.
The taxation of restricted stock to an executive is essentially similar to that 
of the exercise of a regular stock option. That is, when the restriction expires, 
the difference between the fair market value of the stock when substantially 
vested and what was paid for it, if anything, is taxable compensation income. 
However, unlike with a regular stock option, there is something you can do 
immediately to limit the amount of tax you might end up owing when you exer-
cise restricted stock. If you make a special tax election (commonly referred to 
as a Section 83(b) election after the Internal Revenue Code section of the same 
number) to recognize income as of the date you receive the restricted stock 
rather than when the restriction expires, any subsequent appreciation in the 
value of the stock is treated as capital gains income and is potentially taxable 
at a much lower rate.
For example, assume that you received restricted stock in the year 2013 
when its publicly traded value was $35 per share. You paid nothing for this 
stock. Further, assume that you anticipate that, with your efforts, the value of 
this stock will be $85 per share five years from now (in 2018), which is also 
the date when the restriction of the stock expires. If you make the Section 
83(b) election, you will have $35 of compensation income in the year 2018, 
but $50 of capital gains income ($85 less $35) in 2018, which is taxable at a 
much lower rate (currently, no more than 20 percent). Compare this to $85 
of compensation income in 2018, which is currently taxable at a rate as high 
as 39.6 percent, and you can see why making a Section 83(b) election may be 
a prudent planning technique.
But be careful! What happens if you leave the company and forfeit the stock 
before 2018 but previously had made the Section 83(b) election in 2013? In 
that case, you are not permitted to go back and amend your 2013 tax return 
to claim a $35 per share loss. That’s right: you are gambling that the stock will 
increase in value from the date you make the election and that you will not 
leave the company prior to the restriction expiring.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
We end this chapter with an employee benefit that is available only to a select 
few—the very top echelon of many corporations and businesses. This ben-
efit is a nonqualified deferred compensation agreement, commonly funded 
with life insurance or securities made payable only to the executive or their 
family.
Nonqualified deferred compensation is not that far removed from the 
employer-sponsored retirement plans in which many of us participate. Both 
arrangements are really forms of setting aside current compensation to be 

Chapter 8 | Optimizing Your Employment Benefits
110
paid out later, typically at the employee’s retirement date. However, employer-
sponsored retirement plans generally have to be available to all employees, 
regardless of compensation level and employment status (an exempt or 
nonexempt employee for purposes of labor law). In contrast, nonqualified 
arrangements may discriminate in favor of whomever the employer chooses. 
Usually, these favored employees are the CEO and senior management of the 
company.
If you are lucky enough to be offered any of the several forms of nonquali-
fied deferred compensation such as a rabbi trust, be sure you do not sac-
rifice your future benefit security for a current tax advantage. For example, 
although a mere promise from an employer that it will pay your deferred 
compensation at some point in the future achieves tax deferral, you will have 
sacrificed payment of your current compensation needlessly if the employer 
goes out of business in the future. Fortunately, there are ways to accomplish 
both objectives.
Most deferred-compensation arrangements must be drafted by skilled legal 
counsel. The risk that you, as a valued executive, will not be adequately pro-
tected by your corporate legal office or an outside law firm is relatively small. 
Nevertheless, it is always important to remember that the corporate legal 
office primarily represents the business; it represents you as an employee only 
secondarily. As such, you may wish to secure your own attorney and financial 
planner to advise you on how best to proceed.
This chapter concludes our look at the first part of the PADD process of 
financial planning: that of protecting yourself, your family, and your property. 
We now move on to the second part of the process, accumulating wealth, and 
begin by considering the advantages and disadvantages of investing in financial 
assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

Accumulating 
Wealth

P A R T  

Investing in 
Financial Assets
There are two basic categories of investment assets: financial assets and 
real assets. For the purposes of this chapter, however, we will be discussing 
what most people think of when the term investment is mentioned: financial 
assets, such as stocks and bonds denominated and traded in U.S. ­dollars. To 
be ­properly diversified in financial assets, many financial planners ­recommend 
some ­exposure to foreign markets or assets denominated and traded in 
local (non-U.S. dollar) currencies in addition to maintaining holdings in more 
­traditional investments. But unless investors invest in an American Depository 
Receipt (ADR) of foreign stock, they need to understand that there is a 
­currency or exchange risk when converting the proceeds from a foreign stock 
into U.S. dollars. This is in addition to other systematic risks that are assumed 
when accumulating wealth via financial assets.
Why, with all the inherent risks we discuss in this chapter, should you invest in 
financial assets? The reason is very simple: because to generate an ­investment 
return, you have to assume some form of investment risk. For example, some 
investors believe that if they hoard cash and stuff it in a mattress in their 
basement, they are immune to investment risk—but this isn’t true. Because of 
inflation (also known as purchasing power risk), when the investor is ready to 
spend the cash some years later, they will not have as much money (­purchasing 
power) as when the cash was first stuffed in the mattress.
The key to investing in financial assets and to accumulating wealth ­generally is 
to assume as little investment risk as possible in order to generate as great an 
investment return as possible. The methods required to do this are the subject of 
another book—probably several books—but any serious investor should under-
stand the risk/return relationship and structure their portfolio accordingly.

Cash Investments and When to Use Them
You may think you know what is meant by the term cash—namely, that it is 
green and tangible (you can see and touch it). However, in the investment 
and financial planning world, cash has a very specific meaning. It refers to 
investments that possess a high degree of liquidity with little or no risk to 
principal (the sum of money that you originally invest). Many planners use the 
term cash equivalents to differentiate a cash investment from the more general 
“green and tangible” definition.
In general, cash investments are short-term (not more than 12 months 
in  maturity) interest-bearing securities and deposit accounts. As such, 
cash  investments include not only bank deposits, such as savings accounts, 
certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market deposit accounts, but also 
investments that are made in the money market, including money market 
mutual funds, corporate commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills). 
Sometimes,  patriotic investments, such as the purchase of U.S. government 
Series EE bonds, are also included among cash equivalents. None of these 
investments generate a great deal of investment return, but they are very 
liquid, which is a fundamental attribute of cash equivalents.
Bank Deposits
Many conservative investors do not venture away from bank deposits as an 
investment strategy. This is likely because they prefer the assurance of knowing 
that these deposits (up to a certain limit) are insured by the Federal Deposit 
and Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As a result of relatively recent legislation, 
all non-IRA bank deposits are now insured up to an amount of $250,000 per 
account (up from $100,000 previously). IRAs are also insured up to an amount 
of $250,000 per depositor per bank.
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are probably the most popular form of bank 
deposit. Also known as time deposits, CDs are monies deposited with a bank 
for a specified period of time, usually anywhere from 3 to 12 months. The 
bank typically pays a fixed rate of interest for the term of the certificate, with 
rates increasing with the length of the term. If you redeem the CD and convert 
it to cash prior to its stated expiration or maturity date, a penalty is imposed 
by the bank in the form of a one-time fee or a lower overall  interest rate.
If you have a substantial amount of money to invest (for example, a lump-sum 
distribution from a retirement plan), you may wish to purchase multiple CDs 
rather than investing in only one certificate. In addition, in order to obtain as 
much FDIC insurance as possible, you may wish to purchase each of these 
multiple CDs at a different bank. A viable investment strategy is to sequence 
or ladder the maturity dates of the multiple certificates to take advantage 
of interest rate fluctuations (hopefully up rather than down). For example,   

Plan Your Financial Future
115
if interest rates increase, dividing an investment into two 6-month certificates 
(rather than one 12-month certificate) may be prudent. As each 6-month 
­certificate matures, you can then reinvest it at a higher interest rate without 
penalty.
Many people are unaware that banks also offer money market deposit accounts 
(MMDAs) in addition to standard savings accounts. An MMDA generally pays 
a higher rate of interest than a savings account, but it also requires a minimum 
deposit and account balance to avoid bank fees. Typically, six pre-authorized 
transfers are permitted from the account each month, up to three of which 
may be by personal check. Unlike a money market mutual fund, an MMDA is 
federally insured and for that reason may offer a slightly lower interest rate 
accrual than the money market fund.
Although many investors purchase Series EE bonds through ­payroll-deduction 
plans at their places of employment, you can also obtain these bonds at 
­banking institutions. Also known as savings bonds, Series EE bonds are cash 
investments that must be purchased at 50 percent of their face amount and 
that range in denomination from $50 to $10,000. The value of the bond is 
guaranteed to double after 20 years, after which time it may be extended for 
another 10 years at a fixed rate of interest. An advantage of a savings bond 
is that the interest earned is not taxable until maturity or when the investor 
redeems the bond, unless the investor elects to accrue the interest annually. 
As we will discuss in Chapter 15, when we look at funding your child’s college 
education, there is a special type of EE bond for which the interest is entirely 
income-tax free if the bond’s proceeds are used to pay qualified educational 
expenses, provided the parents’ income does not exceed a certain annual 
amount.
Money Market Deposits
The term money market is used in the investment world to refer to the market 
in which short-term securities are borrowed and re-loaned by financial insti-
tutions. The money market is contrasted to the capital market, which generally 
involves the trading of securities with longer-term maturities or no maturity 
date at all (like a stock). Banks and bank deposits are part of the money 
­market, but the term is used here to refer to cash investments obtained 
through ­brokerage firms and mutual fund companies.
Most investors are familiar with money market mutual funds, if for no other 
reason than because they use such funds as emergency assets and as a ­conduit 
to park money before it is invested somewhere else. An investor who works 
with an investment advisor or financial planner to establish a separate, 
­fee-based account of securities typically uses a money market mutual fund to 
“sweep” money from one investment to another.

Chapter 9 | Investing in Financial Assets
116
Money market mutual funds are offered by mutual fund companies that invest 
in high-quality, short-term investments, such as T-Bills, corporate ­commercial 
paper, bank repurchase agreements, and large CDs. The typical minimum 
investment in the fund is $1,000, and funds may be withdrawn at any time by 
telephone or if the investor has check-writing privileges on the account. Most 
funds also offer owners the ability to wire-transfer money from the fund to a 
bank account.
Although money market mutual funds lack FDIC insurance protection, they 
are very safe, primarily due to the quality of the assets in which they are 
invested. You can also put your money into a tax-exempt money market fund 
that invests only in short-term municipal securities that are backed by full faith 
and credit and the taxing power of the municipality. This backing not only 
increases the potential safety of the fund, but may also increase your after-tax 
return, because interest from municipal securities is typically exempt from 
federal taxes (and may be exempt from state and city taxes as well, if you are 
a resident of the state and city that issued the security).
Another type of money market deposit that you may wish to consider as a sep-
arate cash investment is a T-Bill. T-Bills are sold on a discount-from-face-value 
basis, and the interest portion (the difference between the issue value and the 
face value) is exempt from state and local taxes. T-Bills are offered by the U.S. 
Treasury in denominations of $1,000 and have maturity dates of 4, 13, 26, and  
52 weeks. Most investors find it easier to purchase T-Bills through a local bank, 
but they can also be purchased online at www.treasurydirect.gov/. The ­primary 
T-Bill market is an auction by mail.
T-Bills are very important as a reference for the benchmark short-term ­interest 
rate from which all other short-term rates are established, ­including bank 
CDs. Because the U.S. government stands behind the issuing of all Treasury 
securities, including the short-term Treasury Bill, T-Bills are often said to be 
default-risk free. As such, the investor assumes no credit risk when purchas-
ing the obligation. This is not the case with other debt obligations, such as 
corporate bonds (or even bank CDs in excess of the FDIC limit). Thus, if you 
want to determine what short-term interest rate you will receive on your 
cash investment, start with the 13-week T-Bill rate and add a half-percentage 
point or so for a credit risk premium.
Like any serious investor, you should invest in securities beyond what is 
included in the money market. However, in the wealth-accumulation process, 
you should make sure you always maintain some money (known in the invest-

conditions improve. Regardless, remember that the money market is for 
short-term cash investments, whereas the capital market is for longer-term 
security investments.
Bonds and When to Use Them
Unlike stocks, in which you own an equity interest in the company issuing 
the stock, bonds are debt obligations. In other words, when you purchase a 
bond from an issuer—usually a corporation or government—you are making 
a loan to the issuer in exchange for the right to receive semiannual or annual 
interest payments from that issuer. Given that interest payments from bonds 
are paid on a predictable schedule, you should time the purchase of bonds to 
coincide with when you are interested in receiving regular income payments 
to assist with your ongoing cash flow. Of course, concomitant to this stream 
of income is the expectation that you do not need back your original invest-
ment (the principal of the bond) or loan to the issuer until some known date 
in the future, otherwise referred to as the maturity date of the bond.
Generally speaking, the longer the time until the maturity date of the bond, 
the higher the interest or coupon rate of payment. This is because you are 
loaning your money to the issuer for a longer period of time and thus want 
a higher interest rate for doing so (as with a bank CD). But be careful: the 
amount of interest you will earn depends on the interest rate payable by the 
bond, which is determined by a number of market-related factors, a measure 
of which is represented by something known as the yield curve. This curve is 
published regularly in financial newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and tells 
you roughly how much more interest you are likely to receive the longer you 
commit your money to the issuer of the debt or bond. If this curve is relatively 
flat, you probably will not receive any investment reward for promising the 
issuer the use of your money for a longer period of time. As such, if the trend 
is a flat yield curve, do not invest in bond obligations with a maturity date of 
more than several years. Instead, reinvest your money in another bond issue 
when longer-term interest rates have increased—in other words, when the 
yield curve has turned normal or positive.
Corporate Bonds
Bonds are usually issued by a corporation or government. Corporations issue 
bonds in the form of a secured obligation, known as a mortgage bond, or an unse-
cured promise, known as a debenture. As an investor who may be concerned 

Chapter 9 | Investing in Financial Assets
118
about not getting all of your original investment back at the bond’s maturity 
date (referred to as the bond’s default risk), you may want to limit your pur-
chases only to mortgage bonds, because the corporation pledges property as 
collateral that may be sold in the event of the issuer’s default. However, com-
mensurate with the investment risk/investment return tradeoff, the yield on the 
bond (essentially, the income rate of return) is less on a mortgage bond than 
on a debenture, because you are assuming less risk of possible default.
Corporations may issue bonds that are callable and convertible into stock. 
If the corporation issues a callable bond, that means it can pay off or call the 
obligation before its maturity date. Thus, you will get your money back sooner 
rather than later. However, this result is not as attractive as it may appear. The 
corporation has likely called the bond because market interest rates declined, 
meaning it is less expensive for the corporation to pay off the existing bond 
and issue another one at a lower interest or coupon rate of payment. As an 
investor, you are now confronted with reinvesting the bond proceeds at the 
current, lower interest rate. To protect investors who are relying on the secu-
rity of a fixed payment from the bond, corporations usually issue bonds with 
a provision that they may not be called until a certain number of years have 
passed. Nevertheless, if you have to choose between a callable bond and one 
that is not, choose the noncallable bond.
A convertible bond, on the other hand, gives an investor both the certainty of 
semiannual income payments and the opportunity for significant capital gains 
if the bond is converted into the underlying stock of the issuer. Actually, a 
convertible bond provides the investor with two opportunities for capital 
gains: not only is there the opportunity for underlying stock price apprecia-
tion, but as the stock increases in value, so does the price of the bond. For 
example, assume that a bond convertible into 30 shares of ABC common 
stock is issued at $1,000; and, at the time of issuance, ABC common stock is 
trading for $25 per share. If the price of ABC stock increases to $35 per share, 
the convertible bond now sells for at least $1,300 ($1,000 plus the $300 of 
appreciation in the value of the stock shares).
The primary alternative to a convertible bond is a standard or “plain vanilla” 
bond, which is not convertible into the common stock of the issuer. A ­standard 
bond also may or may not be callable. Since 1998, Treasury bonds must be 
issued as noncallable, but this restriction does not apply to corporate bonds. 
However, given the fact that we are in a period of historically low interest 
rates, and interest rates generally have nowhere to go but up, the risk of a 
corporation actually calling a previously issued bond is very low. Still, a non-
callable and nonconvertible corporate bond carries the possibility of default.
How do you minimize the default risk associated with noncallable and non-
convertible standard corporate bonds? The primary way is to invest only in 
investment-grade bonds, which are bonds of the highest quality or next-to-
highest quality, as rated by one of several bond-rating organizations—notably, 

Plan Your Financial Future
119
Standard & Poor’s or Moody Investors Service. These rating services are not 
infallible, but they can give you guidance in differentiating an investment-grade 
bond from a non-investment-grade, or high-yield, bond. (By the way: a high-
yield bond is not, by definition, a bad investment, although it does involve 
greater default risk than an investment-grade bond.) This is because the issuer 
of a high-yield bond has to offer the bond at a higher interest rate than an 
investment grade bond, indicating that the issuer’s financial stability is weaker 
than that of a normal corporation.
You can use Table 9-1 to help determine what is and is not an investment-grade 
bond, according to Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Generally, you should pur-
chase only investment-grade bonds, because they have the lowest default risk 
as determined by the rating agencies.
Government Bonds
U.S. Treasury notes and bonds are debt obligations of the federal government 
that are primarily distinguished by their maturity dates. A Treasury note is a 
medium-term debt security issued with a maturity date of two, three, five, 
seven, or ten years. The minimum denomination is $1,000, but notes may be 
issued up to a maximum of $1 million. A Treasury bond, on the other hand, 
is a longer-term debt security with a fixed maturity date of more than ten 
years. The Treasury discontinued issuance of the long bond (30-year maturity 
date) in October 2001 but, effective February 2006, resumed the auctioning of 
this bond as an additional method to finance the ever-expanding federal defi-
cit. Interest from U.S. Treasury notes and bonds is paid semiannually to the 
owner and is exempt from state and local taxes. As with U.S. Treasury Bills, if 
the U.S. government issues a note or bond, you do not need to be concerned 
about default risk.

Several other forms of U.S. Treasury securities are popular with conservative 
investors, but we discuss two here. The first is a form of zero-coupon bond 
known as a Treasury Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of 
Securities (STRIP). A zero-coupon bond is a bond for which the semiannual 
interest coupons are not attached but instead are omitted, or stripped off. An 
interest payment is still made on this type of bond, but it is accrued as part of 
the bond principal and payable only at the maturity date. As a potential inves-
tor, you would have an obligation to pay federal taxes on the accrued interest, 
but you would not have any cash from the bond with which to pay them. So, 
where is a Treasury STRIP (or any other form of zero-coupon bond, because 
corporations can also issue them) best positioned? In one of two places, and 
for one of two purposes:
If it is a taxable STRIP, position the bond in a tax-deferred 
• 
account, such as a retirement plan.
If it is a tax-exempt STRIP, include the bond as a part of a 
• 
college education savings program for a child under the 
age of 19.
In both cases, you know with absolute certainty when the STRIP will mature, 
which is the primary attraction of any zero-coupon bond. Further, you also 
know with certainty how much the principal and accrued interest will amount 
to at maturity. As such, you can match the bond’s maturity to the date you 
need the funds to meet your financial goals. This is the beauty of any zero-
coupon bond, but particularly of the Treasury STRIP, because, as an obligation 
of the U.S. government, it also has no default risk.
The second—and an increasingly popular—form of U.S. Treasury security 
(actually, a series of securities) are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities 
(TIPS). TIPS were first issued in 1997 and are now auctioned by the Treasury 
four times each year. They are sold in 5-, 10-, and 30-year maturities and in 
minimum $1,000 denominations. As the name indicates, they are designed 
to offer protection against the effects of inflation. The principal is adjusted 
semiannually to keep pace with inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) over the previous six-month period, but the interest rate remains 
fixed. At the maturity date, you receive the greater of the inflation-adjusted 
principal value of the security or its face value at the time of issue.
Simply stated, if you invest in TIPS, you are taxed annually on the interest pay-
ment plus the appreciation in the face value of the security once adjusted for 
inflation. However, you do not receive the inflation-adjusted principal until the 
security is sold or matures (more than likely the latter, because you should 
look at TIPS as a longer-term investment). To avoid this investment vehicle’s 
potentially adverse tax consequences, it is best to hold TIPS in a tax-deferred 
account, such as a retirement plan or a Roth IRA. If you are the treasurer 

Plan Your Financial Future
121
of a tax-exempt organization, consider TIPS as a possible investment for the 
nontaxable entity.
Municipal Bonds
State and local governments typically issue bonds to finance long-term ­projects, 
such as road improvement or other infrastructure needs. Such bonds come 
in two types: general obligation bonds and revenue bonds, although a third 
type of hybrid bond—a private purpose bond—is increasingly being used to 
finance football stadiums and the like. General obligation and revenue bonds 
are issued by public municipalities, whereas private purpose bonds may be 
shared with a private developer or sports promoter. In addition, general obli-
gation bonds are backed by the taxing authority of the municipality and as 
such are safer than revenue bonds, which must depend on the revenue from 
a specific project to pay the bondholders. As a result of their relative safety, 
general obligation bonds feature a lower interest rate than revenue bonds.
Historically, municipal bonds have been most attractive to high-income tax-
payers because their semiannual interest payments are generally free from 
federal income tax and may also be free from state and local taxes in some 
­circumstances. You can easily compute what your after-tax return from a 
municipal bond will be if you know your marginal income-tax bracket 
and the coupon rate or nominal yield of the municipal bond. Once you have 
computed your after-tax return, you should then compare this return to the 
return you would receive on a taxable obligation, such as a corporate bond, 
to determine the higher-paying investment.
For example, assume you are trying to decide whether to purchase a municipal 
bond (only federal-income-tax free) featuring a tax-exempt yield of 5 percent 
or a corporate bond yielding 7 percent. Also assume you are currently pay-
ing taxes in the highest marginal federal income-tax bracket of 39.6 percent. 
To compute your after-tax return on the municipal bond, use the following 
formula:
(
)
(
)
Tax
exempt yield

In this example, your after-tax return on the municipal bond is 8.28 percent 
(0.05 divided by (1 - 0.396)). This compares to the corporate bond yield of  
7 percent, so you should likely invest in the municipal bond. It also means you 
probably should not purchase the corporate bond until its yield-to-maturity 
exceeds 8.28 percent.

Chapter 9 | Investing in Financial Assets
122
It is also possible to invest in a municipal bond or tax-exempt mutual fund, 
usually as part of a money market mutual fund. However, if you do so, you lose 
control over the time at which you have to recognize capital gains from the 
sale of bonds. This is a distinct disadvantage of investing in bonds via a bond 
mutual fund.
Bonds as a Part of Your Portfolio
It is a common misconception that as people age, they become more finan-
cially conservative, meaning that safety of principal and reliable income from 
that principal are paramount. Savvy investors—even retirees—know that 
protection of purchasing power and achieving an after-tax return in excess of 
inflation are just as important as safety of principal and preserving the value 
of the original investment. As mentioned when we discussed asset allocation 
in Chapter 3, an argument can be made for the inclusion of stocks and stock 
mutual funds in any retiree’s portfolio. However, bonds also play an important 
diversification role.
Certainly, a primary relationship that you must understand before investing in 
an individual bond is that bond prices move in the opposite direction of mar-
ket interest rates. Hence, if you believe that interest rates will probably decline 
in the future, you should have a position in bonds, because sizable capital gains 
are likely. This was proven in the bear market of late 2007 to mid-2009, when 
bond returns significantly exceeded that of stocks and interest rates declined 
at the same time. In addition, if interest rates are likely to decline, you should 
also buy long-term bonds, because they will appreciate more in price than 
shorter-term issues.
Beyond that, as the stock market exhibits volatility—seemingly random price 
movements up and down—bonds compete with stocks for investors’ money. 
If the stock market declines in price, investors seek a positive return and, 
more important, safety—and next to cash, there is no safer investment than 
a U.S. Treasury security bill, note, or bond. Conversely, if the stock market 
increases in price consistently over time, investors prefer the higher returns 
of stocks, even though stocks carry more investment risk. Nevertheless, no 
matter your age, you should probably include some bonds or bond funds 
in your portfolio, because no one, including esteemed security analysts with 
many years of experience, can predict with absolute certainty whether the 
stock market is going to be up or down on any given day.
As you explore your bond investment choices, you will probably need to decide 
between an investment in individual bonds and bond mutual funds, but be aware 
that they exhibit different characteristics. With an individual bond, if you hold 
the bond to maturity, you almost always get back your original amount invested 
plus interest. However, with a bond mutual fund, your total rate of return is 
uncertain, because the value of that fund constantly fluctuates.

Stocks and When to Use Them
Stocks represent an ownership or equity interest in a corporation. As a share-
holder, you realize a return from a corporation’s earnings after it has paid all 
its creditors, including its bondholders. This return can come from a declara-
tion of dividends each year by the corporation’s board of directors, from capital 
appreciation of the shares once the earnings are reinvested back into the cor-
poration, or from both. Dividends are taxable to you, the shareholder, if they 
are declared for any given year and you receive them. Capital appreciation, on 
the other hand, is not taxable until you sell shares—and even then it is likely 
taxable at very favorable rates if you have owned the shares for more than 
one year from the date you bought them.
There are two forms of stock: common and preferred. The most widely 
held is common stock, which may or may not provide dividends, depending 
on whether a dividend is declared for that year by the corporation’s board. 
Common stocks are highly marketable, because they can generally be bought 
and sold easily on publicly traded exchanges, such as the New York Stock 
Exchange. However, they are not very liquid, because the investor may or may 
not receive back their original investment. In fact, the value of common stocks 
may change significantly during the course of a single trading day. As a result, 
common stock can carry a significant amount of market risk—risk that can be 
minimized but not entirely eliminated by proper asset allocation and portfolio 
diversification.
A major advantage of owning common stocks rather than bonds is the right 
to vote with respect to significant company matters, such as the election of 
the company’s board of directors. However, shareholders who do not own 
enough shares to be in a controlling position (51 percent or more of the total 
outstanding shares) must join together as a block to influence the course of 
future action by the corporation. Even then, if the majority or the controlling 
shareholders think differently, it is unlikely that the minority shareholders’ 
views will be considered.
Most individuals, particularly younger investors, do not purchase common 
stock for its income potential, but rather for its possibility of significant  
capital appreciation. In contrast, investors purchase preferred stock for much 
the same reason that they purchase individual bonds: to generate income. The 
term preferred in preferred stock means that if a dividend is declared by the 
corporation’s board of directors, shareholders of preferred stock are first in 
line before any payment is made to the common shareholders. The preferred 
shareholder also receives payment before the common shareholder in the 
event of the corporation’s liquidation.

Chapter 9 | Investing in Financial Assets
124
Publicly traded stocks may be thought of in a number of ways, but most fre-
quently they are categorized in terms of their market behavior, the sector 
or industry in which they are situated, and the size of the issuing company. 
Examples of categorizing stocks on the basis of their market behavior include 
the following:
• 
Income stocks: These types of stocks consistently pay high 
dividends to the investor.
• 
Growth stocks: These stocks exhibit considerable capital 
appreciation.
• 
Value stocks: These stocks are perceived as currently 
undervalued in terms of price compared to their mar-
ketplace peers.
• 
Defensive stocks: These stocks do not decline as much in a 
bear market as other stocks.
• 
Cyclical stocks: These stocks are very sensitive to current 
economic and market conditions.
• 
Blue chip stocks: These are stocks of the largest and oldest 
companies, including many of those on the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average—the most frequently quoted index of 
market activity.
The Standard & Poor’s rating service divides stocks into ten market sectors 
and into many more industries within those sectors. In general, however, tech-
nology, health care, and financials tend to be the fastest-growing market sec-
tors, whereas consumer staples and utilities tend to be more stable. Some 
other sectors, such as industrials and materials, tend to be cyclical in nature.
The size of the company issuing the stocks is referred to as its market capital-
ization, which is computed as the price per share of a company multiplied by 
the number of common shares it has outstanding. The higher the price per 
share and the more the number of outstanding shares, the greater the market 
capitalization of the company issuing the stock. With reference to this mea-
surement, stocks are classified as follows:
• 
Large capitalization (large-cap): The stocks of companies 
with market capitalizations of more than $5 billion
• 
Medium capitalization (mid-cap): The stocks of companies 
with market capitalizations of between $1 billion and  
$5 billion
• 
Small capitalization (small-cap): The stocks of companies 
with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion

There are many ways to value whether you should buy an individual stock, 
but the most common is a relative valuation technique known as a price-to-
earnings (P/E) ratio. This estimation of value relies on the premise that the 
stock’s value bears some relationship to the earnings per share generated by 
the issuing company or corporation. This premise is supported by remember-
ing that the rate of return to the investor, whether in the form of dividends or 
capital appreciation, derives from the corporation’s residual earnings after all 
other creditors have been paid.
For example, assume that ABC stock is trading on the stock exchange for $40 
per share. It is perceived by many investors as a value stock. ABC’s earnings 
over the next 12-month period are estimated to be $2.50 per share, and you 
have determined that the relevant P/E ratio for the stock is 20. Therefore, 
using the P/E ratio approach, ABC stock should be trading for $50 per share 
($2.50 times 20) in 12 months. Because it is currently selling for only $40 per 
share, ABC is undervalued, and, if you are a value investor, you should buy the 
stock at your earliest opportunity.
Stocks as a Part of  Your Portfolio
Since 1926, the average large stock has generated a compounded annual rate 
of return of slightly more than 10 percent. Inflation has averaged 3 percent, so 
that is a 7 percent real, before-tax rate of return, which is a pretty good track 
record, notwithstanding the gloomy results of the stock market in recent 
years! However, if you were to look at a risk pyramid, you would find indi-
vidual common stocks near the top. That means a great deal of volatility or 
market risk is associated with the investment—certainly more so than with 
investment-grade bonds. If you are going to include an individual stock in your 
portfolio, then, you need to research the stock carefully before you purchase 
it (either that or let your financial planner do it). Fortunately, there are various 
print services, such as Value Line, and online reference sources that you can 
use before making a potential purchase.
If you decide you want to include individual stocks as a part of your portfolio, 
the types of stocks you select depends on your style of or orientation to 
investing. For example, if you are primarily a growth investor, you will probably 
select stocks with above-average earnings potential. If you are primarily a value 
investor, you will prize a stock that is undervalued in relation to its industry 
or sector peers. To be properly diversified, your portfolio should consist of 
approximately 25 stocks spread across five or six different market sectors. 
Particularly with stocks, you should be a long-term or buy-and-hold investor. 
Although you may be able to make a killing in a short period of time from 
purchasing a hot stock, usually stocks increase in price only over long periods 
of time. Buy-and-hold should not be a problematic investment strategy for 
you if you did sufficient research before you bought the stock and you believe 
in the financial prospects of the company issuing it.

Mutual Funds and When to Use Them
The proper name for a mutual fund is an open-end investment company, mean-
ing the fund or company does not have a fixed number of shares to issue. 
Instead, the number of outstanding shares varies as investors purchase and 
redeem their shares. The value of a share in a mutual fund is determined by 
its net asset value (NAV), which is computed by dividing the value of the fund’s 
total net assets by the number of shares outstanding. As a general practice, 
the NAV is computed at the end of each market trading day and is the price 
at which you must buy and sell shares.
A mutual fund is a type of professionally managed asset. Practically, this means 
you deposit a sum of money with the fund along with thousands (or millions) 
of other investors. In turn, the fund’s professional money manager buys stocks, 
bonds, or other securities with that money. In this way, mutual funds are for 
the small investor, because they allow the “little guy” to purchase a percentage 
ownership in securities that they may not otherwise be able to afford. Mutual 
funds also allow investors to achieve instant portfolio diversification, because 
they now own a small piece of many stocks or bonds across many different 
market sectors or industries. As a final bonus, investors do not have to keep 
track of all their holdings in the fund or the cost basis of purchasing the shares, 
because the fund company usually assumes these responsibilities.
There are thousands of different mutual funds, including money market funds; but 
practically, they can be segregated into stock funds and bond funds or a combina-
tion of both stocks and bonds, known as a balanced fund. You can also purchase 
funds that invest only in foreign stocks or bonds, called international funds, or 
those that invest in foreign and U.S. stocks or bonds, called global funds.
There are three basic types of stock mutual funds:
• 
Growth fund: This is a fund that invests primarily in stocks 
that offer potentially significant capital appreciation. A 
subcategory of this type of fund is an aggressive growth 
fund, which invests in stocks of considerable risk and also 
offers the possibility for maximum capital appreciation.
• 
Income fund: An income fund invests primarily in stocks 
that pay higher-than-average dividends, such as utility 
stocks. The name can also be used to describe a fund 
that invests a high percentage of assets in bonds.
• 
Growth-and-income fund: There are many names for this 
type of fund, including equity income and total return 
fund. Operationally, a growth-and-income fund invests in 
stocks that aim to achieve both long-term capital appre-
ciation and current income. It is here that you find a con-
centration of value stocks that are of primary interest to 
the value style of investor.

Plan Your Financial Future
127
There are also three basic types of bond mutual funds:
• 
Corporate bond fund: This is a fund that invests in either 
short-term bonds (generally not more than a five-year 
maturity date) or longer-term bonds or both, as issued by 
corporations. Usually these bonds are investment-grade, 
but not always. A clue that the bond fund is investing in 
non-investment grade bonds is if the name of the fund 
includes the phrase high-yield. Historically, that type of 
fund has been referred to as a junk-bond fund, although 
the term junk is likely a bit extreme, because you can find 
very good investments among the fund’s holdings.
• 
U.S. government bond fund: This is a fund that invests in 
U.S. Treasury securities, typically Treasury notes or bonds.  
As mentioned, the securities in the fund are free of default 
risk, which is a major safety advantage but also an attri-
bute that results in a lower yield than that of corporate 
funds.
• 
Municipal bond fund: This is also known as a tax-exempt 
fund, because it invests primarily in bonds issued by cit-
ies and states. Dividends paid by municipal funds are free 
from federal taxes; and if the purchaser is a resident of 
the state or city that issues the bond, the dividends are 
typically free of state and local taxes.
There are many mutual funds and many mutual fund companies. In fact, mutual 
funds and professionally managed assets are among the subjects of a new book 
I am writing. However, if you are looking for large and well-known mutual fund 
companies that offer a wide variety of mutual funds (families of mutual funds), 
the two largest companies are Vanguard Investments of Valley Forge, PA, and 
Fidelity Investments of Boston, MA.
Index Funds
An index fund is a mutual fund that attempts to replicate the performance of a 
particular market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks. As 
such, the fund implements what is known as a passive management investment 
style; that is, the fund manager has no actual intent to attempt to exceed the 
return of a specified market index. Additionally, index funds are fairly income-
tax efficient, given that very little selling of securities occurs within the fund, 
the tax consequences of which are passed along to the investor in the form 
of capital gains distributions.

Chapter 9 | Investing in Financial Assets
128
In contrast to an index fund, most stock and bond mutual funds are actively 
managed. As such, there is an effort on the part of the mutual fund’s money 
manager to outperform the market or some appropriate market index on a 
risk-adjusted basis. However, academic studies have shown that, on average, 
approximately 95 percent of all mutual fund money managers fail to outper-
form the Standard and Poor’s index of 500 stocks on a long-term basis. This 
means that as a potential investor, you should seek out mutual funds with rela-
tively low expenses that have achieved above-average market performance 
over at least five years. Fortunately, this is not too difficult, given the thousands 
of mutual funds available in the marketplace.
Exchange Traded Funds
In recent years, a variation of the mutual fund investment has been introduced 
to the financial markets. Called exchange-traded funds (ETFs), these funds 
occupy a relatively small part of the investment marketplace. Nevertheless, 
they are growing in popularity, particularly among tax-savvy investors.
What are ETFs? Essentially, they are index funds that trade like stocks. Instead 
of being priced at net asset value at the end of the day, like traditional mutual 
funds, ETFs trade throughout the day based on market supply and demand. 
Most ETFs are designed to match the performances of various market bench-
marks, such as the Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks, and have interesting 
nicknames such as SPDRs, Qubes, and iShares. Other ETFs try to match the 
performance of a market sector, such as technology, energy, or finance. Still 
others are engaged in the trading of international securities or currencies.
There are two primary reasons you should be interested in ETFs as possible 
wealth-accumulation vehicles:
Because they act like index mutual funds, ETFs are pas-
• 
sively managed, and therefore the expenses of operating 
the funds are very low—sometimes even lower than they 
would be for an index mutual fund.
ETFs trade equivalent securities, or what are known as 
• 
in-kind trades. According to the IRS, this exchange of 
essentially similar securities does not constitute a taxable 
event, and thus no capital gains or losses are incurred. 
Thus, ETFs are very income-tax efficient. Alternatively,  
a traditional mutual fund must trade its securities in the 
open market, with the investor paying taxes on those 
gains.

Many small investors begin and end their portfolio construction with mutual 
funds. They also work with an investment advisor or financial planner to posi-
tion these funds in an advisory services account. If you are not inclined to 
work with an investment advisor or financial planner but wish to invest in

funds that do not assess a sales charge for purchase. 
Note, however, that most advisory accounts waive the 
sales charge if the fund is held within the account.
Try to invest in funds with low maintenance expenses in 
• 
relation to their peers. There is no rule of thumb here 
except that the lower the annual expenses to operate 
the fund, the better. An alternative is to invest in all index 
funds, but you lose the potential for excess market per-
formance that an excellent mutual fund money manager 
may generate.
Try to invest in funds with a relatively low turnover of 
• 
assets. Investing in a fund that does not constantly sell and 
buy securities is an effective tax-management technique, 
which, as you will see in Chapter 12, is a key component 
to defending the wealth you accumulate.
Make sure the fund is investing in securities consistent 
• 
with its investment objective. For example, if the fund 
states that it is a growth-stock fund, it should not be 
investing in short-term bonds.
Understand how much investment risk you are willing to 
• 
assume, and match up your risk profile with the invest-
ment objective of the fund. This is critical in mutual-fund 
investing. If you are most covetous of income (generally, 
characteristic of a conservative risk profile), many stock 
funds are not for you. Alternatively, an aggressive growth 
risk profile usually means that investing in a U.S. govern-
ment bond fund is not the most appropriate use of your 
money.
In summary, you may wish to invest in a combination of actively managed 
mutual funds and passively managed index funds. Many investors who have 
adopted this strategy are wealthier for it.

International Investing
It has frequently been said in recent years that we are becoming a globalized 
economy. As such, what happens financially in one country—particularly in 
emerging growth economies, such as China and India—almost instantaneously 
impacts the economy of the United States. Fortunately, a globalized economy 
presents investment opportunities beyond purchasing only domestic stocks, 
bonds, or mutual funds. Unfortunately, however, there is additional risk in 
international investing.
Currency or exchange-rate risk originates in the uncertainty associated with the 
value of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. For example, let’s say 
you invest in a stock of a UK company, and you pay for it in the currency of 
the UK pound. Even if the share value of this stock appreciates, you may still 
lose money if the pound depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, you 
may reap a double benefit, including the appreciation of the UK stock, if the 
pound appreciates with respect to the U.S. dollar.
How is currency or exchange-rate risk effectively minimized? This question 
leads us to the investment strategy of purchasing foreign stocks using a finan-
cial instrument known as an American Depository Receipt (ADR). An ADR is 
a receipt issued by a U.S. bank on foreign securities purchased by the bank 
through a foreign representative and held in trust for the benefit of the ADR 
owner. These receipts are listed on most U.S. stock exchanges, including the 
New York Stock Exchange, and represent an alternative to direct foreign 
investment in a stock. The ADR is denominated in U.S. dollars, meaning you 
never have to worry about the relationship of the foreign currency to its 
American counterpart.
Another way of investing internationally is to purchase shares of an interna-
tional or global mutual fund. An international mutual fund invests in securities, 
either stocks or bonds or both, of companies that are located and do business 
outside the United States. Alternatively, a global mutual fund (also known as a 
world fund) invests in securities of international companies and those of U.S. 
companies. There are also region-specific funds, notably in the Pacific Rim 
countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia.
You should consider international investing as another way to diversify your 
portfolio. In recent years, international and global investing have generated 
returns considerably in excess of those in the U.S. market; and, depending 
on future political events in foreign countries, global investments are likely 
to continue to outperform domestic funds. This is particularly the case if the 
relevant country’s currency strengthens in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Now let’s move on to the other major category of investments and wealth 
accumulation: investing your money in real assets or in real property, as dis-
cussed in the next chapter. After that, we contrast financial and real assets 
to use assets, with the major asset being your home or personal residence. 
Historically, many people have considered their home as their one primary 
investment. In Chapter 11, we show why that is not how you should think of 
your personal residence in the PADD process, because a home, at least for 
most people, has not been proven to be an excellent long-term investment.

Investing in  
Real Assets
Most individuals own real estate; in fact, approximately 65 percent of Americans 
own their own home as of the year 2012. In addition, according to the U.S. 
Census Bureau, in 2000, 32.3 percent of the typical American’s net worth 
consisted of the equity in their home. Although this percentage decreased 
considerably with the real-estate bust that began in the summer of 2007 in 
most areas of this country, it remains true that home ownership is an integral 
part of both the American Dream and the wealth-accumulation process.
For most people, owning a home is not an investment in the same sense that 
owning stocks and bonds or rental real estate is an investment. Rather, your 
home or primary residence should be thought of as a use asset and should 
be listed as such on the statement of personal financial position. This is to be 
contrasted with direct investments in real estate, such as the ownership of a 
rental home, a vacation home, or even raw land, and indirect investments in 
real estate, such as a share of a real estate limited partnership (RELP) or a real 
estate investment trust (REIT).
Direct Investments in Real Estate
Direct investments in real estate are made primarily by wealthy individu-
als who understand the real estate selection process and are comfortable 
with riskier assets. Many direct investments in real estate are also made for  
purposes of improving an individual’s cash flow (income) and not only for 
purposes of enjoying the capital appreciation of an asset (growth).

Vacation Homes
According to American Demographics magazine, approximately 70 per-
cent of Americans view the purchase of a vacation home as the number-one 
indication that an individual has accumulated wealth. Further, partly as a reflec-
tion of this fact, some 60 percent of Americans anecdotally say they would like 
to own a vacation home. Although this is a common financial goal, it is not of 
tantamount importance for many people, because buying a vacation home is 
beyond their financial means. (With any luck, this book will show you how to 
change that situation!) However, if you are interested in purchasing a vacation 
home, you should take three major factors into consideration: the location 
of the home; the financing costs associated with buying and maintaining the 
property; and how long you plan to own the home, including how you may 
wish to ultimately divest yourself of ownership.
A standard rule in any purchase of real estate applies when buying a vacation 
home: the most important factor is location, location, location! As of 2005, 
according to an EscapeHomes.com survey, with the exception of Las Vegas, 
NV, all of the top-ten preferred locations for buying a second home were near 
the ocean or in the mountains. They were also close to or part of a major city 
(for example, San Diego, CA, was number seven in the survey). You can bet 
that those locations demand premium prices and are probably suffering from 
a paucity of attractive vacation properties.
As such, you may wish to take a different approach. Look for areas that more 
than one print publication or website describe as up-and-coming. For example, 
in recent years, properties along both coasts of Mexico have become more 
attractive to retiring and vacationing Americans. The same can be said of the 
country of Costa Rica in Central America. If you concentrate on areas that are 
not yet well known to the wealthy and those who are aspiring to be wealthy, 
you are less likely to buy at the top of the market and can thus anticipate that 
your second home will enjoy future appreciation that may not be possible in 
more established locations.
Financing a second home, particularly if you do not have much equity in your 
first home or primary residence, is always an issue. Most lenders expect you 
to put down at least 20 percent of the second home’s fair market value before 
closing. Renting out the home is a good way to recover some of this down 
payment, but if you do so, charge a rent that is approximately 10 to 20 percent 
higher than your mortgage payment to take care of maintenance expenses. 
You will also very likely need to hire a property manager, particularly if the 
second home is some distance from your primary residence or in another 
country. If you can avoid it, try not to tap into the equity of your first home 
to make the down payment on the second. If the property value of your first 
home declines, it will be all the more difficult to recover the lost equity. It will 
also present a cash-flow challenge if you used an interest-only adjustable rate 
mortgage (ARM) to finance the first home.

Plan Your Financial Future
135
Do not expect your vacation home to pay for itself immediately. Over the 
long term, a vacation home can be self-sustaining (particularly if you are rent-
ing it out when you are not there), but only if you exercise careful financial 
planning. As with most real assets, the longer you own the vacation home, 
the greater the chances of its significant capital appreciation. Ultimately, you 
must determine whether you wish to pass your vacation home on to family 
members now or at your death, or whether you wish to sell it and realize a 
(hopefully) sizable percentage return on it. As you will see in Chapter 19, the 
value of a highly appreciated vacation home may be a significant estate plan-
ning issue, although a competent estate or financial planner can assist you in 
removing or reducing the value of the home from your taxable estate.
Rental Homes
Most individuals become landlords in one of two ways: as a result of a  conscious 
decision to buy homes and rent them to others, or because their primary 
residence does not sell in the time frame they anticipate and they convert 
the residence to a rental property. The obvious practical  disadvantage of 
becoming a landlord is that, unless you hire a property manager, you have to 
deal with tenants. However, there are tax advantages associated with rental 
homes. Notably, as a landlord, you can depreciate the home and, at least to 
a limited extent, take an annual operating loss if your annual adjusted gross 
income is not deemed to be too high.
Under current tax law, a rental activity is treated as a passive activity, or one 
that involves the conduct of any trade or business in which the taxpayer does 
not materially participate. But there is a lesser standard of participation—
active participation—that most individuals can easily meet with respect to 
their rental real estate activities. An individual meets the active-participation 
standard if they participate in making management decisions with respect to 
the rental property or arrange for others (for example, a property manager) 
to provide rental property services. If this lesser standard is met, you can 
deduct up to $25,000 of losses annually from your rental real-estate activi-
ties, provided your adjusted gross income (AGI) for that year does not exceed 
$100,000. If you pass this threshold, the $25,000 maximum is then reduced by 
50 percent of the amount by which your AGI exceeds $100,000, meaning that 
if your AGI (and your spouse’s income, if you file jointly) reaches $150,000, no 
loss deduction is permitted.
For example, assume that you own an apartment building that is managed by 
an on-site property manager. You meet frequently with the property man-
ager and make all decisions with respect to improving the property. As such, 
you actively participate for purposes of the rental real-estate loss deduction. 
Further, assume that your AGI for the year 2013 is $110,000 and the build-
ing generates $26,000 in losses during that year. You are allowed to deduct 
only $20,000 of these losses on your 2013 income tax return, because the 

Chapter 10 | Investing in Real Assets 
136
maximum deduction is $25,000, and the maximum deduction is reduced by 
$5,000 (the portion of $110,000 in excess of $100,000—or $10,000—times 
0.50 equals $5,000).
As you will learn when we discuss the primary residence as a use asset in 
Chapter 11, generally you are never allowed to take an income-tax loss when 
selling that residence (your home). However, there is a favorable exclusion-of-
gain provision in the tax code that applies to the sale of a personal residence 
previously converted into rental property. The sale of a rental home is taxed 
in accordance with the normal capital-gain and -loss rules (remember, you 
have turned your home into an investment), but there is the additional tax 
benefit of the up-to-$25,000 annual loss provision, if you qualify. This may 
even be enough reward to compensate you for the daily hassles of putting up 
with tenants.
Commercial Real Estate
Typically, given the investment risk, only experienced investors purchase com-
mercial real estate. Accordingly, you may wish to avoid this investment oppor-
tunity entirely. However, if you do wish to invest in commercial properties, you 
will probably do so for one of two reasons: to receive annual income or to 
hold such properties for capital appreciation before eventual sale.
Most investors who participate in the commercial real-estate market do so 
to generate income, because a primary reason to invest in raw land is capital 
appreciation. If you are after income from a commercial property, you first 
need to determine how much to pay for it. For that, fortunately, you can use 
a relatively easy computation known as the net operating income (NOI) 
formula. The formula for NOI is as follows (if you hire an appraiser to help 
you with the investment decision, the appraiser will likely compute the NOI 
for you):
Gross rental receipts from the property
+  Nonrental or other additional income from the property
=  Potential gross income
–   Vacancy and collection of receipts losses
=  Effective gross income
–  Operating expenses (excluding interest and depreciation)
=  Net operating income (NOI)
Because NOI is a cash-flow computation from the commercial property,  
any charges you have incurred to finance the purchase of the property 
(such as interest on a loan) and tax-related charges (such as depreciation) do 
not enter into the computation.

Plan Your Financial Future
137
Once you or your appraiser have computed the commercial property’s 
NOI, you need to divide that by a prevailing capitalization rate (cap rate) 
to determine how much you should pay for the property. This cap rate is 
not easy to determine, but think of it as the rate of annual compounded 
return you would like to receive from the property. It is also the reciprocal 
of the number of years it will take for the property to pay for itself. For 
example, a standard cap rate is 12 percent, meaning you want your original 
investment back in slightly more than 8 years (100 divided by 12 = 8.33 
years). Similarly, to achieve a 20 percent return from the ­property, you 
want your original purchase price back in 5 years (100 divided by 20 = 5). 
Of course, keep in mind that you are being more aggressive, and factor in 
higher risk regarding the initial investment with a 20 percent cap rate than 
with a 12 percent cap rate.
Raw or Unimproved Land
Mark Twain is famous for saying, “Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.” 
This is true, but it does not provide a great deal of guidance if you are an inves-
tor trying to decide where to buy land. The most valuable land or unimproved 
real estate is probably land that is adjacent to already-developed or soon-to-
be-developed residential or commercial property. It is likely that, before long, 
the adjacent property will also be developed, given that its highest and best 
use is no longer as farmland, grassland, or other land lying fallow. As a result, 
you will probably enjoy significant capital appreciation from this land when 
you subsequently sell it.
Keep in mind, though, that certain significant investment risks are ­associated 
with the purchase of any undeveloped land. Among these risks are the 
following:
The land may be adversely rezoned. For example, ­property 
• 
bought for residential development purposes may be 
rezoned by the city or county for commercial purposes.
You may not be able to obtain permits from the county, 
• 
city, or township to build on the land in the manner that 
you (or the developer) intend.
Access to your land may be restricted by an adjacent 
• 
landowner’s property or property rights.
The population growth that you anticipate in the area 
• 
may not occur.
As a result, many investments in undeveloped land are extremely risky. If you 
have borrowed money to buy the land (known as leveraging your investment), 
you must find a way to service the debt from income or assets other than 

Chapter 10 | Investing in Real Assets 
138
your original purchase. Otherwise, you will be forced into a position to sell 
the land well before you otherwise intended.
Indirect Investments in Real Estate
There are two basic ways to indirectly invest in real estate: as a limited partner 
owning an interest in a RELP or as a shareholder in a REIT. Let’s look at the REIT 
first, because it is generally the more marketable of the two investments.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
A REIT is like a mutual fund, except that its shares are not always valued at 
net asset value (NAV). Instead, they are traded at a premium or discount to 
NAV on a publicly traded exchange. In most cases, the REIT invests in income-
producing real-estate properties, such as apartment buildings, shopping 
centers, office parks, hotels, and, increasingly, retirement communities. Some 
REITs, known as mortgage REITs, also invest in the financing of real-estate 
properties.
The REIT entity is not subject to federal income tax as long as it distributes 
at least 90 percent of its annual income to shareholders each year. As a result, 
many REITs distribute 100 percent of their annual income to shareholders. 
Taxes are then paid by the shareholders on dividends received (like stocks or 
stock mutual funds) and any passed-through capital gains, but be careful: unless 
the REIT tells you the dividend is a qualifying dividend for federal income-tax 
purposes, you cannot claim the favorable 0 or 20 percent tax rate that other-
wise applies to stock or mutual-fund dividends. Further, unlike RELPs, REITs 
cannot pass through any losses experienced in the sale of their underlying 
properties.
There is a relatively low correlation between the price movement of REIT 
shares and that of a typical stock or stock mutual fund. A primary advantage 
to you, as a potential investor, then, is the opportunity to further diversify your 
portfolio with the purchase of a REIT. Other advantages of REITs include
Relatively stable dividend income
• 
High dividend yields
• 
The possibility of significant capital appreciation
• 
Liquidity
• 
Access to professional management of the property
• 
The long-term total return (defined as dividend income plus capital appre-
ciation of the underlying real-estate investment) of a REIT is likely less than 

Plan Your Financial Future
139
a high-performing, higher-risk growth stock, but more than the return of a 
lower-risk investment-grade bond.
Before you invest in a REIT versus, for example, a mutual fund, you must first 
decide that you want to invest in real-estate properties. Then you must decide 
in what manner you wish to invest in those properties—directly or indirectly. 
If you decide that you want to invest indirectly in the form of a REIT, you must 
decide whether you wish to invest in a publicly traded or non-publicly traded 
REIT. Finally, in what type of REIT should you invest? There are three types:
• 
Equity REIT: Generally acquires income-producing real 
properties
• 
Mortgage REIT: Makes construction loans and otherwise 
invests in the financing of real-estate ventures
• 
Hybrid REIT: Both owns properties and makes financing 
loans
As a general rule, a mortgage REIT is a bit riskier than an equity REIT, because 
the mortgage REIT does not have established properties from which to 
­generate an income stream to the investor. However, your ultimate rate of 
return from a mortgage REIT may be greater than from an equity REIT.
Real Estate Limited Partnerships (RELPs)
If you want a high-risk real-estate investment and the possibility of a high 
return, purchasing an interest in a RELP may be for you. A RELP is most 
commonly structured as a real-estate syndication with one or more general 
partners or real-estate developers and many investors as limited partners. 
The limited partners have no say in the management or control of the real 
property investments or in when the underlying properties may be sold.
Unlike a REIT, a RELP is permitted to pass on losses to its limited partner 
investors. However, because of a series of income-tax rules known as the 
passive activity rules, it is doubtful that you, as a limited partner investor, can 
claim this loss on your annual income-tax return. Typically, you cannot claim 
this loss until the general partner or syndicator sells the partnership property 
that has generated the loss—and remember, as a limited partner, you cannot 
legally force them to do so.
A RELP usually is not a publicly traded entity, so cashing in your interest at 
something close to what you paid for it is difficult, if not impossible. Some 
RELPs are organized and publicly traded in the form of master limited 
­partnerships (MLPs), but the trading is very thin, and tax rules generally 
restrict the claiming of any losses on your income-tax return. Thus, an ­interest 
held in a RELP is generally both illiquid and relatively unmarketable.

Chapter 10 | Investing in Real Assets 
140
So why invest in a RELP? You would do so almost always because you believe 
in the ability of the syndicator to develop and sell the underlying real proper-
ties for a significant profit. In addition, you are able to invest in commercial and 
residential real-estate properties for a relatively small amount and are limited 
in your potential liability as a creditor only to the extent of your investment.
The Use of Leverage in Real-Estate Investing
The financial concept of leveraging is the use of borrowed money to increase 
your profit on a real-estate investment. The concept may also be used with 
financial assets, most notably through the use of margin (borrowing money 
from your broker to purchase stock), but one of the oft-cited advantages of 
real assets is the ability to employ leverage effectively.
For example, assume that you have directly invested $100,000 in a residential 
real-estate property. Further, assume that this real estate is in a good location 
and appreciates at a rate of 10 percent annually. At the end of year one, your 
investment has grown to $110,000, and at the end of year two, the property is 
worth $121,000. You have earned a $21,000 profit in the property. Now let’s 
assume that you have put down $100,000 on a $500,000 tract of residential 
real property and have borrowed the remaining $400,000 from a bank at a 
low interest rate. Again, the property appreciates at the rate of 10 percent 
annually. Now, however, at the end of year one, your investment has grown to 
$550,000, and at the end of year two, the property is worth $605,000. Thus 
you have increased your dollar profit from $21,000 to $84,000 ($105,000 less 
$21,000). That is four times your original profit, or a total percentage return of 
400 percent before figuring in the dollars and percentage rate you have to pay 
to the bank for borrowing the money.
How do you put the concept of leveraging into practice as a real-estate inves-
tor? You do this by putting the minimum down on real property that has a 
strong likelihood of appreciating in future years. Generally, on any real-estate 
purchase other than primary home purchases, the bank will ask you to put 
down at least 20 percent on the initial investment. If you can find a bank that 
will let you put down less, and you are relatively sure that the property you are 
interested in will go up in value, you should be able to understand the ­benefits 
of using someone else’s money to accumulate wealth. That is leverage!
However, be aware that leveraging also compounds your dollar loss if the 
property goes down in value. Using the previous two examples, if leverage is 
not used, you end up with a $19,000 loss after two years. Because you are 
dealing with residential rental property, you may or may not be able to claim 
all of that loss on your tax return, depending on your AGI at the end of year 
two. If you used leverage, on the other hand, your loss is $95,000, a difference 
of $76,000 ($95,000 less $19,000). Regardless of your AGI, you definitely 

Plan Your Financial Future
141
cannot take all of that loss for income-tax purposes, because you are limited 
to no more than $25,000 in any given year. In addition, you still have to pay the 
bank for any interest incurred on the loan during the two years.
In summary, if you are going to employ leverage, stay away from purchasing 
questionable properties in less-than-desirable areas. As mentioned in Chapter 
1, there is both good debt and bad debt. Bad debt is any debt incurred on 
­property that is likely to depreciate in value over the anticipated time frame of 
the investment. The misuse of leveraging proves the truth of that statement 
many times over.
Correlation
In the financial world, correlation measures the direction and extent of a 
relationship between two investment assets. However, you can also use this 
concept to diversify your portfolio and accumulate wealth.
How does correlation work? A correlation of +1.0 means two assets move 
exactly together in one direction, whereas a correlation of -1.0 means the two 
assets move in the exact opposite direction of each other—that is, when one 
goes up, the other goes down. Meanwhile, a correlation of 0.0 means there is 
no relationship whatsoever between the two assets—that is, they move inde-
pendently of each other.
The following list shows the correlations of various financial asset classes and 
real estate to the Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks for the time period 
extending from 1970 through 2004, a duration that encompasses numerous 
market cycles:
Large-cap stocks: 0.96
• 
Mid-cap stocks: 0.86
• 
Small-cap stocks: 0.79
• 
International stocks: 0.55
• 
Intermediate-term bonds: 0.23
• 
Cash: 0.02
• 
Real estate: 0.52
• 
As you can see, with the exception of cash and medium-term bonds, real 
estate and international stocks have the lowest positive relationship to the 
broad domestic stock market. Thus, if possible, given your budget and appro-
priate risk tolerance, you should consider adding real estate and international 
stocks to your portfolio as diversification tools.

Financial or Real Assets:  Which Are Better?
A great amount of wealth has been created (the accumulation part of the PADD 
process) by individuals investing in financial and real assets. Nevertheless, this 
process is not a zero-sum game. The wealth-accumulation techniques involved 
with each type of asset are not mutually exclusive.
Many investors prefer to invest in either financial assets or real assets, but 
not both. The general reason is that those investors are investing in assets 
they understand (or someone has convinced them they understand), or they 
are comfortable with only one of the two general categories of assets. If you 
understand your ability to assume differing amounts of risk, however, you may 
wish to invest in both financial and real assets. History has shown that adding 
real assets to a predominantly financial portfolio improves diversification and 
reduces overall risk. Remember: the goal of wealth accumulation is not only 
to achieve as great an annual percentage of return as possible, but also to do 
so with as little risk as possible. As such, you might consider investing in real-
estate investments that look more like financial investments (for example, a 
REIT is a mutual fund that invests in real estate and real-estate properties). 
Alternatively, you can invest in securities issued by real-estate development 
companies and home builders.
Regardless of whether you decide to invest solely in financial assets, solely in 
real assets, or in both, do not forget this fundamental rule of investing: if you do 
not understand a potential investment, you should not be investing your hard-earned 
money in it! Prior to the most recent recession that began in December 2007, 
some investors ignored this basic rule and piled money into exotic derivative 
investments, such as credit-default swaps, whose underlying risk they did not 
appreciate and whose complexities they did not understand.
Now let’s move on to a topic of great interest to investors and non-investors 
alike: how to buy a home and take best advantage of use assets in accumulat-
ing wealth. The effective management of use assets is the focus of the next 
chapter and concludes our look at the second step in the PADD process: 
techniques to accumulate wealth. After that, we take up the defense of that 
hard-earned wealth using effective tax management.

Investing in  
Use Assets
If you think back in the financial planning process to when you first prepared 
your personal financial statement, you will notice that your home and auto-
mobile were properly listed as use assets and not as investments. Although a 
profit motive may attach to some use assets (particularly luxury automobiles 
or antique collectibles), generally such assets are purchased so you can make 
efficient and enjoyable use of them.
Your Home as an Investment
Your home likely means a lot of things to you, not the least of which is ade-
quate and enjoyable shelter. Further, owning your own home is an integral 
part of the American Dream. One of the things your primary residence or 
home should not be, however, is an investment—or, as many baby boomers are 
relying on, a retirement planning vehicle. As noted in Chapter 3, studies have 
shown that the average annual real rate of return on residential real estate 
is only 1.62 percent after considering the costs of maintenance and improve-
ment. Moreover, it is generally not good financial planning to have too much of 
your net worth tied up in any one asset, such as your home. We discussed in 
Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 the importance of diversification when investing in 
financial and real assets, yet millions of individuals now, and when they retire, 
will hold approximately 70 percent of their net worth in just one asset: the 
equity in their home.

According to the Wall Street Journal as a homeowner, you can easily spend up 
to three times the purchase price of your home in additional costs, such as 
mortgage interest, property taxes, and major home improvements. For exam-
ple, today’s buyer of a $300,000 single-family dwelling who finances with a 
30-year fixed rate mortgage will end up paying the price of the dwelling over 
again just in mortgage interest. Then add 30 years of property taxes, ongoing 
maintenance of the home, and several major home repairs or improvements, 
and the total cost of buying the home could approach $1.0 million.
Does this mean you should not buy a home and should instead rent? No, not 
at all! Since the nationwide collapse of the housing market that began in 2007, 
and the subsequent historic reduction in mortgage rates, it is now less expen-
sive in many parts of the country to buy than to rent. However, the cost of 
home ownership does argue for a new method of analyzing why you bought 
your home in the first place.
A house is one of the few assets that does not violate the basic rule of debt 
management: only go into debt for an asset that is likely to appreciate in value. 
Notwithstanding the current housing crisis in many cities, over the long term, 
depending on their location, houses generally do increase in value. As men-
tioned, you may have already spent your initial purchase several times over; 
so, as the Wall Street Journal suggests, think of the sales proceeds from your 
home as a rebate of the money you spent on it. In other words, some of the 
thousands of dollars you spent on upkeep and improvements to your house 
are returned to you when you eventually sell it.
Let’s look at the average cost of home ownership over the 30-year period end-
ing in 2007, according to an Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight 
(OFHEO) study. The OFHEO assumes a purchase price of $50,000 for a 
­single-family home in 1977 (not much above the national median home price 
of $48,800 at that time). It then takes the total cost of owning the home by 
financing its purchase with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and compares it with 
the total cost of an all-cash purchase of the home. According to the OFHEO, 
the house would have appreciated to a value of $290,500 by the year 2007 at 
a nominal annual compounded rate of return of approximately 6.04 percent. 
The average mortgage interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate ­mortgage in 1977 
was 8.72 percent, and the homeowner is assumed to be in a 33 ­percent mar-
ginal income tax bracket. Here are the actual results of the cost of owning this 
home in table form.

There are several striking facts to recognize when analyzing this table. The 
first is that even an all-cash purchaser suffered a dollar loss over the 30-year 
period of home ownership (although not as much as the borrower, after 
itemizing their mortgage interest deduction). The second is that the net loss in 
both instances could have been turned into a net profit if not nearly as much 
money was expended on major repairs and home improvements. This speaks 
to the next major point we need to make with respect to home ownership: 
exercise as much financial discipline as possible over the controllable aspects of the 
purchase and ongoing ownership of your home.
Specifically, as a prospective home purchaser and owner, you have control 
over two significant home-owning costs: the amount of interest you pay and 
the extent of home improvements you make. With respect to the interest 
payments on your home, even though some of this cost can be offset by 
income-tax deductions, you are doing nothing to pay down the principal on 
which the total interest amount of your home is computed if you simply 
submit your mortgage payments in accordance with your financing schedule. 
Thus, accelerating your principal payments and paying off the mortgage as 
quickly as you can will result in considerable savings. Another option, if you 
can afford it, is to finance the purchase of the home with a 15-year fixed-rate 
mortgage rather than the standard 30-year note.
Limiting the amount of home improvements you make is even more challenging, 
but the fact is that very few improvements will pay off for you at the time of 
sale. Studies have shown that a new kitchen or bathroom returns the greatest 
rebate at the time of sale, but even those improvements do not often return all 
of the money expended. In addition, beware the temptation to add a backyard 
swimming pool or dog run to your home. The next buyer of your house may 
not have children or a dog, so these additions can actually be disadvantageous

at the time of sale, not advantageous. Furthermore, a swimming pool can be an 
attractive nuisance to neighborhood kids, and if one of them falls in the pool and 
is injured, you will likely be sued, particularly if you did not enclose the pool.
In addition to accelerating your mortgage payments and limiting the extent 
of your home improvements, you can adopt several other planning strategies 
with respect to managing your home as a use asset:
• 
Adopt a different attitude. Treat your home like any other 
consumer purchase, and buy it at as low a price as pos-
sible. Monitor price trends in your local housing market 
closely, and when there is a dip in the market, consider 
houses to be on sale. Buy then if you can. When tracking 
home values, websites such as www.zillow.com can be 
very helpful.
• 
Stay put as long as possible. Be a buy-and-hold home pur-
chaser as long as possible. The average homeowner lives 
in their home only seven years before moving on, usually 
to a more expensive residence. Depending on your area 
and market conditions, this probably is not long enough 
to ensure a net profit when you eventually sell.
• 
Pay as much cash as possible. If you can afford an all-cash 
purchase, doing so is preferable; but absent that, make as 
much of a down payment as you can. A large down pay-
ment limits the amount of principal you have to borrow 
and interest you have to pay.
• 
Be careful about refinancing. Yes, if you refinance, you will 
lower your monthly payment, but you also extend the 
time of your loan and thus add to your total interest pay-
ments. If you are going to refinance, consider going from 
a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to a 15-year fixed-rate 
mortgage (especially as you grow closer to your planned 
retirement date).
• 
Stay away from interest-only mortgages. This is not so much 
a cash-management tool as it is straightforward, practi-
cal advice. Many individuals who finance their home pur-
chases with interest-only mortgages buy more house 
than they can afford and thus probably pay too much. 
Interest-only mortgages contradict the first strategy of 
paying as little for the house as you can.
• 
Diversify, diversify, diversify! After accelerating your mort-
gage payments, take whatever money you have left and 
make sure you are contributing as much as possible  

Plan Your Financial Future

to your employer’s 401(k) retirement plan and any per-
sonal retirement savings vehicles, such as traditional or 
Roth IRAs. But don’t go overboard: if you can pay off your 
house (or as much of it as possible) before you retire, you 
will increase your cash flow considerably and enjoy your 
retirement years that much more.
Buying versus Renting a Home
It can be argued that buying a home with a mortgage is just another form of 
renting. Instead of paying the rent to a landlord, however, as a homeowner pay-
ing interest, you are paying the mortgage lender. Sure, you get a tax deduction 
for paying mortgage interest if you itemize your deductions; but until about 
the 20-year point in a standard 30-year mortgage, your interest payments are 
not doing much to reduce your principal. As such, you are only compromising 
your financial well-being when you move soon after purchasing your home. 
As just discussed, this is why it is so important to accelerate the payment of 
your mortgage as quickly as possible.

One important positive component of buying a home is not an issue for ­renters: 
the estimated annual appreciation in the value of the home. This underscores 
what was just discussed: it is critical that, as a prospective ­homeowner, you 
research the local market carefully and do not overpay for the property. If 
you do overpay, you limit the amount of potential appreciation in your home’s 
value. If you happen to buy in the wrong area or at the wrong time, you may 
have been better off renting in the first place.
As for renting, an oft-overlooked protection strategy for the renter is the 
purchase of a tenant’s property insurance policy. Almost every lease includes 
exculpatory language whereby the landlord bears no liability for damage to 
or theft of the tenant’s personal property. A tenant’s policy provides for this 
protection plus liability coverage for guests who may be injured while on the 
property. The policy also protects the tenant from the consequences of their 
own injurious acts, wherever they may occur.
In addition to securing a property insurance policy, a tenant should be sure 
to check on the status of any security deposit required by the landlord. Some 
landlords, in an attempt to attract tenants, invest this deposit for the tenant 
and pay them the interest at the end of a long-term lease. However, more 
commonly this deposit is simply maintained in escrow by the landlord and 
refunded to the tenant at the expiration of the lease, provided the rental unit 
is left in good physical condition As a prospective tenant, you want as low a 
security deposit as possible and a return on your money in the form of pro-
tected premises and timely landlord maintenance.

Selling Your Home
Most of the issues involving the sale of your home are income-tax related, 
but you should not overlook practical questions, such as whether to sell the 
home yourself or use a real-estate broker. With today’s Internet-savvy society, 
­increasing numbers of individuals are opting to list and sell their homes themselves. 
However, as attractive as it might seem to avoid the cost of using a real-estate 
broker, consider the following if you choose to sell your home on your own:
You must establish a reasonable price for your home. 
• 
Although this may appear easy given the widespread 
availability of comparable market data these days, you 
need to be as realistic as you can about what your home 
may be worth. As such, you must separate emotion and 
the natural tendency to ask for more money rather than 
less. Be as objective as possible.
You need to market your home. This involves much more 
• 
than simply sticking a For Sale by Owner sign in the front 
yard. You need your house listed in your area’s multiple-
listing service (MLS). According to the National Association 
of Realtors, over 60 percent of home sales occur with the 
assistance of a buyer’s agent (in contrast, real-estate agents 
or brokers typically work only for the seller). Try to list your 
house with such an agent, who typically works as part of a 
network and represents any number of qualified buyers.
You need to separate the serious prospects from the 
• 
merely curious. Neighbors are notorious for taking sales 
brochures or flyers simply because they want to see what 
you are asking for your house. Instead, ask your neigh-
bors to refer any friends or family who may be looking 
for a new home. You should then prequalify the serious 
buyers so as not to waste your time negotiating a price 
with someone the mortgage lender will not approve.
You have to close the deal! This is where many  
• 
for-sale-by-owner sellers stumble. Many buyers are 
skilled in the art of negotiating for the absolute ­lowest 
price (or sometimes even a below-market price). Hence, 
as a seller, you have to know what price you will accept 
while recognizing that it is the most the market will 
bear at that particular time.
Assuming that you or your real estate agent have been successful in getting a 
fair price for your home, you now have to report the tax on any gain from that 
sale. Fortunately, the gain from the sale of any primary residence is considered 
a gain on the sale of a capital asset. Depending on your income-tax bracket and 

Chapter 11 | Investing in Use Assets 
150
whether you have owned the house for at least one year, the gain is generally 
taxed at either a 0 percent or a 20 percent rate. More important, if you meet 
certain conditions, any gain on the sale of a home is taxable only to the extent 
that it exceeds $250,000 (or $500,000, if you file a joint return). This $250,000 
or $500,000 exclusion may be used as often as once every two years.
To determine your taxable gain, you must subtract your basis in the home 
from its sales price minus all costs and commissions. This computation pro-
cess underscores the importance of keeping good records, because your basis 
in a home is generally equal to what you paid for it plus any improvements 
made while you owned it. For example, assume that you paid $150,000 for 
your home ten years ago. While you owned it, you finished the basement at a 
cost of $30,000. Your adjusted basis in the home is now $180,000 ($150,000 
plus the $30,000 in improvements). Also assume that you recently sold the 
home for $270,000 with the assistance of a real-estate broker. You must pay 
your broker a commission of 6 percent of the sales price. Therefore, your 
sales price for determining any capital gains tax due is $253,800 ($270,000 
less the $16,200 broker’s commission). Accordingly, your total, potentially 
taxable gain is $73,800 ($253,800 net sales price less $180,000 basis); but if 
you qualify for the $250,000 exclusion, you do not have any recognized gain 
for tax purposes. In other words, you do not owe any income tax if you take 
advantage of the available exclusion.
To qualify for the $250,000 or $500,000 exclusion, you must meet both an 
ownership test and a use test. Specifically, you must have
• 
Owned the residence for at least two out of the five years 
prior to when you sold it
• 
Used the home as your primary residence for this same 
period of time
If you are married and file jointly at the time of sale, either you or your 
spouse can meet the ownership requirement, but you both must meet the use 
requirement. This may be a particularly difficult requirement for divorced or 
divorcing couples in which one partner vacates the home before sale. If you 
fail to meet these tests due to a change in employment (for example, if your 
employer transfers you to a new location) or as a result of other unforeseen 
circumstances, you can exclude the fraction of the $250,000 or $500,000 
exclusion that is equal to the fraction of the two-year period in which these 
tests were met.
For example, assume that you purchased a home on January 1, 2011, and on 
January 2, 2012, your employer transferred you to another city. You have 
owned your home for at least 12 months and, as a single taxpayer, are entitled 
to exclude up to $125,000 of any gain on the sale ($250,000 times 0.50 [or 12 
divided by 24]). Finally, as with any other personal asset, losses on the sale of a 
home used as a personal residence are not allowed for income-tax purposes.

Automobiles: Do You Really Need That  
New Lamborghini?
Unlike houses, which have historically appreciated in value, no other use assets 
depreciate in value more quickly than automobiles. From a debt-management 
perspective, you should think twice before borrowing to purchase a new 
­luxury automobile. Remember, it does not make financial sense to borrow to buy 
a depreciating asset. Nevertheless, in most places in America, an automobile 
is not a discretionary purchase, but a necessity for getting around. What are 
some tips for taking the most advantage of this necessary tool of daily living?
If you can suffer what is, for some, an indignity, purchase only a 
• 
quality used automobile. An automobile broker can assist you 
in finding one. Then, as with a house, do not overpay for it.
Do some research before you buy. For example, if you 
• 
have decided on a pre-owned car, consult the Kelley Blue 
Book to determine what you should be paying as the retail 
price. If you are purchasing a new car, there are online 
services you can consult to find out the dealer’s invoice 
cost. Start your negotiation with the dealer about 2 per-
cent above that cost, and try to work down from there.
Before you buy, try to determine whether the car you are 
• 
interested in is likely to become a classic model. For exam-
ple, individuals who were fortunate enough to buy a 1957 
Chevrolet or a 1965 Ford Mustang transformed a depreciat-
ing asset (a car) into a collector’s item (a classic automobile).
Buy only one quality automobile at a time, and keep it for at 
• 
least ten years or 100,000 miles. Fortunately, automobiles 
are improving in quality all the time, so this should not be 
too difficult.
Keep your car in good repair and up to date on mainte-
• 
nance. It has been proven that well-tuned cars conserve 
gasoline and thus, in the longer term, save you money.
Another decision you may need to make with respect to an automobile is 
whether to buy or lease the car. Generally, when a high percentage of the car’s 
use is for business purposes, it may be more advantageous to lease instead of 
buy. Not only can the business portion of the lease payments be deducted for 
income-tax purposes, but the business portion of the interest on the loan may 
be deducted. Further, depreciation of the leased vehicle, within certain limits, is 
also a tax deduction. Finally, if the vehicle you are purchasing is to be used for 
primarily personal purposes, buying and owning the car for a significant period 
of time is preferable. This is particularly the case if the lease agreement does 
not provide for an option to purchase the car at its depreciated value at the 
lease’s expiration date (known as a closed-end automobile lease agreement).

Chapter 11 | Investing in Use Assets 
152
Tangible Personal Property and Collectibles
Tangible personal property, such as art, stamps, and coins, may be transformed 
from a use asset to an investment based on the rarity and quality of the 
property. Likewise, a hobby, such as stamp collecting, may turn into a business 
depending on whether there is intent on the part of the collector to earn a 
profit from the activity as determined by the IRS and the courts.
Examples of popular investment-quality collectibles include artwork, gem-
stones, rare coins, antique dolls and furniture, and even baseball cards. All share 
certain attributes—notably, rarity and popularity within a sizeable market. But 
collectibles generally do not provide any current income to the owner and 
are best held for capital appreciation. Once disposed of, the items are taxed at 
a special long-term capital gain rate of 28 percent.
Although there is a market for collectibles, in most cases it is not an organized 
market. As a result, both buyers and sellers are at a disadvantage, because 
unless they are very skilled, they are unlikely to know what constitutes a fair 
price for the item. As with so many other consumer purchases, the Internet 
and a multiplicity of websites (particularly eBay) have improved access to ­reliable 
information about collectibles. Still, by and large the market for ­collectibles is 
inefficient.
Another problem with tangible personal property that may become a col-
lectible is that the market may be temporary. For example, several years back, 
Cabbage Patch Kids dolls were a heavily sought-after item that demanded high 
retail prices (and caused even higher tempers among potential purchasers). 
Today, however, the craze has passed, and the price has returned to a more 
normal level. This is bad news if you bought at the top of the market, intended 
to make a subsequent profit, and now have no practical use for the dolls.
It is possible to obtain insurance coverage for valuable tangible personal 
­property. If you own standard-use property, you need to schedule or endorse 
the property for an agreed-on value with the insurance company, as ­mentioned 
in Chapter 7. If, on the other hand, your property is truly a collectible with a 
recognized and sustainable market, you must enter into insurance ­negotiations 
with a specialized underwriter, such as those found at the Lloyds of London 
insurance market.
The next few chapters take up the defense of accumulated wealth, most nota-
bly from the harmful effect of income taxes. It is well understood by effective 
wealth managers that inflation and taxes are the two primary threats to wealth 
accumulation. However, only one of these threats—taxes—can be managed 
by the average individual. The purpose of the next section of the book is to 
show you how to manage taxes and leave more money in your pocket rather 
than adding to the fisc of Uncle Sam!

Income Tax 
Planning and

Now that we have discussed how to use the PADD process to protect and 
accumulate your wealth, we move on to the defense or preservation of that 
wealth. Specifically, Chapter 12 focuses on income tax planning and manage-
ment, with subsequent chapters addressing transfer tax (gift and estate tax) 
planning and life events that threaten wealth, such as divorce or loss of a job.
There are two primary threats that you must manage effectively in order to 
defend your wealth: inflation and taxes. Unfortunately, the rate of inflation is 
largely out of your individual control. However, you can be proactive when 
it comes to effective tax management, the first step of which is to become 
familiar with the basic provisions of the income tax system.
Basics of Income Tax Rates, Withholding,  
and Estimated Taxes
A basic rule of wealth accumulation and management is to determine not 
only how much income you have to spend or save, but also how much of this 
income you get to keep. In order to maximize how much of your income you 
get to keep, you need to know your federal income tax rate. Keep in mind 
that you should also know what your state income tax rate is if you work in a 
state that imposes an income tax. However, because of the wide variation in 
12
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 12 | Income Tax Planning and Management
156
state laws with respect to income taxes, only the basics of the federal system 
are discussed here.
There are two types of federal income tax rates: effective and marginal.   
Your effective or average tax rate is the total tax payable divided by your 
taxable income as reported on your federal income tax return. Normally, 
though, when someone asks what your tax rate is, they are referring to your 
marginal income tax rate, which is the percentage of tax applying to your next
dollar of taxable income.
As of the year 2013, seven federal marginal income tax rates apply to salaries 
and wages (and most other income other than capital gains income): 10, 15, 
25, 28, 33, 35, and 39.6 percent. These seven rates clearly are more than the 
two income tax rates (15 percent and 28 percent) implemented by the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986. But historically, seven is still a relatively small number of 
income tax rates. Moreover, as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief 
Act of 2012, these rates are now permanent (or as permanent as rates can 
be with a new Congress every two years).
Income is taxed in each of these rates according to a range of income known 
as an income tax bracket. Your bracket depends on the amount of taxable 
income you make in a year and the filing status you use to report this income 
(for example, single or jointly filed with your spouse). As a tax-management 
technique, you want to do everything legally possible to not progress into the 
next higher marginal tax bracket where all remaining income is then taxed at 
a greater percentage.
One strategy for minimizing your marginal tax rate involves holding invest-
ment or business property for a required length of time (currently, more than 
one year) before selling it. This is known as long-term capital gain property, and the   
tax rate that is assessed depends on your marginal income tax rate. For example, 
if you are in the 10 or 15 percent marginal tax bracket, long-term capital gains 
are now permanently not taxed at all (a rate of zero percent). Meanwhile, 
if your annual taxable income exceeds $400,000 for single taxpayers and 
$450,000 for joint filers, long-term capital gains are, beginning in 2013, taxed at 
a rate of 20 percent. In addition, a surtax of 3.8 percent (the purpose of which 
is to finance the future health insurance coverage provisions of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010) is charged on capital gain/invest-
ment income for single taxpayers with annual modified adjusted gross income 
(MAGI) over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers.
Losses from investment or business property in both sets of marginal tax   
brackets are first offset against any capital gains and, if there is any  remaining   
loss, are taken against salary or wages (or any other non-investment or 
business property income) up to a maximum of $3,000 in any given year. Any 
excess loss is then carried forward indefinitely until used up. For example, 

Plan Your Financial Future
157
assume that you or your tax preparer have reported that you have a long-term 
capital gain of $4,000 and a long-term capital loss of $5,000 in the current year 
(2013). You are in the 15 percent marginal income tax bracket. As such, you 
have no long-term capital gain (it is completely offset by the long-term capital 
loss), but you have incurred a remaining $1,000 long-term capital loss. As a 
result, you can use the total of this loss ($1,000) to reduce your salary or 
wages (or other non-investment or business property income), because it is 
less than $3,000 in the current year.
Once you know what your marginal income tax rate is (you can determine 
this by referring to past tax returns and checking the amount of taxable 
income against the bracket range), the next step is to figure out how much to 
withhold from your paycheck for future taxes. You do this by obtaining and 
completing an IRS Form W-4. Your goal in completing this form is to withhold 
taxes equal to 90 percent of what you think you will owe the federal govern-
ment at the end of the year. How do you do this? The IRS Form W-4 lets you 
claim allowances or exemptions based on your projected income for the cur-
rent year. An exemption reduces the amount of taxes withheld and increases 
the amount of your take-home pay. Therefore, the greater the number of 
exemptions claimed, the higher your take-home pay; and the lower the number 
of exemptions, the lower your take-home pay.
Some individuals, notably self-employed taxpayers, are required to pay estimated 
taxes in lieu of income taxes. However, some taxpayers must pay estimated 
taxes in addition to their income taxes. For example, if, as a salaried individual, 
you have a great deal of additional income, such as rental real-estate income, 
you may have to pay these taxes. Retirees with a large lump-sum distribution 
from their retirement plan also may be required to pay estimated taxes. If you 
are a taxpayer who is subject to estimating your taxes, your first payment is to 
be made by filing IRS Form 1040-ES on April 15 of the current year followed 
by payments on June 15, September 15, and January 15 (of the next year).
Social Security and Medicare Taxes (FICA)
Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), all salaried employees 
have to pay (or have withheld from their paycheck) 7.65 percent of their 
salary to fund the Social Security and Medicare social insurance systems. 
Specifically, 6.2 percent of the total portion of 7.65 percent represents the 
employee’s contribution to fund their own Social Security retirement benefit, 
and the remaining 1.45 percent helps to fund the Medicare program. There 
was a temporary reduction to 4.2 percent in the amount that employees 
were tasked with contributing to Social Security in 2011 and 2012, but this 
reduction was permitted to expire at the end of 2012, thereby restoring the  
6.2 percent employee contribution. The Social Security withholding is assessed

only up to a certain amount of the employee’s salary (referred to as the ­taxable 
wage base: for example, $113,700 in 2013) in any calendar year, whereas the 
Medicare withholding is assessed on an unlimited amount of employee salary.
Unlike state and local income taxes, which some taxpayers can separately 
deduct against their federal income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes 
are not deductible. Effectively, this increases the overall marginal income tax 
rate that an individual pays. For example, if you are in the highest marginal 
income tax bracket of 39.6 percent, you effectively pay 10.68 percent more in 
taxes (7.65 percent plus 3.03 percent (0.396 times .0765) because you cannot 
deduct these amounts from your federal income taxes.
Regular Income Tax vs. Individual Alternative 
Minimum Tax (AMT)
We just discussed the most important provisions of the regular income tax 
system—the one that most taxpayers must protect against as an ongoing 
threat to their accumulated wealth. However, there is another tax system that 
certain high-income (and some upper middle-income) taxpayers must plan 
for each year. This system is referred to as the individual alternative minimum 
tax (AMT).
The AMT is a parallel tax system originally designed to prevent a small number 
of high-income taxpayers from avoiding paying regular tax. Under the AMT 
system, taxpayers pay the greater of the regular tax or alternative minimum 
tax due in any given year. Beginning in 2012, the American Taxpayer Relief 
Act of 2010 increased the AMT annual exemption amounts to $50,600 for 
single taxpayers and $78,750 for married couples filing jointly. It also indexed 
those amounts for inflation after 2012. However, phaseouts do apply with 
respect to alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) such that once a tax-
payer’s income exceeds a certain amount, the exemptions no longer apply. 
For 2013, these indexed exemption amounts are $51,900 for single taxpayers 
and $80,800 for married couples filing jointly, with phaseouts of $115,400 and 
$153,900, respectively. Although the AMT top rate is only 28 percent of AMTI 
in excess of $179,500 in 2013 (compared to the regular system’s top rate of 
39.6 percent), certain deductions and other tax breaks that are provided in 
the regular system do not count in the AMT computation. As a result, even 
though it appears at first glance that you do not have to worry about the AMT 
if you are in the top four regular income tax brackets (28, 33, 35, and 39.6 
percent), unfortunately, because of the stated limitations, this is not the case.
The deductions and other regular income tax breaks not allowed to you 
under the AMT system are generally referred to as tax preference items. These 
items are added back to your regular taxable income to compute your AMTI, 

Plan Your Financial Future
159
upon which an AMT tax rate of 26 percent or 28 percent is imposed. Among 
such preference items is the income portion of an incentive stock option 
(ISO) occurring on the date of exercise of that option, the disallowance of the 
regular standard income tax deduction, and the disallowance of any personal 
or dependency exemptions. As an example, according to the Ernst &Young 
2011 Tax Guide, if, when the AMT exemption amount was $74,450 (married 
couple filing jointly), your regular taxable income was at least $100,000, you 
filed as a joint taxpayer, and you had more than $32,223 in tax preference 
items, you were likely to be subject to the AMT for that year.
How do you avoid the application of this onerous tax? First, understand what 
constitutes a tax preference item (they are described in the separate instruc-
tions to the AMT tax form), and then try to limit such items. For example,  
if you hold ISOs as an employee benefit from your employer, postpone 
­exercising them for as long as possible (ideally until your total income is rela-
tively low in a given year). Next, as curious as it seems, you may wish to consider 
accelerating income into the current year in the hopes of increasing your regular 
tax liability to above that of the AMT. Finally, postpone deductions that you cannot 
take for AMT purposes into the next taxable year. The deductions at risk 
here include certain itemized deductions, including the deduction for state 
income taxes and property taxes. If you currently live in a high income tax 
state, such as New York, you should ask your accountant or financial planner 
to separately compute your possible AMT liability.  Also note that these last 
two AMT planning techniques are the exact opposite of what you would do  
in regular income tax planning.  As a result,  AMT planning essentially requires 
you to think backward with respect to how you would otherwise try to 
­minimize taxes.
Basic Tax Planning Technique #1: Tax Avoidance
The term tax avoidance may be used narrowly, as when a higher-bracket 
­taxpayer gives property to a lower-bracket taxpayer and the lower-bracket 
taxpayer pays the income tax on that property at a reduced rate. Alternatively, 
the term may be used broadly, meaning that the higher-bracket taxpayer does 
not incur income taxes on the income. In the context that the term is used in 
this book, you should think of tax avoidance as broadly as possible.
The most common example of tax avoidance is taking full advantage of all 
income tax deductions to which you are entitled under the tax law. A tax 
deduction is a percentage reduction of your taxable income based on your 
marginal income tax rate. For example, if you are in the 33 percent marginal 
bracket, you are only, effectively, paying tax on 67 percent (1 less 0.33) of your 
income. Similarly, the standard deduction available to all taxpayers operates 
to exclude that specified amount of income from taxation. A third example 

Chapter 12 | Income Tax Planning and Management
160
of tax avoidance involves attempting to qualify for any income tax credits 
provided under law. A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction against an 
individual’s income tax liability and therefore is not affected by the taxpayer’s 
marginal income tax rate. For example, if you have computed your income tax 
liability before credits to be $10,000 this year, and you qualify for a credit of 
$1,000, you owe the government only $9,000 ($10,000 less $1,000). In practi-
cal effect and as a tax-avoidance technique, a credit is worth more to a lower-
bracket taxpayer (15 percent rate and below), whereas a deduction is worth 
more to a higher-bracket taxpayer (25 percent and above).
As a regular taxpayer, you are entitled to choose one of two general deduc-
tions: a specified standard deduction under law, based on your filing status, or 
a series of deductions known as itemized deductions. You want to choose the 
higher of the two deductions, because doing so will afford you the greatest 
tax benefit. As a practical matter, if you own a home that you have financed 
with a mortgage and are paying a sizable amount of interest on that mortgage, 
you can probably itemize your deductions. If you rent, have not financed your 
home, or have paid off your mortgage early, more than likely you are limited 
to choosing only the standard deduction.
You may potentially be able to take advantage of the following deductions if 
you elect to itemize:
Unreimbursed (by health insurance) medical expenses
• 
State and local income and property taxes
• 
State and local sales taxes (instead of state and local 
• 
income taxes)
Home equity loan or line-of-credit interest payments
• 
Charitable contributions
• 
Casualty and theft losses
• 
There are also a number of miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as unre-
imbursed employee expenses, home office expenses, and tax return prepa-
ration fees, that may only be deducted in limited circumstances. Generally, 
you cannot deduct any miscellaneous itemized deductions unless the total of 
those deductions exceeds 2 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI) as 
reported on your federal income tax return.
As mentioned, regardless of whether you take the standard deduction or 
itemize, certain tax credits are allowable for qualified taxpayers. There are two 
general types of credits: refundable and nonrefundable. A refundable credit, 
such as the earned income tax credit, is one where money is paid to you even 
though you have no income tax liability. Conversely, a nonrefundable credit 
is one where, at best, your tax liability can be reduced to zero (in other 
words, you are not separately paid if you do not owe any taxes). Of the two,  

Plan Your Financial Future
161
you should maximize the number of refundable credits you can take. 
Unfortunately, however, most credits are nonrefundable. 
Among the most popular nonrefundable (or only partially refundable) credits 
are the following:
The child and dependent care tax credit
• 
The child tax credit (partially refundable)
• 
The adoption credit
• 
The credit for the elderly or disabled
• 
Certain higher education expense credits, such as the 
• 
Lifetime Learning Credit
As a general strategy to avoid paying as much regular income tax as possible, 
you should accelerate deductions and credits into the current tax year and post-
pone income into the next or subsequent tax years. Salaried taxpayers typically 
find it difficult to postpone income, because they are not in control of when 
they receive it. However, self-employed taxpayers have much more latitude 
with respect to this tax-planning technique. For example, a self-employed 
taxpayer can choose to bill a client early in January of the following year 
rather than in late December of this year, thereby deferring taxes due on the 
income.
Tax Avoidance vs. Tax Evasion
While we are on the topic of tax avoidance, it is important to distinguish 
between income tax avoidance planning techniques and tax evasion. Avoidance 
techniques are perfectly legal and take advantage of tax benefits, such as 
deductions and credits, that are afforded to you under the tax law. Conversely, 
tax evasion is illegal; it means you intended to not comply with the tax law. The 
most common form of tax evasion is the failure to report all your taxable 
income for the calendar year.
If, in filing your tax return for any given year, you intend to break the law, the 
IRS must prove this fact in court. If it does, you will be found guilty of a felony 
offense that is punishable by severe monetary fines or imprisonment in a fed-
eral penitentiary. Fortunately, imprisonment is rarely the punishment for tax 
evasion. Instead, restitution (paying what you should have owed) and fines are 
the preferred recourse of the government. Nevertheless, if you are involved 
in a tax-evasion case, either as the subject of the investigation or as someone 
who knows something about it, you should immediately contact a tax attor-
ney to represent you to the IRS Criminal Investigation Division (CID). Do not 
speak voluntarily to the CID, because anything you say may be used against 
you later.

Basic Tax Planning Technique #2: Tax Deferral
The most common tax-deferral technique is to contribute to a retirement 
plan at work or to a personal retirement savings plan, such as a traditional 
or Roth IRA. We have already talked about the importance of contributing 
to your employer’s 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan and taking advantage 
of any matching contributions your employer may offer. However, from a tax 
planning perspective, you are also deferring the tax on any contributions made 
to the 401(k) or 403(b) plan and deferring the tax on any earnings generated 
from those contributions. Because 401(k) and 403(b) plans are tax-deferred 
retirement plans under law, you must pay tax on your contributions and earn-
ings beginning in the year after you reach the age of 70 and 6 months. In the 
meantime, you have enjoyed the financial advantage of the tax-free compound-
ing of your money. Let’s try to understand the importance of this advantage.
If you were asked, “Would you rather have $1,000 today or $1,000 ten years 
from now?” you would likely intuitively answer, “$1,000 today.” Why? The logic 
is that if you receive $1,000 today, you can invest the lump sum and make even 
more money with it. Assume that you invest your $1,000 in a U.S. Treasury 
Note that returns 5 percent annually. At the end of ten years, you will have 
$1,628.89. Alternatively, if you were to take the $1,000 ten years from now, the 
present value of this same amount would be only $613.91 in today’s dollars.
Now let’s look at this question another way. Think of the 5 percent annual 
rate of return as a tax percentage. If you have an income tax liability this year 
of $1,000 but you can somehow defer that liability for ten years, the present 
value of that liability is now only $613.91 (a savings of more than $386). And, 
using time-value-of-money principles, the longer you postpone that liability, the 
lower your present value and the greater your savings. Moreover, you should be 
aware that by year 40, your $1,000 liability is worth only $142.05 in present 
value dollars—approximately 14 cents on the dollar. You have generated the 
other 86 cents on the dollar completely income-tax free, which is the beauty of 
income-tax deferral with respect to retirement plan accumulations of wealth.
There are also other tax-deferral techniques involving financial products. 
Notably, if you purchase a tax-deferred fixed or variable annuity product, the 
taxes on your earnings from the after-tax contributions to that product are 
deferred (in some cases, until age 100). You can also purchase a tax-deferred 
annuity with a lump-sum distribution that you make from an employer’s retire-
ment plan (such as a 401(k)). However, because those contributions are really 
made with before-tax money (you never paid taxes on it), distributions must 
be made in the year after you reach the age of 70 and 6 months if you want 
to avoid paying hefty taxes on them.
Another financial product that provides for tax deferral is a cash-value life 
insurance policy. If you do not access the cash surrender amount in this ­policy 
during your lifetime, the death proceeds from the policy to your named 

Plan Your Financial Future
163
­beneficiary are completely income-tax free. Alternatively, the earnings on the 
cash value accumulated within a whole life, universal, variable, or variable/
universal life insurance policy are tax-deferred until you surrender the policy, 
assuming that the cash value you receive is in excess of the premiums paid on 
the policy at the time of surrender. For example, assume that you have owned 
a whole life insurance policy for some time and have accumulated $70,000 of 
cash-surrender value. During the course of the year, you surrender this policy 
for cash but have paid only $50,000 in premiums on the policy to date. The 
portion of the lump-sum payment of $70,000 in excess of the premiums paid 
of $50,000 ($20,000) is taxable immediately, payable at your current marginal 
income tax rate.
Basic Tax Planning Technique #3:  
The Conversion of Income
Ultimately, every item of income is generally classifiable as either ordinary 
income (such as salary and wages) or capital gains (generally, income deriving 
from the sale or disposition of an investment product, such as a stock or busi-
ness property). As previously noted, significantly different tax rates potentially 
apply to each of these types of income. For example, ordinary income is taxed 
at a maximum rate of 39.6 percent, whereas long-term capital gains income 
is taxed at a maximum rate of only 20 percent. This rate spread of almost 
20 percent suggests the prudence of following a tax-planning strategy that 
converts as much ordinary income as possible into capital gains income. It 
also underscores the importance of saving and investing as much as possible, 
because the appreciation on investment assets is taxable at a rate of no higher 
than 20 percent.
Assume that you have earned $1,000 in salary and are currently (in the year 
2013) in the maximum ordinary income tax bracket of 39.6 percent. Your 
after-tax, disposable dollars are $604 ($1,000 less $396). If you take this same 
$1,000 and invest it in ABC stock, which you later sell for $2,000 at least 
one year after you bought it, your after-tax, disposable dollars are now $800 
($1,000 less $200). Note that you incur only a 20 percent capital gains tax. If 
you were in the 15-percent-or-lower ordinary income-tax bracket, you would 
not pay any capital gains tax on this sale.
Since 2003, you can take advantage of capital gain income tax rates on most 
investment income (dividends) generated from stocks or stock mutual funds. 
However, keep in mind that dividends payable from indirect real-estate invest-
ments, such as a real estate investment trust (REIT), do not typically qual-
ify for this same advantage. As such, a conversion of income is not possible 
with these types of investments. There is also a common reverse conversion of 
income that many taxpayers unwittingly commit without realizing it. This occurs 

Chapter 12 | Income Tax Planning and Management
164
when a taxpayer invests in mutual funds (or individual stocks and bonds) in a 
­retirement plan—either an employer-sponsored plan, such a 401(k), or a tradi-
tional deductible IRA. In such cases, what the taxpayer has really done is invest 
in a capital asset, which could potentially be taxed at a lower capital gains rate 
on sale, and then converted it to an asset that requires the payment of ordinary 
income taxes on distribution. This happens because, for income tax purposes, 
a distribution from a retirement plan or IRA is considered a replacement for a 
salary, which would otherwise be taxable as ordinary income. Nonetheless, this 
disadvantageous conversion of income is likely outweighed by the extremely 
favorable, long-term tax deferral of earnings and contributions associated with 
an employer-sponsored retirement plan or IRA.
Tax-Smart Investing
Now that we have discussed both investing and income taxes, we need to 
combine the two. In other words, which type of account—tax-deferred or 
taxable—is most efficient to position a given type of financial asset?
Tax-deferred accounts, such as retirement plans, allow taxpayers to grow their 
assets over many years without having to pay taxes on the earnings. Therefore, 
it makes sense to position those investments that are not income-tax efficient 
in retirement plans. An example of such an investment is a zero-coupon bond, 
which generates taxable phantom income each year but does not distribute any 
corresponding cash to the bond holder. Other similarly income-tax-inefficient 
investments you may wish to position in retirement plans are individual cor-
porate, investment-grade bonds and bond mutual funds, as well as Treasury 
Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPs) and 
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Conversely, one type of financial 
asset you should generally not position in a tax-deferred account is a municipal 
bond or municipal bond fund. Interest from a municipal bond is tax-exempt, 
so if you position it in a tax-deferred account, you are converting its tax-free 
status to a taxable status once it is withdrawn from the retirement plan. It is 
important to note that in recent years, the tax-exempt yield generated from 
a municipal bond—as compared to a taxable corporate bond—was so advan-
tageous that it made economic sense to modify this strategy. However, as an 
income tax strategy, you are generally better off refraining from positioning 
municipal bonds and municipal bond funds in a tax-deferred account.
What about taxable accounts? As a general rule, individual stocks and stock 
mutual funds belong in these types of accounts, because they are more tax-
efficient than bonds and bond mutual funds. Index funds or exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs) are also good choices for taxable accounts, because they are pas-
sively managed and generally very income-tax efficient. However, with respect 
to stocks and stock mutual funds, an argument may be made that, given their 
growth potential and the total compounded dollars they have earned at the 

Plan Your Financial Future
165
time of withdrawal, they may also optimally fit into a tax-deferred portfolio. 
If you are working with a financial planner or investment advisor, ask them to 
give you perspective with regard to this argument.
What You Can Learn From Your Own  
Tax Return
Although most taxpayers do not prepare their own tax returns, they should 
understand the entries so as to plan more effectively for the coming years. 
The following points provide a brief explanation of some of the basics of filing 
a tax return:
• 
What is your filing status? If you are married and living 
together throughout the year, you should file your return 
jointly with your spouse, because generally you will be 
taxed more favorably. Alternatively, if you are a single 
parent with a dependent child or children, you should 
investigate filing your return by using the advantageous 
head-of-household status.
• 
How many personal exemptions can you claim? This depends 
on whether your personal circumstances meet a number 
of qualifying conditions, but you can always claim yourself 
and your spouse as exemptions.
• 
Should your investment interest be taxable or tax-exempt? As 
discussed, the higher your marginal income tax rate, the 
greater the advantage to you of investing in tax-exempt 
assets, such as municipal bonds or municipal bond funds.
• 
Do you have any self-employment income? If you do (to be 
reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedule C), you may be 
entitled to a number of business deductions that you 
would not otherwise be able to claim.
• 
Do you have capital losses (losses from the sale of any investment 
or business property)? As a tax planning technique, you should 
recognize capital losses in years when you have capital 
gains. These losses can offset capital gains and further offset 
ordinary income to the extent of $3,000 per year.
• 
Are you required to make required minimum distributions 
from your IRA this year? Just as with distributions from 
employer-sponsored retirement plans, you have to begin 
taking distributions from a traditional deductible IRA (not 
a Roth IRA) no later than April 1 of the year after you 
reach the age of 70 and 6 months.

Chapter 12 | Income Tax Planning and Management
166
• 
Can you contribute to and deduct contributions to your IRA 
this year? The answer is somewhat complicated and 
depends on your filing status, but if your income is low 
enough, you can both contribute to and deduct a speci-
fied amount annually from your IRA.
• 
Do you have enough deductions to itemize? If you own a house 
and have financed it with a mortgage, chances are that your 
amount of itemized deductions will exceed the standard 
deduction afforded to you under law for a given year.
• 
What is your taxable income? Depending on your filing status, 
this amount determines what marginal income tax bracket 
you are in and your applicable marginal income tax rate.
• 
Do you qualify for any additional tax credits this year? All 
allowable credits have qualifying conditions or limitations. 
However, if you qualify, a credit affords you a dollar-for-dollar 
tax reduction.
• 
Do you owe household employment taxes? Generally, you 
are responsible for paying Social Security and Medicare 
taxes if you employ a household domestic worker, such 
as a nanny. This is one of the most overlooked sections of 
income tax law and has resulted in the imposition of tax 
penalties for many salaried and self-employed workers.
• 
Did you pay tax or receive a tax refund? A goal of many 
taxpayers is to receive as big a refund as possible when 
they file their tax return, but think about it: if you receive 
a refund, you have just given the federal government an 
interest-free loan for the entirety of the previous tax 
year. Alternatively, you do not want to withhold so little 
tax that penalties are imposed for the previous year. Your 
goal should be a small tax payment with the filing of your 
individual income tax return (for example, a payment of 
no more than $100).
We now move on to the other major tax that can reduce your accumulated 
wealth very quickly: the transfer tax imposed under federal tax law. The transfer 
tax, which includes estate and gift taxes, is most relevant in estate planning and 
will be referred to again in Chapter 19. Regardless, the next chapter provides 
important information with respect to the provisions and application of 
federal estate and gift tax law in planning for your financial future.

Transfer Tax 
Planning and 
Management
Once an individual has accumulated wealth, their motivations in the financial 
planning process turn to not only how to protect or defend this wealth, but 
also how to distribute it. For this reason, this chapter explains gifts and the 
advantages of making gifts in transfer-tax planning and management. Many 
­individuals think that transfer tax (gift and estate tax) planning is only relevant 
for very high-net-worth taxpayers, but this is not really true. For example, did 
you know that you can give away $14,000 per year, regardless of the amount 
of your net worth, to donees without having to file a federal gift tax return, IRS 
Form 709? Just as important, did you know that once you exceed this $14,000 
limit, you are required by law to file a federal gift tax return? Yes, you will also 
have to include Christmas gifts on that tax return if you have given away the 
full $14,000 limit earlier in the same year.
This chapter also considers how to minimize your taxable estate at death. 
Although there has been a great deal of discussion in Congress about the 
repeal of the estate tax (sometimes referred to as the death tax), it is still with 
us—and likely will be so in some form for years to come. We talk more about 
the distribution of wealth in Section 5 of this book, but the beauty of lifetime 
gifting is that it accomplishes two steps of the PADD process at once: the 
defense of your wealth against transfer taxes and the distribution of that wealth 
for the benefit of others (typically, your spouse and children).

The Advantages of Lifetime Gifting
You may have many reasons for making gifts. Among these may be personal 
reasons, such as assisting a family member or close friend in immediate finan-
cial need. You may also have tax reasons for gifting. Whereas lifetime gifting 
(other than to charity) does not generate an income tax deduction, it does 
shift the income generated from the gifted property onto someone else. 
Numerous tax rules restrict the outright assignment of income to others, but 
if you gift them an income-producing asset, such as a stock, a bond, or real 
estate, the donee—and not you—will pay the future income tax on the gains 
that asset generates.
Under the gift tax rules, there are three ways to make gifts to others ­without 
worrying about paying a gift tax. The first has already been mentioned: as 
of 2013, you can give up to $14,000 per year to as many donees as you 
like. Technically, this $14,000 allowance per donee is known as the gift tax 
annual exclusion amount. For example, if you have ten children, you can give up 
to $140,000 per year ($14,000 times 10) without concerning yourself with 
reporting these gifts to the federal government. But be careful: some taxpayers, 
believe it or not, are so concerned about reducing their income- and estate-tax 
liability that they forget to ask a basic question before making a gift—can I 
afford to make this gift without sacrificing my own future financial security?
The second method of making a lifetime gift is to transfer assets or property 
to your spouse or a qualified charity. Unlike gifts to others, you can make a 
gift of unlimited value to your spouse or a qualified charity. Particularly as the 
situation relates to estate-tax planning, it may be financially beneficial to make 
gifts to your spouse or a qualified charity, because the gifted property is now 
completely removed from your taxable estate at death. However, as you will 
see later in this chapter, if your spouse is the recipient of your gift, you may be 
causing a further estate tax problem for them if they are already of high net 
worth in their own right (or expects to be shortly).
The third method of prudent lifetime gifting is to pay the educational or medi-
cal expenses of a loved one. However, the payment of such gifts needs to be 
made directly to the educational institution or medical provider, not indirectly 
through the donee, who would then pay the institution or provider. If the 
donee is the intermediary, the $14,000 or other indexed-for-annual-inflation 
limit applies, rather than the unlimited amount that is possible if the institution 
or provider is the payee.
If you give more than $14,000 annually to any donee, you are legally required 
to file a gift tax return and apply the excess amount against an overall lifetime 
exemption limit of $5.25 million (a $5.0 million indexed amount) through  

Plan Your Financial Future
169
the end of calendar year 2013. There are two consequences to making a gift 
that is larger than the annually permitted limit:
You begin to use up your overall lifetime limit of $5.25 
• 
million. Once you exceed $5.25 million in lifetime taxable 
gifts, you pay federal gift tax out of pocket.
The gift tax value of the gift you make (the property’s 
• 
fair market value at the time you gift it) is included in the 
estate tax computation as an adjusted taxable gift, mean-
ing it adds to your potential taxable estate at death.
For example, assume that you make a gift of appreciated stock to your 
adult son in 2013. The fair market value of this stock at the time you give 
it is $100,000. Thus, you have made a taxable gift of $86,000 ($100,000 less 
$14,000) for which you must file a federal gift tax return. As a result, you now 
have only $5,164,000 ($5.25 million less $86,000) of your lifetime exemption 
limit left. This taxable gift of $86,000 is also added to your taxable estate 
at your date of death. The good news, however, is that your gift is frozen 
in taxable value at that amount and cannot increase to a date-of-death fair  
market value (because you don’t own the stock anymore)! In other words, you  
have removed any future appreciation of the gifted property from your taxable  
estate. In this example, let’s say the $100,000 in stock that you gave your son 
appreciates to $600,000 at your death 20 years later. The appreciation amount 
of $500,000 ($600,000 less $100,000) is now forever removed from possible 
future transfer taxation in your estate.
Let’s go back to taking maximum advantage of the $14,000 annual gift tax 
exclusion. In the example given previously, wherein each of ten children is 
the donee of $14,000, the person who gave the gift immediately removed 
$140,000 from their taxable estate and did not have to file a gift tax return or 
worry about reducing their overall $5.25 million exemption limit in 2013. This 
strategy is known in estate planning as a systematic annual gifting program and 
takes advantage of as many gift-tax annual exclusion amounts as possible, to 
as many donees as possible, to reduce the donor’s taxable estate. Therefore, 
as a transfer-tax planning technique, you should look first into adopting a 
systematic gifting program by making as many annual exclusion gifts as you 
can afford at the beginning of each calendar year. In this manner, you not only 
reduce your taxable estate but also remove an additional year of income from 
the gift—unless it is cash—from your current year’s taxable income.
Gifts to Minors
If you are going to make gifts to a minor (someone who is under the  
state-specified age of legal majority, usually 18), you have to be concerned not 
only about gift tax laws, but also about state property laws. Minors cannot take 

Chapter 13 | Transfer Tax Planning and Management
170
title to property in the same way individuals of legal majority—adults—can. 
Instead, minors must take title through custodial arrangements as specified 
by each state. Historically, custodial arrangements have also been a common 
method of saving for a child’s college education, as discussed in Chapter 15.
There are two basic types of custodial arrangements: those provided by the 
Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and those provided by the Uniform 
Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA). In many states, UTMA has superseded the 
previously enacted UGMA and is now the approved form for making prop-
erty transfers to minors. Under both uniform laws, the minor is given title to 
property, but the property is managed by a custodian, usually the parent or 
grandparent of the minor. This custodian then invests and manages the gifted 
property on behalf of the minor and does not own the property in any respect. 
As such, the custodial arrangement is similar to a trust on behalf of the minor, 
but it lacks the complexity and cost of implementing the trust document.
All states have simple forms to title property gifted to a minor in a custodial 
arrangement, but be aware that custodial gifts to minors are completed gifts 
for federal gift-tax purposes. In other words, the gift becomes the minor’s prop-
erty, and not yours, if you are the donor. As a result, at the state-specified legal 
age of majority, the child can do whatever they want with the gifted property. 
Even if the gift was intended to finance the child’s future educational expenses, 
they are under no obligation to go to college or pursue higher education. 
Meanwhile, income used for your minor child’s maintenance and support is 
taxable to you if you are the child’s parent, even though you may not be the 
named custodian of the custodial arrangement. This is because, under all state 
property laws, as the child’s parent you have the legal obligation to support 
and raise that child until they attain the legal age of majority.
Fortunately, as discussed in Chapter 15, Congress recently legislated a much 
better technique for saving for college than custodial arrangements. Called 
a private savings plan, this approach for funding a child’s future educational 
expenses is made possible under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(commonly referred to as Section 529 savings plans).
A Basic Primer on the Use of Trusts
A trust is an arrangement to which there are three parties:
The individual who establishes the trust (known as the 
• 
creator or grantor)
The trustee of the trust
• 
The individual or individuals for whose benefit the 
• 
trust is established (known as the trust beneficiary or 
beneficiaries)

Plan Your Financial Future
171
In any trust arrangement, the trustee must act solely and exclusively on behalf 
of the trust beneficiaries. As such, the trustee has the legal title to the trust 
assets, but the beneficiaries have what is known in the law as equitable title to 
the assets.
Trusts carry many advantages when they are used in transfer-tax planning 
and management, as well as in estate planning generally. Among these are the 
following:
The ability to benefit one or more specified beneficiaries
• 
The ability to afford the expertise of a professional or 
• 
other skilled individual in the management of the invest-
ment of trust assets
The ability to provide asset protection
• 
The ability to avoid probate
• 
The ability to achieve income and transfer tax savings
• 
There are many types of trusts, including those established on behalf of minors, 
but all may be categorized from a transfer-tax perspective as either revocable 
or irrevocable trusts.
Revocable Trusts
A revocable trust is a trust that is created during your lifetime and over which 
you retain the power to revoke or take back the trust assets. Accordingly, you 
do not make a completed gift, nor do you lose the right to the income from 
the trust assets. However, if you appoint someone else the beneficiary of the 
trust, a gift does occur at that time. Once you die, if you have not revoked 
the trust, the trust becomes irrevocable and can operate in lieu of a will to 
distribute your assets.
A revocable trust offers two major advantages, neither of which involves 
transfer-tax savings:
If you transfer assets to the trust during your lifetime and 
• 
re-title them in the name of the trustee (which is typically 
you), the trust assets avoid the probate process in the 
state where you die.
If you become mentally incompetent (for example, if you 
• 
contract Alzheimer’s disease), the successor trustee of 
the trust can assume the management of your financial 
and personal affairs.
Additionally, you can reduce the beneficiary’s estate tax using a revocable trust—
once it becomes irrevocable at your death—if the trust is drafted properly.

Chapter 13 | Transfer Tax Planning and Management
172
Keep in mind that because you keep complete control over the trust and 
its assets, the assets are included in your gross estate. However, if you are 
below the estate tax allowable exemption amount ($5.25 million in 2013), 
you should not be concerned about this disadvantage. Furthermore, generally 
the advantages that trusts provide far outweigh the lack of transfer-tax savings 
your estate will suffer from the revocable trust at the time of your death.
Revocable trusts, which are also known as living trusts once property is retitled 
in the name of the trustee, are heavily promoted by trust sponsors and market-
ing firms as the panacea to all estate tax problems. Although this is decidedly not 
the case, living trusts can be a very effective estate-planning tool, particularly for 
individuals who own a vacation home or other real estate in a state other than 
their primary residence. For owners of out-of-state vacation homes, a ­second 
or ancillary probate proceeding is required in the state where the vacation home 
is located. By transferring the title of the vacation home to the trustee of the 
revocable trust, your estate can avoid multiple probate proceedings.
Irrevocable Trusts
An irrevocable trust, which may be created during your lifetime or at the time 
of your death, can result in estate-tax savings when you—the creator of the 
trust—die. The term irrevocable means just what it implies: you cannot change, 
revoke, or amend the trust in any way after you create it. This disadvantage alone is 
incentive enough for many trust creators to shy away from even considering the 
implementation of an irrevocable trust—with one or two notable exceptions.
The first reason you may wish to create an irrevocable trust has to do with 
the usual motivations of individuals who purchase life insurance policies. Most 
individuals purchase a life insurance policy for death-motivated reasons: that 
is, to protect their survivors from the loss of income resulting from their 
death. Given the at-death motivation and the fact that a very low gift-tax value 
is associated with most policies, the life insurance policy is usually an excellent 
asset to transfer to an irrevocable trust. As such, funding a trust with only  
a life insurance policy, otherwise known as creating an irrevocable life 
­insurance trust (ILIT), is a commonly used estate-planning technique.
The second reason you may wish to create an irrevocable trust is for asset 
protection from creditors. This type of trust, which is particularly popular 
among doctors and lawyers and other professionals who are frequently the 
target of lawsuits, is known as a foreign situs or offshore trust. Be careful, though: 
the offshore trust is controversial, and the IRS monitors its operation very 
carefully. In part, this is because the income generated from property trans-
ferred to the trust is still taxable to its creator or grantor. As a result, unless 
the trust is drafted very skillfully and for appropriate estate-planning reasons, 
the trust may be rendered void on its face in violation of the state fraudulent 
conveyance laws of its creator.

Components and  Valuation of the Gross Estate
Thus far in this chapter, I have mentioned the estate tax on a few occasions, 
but what, exactly, is the estate tax? This tax is ultimately assessed on an amount 
known as the tentative tax base, which is your taxable estate plus any adjusted 
taxable gifts made during your lifetime; but the computation begins with assets 
that make up the taxpayer’s gross estate. The gross estate is similar to gross 
income under income tax law, but with one major difference: in income tax 
law, tax is assessed on your annual income, whereas in estate tax law, tax is 
assessed on the fair market value of your lifetime assets as of the date of your 
death. Operationally, the income tax is a government levy on the inflow items 
you show on your personal cash flow statement; conversely, the estate tax is a 
government levy on the asset items you show on your statement of personal 
financial position.
The gross estate consists of not only assets you die owning, but also certain 
lifetime transfers (gifts) over which you retain control or from which you 
enjoy benefits at the time of your death. For example, if you make a gift to an 
irrevocable lifetime trust but at your death are an income beneficiary of that 
trust, the total fair market value of the trust assets at your date of death is 
taxed. Similarly, if you have previously gifted an out-of-state vacation home to 
your favorite child, but you retain by agreement with that child the right to use 
the home whenever you want, the fair market value of that home at your date 
of death is taxed. For example, assume that you live in North Dakota but own 
a winter home in Florida. In 2013, you transfer the title to the Florida home to 
your oldest son but, per an oral agreement with him, are permitted to use the 
home whenever you want. If you die still holding this power, the fair market 
value of the Florida home is included in your gross estate, as if you had never 
transferred the title to your son in the first place.
Property is included in your estate at its fair market value as of the date of your 
death. You should contrast this with gifted property, which is valued at its fair 
market value as of the date of the gift. Most of the time, the date-of-death fair 
market value of property can be easily established. For example, publicly traded 
stock is valued based on the average of the highest and lowest trading price on 
the decedent’s date of death. Real estate can also be relatively easily valued by 
referencing comparable sales in the neighborhood or area. However, if a dece-
dent is the owner of a small, family, or closely held business, the value of their 
business interest may not be so easily determined. Many factors must be consid-
ered when establishing this value, not the least of which is whether the owner 
owns a controlling or minority interest in the business at the time of their death. 
If you are an owner of a closely held business, it is best to contact a qualified 
appraiser to help you value it properly for estate- or gift-tax purposes.
One final comment with respect to the assets included in the gross estate and 
their respective value: if you die owning or having incidents of ownership with 

Chapter 13 | Transfer Tax Planning and Management
174
respect to a life insurance policy, you have to include the death proceeds or face 
value of that policy in your gross estate. This is a much greater amount than the 
fair market value of the policy, which, depending on its type, is usually ­relatively 
small. For example, if you own a cash-value type of life insurance policy, its fair 
market value is very close to its accumulated cash value. Meanwhile, if you 
own a term policy that has no cash value, its fair market value is very close 
to zero. This is all the more reason to consider making a lifetime gift of a life 
insurance policy to a beneficiary: if you gift it, the policy has a very small value, 
whereas if you die owning it, the policy has a very large value. Assume, for 
example, that you die owning a whole life insurance policy with a face value 
of $500,000 and that the accumulated cash value in this policy at your date of 
death is $80,000. For estate-tax purposes, the policy is included in your gross 
estate at a value of $500,000. If you had previously gifted it, the policy value for 
gift-tax purposes would be no more than $80,000 (and probably less, because 
the policy would not have accumulated the same amount of cash value at your 
death years later).
Deductions and Credits Available to the Estate
As with the income tax system, deductions and credits are available to the 
estate for transfer-tax purposes. However, unlike those that you can claim 
under the income tax system, these deductions and credits are not usually 
limited in amount.
The two most useful—and probably the most frequently claimed—estate tax 
deductions are those for property transfers at death to either your spouse 
or a qualified charity. Respectively, these are known as the estate tax marital 
deduction and the estate tax charitable deduction. They are unlimited in amount, 
as is also the case for transfers to a spouse or qualified charity during an 
individual’s lifetime for gift-tax purposes. However, both types of property 
transfers need to be left in a qualifying form before the deduction is permit-
ted. Specifically, property transfers to a spouse at death must be left without 
restriction, and property transfers to a qualified charity must generally be left 
in the form of a charitable trust.
Assume that you leave all your property outright (with no restrictions) to 
your spouse at your date of death under your will or by beneficiary designa-
tion. This is acceptable and qualifies the full amount of transferred assets for 
the unlimited estate-tax marital deduction. However, if you left your property 
to your spouse only for their lifetime use or for a term of years (in other 
words, with restrictions), the transfer typically does not qualify for the unlim-
ited marital deduction. Next, assume that you leave property in remainder 
interest to a qualified charity but reserve the right to the income from the 
property during your lifetime through a charitable remainder trust (CRT). 

Plan Your Financial Future
175
The remainder interest left to charity at the time of your death qualifies for 
the unlimited estate-tax charitable deduction. But if you tried to accomplish 
this same transfer during your lifetime without establishing a trust, the unlim-
ited charitable deduction would likely not be allowed.
There are also several credits available in estate-tax planning, the most useful 
of which is the unified credit. The unified credit is equal to a certain amount of 
property that may be transferred estate-tax-free at death. However, as with 
income tax, this credit is applied only after computing the total tax liability. For 
example, in 2013, the amount of estate tax on $5.25 million of taxable estate 
property is $2,045,800. To that amount, you must apply the allowable unified 
credit of $2,045,800, so your net estate-tax liability is zero. When you hear 
that you may transfer up to $5.25 million in property free of estate tax ­(actually 
more, if your only beneficiary is your spouse or a qualified ­charity), you know 
it to be true, because you have an allowable unified credit of $2,045,800 to 
offset the tax due on that amount.
But you need to be aware of one circumstance that reduces the $2,045,800 uni-
fied credit at death. Because the gift- and estate-tax systems are linked (which 
is where the term unified comes from), any taxable gifts that you make during 
your lifetime in excess of the gift tax annual exclusion impact the amount of 
unified credit that is available to your estate at your death. As such, if you 
make any taxable gifts during your lifetime, the credit amount that you use to 
offset that gift-tax liability reduces your allowable unified credit at death. For 
example, assume that you die with a taxable estate of $5.25 million in 2013 
and you leave it all equally to your two children. During your lifetime, however, 
you made taxable gifts of $75,000 to each of those children. In operational 
effect, this means you have a tentative tax base of $5.4 million, leaving you with 
an estate tax due of $60,000 ($150,000 excess over $5.25 million exempted 
amount times the applicable marginal estate tax rate of 40 percent). Looked 
at another way, you have reduced your allowable unified credit by $60,000 and 
thus only have available at your death an allowable unified credit of $1,985,800 
($2,045,800 less $60,000).
Tax Rates and the Possible Repeal of the 
Death Tax
In recent years, one of the transfer taxes—the estate tax—has become some-
what of a political football. Specifically, some legislators have urged the repeal 
of what they believe to be an unnecessary and even punitive tax, while others 
are worried about the revenue effects of eliminating this tax. Fortunately, the 
ongoing debate over the estate tax was likely settled—at least for now—
with the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Relief Act) and 
the provision of a maximum federal estate tax rate of 40 percent with an 

Chapter 13 | Transfer Tax Planning and Management
176
inflation-adjusted $5.0 million exemption or exclusion amount. This provi-
sion is effective for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2012, as 
well as for lifetime taxable gifts made after that date.
Moreover, the Relief Act included a permanent extension of the portability of 
exclusion amounts between married couples. Specifically, portability allows 
the estate of a decedent who is survived by a spouse to make an election to 
permit the surviving spouse to apply the decedent’s unused exclusion to the 
surviving spouse’s own transfers during life and at death. In effect, to the extent 
that the decedent’s spouse’s $5.25 million exclusion is not used at all during 
their lifetime or at death, the married couple enjoys a joint $10.50 million 
($5.25 million times 2) exclusion amount before any transfer tax is payable 
in 2013. However, note that to take advantage of portability of the unused 
exclusion, an estate tax return needs to be filed for the first spouse regardless
of whether any estate tax is due for that spouse.
As you might appreciate, the 40 percent transfer tax rate in 2013 is relatively 
high. Thus, if you currently have a gross estate of at least $5.25 million, the 
need for transfer-tax planning is particularly acute. Otherwise, the govern-
ment, rather than your family, may be the chief beneficiary of your lifetime 
assets. Even if you are currently below $5.25 million in total net worth, if 
you think you may exceed that amount at your death (perhaps through the 
wealth-accumulation and -management techniques explained in this book), 
you need to plan.
Do I Really Want to Leave It All to My Spouse 
or Charity?
As we have discussed, the deduction available for transfers made at death to 
a spouse or charity is unlimited in amount. But as a planning technique, do you 
really want to take full advantage of either deduction?
Although the tax law allows you and your spouse to leave each other all 
property free from estate tax, you may end up increasing or overfunding your 
spouse’s estate if you leave everything to them. This is particularly the case if 
your net worth is already at or near the estate-tax exemption equivalent of 
tax-free property ($5.25 million in 2013). If your spouse is much younger than 
you (and thus there is considerable time for your bequeathed assets to grow 
in value), it may not be the best idea to leave it all to them. This possibility is 
one of the major problems with titling all your property in joint tenancy 
with right of survivorship (JTWROS) with your spouse: from a planning 
perspective, JTWROS titling limits your flexibility, because all property passes 
directly to your spouse.
Moreover, insofar as federal transfer-tax law is concerned, there is no 
debate about who constitutes a spouse for the purposes of taking advantage 

Plan Your Financial Future
177
of the unlimited marital deduction allowance; that is, the spouse must be a 
member of the opposite sex. This is the case even if your state of residence 
recognizes same-sex couples as being legally married, because when it comes 
to transfer-tax law advantages, federal law and not state property law is in con-
trol. As a result, gay and lesbian couples of fairly sizable net worth cannot plan 
to pass on their individual estates to the other partner free of estate or gift 
tax as traditional married couples can. If you are part of this segment of the 
population, you need to consult an estate-planning attorney who specializes 
in planning for gay and lesbian couples.
If your estate or the combined estate of you and your spouse is currently 
equal to or expected to be more than the allowable exemption equivalent, 
you may wish to consider seeking the counsel of an estate-planning attor-
ney relatively soon. You may also wish to do so if you have questions about  
the possible application of the portability exclusion election. When and if 
you do seek assistance, ask the attorney about including in your estate plan a  
disclaimer trust, which will allow your spouse or estate executor to do 
some after-death planning and legally refuse the amount of your property that 
may overfund their estate. It will save your ultimate estate beneficiaries a 
great deal of money in the long run.
In contrast to property left to your spouse, you do not need to be concerned 
about possibly overfunding a charity. If the charity is tax-qualified, it is a tax-
exempt entity and does not pay any income or transfer taxes on bequeathed 
property. You do, however, need to take into account how best to take care 
of family members who have otherwise been disinherited because their por-
tion of your estate went to a charity. In most states, your surviving spouse may 
elect against your will to take the portion of your estate that they normally 
would have been entitled to—usually half of all your property at death—but 
your children, siblings, and close friends are not permitted this election.
There are several ways to benefit or “re-inherit” your children or other dis-
advantaged heirs. The most popular is to buy a life insurance policy and name 
your children as its beneficiaries. If you buy a policy in the name of an ILIT, 
the death proceeds from the policy are removed from your gross estate for 
transfer-tax purposes. However, because the proceeds are paid from a life 
insurance policy, they are not taxable to your children or other beneficiary 
for income tax purposes. In estate-planning terminology, setting up an ILIT in 
this manner, and for the reason of making up an inheritance otherwise lost to 
charity, is known as a wealth replacement trust.
For example, assume that, as an unmarried individual with two adult children, 
you wish to benefit the American Cancer Society (ACS) with the majority of 
your $5.25 million estate in 2013. As a result, you make a bequest in your will 
of $4 million to the ACS. Meanwhile, at the time you write your will, you also 
establish an ILIT and name your two adult children as the trust beneficiaries. 
You then have the ILIT purchase a $4 million life insurance policy on your life. 

Chapter 13 | Transfer Tax Planning and Management
178
Accordingly, you get the benefit of both claiming the estate tax charitable 
deduction and accomplishing your philanthropic goals. Plus, you meet these 
objectives without disadvantaging your children, who would otherwise expect 
to be the beneficiaries of your estate.
The Unintended Danger of  
Generation-Skipping Transfers
A number of high-net-worth individuals are unaware that there is a third 
­transfer tax on gifts and estates that skip a generation, such as those made by 
a grandparent to a grandchild. The additional transfer tax that is assessed on 
this transfer is known as the generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT).
The rules with respect to skip transfers are very complex, but here is what 
you need to know to avoid the GSTT:
The tax is designed to impose the equivalent of the gift or 
• 
estate tax that the intervening generation (or the ­parent’s 
generation) would have paid for the transfer.
The tax is imposed 
• 
in addition to either the estate or gift 
tax; thus, the tax can only add to an otherwise sizable 
transfer tax burden.
The tax is assessed at the 
• 
maximum estate tax rate in 
a flat rate at the time of a generation-skipping transfer  
(for example, in 2013, a flat 40 percent rate applies to any 
generation-skipping transfer). There is no progressivity 
leading up to this maximum rate as there is with other 
lifetime or testamentary transfers.
The tax potentially applies to a gift made either directly 
• 
from grandparent to grandchild during the grandparent’s 
lifetime (known as a direct skip) or at the time of the 
grandparent’s death via a trust, wherein the grandchild 
is benefited to the exclusion of the parent (otherwise 
referred to as a taxable termination or indirect skip).
The tax potentially applies to a gift made from one unre-
• 
lated individual (transferor) to another (transferee), 
where the transferee is at least 37-1/2 years younger 
than the transferor.
The liability for paying the tax falls on different individuals 
• 
depending on the type of generation-skipping transfer 
made.

Plan Your Financial Future
179
Fortunately, most individuals can escape the payment of the GSTT—even if 
they do make a generation-skipping transfer—rather easily. This is because 
the transferor has a $5.25 million exemption (in 2013) that they can allocate 
to the transfer to avoid the imposition of the tax. This allowable exemption, 
to be used on an elective basis by the transferor or their estate, tracks the 
estate-tax exemption equivalent or exclusion that was previously discussed. 
Direct gifts to grandchildren that qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion 
($14,000 in 2013) during the grandparent’s lifetime also are not subject to 
the tax.
Let’s say, for example, that in 2013, a wealthy grandfather makes a direct gift 
of $5,264,000 in appreciated stock to his adult granddaughter. If he elects to 
allocate his full $5.25 million generation-skipping exemption to the transfer 
(the $14,000 gift tax annual exclusion is automatic and does not need to be 
elected), no GSTT is imposed. However, be aware that the generation-skipping 
tax exemption amount is now fully allocated and may not be used to offset 
any additional generation-skipping transfers at the time of the grandfather’s 
death. Also, not only may the GSTT apply to the direct gift, but so does the 
federal gift tax on any transfers made from a donor to a donee in excess of 
$14,000 annually in 2013.
In summary, the GSTT may be easily avoided with a little planning. If your will 
or trust was drafted before 1987, when this tax came into effect, you should 
ask your estate-planning attorney or financial planner to review it to see if the 
tax applies. If the tax does potentially apply, amend your will so as to defend 
your hard-earned wealth. If you are fortunate enough to avoid the imposi-
tion of the tax in your estate planning, be aware that the GSTT constitutes 
an unintended danger to the accumulation and distribution of wealth from one 
generation to the next.
Now, to conclude this section of the book, let’s look at common events 
that may threaten the accumulation of lifetime wealth. Among these are the 
divorce of married couples and the unexpected loss of employment in today’s 
economy. Life events that endanger wealth are the title and focus of the next 
chapter.

Life Events that  
Endanger Wealth
As you go through life, you sometimes experience events that endanger or 
threaten the amount of wealth that you have accumulated. We have already 
discussed the importance of obtaining an individual disability income policy 
in the event of physical disability, and we will discuss how to plan for your 
own possible mental incapacity later in this chapter. Specifically, however, 
we identify important planning considerations with respect to six potentially 
financially devastating life events, including divorce, the loss of a job for an 
extended period of time, the death of a spouse or life partner, a parent incur-
ring a debilitating condition, caring for a developmentally disabled child, and 
physical or mental incapacity.
Divorce
Statistics indicate that one of out of every two marriages ends in divorce  
(the legal ending of a marriage) or separation (the establishment of a separate 
and independent lifestyle from that of your spouse). How do you financially 
make the best of (and hopefully recover from) divorce or separation?
Likely the first financial task that you, your attorney, or your financial plan-
ner should undertake—either before the divorce is finalized or immediately 
after property settlement—is to separate your and your spouse’s assets and 
liabilities. In other words, you need to prepare new statements of personal 
financial position. Unlike before, when assets and liabilities could be listed 
as joint or individually owned on one statement, you now potentially need 
to prepare three personal financial statements: his, hers, and ours. If you live 
14

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
182
in a community property state, such as California or Texas, the division of 
assets and liabilities is easier, because all marital property must be divided 
equally between spouses. This may not be the case in non–community 
property states, also referred to as “common law states”. Nevertheless, 
the preparation of separate financial statements is still prudent divorce  
planning in all states.
Once you have identified and reduced to writing your and your spouse’s total 
assets and liabilities, each of you needs to prepare separate income or cash-
flow statements. Doing so will assist you in determining whether temporary 
alimony or child support is possible before the divorce is finalized, and it 
also will help you establish any future amounts that may need to be paid. 
As a general rule, many divorcing spouses (particularly women) do not fully 
understand how their living expenses will change after divorce. As a result, 
ex-spouses typically underestimate how much money they will need to sustain 
their pre-divorce standard of living. The notable exception to this rule is a 
celebrity divorce, wherein divorcing spouses typically overestimate their future 
income needs.
Three basic provisions of most divorce or separation agreements should be 
carefully considered by separating spouses:
The amount and necessity of alimony payments from one 
• 
spouse to the other
The amount of child support payments, if there are minor 
• 
children from the marriage
The division of property accumulated during the marriage 
• 
(otherwise known as the property settlement agreement)
If the spouses own a home at the time of the divorce, attention should also be 
given to how best to divide equity in that important asset.
Alimony
Alimony, if it is to be paid, is often the most contentious aspect of any divorce 
proceeding. This is complicated by the fact that the payer of the alimony 
receives an income tax deduction for payments made, thereby encouraging 
them to allocate as much of the total payments from the divorce to alimony as 
possible. To prevent this abuse, some years ago Congress added a provision 
to the Internal Revenue Code known as excess front-loading alimony rules, com-
monly referred to as alimony recapture. If violated, these rules make the payer 
go back and include in their income statement some portion of the alimony 
paid and deducted.

Plan Your Financial Future

For example, assume that a husband made an alimony payment of $50,000 
in the first year subsequent to a divorce and nothing thereafter. Under the 
alimony recapture rules, at the end of the third year after the divorce, the 
husband is required to file an amended income tax return and include a  
portion of the $50,000 first-year payment in his income. This excess payment 
is referred to as disguised alimony because, inevitably, the real intent of the pay-
ment was as part of a property settlement agreement between the husband 
and wife. This payment could also have been intended as child support in the 
event that the couple had minor children at the time of the divorce.
The payee, for their part, must include in their income any alimony paid by the 
payer. Although not technically income in the sense of salary or wages, alimony 
constitutes earned income as characterized by a traditional IRA contribution. 
This means a stay-at-home ex-wife receiving alimony from her husband may 
contribute and deduct up to the specified annual amount for IRA savings and 
her own eventual retirement.
To qualify as tax-deductible alimony, payments stipulated in the divorce or 
separation agreement cannot be designated as something other than alimony 
(such as child support, for example). In addition, the payments cannot be 
scheduled to continue after the death of the payee spouse and must be made 
in cash or its equivalent. As such, transferring appreciated securities to an ex-
spouse does not constitute alimony. However, payments made to a third party 
on behalf of the payee—such as life insurance premiums payable on the life of 
the payer—do constitute alimony.
For example, assume that a wife receives a sizable alimony award as a result 
of her divorce from her physically ailing husband. She is very concerned about 
how these alimony payments will be made if her husband predeceases her. 
Accordingly, as a part of the divorce decree, she mandates that the husband 
continue his premium payments on his life insurance policy and retain her as 
the irrevocable beneficiary. These premium payments constitute qualifying, 
deductible alimony for income tax purposes.
In this example, what happens if the husband fails to make the premium pay-
ments on his life insurance policy, leaving the wife without income protection? 
The husband may be held in contempt of court and punished with jail time. 
This complicates the wife’s situation even further, though, because if the hus-
band is in jail, it is extremely unlikely that he will resume making life insurance 
premium payments. There is a better way.
As a planning technique in the context of this example, consider having the 
wife own the life insurance policy and make the premium payments. This 
prevents changes from being made to the policy without her knowledge. In 
addition, if the wife can afford it, have her buy life insurance that can build 
cash value on the life of the husband (for example, a whole life, universal life, 
variable life, or variable/universal life policy). The cash account in this policy 

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
184
is now hers to do with as she pleases, and she may even borrow against the 
policy for her own retirement if she so chooses. If any new life insurance is 
needed as a result of her changed financial circumstances after the divorce, 
the wife should apply for the insurance before the divorce is final. Then, if the 
husband cannot qualify for the life insurance (for example, because of poor 
health), the wife may still modify the final divorce decree to make up for the 
loss of the insurance proceeds.
Note that the just-discussed ownership strategy will also work, of course, if 
the husband is the alimony recipient and the wife is in poor health. The point 
is that, if faced with these concerns in an upcoming divorce, the divorcing par-
ties may need to consider some novel thinking.
Child Support
Each state has applicable guidelines with respect to the amount of child sup-
port that may be appropriate in any divorce agreement. If you are working 
with a divorce attorney or financial planner, they will be familiar with these 
guidelines. However, as with any cash-flow issue, be sure you, as the payer, can 
afford the minimum recommended child-support payment. For most divorc-
ing individuals, the question is not whether child support should be paid, but 
rather how much should be paid. As such, be sure you are comfortable with 
the amount specified by the court—and pay it! Although it is against the law 
for an employer to fire you because you are not current with child-support 
payments, there is no prohibition against garnishing your wages to pay back-due 
amounts. If this happens, the employer may use other reasons to terminate 
your employment, notwithstanding that the real reason was your failure to 
assume the parental responsibility of supporting your children.
Child-support payments are neither deductible by the payer spouse nor tax-
able as income to the payee spouse. However, sometimes there is a question 
as to whether a payment is, indeed, child support or disguised alimony. Here 
is the standard rule you can use to tell the difference: if any portion of the 
agreed-on payment may be reduced because of circumstances related to the 
child, it is child support for income tax purposes. For example, if the pay-
ment is reduced once the child goes to college, it is treated as nondeductible 
and nontaxable child support. This differentiation is likely very important to 
high-income divorcing couples, where the higher-wage earner wants as much 
of the payment as possible treated as deductible alimony. This is in marked 
contrast to the lower-income earner, who probably is not nearly as concerned 
with the tax treatment of the payment.

Property Settlements
The overriding issue in finalizing a property settlement agreement is to be fair 
to both spouses. In community property states, where both spouses own 
half of all property acquired during the marriage, an equal division is relatively 
easy. However, a notable exception occurs when one spouse brings an already-
thriving small business to the marriage, but the business is worth considerably 
more at the time of the couple’s divorce or legal separation. The question then 
arises: how is the appreciation of the business during the couple’s marriage 
best handled? The answer varies depending on state community-property 
law, but generally, the founder-of-the-business spouse is awarded the value of  
the business at the time they brought it to the marriage in addition to half of the  
appreciation in the business thereafter. The non-founder spouse receives  
the other half of the appreciation.
Assume that you live in California and recently started a computer software 
business. It is worth $1 million when you marry your spouse. Eight years later, 
you get divorced, and at the time of your divorce, the business is worth $10 
million. It is likely that the court will award you a settlement of $5.5 million 
with respect to the business—your original $1 million for your interest in the 
business prior to your marriage and another $4.5 million for the apprecia-
tion of your business during your marriage. You now have to come up with 
another $4.5 million to buy out your spouse’s interest or sell the business 
entirely to make the required payment. (Can you see why divorce can be 
financially devastating to your accumulated wealth?)
There are currently eight community property states in the United States, 
and a ninth—Wisconsin—has a very similar form of property law known as 
marital property. The two largest community property states—California and 
Texas—are relatively well known to most Americans. The other six states 
with community property law systems are
Arizona
• 
Idaho
• 
Louisiana
• 
Nevada
• 
New Mexico
• 
Washington
• 
In addition, Alaska allows for the establishment of community property among 
married couples on an elective basis.
All the remaining states (41, after accounting for Wisconsin’s variation of the 
community property form) are referred to in property law as common law 
property or individual property states. In these states, either the husband or 

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
186
wife (even with property acquired during the marriage) can title property in 
their individual name. However, for those who think this may be an advantage 
when it comes to making an inordinate or unequal division of property at the 
time of divorce, think again. Most—if not all—common-law property states 
follow a concept in property settlements known as equitable distribution. Under 
this model, each spouse has a legal right during marriage to the other spouse’s 
earnings and to the assets acquired with those earnings. As a result, common-
law states end up in essentially the same place as community property states 
with respect to property acquired during the marriage: it is typically split in 
half between each of the spouses at the time of divorce or separation.
Often, the most contentious part of property-settlement negotiations is how 
to fairly divide one spouse’s present or future retirement benefits. If this issue 
pertains to you, you should obtain a valuation of your (or your spouse’s)  
current 401(k) or other retirement plan balance at the time of divorce. Once 
you have this valuation, make sure, if you are the payee spouse, that you obtain 
what is known as a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) from the court. 
This order awards you the same rights that the plan participant would have 
had under the 401(k) or other retirement plan, including the right to choose 
your own investments.
As a divorcing spouse, you can also receive current or future Social Security 
benefits based on your former spouse’s employment record if the following 
conditions are met:
You were married to your former spouse for at least ten years.
• 
You are not remarried.
• 
You are at least 62 years old.
• 
Your former spouse is at least 62 years old and entitled 
• 
to retirement or disability benefits.
Note that if you remarry after you have attained the age of 62, your eligibility  
for Social Security benefits based on your former spouse’s employment record 
is not precluded.
Principal Residence
Typically, the major asset that most couples own at the time of divorce is their 
house or primary residence. Because most couples are jointly obligated on 
the home mortgage, half of each mortgage payment may qualify as deduct-
ible alimony by the departing spouse. The other half of the mortgage pay-
ment is deductible by the remaining spouse under normal mortgage interest 
deduction rules; in other words, the remaining spouse should itemize their 
deductions on a separately filed income tax return. Proceed carefully, however. 
Remember, under the alimony tax rules, any payment that constitutes deductible 

Plan Your Financial Future
187
alimony may not be specified as anything other than alimony. Therefore, if you 
are the departing spouse and will be responsible for half the mortgage, add a 
sufficient amount to your required alimony payments to cover your portion 
of the monthly mortgage interest liability.
For example, assume that you and your wife are getting a divorce. You have 
agreed to pay her alimony of $3,000 per month. Your mortgage payment each 
month is $1,000, and $600 of that amount is interest. You remain obligated 
for your half of the mortgage payment. As such, add or re-characterize half—or 
$300—of the mortgage interest payment as deductible alimony, resulting in a 
total alimony payment of $3,300 per month (the $3,000 original amount plus 
the additional $300 re-characterized amount).
It gets even more complicated if you, as the departing spouse, are solely 
responsible for the mortgage payment. Although you are considered to have 
paid all the monthly interest on the mortgage, you are not necessarily entitled 
to the full itemized interest deduction. Rather, once you have moved out of 
the house, the house is no longer your primary residence (which, as you know 
from Chapter 11, can have serious tax implications if your ex-spouse sells the 
house immediately or if you did not live in it for at least two years before 
they sold it). You may be able to claim the house as a secondary residence 
and deduct the mortgage interest in that manner. The catch in this strategy, 
however, is that you must let your ex-spouse remain in the primary residence 
rent-free. Some spouses do not want to do this, particularly if it is a bitter 
divorce proceeding.
The key takeaway from this discussion is this: if you are involved in a divorce, 
do not try to represent yourself. The potential damaging consequences to 
your accumulated wealth are much too significant to forego seeking the assis-
tance of competent legal and financial counsel. 
Loss of Employment
Beyond the major psychological trauma of losing your job, particularly if you 
were terminated “for cause,” are the financial consequences that should be 
considered in the aftermath of such an event. Chief among these is how to 
immediately reduce your ongoing living expenses. If you have not done so 
already, consider refinancing your current mortgage to obtain a lower interest 
rate. Although refinancing extends the life of the mortgage obligation, your 
monthly payment is reduced. What’s more, refinancing usually frees up cash 
that can be used for any reason, including the payment of living expenses until 
you can find new employment.

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
188
Another key issue involved in managing job loss is the reevaluation of your 
and your family’s health insurance needs. As discussed in Chapter 5, remem-
ber that you can exercise your COBRA rights upon losing your job. Yes, you 
will likely have to pay your previous employer’s share of the group medical 
insurance, but this option is probably much less expensive than purchasing an 
individual health insurance policy. Alternatively, cost savings may result from 
funding a health savings account (HSA) and purchasing a high-deductible 
individual health insurance policy. In addition, current tax rules stipulate that, 
as a former employee, you may take distributions from your IRA to pay health 
insurance premiums while unemployed without being subject to a 10 percent 
early distribution penalty. However, unless you own a Roth IRA—and have 
done so for a specified period of time—you must pay ordinary income tax on 
the distribution.
Should you file for unemployment benefits once you have lost your job? There 
are several considerations to keep in mind. The first is psychological: do you 
feel embarrassed, or are you reluctant to file? Many workers, particularly those 
who have been terminated from a management position, simply cannot bear 
to file for unemployment benefits. Nevertheless, you should be aware that, in 
most cases, unemployment is available regardless of the position you left and 
your job status at your former employer. Your former employer has paid a tax 
under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) for just this reason.
The second consideration with respect to unemployment benefits is a more 
practical one: are you eligible to receive benefits? The answer depends on why 
you left your former employer. Assuming that you earned enough money to 
qualify for unemployment benefits during the previous 12-month period, you 
must, then, have left your job for one or more of the following reasons:
You were terminated (laid off) through no fault of  
• 
your own.
You voluntarily quit your job for good reason.
• 
You were involuntarily terminated, but not because of 
• 
embezzlement, violating the company’s drug policy, or 
anything else unrelated to poor job performance.
The biggest uncertainty in any of these reasons is what constitutes “good 
reason” for you to voluntarily leave your job. Unfortunately, you do not get to 
make this determination; your local unemployment agency caseworker does 
(sometimes along with your former supervisor). As a result, if you left your job 
voluntarily and file for unemployment benefits, carefully document in writing 
why you left before speaking with your caseworker, and justify that it was for 
reasons unrelated to personal preference or desires for another career.

Death of a Spouse or Life Partner
As with job loss, there are psychological and financial issues associated with 
the premature death of a spouse or life partner. Unlike with job loss, however, 
assuming that the life of the spouse or partner is adequately insured, the 
psychological aspects of overcoming the loss are probably paramount.
Normally, countless financial questions confront the survivor of the spouse or 
partner, including these:
Do I pay off or pay down the mortgage now while remaining  
• 
in the house?
Do I sell the house and move?
• 
If I am not retired, do I retire now (or as soon as finan-
• 
cially possible)?
Do I continue to work?
• 
Am I entitled to retirement or life insurance benefits?
• 
How do I distribute any retirement or life insurance  
• 
benefits to which I am entitled?
Can I afford to live in the same lifestyle to which I am 
• 
accustomed?
Should I seek the assistance of a financial advisor?
• 
None of these questions is easy to answer, particularly during the grieving 
process. Nevertheless, they need to be addressed—and sooner, rather than 
later—to avoid damaging the lifetime wealth you accumulated together.
Not only is the surviving spouse or life partner the beneficiary of all or most 
of a decedent’s estate, but they are also often the named executor or admin-
istrator of that estate. Legally, the difference between an executor and an 
administrator depends on whether the decedent dies with or without a will. 
If the decedent dies after having written a will (or dies testate), the individual 
named to handle the decedent’s financial affairs is referred to as the executor. 
If the decedent dies without a will (or dies intestate), the individual appointed 
by the court to handle the decedent’s financial affairs is said to be the 
administrator of the estate. In either case, if the spouse or partner survives, 
they are normally the named executor or appointed administrator of the estate.
This raises the question of whether the surviving spouse, as the named executor  
or administrator, should take a fee for the rendering of services. Under the 
probate code of most states, the surviving spouse is entitled to such a fee, 
but they should consider the usual circumstances of most estates. In most  
circumstances, the surviving spouse or executor is also the primary (if not sole) 

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
190
beneficiary of the deceased spouse’s property. Furthermore, under federal 
transfer tax, property that is inherited by the spouse or any other beneficiary 
is not income taxable. However, if the surviving spouse or executor collects a 
fee for administration services associated with the estate, that fee is income 
taxable. As a result, by accepting a fee, the surviving spouse converts nontaxable 
income into taxable income. The better option, clearly, is for the executor to 
receive all (or their share) of the decedent’s property at death in the form  
of an inheritance and not reduce this amount by an after-tax payment of 
executor fees.
As is discussed further in the “Distributing Wealth During Your Lifetime”  
section of the book, whether a court becomes involved in administering your 
estate depends on whether your estate goes through probate, which is a legal 
proceeding administered by the local court to verify title to a decedent’s 
assets and distribute them to your heirs at death. Generally speaking, a great 
number of individuals do not like the potential costs and delays inherent in the 
probate process and search for ways to plan around the process. There are 
three primary means of doing this, and we will examine each in turn:
Title all your assets jointly (in joint tenancy with right of 
• 
survivorship) with someone else, such as your spouse or 
life partner.
Use beneficiary designations on as many assets as permit-
• 
ted by law.
Establish a revocable living trust and transfer as many 
• 
assets as you can into it during your lifetime.
Titling Assets Jointly
Titling all your assets in joint tenancy with right of survivorship ( JTWROS) 
with someone else is sometimes referred to as “the poor man’s way of avoid-
ing probate,” because it does not involve the drafting of a trust or acquiring 
any other assets where a beneficiary designation is possible, such as a life 
insurance policy. Typically, only spouses title assets jointly, although such titling 
is heavily used by same-sex domestic partners in states where the marital 
relationship is not legally recognized.
Joint tenancy titling may be both a blessing and a curse, because it provides 
an easy way to dispose of property at death while avoiding probate, but it 
can be relatively inflexible from a transfer-tax standpoint. Specifically, if a 
surviving spouse already has significant property of their own, leaving even 
more property to them by operation of law only adds to an existing taxable 
estate. Fortunately, under current tax law, it is possible for a surviving spouse  
(or other surviving joint tenant) to refuse, or disclaim, the receipt of this 

Plan Your Financial Future
191
additional property. However, the survivor must do so within nine months 
of the decedent’s death and in a certain manner, referred to as a qualified  
disclaimer. Otherwise, the survivor is considered to have made a subsequent 
gift to whoever receives the property in their stead.
For example, assume that you are a joint tenant at your death with your 
already-wealthy spouse. To avoid potential additional estate taxes at their 
death, your spouse should refuse the property within nine months of your 
death by making a qualified disclaimer. They must do this before accepting 
any benefits from the disclaimed property and without separately directing 
to whom the property should now pass. If you have children, they normally 
receive any disclaimed property under state law. If you do not have children, 
your closest blood relative (or relatives) receive the property.
Using Beneficiary Designations
Beneficiary designations are typically contractual agreements used to leave 
property to others upon the death of the owner. Common examples of assets 
where beneficiary designations are used are life insurance policies, employer-
sponsored retirement plans (such as 401(k) plans), and IRAs. It is also possible 
to use a beneficiary designation to avoid probate on brokerage or advisory 
accounts.
Given that you should access taxable brokerage or advisory accounts before 
accessing any tax-deferred accounts during your lifetime, you may have few or 
no assets to pass in this manner. Nevertheless, you can avoid the probate pro-
cess on these types of accounts by asking your broker or financial advisor for 
a transfer-on-death (TOD) form. Fill out that form for each of your brokerage 
or advisory accounts, and ask that it be sent back to the broker-dealer with 
whom you established the account. If you are investing online, ask whatever 
company or mutual fund family you are investing with to send you the com-
parable form. By proceeding in this manner, you should be able to avoid the 
probate process on those particular assets in the state of residence where 
your estate is potentially subject to court administration. Note that the same 
result may be accomplished with individual bank accounts, but the form used 
is referred to as a payable-on-death (POD) form.
Establishing and Funding a Revocable Living Trust
As discussed, revocable living trusts are frequently promoted for several rea-
sons, but the most prevalent of these is their ability to avoid probate. Be 
careful, though: many grantors or creators of revocable living trusts believe 
all that is necessary to avoid probate is to purchase the trust document from 
the promoter. This is not correct! Rather, to avoid probate, your assets must be 

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
192
transferred into the name of the trust before your death and while you are 
still legally competent to know the ramifications of that action. If the assets (or 
any assets you may have acquired after establishing the trust) are not in the 
name of the trustee of the trust at your death, they do not avoid probate.
If you are electing to establish a revocable living trust and pass on all your 
assets via the trust outside of probate, you must fund the trust during your 
lifetime. Alternatively, if you are not concerned about the delay or cost of 
probate, you can use the trust only to distribute your assets in a transfer-tax-
efficient manner subsequent to your death. As a third option, you may elect 
to pass on all your property using joint-tenancy titling or beneficiary desig-
nations and use the trust only as a standby document in the event that you 
become mentally incompetent during your lifetime.
For example, assume that you and your spouse own most of your property 
jointly, including your house, checking and savings accounts, and investment 
accounts. In addition, let’s say your retirement plans and life insurance poli-
cies name your spouse as the primary beneficiary, and you are not concerned 
about having your estate or that of your spouse subject to transfer tax at 
death. Under such circumstances, you may wish to establish a revocable living 
trust to be used to manage your assets only in the event of your own mental 
incapacity. If this event occurs, you can name your spouse as the successor 
trustee or, if they are not able to serve in such a capacity, someone else (such 
as, perhaps, your favorite brother). Because you will be legally incompetent at 
the onset of your mental incapacity, you must also give your spouse a dura-
ble power of attorney to transfer property to the trust and avoid probate. 
(Durable powers of attorney are discussed later in this chapter.)
Now let’s proceed to a very common issue confronting many members of 
the baby boom generation: how to pay for the long-term care expenses of a 
dependent parent.
Dependent Parents
Certainly there are more issues involved in caring for dependent parents than 
in paying for their long-term care expenses. (As a reminder, long-term care is 
defined in this context as daily care provided in a nursing home for a chronic 
medical condition.) Nevertheless, the payment of the ongoing expenses of a 
parent who cannot live alone independently or whom you, as a concerned 
child, cannot care for properly is a significant threat to your accumulated 
wealth. This is not to mention the additional emotional burden that taking 
care of a formerly able-bodied and responsible parent entails.
As you know from the discussion of Medicare and Medicaid in Chapter 5, 
Medicare provides only a limited benefit for skilled nursing facility care; and 
although Medicaid does cover long-term care, qualifying is extremely difficult. 

Plan Your Financial Future
193
Remember also that some states have filial statutes that may require you to 
take care of your parents’ long-term care expenses. In the absence of such a 
statute in your state, you are faced with the following options:
1.	 The best option is that your parent or parents are finan-
cially educated enough to recognize the need for long-
term care insurance and have previously purchased a 
long-term care policy. Unfortunately, many seniors do not 
recognize this need before they can no longer qualify for 
the coverage or the protection is so prohibitively expen-
sive that they cannot afford it.
2.	 The next best option, if your parents are likely to need 
long-term care but are unable to pay for the cost of the 
insurance themselves, is for you to buy the policy for 
them. The risk of this approach is that your parents may 
never need long-term care, and the expended premium 
dollars are lost forever.
3.	 A close alternative to the second option is that you set 
aside money to pay for your parents’ long-term care 
needs. This option gives you more flexibility, because you 
do not lose the money if your parents do not need long-
term care, but it means an added monthly or other peri-
odic expense for which you have to budget.
4.	 The least-best option is that you do nothing and then 
the need arises for long-term care for your parents. In 
this instance, you are likely to see the wealth your par-
ents accumulated (and your potential inheritance) slowly 
depleted over the years, at the end of which Medicaid is 
the only option.
As noted, the preferable option is that your parent does not place the burden 
of funding their long-term care on you. If they do, though, you should purchase 
a long-term-care insurance policy for your parent while they can still qualify 
for the coverage. You also need to consider how long an insurance benefit 
period you should purchase. Remember, the longer the benefit period, the 
greater the premium costs associated with the policy.
You may wish to purchase a lifetime benefit period for your parent to be 
absolutely sure that proper long-term care will be there for them when they 
need it. You may also wish to purchase a higher-than-normal daily benefit as 
part of the policy (currently, the average cost of nursing home care for a semi-
private room is approximately $225 per day). If you do purchase a high daily 
benefit (beyond the average $225 per day), it is possible that you can make 
money from the policy. This is because you can pocket the higher daily benefit 
paid under the policy in excess of the actual daily cost charged by the facility. 

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
194
However, before you purchase such a high benefit, check with the insurance 
company or issuer of the policy, because such a motivation may be frowned 
on in your particular state.
You also need to consider what Medicare will and will not cover once your 
parent reaches age 65. For example, although Part D of Medicare has been 
fully phased in as of 2006 and now covers the cost of most prescription drugs 
for your elderly parent, a privately owned policy may provide better coverage. 
In addition, there are many deductibles and co-insurance payments associated 
with Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (physician’s 
care) that you need to provide for.
The preferable way to cover these costs is to purchase a supplementary 
health insurance policy, commonly referred to as a Medigap policy. All Medigap 
policies are standardized according to federal law, with Medigap Policy A con-
stituting the least expensive and least comprehensive form of coverage and 
Medigap Policy F constituting the most expensive and most comprehensive 
coverage. As such, the purchase of a Medigap policy means you or your parent 
are protected by federal regulations with respect to supplementary medical 
care, a fact that may be of some comfort to you. It is also important to note 
that you may purchase only one Medigap policy for your parent at any given 
time under current law. In addition, your parent may not be turned down for 
supplemental coverage, regardless of any preexisting, potentially disqualifying 
medical conditions, as long as they apply for such coverage within 6 months 
of reaching age 65.
Claiming Your Parent as a Dependent for Income  
Tax Purposes
To claim your parent as a dependent for income tax purposes, all the following 
tests must be met:
You must pay for more than half of the financial expenses 
• 
of your parent for the tax (calendar) year.
Your parent must not have gross income of more than 
• 
the annual personal dependency exemption provided for 
under law ($3,900 in 2013).
Your parent, if married, cannot file a joint income tax 
• 
return with their spouse unless the only reason they file 
the return is to obtain a tax refund.
Your parent must not have claimed a personal exemption 
• 
individually.
Your parent must be a US citizen or resident.
• 

Plan Your Financial Future
195
Assuming all these tests are met, you may claim an income tax credit for  
taking care of your dependent parent of up to $600 annually ($1,200 annually for 
two dependent parents). The applicable credit equals 35 percent of expenses 
up to a maximum of $3,000 if your AGI is $15,000 or less and is reduced  
1 percent for each $2,000 of AGI you earn up to $28,000. The credit is then 
limited to 20 percent of expenses if your AGI is more than $43,000. Thus an 
individual with an AGI over $43,000 may take a credit of $600 ($3,000 times 
0.20) for one qualifying parent and $1,200 ($600 times 2) for two qualifying 
parents.
As a planning technique, if your parent has a small amount of investments that 
are currently generating income in excess of the annual personal dependency 
exemption, have your parent first use up these investment assets to pay for 
their support for a short period of time. Depleting those investments should 
subsequently lower your parent’s income in the future so that when you pay 
for their expenses, including any necessary long-term care expenses, you can 
receive a tax benefit by claiming the dependent care credit.
For example, assume that your mother, age 60, has investments in bank cer-
tificates of deposit of $80,000 in 2013 that are paying her a 5 percent annual 
interest rate. This is the only income your mother has, because she is not 
yet eligible to receive Social Security benefits. Because the income of $4,000 
($80,000 times 0.05) is more than the personal dependency exemption  
permitted for the year ($3,900), consider having your mother cash in the CDs 
and use the proceeds for her living expenses for the remainder of the year. 
Then, in 2014, you will be able to claim the dependent care credit on your 
2013 income tax return, assuming that the other qualifying dependency tests 
are met for that year.
A Developmentally Disabled Child
A developmentally disabled child presents special challenges in wealth accu-
mulation and management. Specifically, what is the optimal way to pay for the 
tremendous expenses associated with raising a developmentally disabled child 
to independence?
The numerous planning techniques that may be used cannot be fully explained 
here, but certainly a prevalent strategy is to establish a special needs trust 
for the benefit of the child. To properly establish and maintain such a trust, the 
child must first meet the Social Security definition of disability, even though, 
typically, public assistance benefits are paid at the state or local level rather 
than from the federal government.
The purpose of the special needs trust is to allow the child to maintain  
eligibility for certain public assistance benefits, such as Supplemental Security 
Income (SSI) or Medicaid, while at the same time providing for needed  

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
196
services that are not available from the government. The trust document 
must state that the trust income and principal are to be used only to provide 
for extra services required to care for, maintain, and educate the child beyond 
those government-provided benefits. If the document does not state this or 
include similar language, the state may attach the assets transferred to the 
trust to pay for its cost of providing required care.
At a minimum, if you are the parent of a developmentally disabled child, you 
should consider the implementation of a special needs trust. Beyond that, you 
also need to consider who will care for the child in the event of your or your 
spouse’s death or incompetency. Under law, parents are the natural guardians 
of their child only until the child reaches age 18 or the otherwise-specified 
state age of legal majority. Hence, if your disabled child needs care after the age 
of 18, you may wish to seek court appointment as your child’s legal guardian. 
Further, in the event of your death or incompetency, you may wish to have 
your spouse succeed you in this capacity. In your will, you should provide for 
the naming of a guardian, likely first your spouse and, in the event of a joint 
death, a willing and competent family member or members. If you fail to do 
so, the court will normally appoint a guardian for your child, but you will have 
no say with respect to whom this person is or where your child will live sub-
sequent to your death.
The need for the implementation of a contingent family trust is important in 
all cases where a minor child may be left without their natural parents, but 
it is even more important where one or more children are developmentally 
disabled. The guardian named for your child and the trustee of the contingent 
family trust will probably be the same individual, but you should give careful 
consideration to the different skill sets required for each duty. A guardian 
needs to possess considerable empathy and compassion for your disabled 
child’s ongoing needs, whereas a trustee needs some financial acumen. Just 
because a family member has one set of these skills does not mean they have 
the other. Moreover, although your first thought may be that your parent  
(the child’s grandparent) is the perfect choice, do you think it is fair to ask 
your parent to take on a second family, particularly one involving a disabled 
child, late in their life? Only you can gauge the correct way to deal with this 
situation, but do not overlook considering it.
Your Own Physical or Mental Incapacity
The terms disability and incapacity are frequently used interchangeably, but 
there is a difference between the two. Disability refers to a contractual status, 
whereas incapacity is a legal status. As such, you are typically disabled if a con-
tractual definition, such as that included in a disability income insurance policy, 
says you are. However, you are incapacitated or incompetent to act only if the 

Plan Your Financial Future
197
law says you are. An example of a legally incapacitated person is a minor or 
child who has not yet reached the age of legal majority. Such an individual can-
not take legal title to property and can only execute what is known as a void-
able contract, meaning that once they turn 18 (or reach the state’s legal age of 
majority), the child can revoke the terms of any contract that was previously 
signed. For this reason, financial and other institutions often require a parent’s 
co-signature on any contract entered into with a minor.
An individual who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease would also be considered 
legally incapacitated. Such an individual may be physically fine, at least for some 
period of time after the initial diagnosis is made, but mentally they may not 
have the legal capacity to act. As such, someone must act on their behalf. 
Typically, this surrogate is a close family member (usually the spouse) who 
was granted power of attorney by the Alzheimer’s patient while they were still 
competent. This leads to a very important point in planning for your own or 
your parent’s possible legal incapacity: the power of attorney must be executed 
while the author (or principal) is still legally competent. How do you determine 
legal competence? Usually, it is done by asking the author’s primary physician 
to render an oral or written opinion that the author is legally competent at the 
time of granting the power. Absent a positive affirmation from a physician, or if 
a power of attorney is never completed, the family must ask the local court to 
appoint someone as the legal guardian of their incapacitated loved one.
Is one type of power of attorney preferable to another? Yes. Under the prop-
erty laws of every state, the principal’s authority to grant someone else the 
right to act on their behalf terminates at the date the principal becomes legally 
incapacitated (for example, they become so severely demented that they do 
not readily understand the consequences of their actions). What’s more, 
when the principal most needs their power of attorney (or agent) to act, the 
individual with power of attorney is legally prohibited from doing so. To avoid 
these consequences, you should always seek to execute a durable power-of-
attorney form, which specifically includes in its language that the power of the 
agent to act continues even after the principal is declared legally incompetent. 
Again, if this language is not included in the power of attorney form, family 
members will be forced to request court intervention.
If you execute a durable power-of-attorney form for yourself or your parent,   
you have a choice with respect to the date that you request your agent to 
act on your behalf. You can grant the agent the right to act immediately   
(a non-springing durable power of attorney) or postpone this right until you, 
the principal, are declared legally incompetent (a springing durable power of 
attorney). Although many authors or principals are concerned about giving 
someone else the ability to act immediately with respect to their financial 
affairs, as a practical matter, the agent named is almost always a close family 
member. Typically, if you are married at the time of executing the power, your 
spouse is named as the agent. Many authors therefore draft a non-springing 

Chapter 14 | Life Events that Endanger Wealth 
198
durable power and continue conducting their own affairs as if the power 
was never granted. This avoids the inherent problem presented in the  
drafting of any springing durable power where someone (usually, the concurring  
opinion of two physicians) must determine when you have become legally 
incompetent.
You may want to execute a durable power of attorney to plan for your own 
possible legal incapacity, but there is often a practical problem with third-party 
acceptance of the document. This is particularly the case with financial institu-
tions that either want you to execute their own durable power-of-attorney 
form or refuse to recognize an outdated form. To avoid this issue, you should 
adopt the following two measures:
Have an attorney draft the broadest possible durable 
• 
power-of-attorney form in the hopes that all conceivable 
actions that the financial institution may require of your 
agent are covered by the power.
Periodically (every three years or so) re-execute the 
• 
durable power-of-attorney signature page; this ensures 
that the form is executed while you are still legally com-
petent to grant the power.
Most states provide for the execution of two durable power-of-attorney forms: 
a general durable power-of-attorney form for property or financial management 
and a medical or health care durable power-of-attorney form. This second 
form is intended for you to grant authority to an agent (again, usually a close 
family member) to give informed consent to any needed medical procedure 
on your behalf if you are unable to do so. Some states allow the inclusion of 
living-will provisions in the medical durable power-of-attorney form, whereas 
others require two separate documents. However, of the two documents  
(living will and medical durable power-of-attorney), the medical durable power 
is likely the more important, because it is much broader and covers additional 
health-care situations in which terminal illness is not the diagnosis. A sample 
general durable power-of-attorney form is included in Appendix C to this 
book. You may wish to adopt it or discuss adopting it with your attorney.
We now move on to planning for the distribution of wealth to others, including 
yourself via the retirement planning process. The next chapter considers 
wealth distribution via a similarly important financial goal for many parents: 
planning for your child’s higher or post-secondary education.

Distributing 
Wealth During 
Your Lifetime

P A R T  

Planning for 
Your Child’s 
Higher 
Education
We now move to the last step in the PADD process of wealth accumulation 
and management: distributing your wealth. Toward that end, this section of the 
book focuses on the distribution of wealth during your lifetime and consid-
ers the common financial goals of saving and planning for your child’s higher 
education and your own retirement. It also discusses how to save and plan for 
other lifetime financial goals you may have, such as starting your own business. 
Then, the last section of the book takes up the process of distributing your 
wealth at death.
If you are married and have children, one of your first goals when evaluating 
how to distribute wealth during your lifetime is probably to afford your fam-
ily members the best opportunity to pursue a profitable career—and that 
requires, at a minimum these days, a college degree. There are many colleges 
and universities, public and private, that they may attend, and the costs of 
attendance will vary dramatically based on their eventual choice. The com-
mon thread to whatever choice they make is that college is expensive—and 
getting more expensive by the year. According to the College Board, over 
the ten-year period ending 2012–2013, tuition at public four-year institutions 
15
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
202
increased by an average of 5.2 percent per year nationally (tuition increases 
at private four-year institutions averaged 4.9 percent per year nationally over 
the same period). This compared to an average annual inflation rate of only 
2.5 percent over the same period. For the 2012–2013 school year, the total 
annual cost of attending a four-year public college or university for an in-state 
student was approximately $18,000 ($31,000 for an out-of-state student) and 
close to $40,000 at a private institution. It is closer to $50,000 annually at an 
Ivy League institution.
Fortunately, the availability of financial aid increased during this same ten-year 
period, although most of this aid is based on financial need, with the amount 
necessary to qualify decided by the school and other factors beyond the control 
of the average middle-class parent. The key thing to keep in mind, then, is that it 
is very important to plan for your child’s higher education as early as possible.
How Much Will I Need?
As with any financial planning goal that may be quantified, the first question 
to answer with respect to planning for your child’s higher education is how 
much money you will need. The answer to that question depends on several 
factors, including how many children you have and whether you wish for them 
to attend public or private colleges or universities. In 2013, private-college Ivy 
League institutions (elite institutions), such as Harvard and Yale, are among 
the most expensive to attend, with tuition, fees, and room and board costs 
averaging at least $50,000 per year. Meanwhile, private liberal arts schools 
throughout the country are not far behind in cost. Finally, the cost of atten-
dance at public schools varies greatly, but for planning purposes, using half of 
the current cost of attending an elite private school—or $25,000 annually—is 
not unreasonable.
The first step in computing the cost of your child’s education is to inflate, or 
calculate in today’s dollars, what the current cost of attendance—say, $25,000 
annually—will be when your child is ready to attend college. To do this, you 
need to assume an annual increase in costs of a certain amount—say, 7 per-
cent annually (this is higher than the current ten-year average increase, but 
not unrealistic when considering the financial pressure that the 2007–2009 
recession placed on many state budgets). You can input these numbers into a 
web-based calculator (at http://money.aol.com, for example), or you can 
enter them on a financial function calculator. Here is an example using the 
Hewlett-Packard 10BII financial function calculator:
1.	 Enter $25,000 as the present value (PV). Note: With this 
calculator, you need to enter this amount as a negative 
number so the calculator can distinguish between the PV 
amount you are entering and the future value amount 
(FV) for which you are solving.

Plan Your Financial Future
203
2.	 Enter 7 as the projected annual percentage increase (I/YR).
3.	 Enter the number of years (N) until your child enters col-
lege; for instance, if your child is 10 years of age, enter 8, 
because age 18 is the typical age for beginning college.
4.	 Solve for the FV of the cost of one year of attendance: in 
this case, the cost would be $49,178 per year.
Once you have completed this calculation, you need to determine the present 
value of the total sum that will be required to fund your child’s college educa-
tion for their estimated four years of attendance. The steps are as follows:
1.	 Shift your calculator into BEGIN mode (you will need the 
money at the beginning of the period when your child 
enters college at age 18).
2.	 Enter $49,178 as a payment (PMT). Note: You may need 
to enter this amount as a negative number because it is 
a cash outflow to you, depending on what calculator you 
are using.
3.	 Enter 4 as the number of years (N) of college 
attendance.
4.	 Enter an inflation-adjusted annual rate of return (I/YR) on 
the monies set aside to fund the education; for example,  
if you believe you can make a 10 percent annual before-tax 
rate of return on your investments, the number you will 
enter is 2.8037 (1.10 divided by 1.07 less 1 times 100).
5.	 Solve for the PV or lump-sum amount needed to pay for 
the cost of a four-year college education in today’s dollars. 
Using the assumed numbers, the amount is $188,810.
The third and final step (after you’ve picked yourself up off the floor!) is to 
determine the amount of annual savings required to accumulate a lump sum of 
$188,810. The steps are as follows, assuming that you intend to save monthly 
in order to accumulate this sum:
1.	 Enter $188,810 as a FV amount, because you are solving 
for the amount of monthly payment needed today, while 
the child is 10 years old.
2.	 Multiply 8 years by 12 months (96) for the payments you 
need to make over the period you are saving. Enter this 
as N.

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
204
3.	 Divide the 10 percent annual assumed before-tax rate of 
return by 12 to convert to a monthly rate, and enter this 
as I/YR (here, 0.8333).
4.	 Solve for the monthly payment or savings amount needed: 
$1,280.96 per month ($1,291.64 if you do not save this 
amount until the end of each month). This translates into 
a one-time lump-sum deposit of $85,122.20.
A word of caution as you consider the challenge before you: many people do 
not have the financial resources to accumulate this amount of money quickly. 
The important point is not to focus on the end of the process, but rather 
the beginning. In other words, begin to save some amount, even if it is not the 
amount that you should be saving. Probably the worst planning alternative is 
to do nothing, because you will quickly find other ways to spend the required 
savings. As part of the “pay yourself first” savings strategy, at least do what you 
can to provide for your child’s college education.
The next concern relates to whose name you should use to save for this edu-
cation: your child’s or your own?
In Whose Name Do I Save?
Before you begin to save for higher education, you need to consider whether 
your child is likely to qualify for federal financial aid. As you ponder this issue, 
ask yourself the following questions:
What do you expect your income to be at the time that 
• 
the child enters college—or, more precisely, when you 
complete the Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) 
form in the second semester of your child’s junior year of 
high school? Most federal financial aid is need-based; and 
if the child’s parent makes too much money, the child is 
unlikely to qualify for the aid.
Do you believe it is your responsibility or financial obliga-
• 
tion to provide the child with a college education? Do 
you expect the child to assist financially or cover the 
complete cost of attendance?
Do you anticipate that your child will receive an academic or 
• 
athletic scholarship to cover the cost of college attendance? 
Be realistic: although we all believe our children are uniquely 
talented, more realistically, this is probably not the case.
Do you have relatives or family members such as grand-
• 
parents who have offered—or expect to offer—financial 
assistance when the child goes to college?

Plan Your Financial Future
205
Fundamentally, you may be somewhat ambivalent about whether your child 
attends college or pursues higher education, but remember this: studies have 
shown that over the course of a lifetime, a college graduate will earn in excess 
of a million dollars more than an individual who only receive a high school 
diploma.
Let’s return to the question of in whose name you should save for college, 
which is a critical concern if you anticipate that your child will need financial 
assistance to cover the cost of college attendance. As you complete the man-
datory FAFSA form, you are asked to list your assets and income as well as 
those of the child. This is necessary so the federal government can determine 
an amount of expected family contribution (EFC) toward the cost of 
college attendance. If your child needs financial aid, you want to achieve an 
EFC determination that is as low as possible. Accordingly, you should know the 
formula the federal government uses to compute the amount that the family 
is expected to contribute.
The most critical component of this formula is the fair market value of the 
assets held in the name of the child versus those that are held in the name 
of the parent. In other words, what percentage of these assets is expected 
to be contributed to the cost of a college education and should therefore be 
counted against the family in the formula? The answer is 35 percent for the 
child and less than 6 percent (5.64 percent, to be exact) for the parent. Just 
from this entry into the formula alone, it is generally much more advanta-
geous to save for college in the name of the parent rather than in the name 
of the child. If you decide to save for your child’s college education in your 
own name, you should probably embark on a Section 529 private savings 
plan. Meanwhile, if you have decided to save for your child’s college education 
under their name, you should open a custodial account, such as a Uniform 
Gifts to Minors or Uniform Transfers to Minors account.
Other savings strategies may also reap dividends when you are saving for col-
lege. They are as follows:
Spend down the student’s assets first. This may easily 
• 
be understood when recognizing the disparity in count-
able children’s assets (35 percent) versus parental assets 
(approximately 6 percent).
Maximize contributions to your retirement fund. 
• 
Whereas annual contributions to your 401(k) (or other) 
retirement plan are included in the computation of 
countable parental income, the vested account balance in 
a retirement plan is not counted among available parental 
assets that may be used to help pay for college costs.

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
206
If you are going to borrow to help fund the cost of your 
• 
child’s college attendance, do so through a home equity 
loan or line of credit. As discussed in Chapter 12, this 
type of borrowing also gives you a tax deduction for the 
interest you pay on the loan.
Pay off as much as possible of your credit card and other 
• 
unsecured debt before filing the FAFSA. This will reduce 
the amount of cash or other assets that you must list and 
that are counted against you when applying for federal 
financial aid on behalf of your child.
Try to pay down your original mortgage as much as pos-
• 
sible before applying. This yields two benefits: it can free 
up cash flow that you may need to fund your child’s col-
lege education, and the amount of equity in your home is 
not included among parental assets when computing the 
expected family contribution.
To determine the amount of assistance required, most publicly funded col-
lege financial aid offices use a formula determined by the federal government 
known as the federal methodology. This formula does not consider the value of 
a family’s home in arriving at the EFC. Meanwhile, some private colleges and 
universities use a formula known as the institutional methodology when comput-
ing the EFC. In this formula, the amount of equity in your home is added back 
(and is thus counted against you). You know that a school is using the institu-
tional methodology if it asks you to file the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE along 
with the more exhaustive FAFSA form. Unlike the information requested on 
the FAFSA, the PROFILE form requires the parent’s expected income during 
the child’s college years and not just your current or past year’s income.
As a parent, be aware of a bait-and-switch tactic used by some colleges or uni-
versities in enticing your child to attend their institution. Although this prac-
tice is not as prevalent as it once was, some schools may offer an extremely 
lucrative financial aid package to a student whom they want to attend the 
institution, only to reduce the amount of financial aid given to that student 
after their first year of attendance. If the student is not comfortable at the 
school, they are then forced to consider transferring to another school (often 
with the disadvantage of not being able to transfer credit hours) or continuing 
studies at the same school and trying to resolve acclimation problems. As a 
result, once your child has obtained a financial aid package from a school, be 
sure to ask the financial aid officer how long the current aid package will be 
offered or, absent that, whether your child can easily transfer credit hours to 
another school if they become uncomfortable at the institution.

207
Types of Financial Aid
The two most common federal need-based loans are the Perkins and Stafford 
loans. Unlike grants or scholarships that do not need to be repaid, both Perkins 
and Stafford loans require repayment by the student after graduation.
The federal Perkins loan is a campus-based loan, meaning the school disburses 
the loan proceeds to the student through its financial aid office. The loan 
may be taken out by both undergraduate and graduate students, although the 
annual limit is slightly higher for graduate students than it is for undergradu-
ates. Financial need must be demonstrated to qualify for a Perkins loan, but 
repayment is not required to begin until nine months after the student gradu-
ates from graduate or undergraduate school. Interest on the loan does not 
accrue on the loan principal until repayment is required.
The federal Stafford loan (also known as a direct loan) may be subsidized 
or unsubsidized. A subsidized Stafford loan means the US Department of 
Education pays the interest on the loan while the student is in undergraduate 
or graduate school, as well as during grace and deferment periods. An unsub-
sidized Stafford loan, on the other hand, means the student is responsible for 
the repayment of interest during the life of the loan and should repay the loan 
interest while they are still in school. If the student does not repay the interest 
as it is due, it is simply added to the principal of the loan for repayment at a 
later date. For both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, financial need 
by the student must be demonstrated.
A third type of federal loan is made available to the parent of a student in the par-
ent’s name: the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). This is the only 
type of loan available on behalf of a student for whom financial need is not deter-
mined under the FAFSA formula. As a parent who makes too much money or 
has a significant net worth such that the child cannot qualify for federal financial 
aid, a PLUS loan is the only recourse offered by the federal government to assist 
with the child’s college education. Good financial planning dictates that you have 
already planned for the cost of your child’s college attendance; but if you have 
not, the PLUS loan will be offered to you. Interest begins to accrue immediately 
on the loan, and repayment begins 60 days after you receive the money.
There are also need-based government grants, which do not need to be repaid, 
that may help you pay for your child’s college education. The most prevalent 
grant is the federal Pell Grant, for which the student is eligible if the family’s 
EFC does not exceed a specified amount as determined annually. Scholarship 
awards do not affect student eligibility for the Pell Grant, although there is a 
limit on the amount of grant money that any student may receive annually (the 
maximum is $5,550 for school year 2013–2014). The student must be eligible 
for the Pell Grant on the basis of need before they can also qualify to receive 
federal Perkins or Stafford loans. Furthermore, the Pell Grant is available to 
undergraduate students only.

How Do I Save?
Custodial Accounts
Prior to the advent of Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) and Section 
529 private savings plans, custodial accounts were the primary method of saving 
for a child’s college education. There are still advantages to using this method 
to save, although they are likely outweighed by the fundamental disadvantage 
that the opener of the account (usually the parent or grandparent) loses con-
trol of the money once the child attains the state’s legal age of majority.
Two types of custodial accounts have been established by all states: the 
Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and the Uniform Transfers to Minors 
Act (UTMA). In most states, UTMA accounts are the norm, because that 
legislation superseded the earlier UGMA law. Operationally, however, the two 
types of accounts are the same, except that the UTMA allows for a broader 
range of investments to be made on behalf of the child, including a direct or 
indirect investment in real estate. Ownership of both accounts is vested in the 
child, with the custodian (usually the child’s parent or grandparent) managing 
the account investments on behalf of the child.
As discussed in Chapter 13, anyone can give a child up to $14,000 ($28,000 
for married couples who use the gift-splitting planning technique) each year 
free of federal gift tax. As a result, this amount is usually how much is initially 
transferred to custodial accounts on an annual basis. Appreciated securities 
or expected-to-appreciate securities are a common funding mechanism for 
custodial accounts; but as the child approaches college age, the custodian 
should gravitate toward more conservative and less volatile investments, such 
as bonds or CDs, to preserve the principal of the account. Keep in mind, 
however, that disadvantageous taxable implications are associated with too 
much annual unearned income (such as dividends or interest) generated from 
the account on behalf of a child under the age of 18 (or under age 24 if a 
full time-student). Specifically, a separate tax is imposed on such unearned 
income. Colloquially referred to as “the Kiddie Tax,” this tax was introduced 
by Congress to deal with the perceived income tax abuse of using your child 
as a tax shelter by shifting income to them, presumably to be taxed at a lower 
marginal income tax rate.
Custodial accounts offer two advantages as compared to ESAs or Section   
529 plans:
The funds held in the UTMA or UGMA account may be 
• 
used for anything that benefits the child, not just educa-
tion. But if the funds are used to pay for expenses that 
otherwise constitute an obligation of support of the par-
ent, depending on state law, all or part of the earnings on 
the account may be taxed back to the parent.

Plan Your Financial Future
209
There is a nominal income tax benefit to the parent if sav-
• 
ing in a custodial account. Specifically, for children under 
the age of 18 benefiting from the account, the first $1,000 
of income (in 2013) or other specified annual amount is 
permitted as a standard deduction. The next $1,000 or 
similar specified amount is then taxed at the child’s mar-
ginal tax rate—typically, the lowest tax rate of 10 percent. 
As such, income splitting between the parent and child is 
possible, but only to a limited extent.
As mentioned, as attractive as these two advantages of custodial accounts may 
be, they are likely outweighed by the accounts’ disadvantages. One has already 
been noted: at the legal age of majority, the child can do with the money in the 
account as they wish, including not go to college if the child chooses to pursue 
another career. In addition, several other disadvantages are associated with 
establishing custodial accounts on behalf of your children:
The unearned income tax on minors applies once a speci-
• 
fied annual amount of interest or dividends on the account 
is generated. Accordingly, once this amount is reached 
(for example, $2,000 in 2013), any further income is taxed 
to the child at the parent’s top marginal income tax rate. 
This is the taxable result even if the child’s grandparent 
or other relative actually funds the account.
For example, assume that your parent (your child’s 
• 
grandparent) has transferred $50,000 over the years to a 
UTMA established on behalf of your child. You are in the 
25 percent marginal income tax bracket in 2013. Further 
assume that this $50,000 generates a 5 percent return 
in the account ($2,500 of unearned income to the child). 
Thus, the child incurs a tax of $125 on this income, or 
25 percent of the amount in excess of $2,000. Note that 
you received a nominal income tax benefit in avoiding 
tax on the first $1,000 of income from the account, with 
the child subsequently paying only $100 tax on the next 
$1,000 of income, for a total tax due of $225.
As compared to a Section 529 private savings plan, where 
• 
a one-time contribution of up to $70,000 may be made 
in 2013 (or $140,000 for married couples who split the 
gift), the amount that may be contributed annually to the 
custodial account free of any federal gift tax is extremely 
limited. For example, currently no more than $14,000 
may be contributed to a custodial account in any one 
year on behalf of any one child without having to report 
the gift as taxable for federal gift tax purposes.

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
210
As a general rule, custodial assets are treated as assets 
• 
of the child when determining qualification for federal 
financial aid. As a result, these assets are usually counted 
against the child in the amount of 35 percent when com-
puting the EFC.
There is one major exception to the federal financial aid disadvantage incurred 
in saving for college using custodial accounts. Given the recent introduction of 
the much more favorable Section 529 private savings plans, many parents are 
transferring (or should be transferring) UGMA or UTMA monies into Section 
529 plans. The resulting account is known in the financial world as an UGMA/
Section 529 plan or UTMA/Section 529 plan, depending on which type of custo-
dial account is possible under state law. Although current financial aid law states 
that either an initially established Section 529 plan or a converted UGMA/
Section 529 or UTMA/Section 529 plan is treated as an asset of the parent if the 
student is dependent, the parent is not permitted to change the beneficiary of 
a converted custodial account (as would be possible with the initially established 
Section 529 plan).
Education Savings Accounts
Named after Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, who sponsored the initial 
legislation that championed this education savings alternative, a Coverdell ESA 
is an investment account opened with a bank or other financial institution 
and funded with cash. Contributions to an ESA are not income-tax deduct-
ible, but the earnings generated from the contributions grow tax-free in the 
account. This is the case only so long as distributions made from the account 
are used to pay a child’s educational expenses. If they are not, the earnings are 
taxed to the account owner—usually the parent—along with a 10 percent 
penalty. Contributions to the ESA are permanently limited to no more than 
$2,000 annually for the benefit of a child under the age of 18. The ability to 
make account contributions was phased out in 2013 for single taxpayers with 
an adjusted gross income (AGI) of between $95,000 and $110,000 and for 
­married taxpayers filing jointly with an AGI between $190,000 and $220,000. 
This phaseout does not adjust annually for inflation, unlike other similar tax pro-
visions. Thus, Congress elected to “schedule” the limit and deny the ability of 
higher-income individuals to take advantage of the ESA planning opportunity.
The major advantage of funding an ESA, which is the successor to the well-
known (although not well understood) Education IRA, is that distributions or 
withdrawals from the account may be used not only in payment of college 
education expenses, but also to cover costs associated with attending public 
or private elementary or secondary schools. If you anticipate sending your 
child to a college-preparatory elementary or high school, you may wish to 
seriously consider saving via an ESA. Preparatory school costs may include 

Plan Your Financial Future
211
the expense of school uniforms, computers, and even tutoring services, all of 
which may be paid with ESA money. However, given the limitation on annual 
contributions, you may wish to couple your ESA savings with that of a Section 
529 plan that allows a greater one-time contribution.
When the beneficiary of an ESA attains age 30 (unless the beneficiary is devel-
opmentally disabled, otherwise has special needs, or dies prior to that age), 
the account proceeds must be distributed to them within 30 days. But at such 
time or before the child attains the age of 30, the account proceeds may be 
rolled over, income-tax free and penalty-tax free, into an ESA for the benefit 
of another, younger family member. If the younger family member is a child 
of the original beneficiary, the parent is treated as having made a potentially 
taxable gift to their child.
For example, assume that you have established an ESA for the benefit of your 
child but have never made distributions from this account for any purpose. 
The child has just turned 30 and is now eligible to receive the proceeds from 
the account. As a result, they are potentially subject to income tax on the 
earnings plus a 10 percent penalty. However, they now also have a child (your 
grandchild). Your child—the original beneficiary—may roll over the account 
proceeds to their child income-tax free, but in doing so, they make a gift of the 
proceeds. If the ESA account balance is more than $14,000 at the time of the 
gift, your child must file a federal gift tax return (IRS Form 709) that reports 
to the government the making of the gift.
Finally, what about the financial aid implications of saving using an ESA? The 
answer to this question depends on who is the owner of the account: the 
child, the parent, or the grandparent. If the child is both the owner and the 
designated beneficiary of the ESA, and they are still considered a dependent at 
the time of filing the FAFSA form, none of the ESA assets are counted against 
financial aid. On the other hand, if the child is both the owner and designated 
beneficiary of the ESA, and they are considered independent of their parents, 
20 percent of assets are counted against financial aid. If the owner of the ESA 
is a parent, 5.64% of the assets are counted against financial aid. Finally, if the 
ESA owner is a grandparent, none of the assets should count against financial 
aid, because there is no place to report ESA assets owned by people other 
than a parent or the child on the FAFSA form.
Section 529 Savings Plans
Two types of savings plans are described in Internal Revenue Code Section 
529 (from which the savings plans get their popular name). The first is a quali-
fied prepaid tuition plan (QTP) that may have been established by your state 
to assist your child financially while they attend college. A QTP allows the 
contributor (typically the parent) to prepay tuition at a particular school using 
today’s tuition price. As such, the parent is protected from future increases in 

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
212
the annual cost of the child attending college. In addition, the earnings made 
on the prepaid tuition grow income-tax deferred. If the parent withdraws the 
accumulated contributions and earnings in a QTP (or a private-savings type 
of Section 529 plan, which we discuss shortly) only for payment of higher-
education expenses, the entire distribution is free of income tax.
The problem with the QTP plan, however, is that the child is restricted in 
choosing where they will attend college. For example, the state of Florida 
may dictate that the prepaid tuition feature is valid only if your child attends a 
publicly funded institution in that state. If your child attends a private school 
in Florida or another state, or a public college or university outside of Florida, 
you may not be able to use the money accumulated in the QTP. This is also the 
result if your child is unfortunate enough to be denied entrance to the quali-
fying public school under the provisions of the state plan. Another problem 
associated with a QTP is that most plans only cover tuition, fees, and books at 
the qualifying institution and not room and board.
As a result of the disadvantages associated with the QTP, in 2001 Congress 
adopted a second type of Section 529 plan: the private savings plan. This plan 
is very similar to a private investment account, but unlike the QTP, a private 
savings plan does not lock in future college tuition payment at today’s prices. 
Rather, the private savings plan affords the contributor the opportunity to earn 
a rate of return on funds invested that hopefully exceeds the annual increase 
in college tuition (currently averaging 5 to 6 percent annually). Earnings in the 
account grow income-tax free as long as distributions are used to pay college 
education expenses, including room and board. In addition, although contribu-
tions to a private savings plan are not federal-income-tax deductible, some 
states permit a state income-tax deduction for contributions offered by their 
state for state residents. Generally, however, Section 529 private savings plans 
are open to investors from any state.
In addition to possible state income-tax deductibility for contributions, another 
major advantage of a Section 529 private savings plan is the significant amount 
that may be contributed to the plan on a one-time basis every five years. In 
2013, this one-time amount is $70,000 for a single donor (or five times the 
annual gift tax exclusion of $14,000) and $140,000 if the contribution is made 
jointly by a married couple. There is also a maximum amount that may be 
accumulated in each of these plans, usually $300,000, on behalf of each plan 
beneficiary. A relatively unknown but significant estate-planning technique is 
that the donor may establish a Section 529 private savings plan on behalf of 
each family member beneficiary and exclude as much as $300,000 per family 
member from their gross estate. This can be achieved even though the donor 
controls the distribution of these funds until the date of their death.
Another significant advantage of a Section 529 private savings plan is that it 
is funded with your own money. Thus, for federal financial-aid purposes, it is 

Plan Your Financial Future
213
counted among parental assets at a much lower percentage when computing 
the EFC than if a custodial account was established on behalf of the child. 
Most private savings plans permit you to change the beneficiary of a Section 
529 private savings plan at any time, as long as the account proceeds are trans-
ferred to a member of the beneficiary’s family (a sibling, a cousin, a grandpar-
ent, or even back to the parent). Therefore, you can take money back from a 
529 plan, although you must then use it only for your own higher education 
or you will pay taxes plus a 10 percent penalty on the distribution. There are 
no age limits associated with the distribution of money from a Section 529 
private savings plan, unlike with custodial accounts or the Coverdell ESA.
If this all sounds too good to be true, it isn’t—but Section 529 private savings 
plans have one minor disadvantage. In any Section 529 private savings plan, 
you cannot directly manage the invested money yourself. Instead, you must 
choose an investment manager who then decides where the money is to be 
invested, just as would happen if you were making a contribution to a mutual 
fund. To minimize the effects of this disadvantage, many plans have increased 
the number of investment choices (typically, mutual funds) in which you can 
invest. Furthermore, states have been very careful in selecting whom they 
choose to manage investors’ monies. Usually, only major brokerage houses or 
mutual fund companies are chosen.
So, what should you look for when selecting among the many choices offered 
in Section 529 private savings plans? Here are among the most important 
factors:
Look for a plan that offers a variety of good choices—
• 
typically, mutual funds. Ask the same questions you would 
ask before investing in any mutual fund, such as what its 
investment objective is, how much investment risk you 
will assume, and what the fund’s longer-term, risk-adjusted 
investment performance has been.
Try to choose a plan with relatively low expenses. Some of 
• 
this total amount depends on the mutual-fund manager in 
charge of the assets, but the higher the fund expenses, the 
more the manager must beat the market. And remember, 
the market in this instance is the ever-increasing annual 
cost of attending college.
Consider the possible availability of a state income-tax 
• 
deduction for contributions made to the plan. A top-
performing fund of another state plan may offset the loss 
of the deduction from not investing in your own state’s 
plan, but you should at least consider the advantage of 
the possible state income-tax deduction.

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
214
Approach an investment in a private savings plan as you 
• 
would an investment in any mutual fund. If you like the 
manager and the funds in the fund family, you may wish 
to invest in the plan of the state where the fund company 
is responsible for managing the plan investments. If not, 
consider another state’s plan.
Other Methods of Saving for the Cost of College
There are several other methods of saving for your child’s higher education, 
including establishing a trust on their behalf. (See Chapter 13 for further dis-
cussion of trusts.) All trusts that may be used for this purpose are irrevocable, 
meaning you cannot get the money back, and ultimately the trust principal 
must be distributed to the minor. Perhaps the most popular trust used in 
planning for the college education of a child is the Section 2503(c) trust, also 
known as a minor’s trust. This trust must be drafted by an attorney, with the 
trust principal (and any unexpended income) made available to the child once 
they reach age 21. The age of distribution may be extended at your discretion 
by adopting an alternative trust, referred to as a Section 2503(b) trust, but the 
income from the Section 2503(b) trust must be distributed annually to the 
child, thus resulting in additional Kiddie Tax concerns.
You can also purchase Series EE and inflation-adjusted Series I US Savings 
Bonds and dedicate them to the purpose of paying for your child’s college 
education. With both of these alternatives, the bond must be purchased 
in your name or in the name of an adult who is at least 24. Furthermore, 
AGI limits apply at the time of redeeming the bonds. For example, if you 
purchase the bond in your name with the intent to use it to pay for the col-
lege expenses of your child, and your AGI is too high (a specified amount 
under law) when the child attends college, you will have to pay income 
tax on the bond interest at the time that you redeem the bond. However, 
if your AGI is below the prescribed amount, you will not be taxed on the 
interest as long as the bond is used in payment of qualified higher-education 
expenses.
Tax Deductions and Credits Available for 
Paying for the Cost of College
This section addresses the benefits provided by the income-tax law to help 
you or your child pay for costs incurred while in college or pursuing some 
other type of higher education. The deductions available are a deduction for 
interest paid on student loans and a qualified higher-education tuition deduc-
tion. Important credits include the American Opportunity Tax Credit and 

Plan Your Financial Future
215
the Lifetime Learning Credit. But since 2001, these deductions and credits 
cannot be taken together in payment of the same expense. As such, the use of 
each must be planned for carefully so as to take maximum advantage of every 
benefit available to you.
Deduction for Student Loan Interest
Under current law, the interest paid (never the principal paid) by any individual 
who is obligated to make repayment on a student loan is deductible regardless 
of whether the taxpayer itemizes their deductions. However, the deductible 
amount is limited to a maximum of $2,500 per year, and an income phaseout 
range applies based on the taxpayer’s AGI level. Although these phaseout 
ranges are very high, particularly for a student borrower, they can operate to 
deny the deduction for high-income taxpayer borrowers, such as parents who 
opt to take out a PLUS loan to pay for their child’s education.
For this deduction to be taken, any debt incurred by the borrower must be 
used solely to pay for qualified higher-education expenses, including tuition, fees, 
books, and room and board. There is no restriction with respect to whether 
this debt is incurred for study toward an undergraduate or a graduate degree, 
but as part of the definition of a qualified higher-education expense, the debt 
must be taken out for study at a qualified educational institution.
Qualified Higher-Education Tuition and  
Fees Deduction
Unlike the student loan interest deduction, which may be taken by a par-
ent or child, the deduction for qualified higher-education tuition is almost 
always taken by the parent. Also, unlike the loan interest deduction, the quali-
fied higher-education tuition deduction is not limited to a specified maximum 
amount, but rather is tiered based on the taxpayer’s AGI. For example, in 2013 
a higher-tier $4,000 annual deduction is permitted for single taxpayers whose 
AGI does not exceed $65,000 and for married taxpayers filing jointly whose 
AGI does not exceed $130,000. Meanwhile, a lower-tier maximum annual 
deduction of $2,000 is permitted for single taxpayers whose AGI is between 
$65,000 and $80,000 and joint taxpayers whose AGI is between $130,000 
and $160,000. Above $80,000 AGI for a single taxpayer or $160,000 AGI 
for a joint taxpayer, no deduction is permitted for higher-education tuition  
and fees.
How does the parent determine how much they have paid in qualified tuition? 
You need to obtain assistance. The educational institution your child attends 
during any part of the academic year must report those qualifying expenses to 
you on an IRS Form 1098-T. Then, in order for you to deduct those expenses, 

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education
216
you must be able to claim the child as a taxable dependent. Although this is 
typically not a problem if you are the parent of a child who has not yet com-
pleted an undergraduate degree, it is an issue if you are attempting to claim 
the deduction for graduate school expenses. In part, this is because one of the 
tests for dependency dictates an age limit—the child must not have reached 
age 24 by the end of the calendar year. It also occurs because most children 
are financially independent by the time they attend graduate school.
As we discuss shortly, a parent may also potentially claim a tax credit, such as 
the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) or Lifetime Learning Credit, 
for higher-education tuition expenses. But if they do so, the tuition deduction 
is not permitted for the same expense for the same student. This presents 
an interesting dilemma if you are a parent with two children in college at the 
same time. You should give some thought as to how to best maximize any tax 
credit that is allowable for one child and any deduction of up to the maximum 
limit of tuition for the other. In essence, although a two-student parent may 
mix and match tax credits and the tuition deduction, you cannot double-dip 
when trying to take advantage of both tax breaks for the same student.
Higher-Education Tax Credits
As discussed in Chapter 12, a tax credit (or a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax 
due) is a very valuable tax-avoidance technique. In most cases, if a taxpayer can 
qualify to take advantage of any tax credit, they should structure their finan-
cial affairs to do so. When a tax benefit is sought in paying for the consider-
able cost of pursuing higher education, three credits are permitted: the Hope 
Scholarship Credit, the American Opportunity Tax (modified Hope) Credit, 
and the Lifetime Learning Credit.
Hope Scholarship Credit
The first credit that is permitted to help offset the cost of funding higher 
education is the Hope Scholarship Credit, which applies for tax years prior 
to 2009. This credit was incorporated into the tax law during the Clinton 
administration and took its name from President Clinton’s birthplace of Hope, 
Arkansas. The credit was permitted for tuition and fees (not books or room 
and board) paid in the first two years of postsecondary education for the tax-
payer, spouse, or dependent. The amount of credit available was 100 percent 
of the first $1,200 of qualified expenses paid in the tax year, plus 50 percent 
of the next $1,200, for a maximum annual credit of $1,800. It was computed 
on a per student basis; therefore, a two-student parent could take the credit 
for each student only if both those students were either freshmen or soph-
omores in college and the parent did not make too much money. Income 
phaseouts also applied.

Plan Your Financial Future
217
American Opportunity Tax Credit
The AOTC is a modification of the Hope Scholarship Credit for tax years 
beginning after December 31, 2008; it was extended through the year 2017 by 
the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The AOTC amount is the sum of 
100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses plus 
25 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses for a 
maximum credit of $2,500 per eligible student. Thus, a maximum of $4,000 in 
qualifying annual expenses may be taken into account in computing the credit. 
What is a qualifying expense for the purposes of the credit? Unlike either 
the tuition and fees deduction or the Lifetime Learning Credit, where only 
tuition and fees may be considered, the American Opportunity Tax Credit 
also includes such expenses as books, school supplies (including computers), 
software, and other class materials.
The credit is available for the first four years of a student’s undergraduate 
education, but phaseout rules apply. In 2013, the credit amount phases out for 
single taxpayers with annual AGIs between $80,000 and $90,000. For married 
taxpayers filing jointly, it phases out between $160,000 and $180,000.
Lifetime Learning Credit
In contrast to the Hope Scholarship or the AOTC, the Lifetime Learning 
Credit is much broader in application and may therefore be used by more 
parents. This credit is available for tuition and fees incurred for expenses 
associated with an undergraduate, a graduate, or a professional degree pro-
gram. Furthermore, there are no credit-hour enrollment requirements, as is 
the case with the Hope Scholarship Credit and the AOTC, where the student 
must be enrolled at least half-time. All that is necessary to claim the Lifetime 
Learning Credit is that the student incur the expense and that you, the tax-
payer claiming the credit, are below an applicable income-phaseout range.
The maximum amount of Lifetime Learning Credit that may be taken in any 
year is $2,000 per family. Therefore, depending on the number of children 
you have attending college at any given time and what year of school they 
are in, the per-family limitation may or may not be an advantage. If you have 
two children in their undergraduate years of college and you are under the 
income-phaseout range, the AOTC may afford you a maximum annual credit 
of $5,000 ($2,500 times 2), whereas the Lifetime Learning Credit yields a 
credit of only $2,000. With this limited exception, however, if you have to 
choose between the two credits (remember, you cannot take both credits for 
the same expense), you are better off claiming the Lifetime Learning Credit.
Unlike either the Hope Scholarship Credit or the AOTC, the Lifetime Learning 
Credit may be claimed for an unlimited number of years. You may even take 
advantage of it as an employee looking to improve your job skills by taking a 
single or several courses not leading to an eventual degree.

Chapter 15 | Planning for Your Child’s Higher Education

The Tax-Coordination Rules: Why Can’t  
I Do That?
Paradoxically, Congress does not want you to take too much advantage of 
a good thing—the “thing” here being double-dipping by using allowable tax 
credits and deductions in payment of the same expense. But what about with-
drawals that you may anticipate making from your college savings accounts—
notably, the Section 529 private savings plan? Remember that one of the major 
advantages of the Section 529 private plan is that, if you use those withdrawals 
to pay college tuition and fees, the earnings on them are income-tax free.
The answer to that question is that Congress has permanently shut down the 
opportunity to pay college tuition expenses and fees with tax-free Section 
529 private savings plan withdrawals and then subsequently claim a Hope 
Scholarship, AOTC, or Lifetime Learning Credit for the same expenses. 
Technically, this prohibition is included in the tax law under the tax-coordina-
tion rules. However, if you have been reading this chapter closely, you know 
that a Section 529 private savings plan withdrawal may be used to pay for 
room and board expenses, books and school supplies, and tuition and fees. 
This is in contrast to any of the permitted credits, which may only be used in 
payment of tuition and fees (or related expenses). Therefore, you have your 
answer with respect to how best to maximize both tax benefits: save for col-
lege with a Section 529 private savings plan, and subsequently make withdraw-
als from that plan to pay for college education expenses other than tuition 
and fees. In the same taxable year, then, depending on your AGI at the time 
your child attends college, you can also claim either the Hope Scholarship or 
AOTC when you pay for your child’s college tuition and fees.
Using a Roth IRA in College Funding
Many individuals think of a Roth IRA only in conjunction with planning for their 
own retirement (the subject of the next two chapters). But this vehicle may also 
be effectively used as a college savings technique. Although most retirement 
savings plans and accounts may only be titled in the name of the participant or 
owner, it is possible to title a Roth IRA in the name of a minor child—therefore 
avoiding the need to also name a custodian for the account. Keep in mind, 
though, that Roth IRAs require that the child accumulate some earned income 
before contributions are possible. The same rule applies before contributions 
may be made to either your or a child’s deductible traditional IRA.
In planning for your child’s college expenses, then, consider hiring your child 
to perform household duties, and pay them at least the maximum amount 
of annual contributions permitted to a Roth IRA (in 2013, $5,500 per year 
for taxpayers less than age 50). Do this at least five years before your child 

Plan Your Financial Future
219
is planning to attend college, and the child can withdraw the after-tax 
­contributions and earnings income tax–free for college use. Alternatively, if the 
child does not go to college or if you have otherwise saved to pay for those 
expenses, the child now has a wealth-accumulation vehicle that is very power-
ful. For example, if you contribute the maximum amount of $5,500 per year 
to a child’s Roth IRA between the years the child turns age 10 and 13 and 
make no further contributions, and assuming you can earn an 8 percent annual 
before-tax return on that money, the child will have over $1.4 million in the 
account ($1,464,278.30, to be exact) when they reach age 65.
Now let’s proceed to most individuals’ number-one financial planning goal, the 
topic you probably have been waiting for or planning for most: retirement. We 
discuss this broad area in two ways over the next two chapters: planning for 
the financial aspects of retirement, and planning for the lifestyle needs of your 
retirement years.

Planning for 
the Financial 
Aspects of 
Retirement
There are many opinions as to when it is best to start planning for your 
retirement, but the best strategy is to do so as soon as possible. As part 
of the PADD process, recognize that accumulating sufficient funds to retire 
comfortably should be your number-one financial goal. If you are married 
with children at the time of your planned retirement, having sufficient retire-
ment funds will help you avoid becoming a burden to your family, and, as a 
result, will make your retirement years that much more enjoyable. Adequate 
retirement monies will also prevent you from becoming overly dependent 
on the Social Security system, which is heading for financial difficulty absent 
Congressional action.
How Much Will I Need?
Similar to the lifetime distribution of your wealth in planning for your child’s 
higher education, the first question in planning for the financial aspects of 
retirement is how much you will need. Generally, we can say you will need a 
lot of money, but a specific computation using a financial function calculator 
16
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
222
can give you a more approximate amount. Let’s use the following example to 
describe the steps: assume that you are 35 and make $100,000 a year. You 
should anticipate that you will need approximately 75 percent of your before-
tax income in today’s dollars to retire comfortably, or $75,000 annually.  
As part of your retirement-planning assumptions, you anticipate that infla-
tion will average 3 percent annually prior to and during your retirement and 
that you can earn a 7 percent after-tax return on your investments. You 
plan to retire 30 years from now at age 65 and plan to be in retirement for  
20 years. Note: All amounts are calculated using a Hewlett-Packard 10BII 
financial ­function calculator.
Step 1: Compute your annual retirement income need in today’s dollars until 
your planned date of retirement:
PV = $75,000 (Enter this as a negative number if using the 
• 
HP 10BII calculator.)
I/YR = 3
• 
N = 30
• 
Solve for FV = $182,045
• 
Step 2: Compute the lump-sum capital needed to generate this annual income 
during the period of retirement:
PMT = $182,045 (You need to be in BEGIN mode if using 
• 
the HP 10BII calculator, and the amount needs to be 
entered as a negative number.)
I/YR = 3.8835 (This is an inflation-adjusted rate of return, 
• 
so enter 1.07 divided by 1.03, less 1, times 100 on your 
calculator.)
N = 20
• 
Solve for PV = $2,596,849
• 
Step 3: Compute the annual amount of savings needed to accumulate this 
lump sum (assuming you have not already begun a retirement savings program 
and have not accumulated any invested assets for retirement):
FV = $2,596,849 (Round to $2.6 million. If using the HP 
• 
10BII calculator, you now need to convert back to END 
mode.)
I/YR = 7
• 
N = 30
• 
Solve for annual savings deposit required or payment = 
• 
$27,524.65

Again, as in education funding, the important action to take here is to begin 
to save some amount now. The amount that needs to be set aside from your 
salary is intimidating—over 25 percent of your gross, and not your take-home, 
pay (where the percentage to be saved would be even greater). Nevertheless, 
do not fixate on the required annual savings or total lump-sum amount as 
much as on the financial goal of beginning to save for your retirement.
If you do not want to purchase a financial function calculator or would 
rather not compute a retirement needs analysis yourself, a number of 
financial calculators and worksheets are available online (for example, at  
http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/) that can assist you. In addi-
tion, some helpful charts are available in financial magazines that, given certain 
assumptions, tell you much money you will need to accumulate at a certain 
age in order to retire comfortably.
There are three basic methods to saving for retirement:
Contributing to employer-sponsored retirement plans, 
• 
such as Section 401(k) plans
Contributing to personal tax-deferred savings plans, such 
• 
as traditional deductible IRAs or after-tax Roth IRAs
Contributing in the form of payroll taxes to the Social 
• 
Security system
Even after maximizing all these retirement savings methods, you will likely also 
have to set aside money in a taxable account to accumulate the necessary 
amount for retirement. When you do so, follow the investment strategy of 
dollar-cost averaging discussed in Chapter 3 and, if investing solely or ­primarily 
in mutual funds, try to choose funds with low expenses and tax-efficient 
investments.
Other Questions to Ask When Planning  
for Retirement
Not only are there financial questions to answer when planning for retire-
ment, but there are also some questions that are softer in nature that you 
need to address. In other words, you must also determine where you will live 
and what you will do once you stop working. Questions such as these are the 
focus of the next chapter, but there are two more financially related issues to 
consider when planning for retirement:
Is my mortgage paid off (or at least paid down to a 
• 
­manageable amount)?
How will I cover major expenses during retirement, 
• 
­particularly the rising cost of health care expenses?

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
224
Mortgage Expenses
The possibility of using a reverse mortgage to generate additional income 
­during your retirement period is discussed in detail in the next chapter. 
Regardless, studies have shown that individuals who have been able to free 
up cash by paying off as much of their mortgage balance as possible prior 
to retirement tend to be much happier. Certainly, if you can remove your 
monthly mortgage payment from your list of fixed expenses, you will have that 
much more cash to live on and enjoy during retirement.
It is true that there is a debate about whether you should pay off your mortgage  
early, given the corresponding loss of the mortgage interest deduction when 
itemizing deductions for income tax purposes. However, you should keep in 
mind that, at most, you are receiving a 39.6 percent offset from your ability  
to deduct any mortgage interest. Further, depending on the type of mortgage 
you signed, you may be accumulating very little—if any—equity in your home. 
For example, if you signed an interest-only mortgage, you probably are not 
reducing your mortgage principal (and thus are relying only on the possibility of 
your home appreciating over time). As a result, paying off as much of your mort-
gage as possible before you retire will likely prove to be wise financial planning.
There is also the issue of refinancing your mortgage prior to retiring, to lower 
your monthly fixed expenses. Although refinancing may prove to be a good 
decision, the disadvantage of doing so is that you have probably extended your 
mortgage payment term to a greater number of years. For example, assume 
you have a 15-year mortgage and are planning to retire in 3 years. The remain-
ing term on this mortgage is 10 years. In an effort to free up needed cash 
and reduce your monthly payment, you refinance your mortgage at a lower 
interest rate and take out another 15-year mortgage. Thus, you have an addi-
tional 12 years of mortgage payments to make during your retirement period 
instead of only an additional 2 years after you retire. Similarly, if you signed 
a new 30-year mortgage instead of another 15-year one, you would have an 
additional 27 years of mortgage payments to deal with.
One way to avoid this consequence of refinancing is to sign a mortgage with a 
shorter repayment term, such as ten years. The tradeoff for doing this is that 
your monthly mortgage payment goes up and not down. Accordingly, unless 
you have budgeted for such a situation, the increased mortgage amount may 
result in cash-flow pressures throughout the remaining seven years of the 
mortgage term after you retire.
Health Care Expenses
As almost everyone is aware, there is a health care crisis in the United States. 
This crisis is particularly acute for retirees, many of whom are relying on a fixed 
income to pay for their retirement years. According to Fidelity Investments, 

Plan Your Financial Future
225
a 65-year-old couple who retired in 2007 will need approximately $215,000 
to cover medical costs after they stop working—and this amount is in excess 
of Medicare coverage, which typically covers catastrophic expenses of an 
­individual age 65 or older. To make matters worse, for individuals retiring 
after 2007, the amount needed to cover medical costs in excess of Medicare 
coverage is even greater, because health care costs have continued to rise. 
The New York Times reports that the cost of family insurance coverage has 
almost doubled over the last ten years (2002–2012).
What is the best strategy to cover the rising costs of health care? Short of 
being fortunate enough to be provided with retiree health insurance from 
your prior employer, the best plan is to save even more while you are working. 
For example, the 35-year-old wage earner noted earlier in this chapter should 
plan to save more than the $2.6 million lump-sum capital needed for retire-
ment; at the very least, they need approximately $200,000 (actually more, 
because the noted amount has not been inflated for 30 more years of growth) 
for their future health care costs. Another option is to apply for Medigap 
­coverage within the first six months of qualifying for Medicare, to assist with 
the payment of these expenses. Finally, a third option, at least for self-employed 
individuals, is to establish and save for current and future medical costs via a 
health savings account (HSA).
Note that this estimated $200,000 cost of medical care does not include 
­possible long-term care expenses. Contrary to common knowledge, Medicare 
does not cover the cost of custodial care. As such, it is critical that you 
­consider the purchase of a qualified long-term-care insurance policy while you 
still qualify for coverage and can afford it. It is probably too early for a 35-year-
old individual to consider purchasing such a policy (unless it is for their par-
ent), but once they reach the age of 50 or so, investigating the purchase of 
an individual long-term-care policy (or participating in an employer’s group 
policy, if available) should be a top financial-planning goal.
The Financial Risks of Retirement
Similar to the general investment risks discussed in Chapter 9, retirees face 
several special financial risks. Specifically, these are as follows:
• 
Inflation or purchasing-power risk: A daily risk of any retiree 
living on a fixed income. Succinctly, it may be asserted 
that the purchasing power of fixed dollars is less in the 
future than it is today.
• 
Longevity or the risk of superannuation: The risk that a 
retiree will run out of money before they die. It is this 
type of risk that most frightens the average retiree and 
is the primary reason that annuities are very important 
retirement-planning vehicles.

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
226
• 
Market risk: The general risk of investing in the stock or 
bond market. It is sometimes referred to as volatility risk 
because the values of those investments fluctuate daily.
• 
Investor behavior risk: The risk that investors are irrational 
and subject to herd mentality. For example, they tend to 
purchase today’s hot stock at the top of the market and 
then sell that same stock at the bottom of the market. Thus, 
many investors are not positioned for optimal, or even aver-
age, returns. A whole new field of finance has arisen, known 
as behavioral finance, to study just this type of risk.
• 
Point-in-time or sequential risk: The risk that a retiree 
begins retirement during a market downturn and then 
withdraws too much money initially, thus accentuating 
the risk of superannuation.
The most important of these risks is likely longevity risk—the risk of outliving 
your money. There is really only one surefire way to avoid this risk, and that 
is to purchase an immediate fixed or variable annuity. But many retirees are 
dubious about purchasing annuities, for two reasons: they do not like the idea 
of spending down the money invested in the annuity; and they fear making 
such a large investment, dying shortly thereafter, and losing their money to the 
insurance company. There certainly are ways to resolve or at least minimize 
these concerns, but another way of managing longevity risk is to establish the 
withdrawal of a fixed percentage of retirement savings and then adhere to that 
percentage, adjusted for annual inflation, until your death.
What fixed annual percentage should a retiree withdraw? Many studies have 
been conducted in an attempt to answer this question, but the consensus of 
most academics and financial-planning practitioners is to annually withdraw 
4 to 5 percent of your initial account balance, and then step up this percentage 
each year after accounting for inflation. In other words, the actual dollars you 
spend in any year should be 4 to 5 percent of the total amount you have saved 
at the time of retirement, adjusted for the effect of inflation in the subsequent 
years. It is important to keep in mind, however, that this percentage is very 
dependent on the market remaining relatively stable (not significantly decreasing 
in value) throughout your retirement period.
Assume that you are 65, have been a diligent saver throughout your working 
years, and have accumulated retirement savings of $1.5 million. In your first 
year of retirement, you would withdraw $67,500 (or 4.5 percent of your 
initial account balance). Assuming that inflation for that year is 3 percent, in 
the next year you would withdraw $69,525 ($67,500 times 1.03) and so on 
throughout your retirement period. In such a manner, it is estimated that you 
have approximately a 90 percent chance of not outliving your money over a 
30-year retirement period.

Plan Your Financial Future
227
Two big challenges are associated with this strategy:
As you enjoy your retirement years, you need to aver-
• 
age an after-tax return of more than 4.5 percent annually,  
or you will invade the principal of your retirement savings.
If you have begun this strategy in a down market, your 
• 
withdrawal of more than 4.5 percent annually will deplete 
your account balance much more quickly than it otherwise 
would. In other words, you are not living off the interest 
and will not have as much—if any—money to leave to your 
heirs at the end of your retirement period. You can make up 
this deficiency in later years by earning more annual invest-
ment returns than you have otherwise assumed. But what 
­happens if you do not achieve your expected rate of return 
or even lose money? For example, if you lose 2 percent from 
your portfolio from a previous return of 4 percent, that 
is a mathematical loss of 50 percent. To recover that loss 
or get back to even, you now need to earn back that lost  
2 percent or achieve a mathematical gain of 100 percent.
It is critical that you associate point-in-time risk with longevity risk. Practically, 
this means the investment climate at the point in time when you retire is very 
important. You want the first few years of your retirement to be enjoyed in 
an up market—or at least in a market environment that is relatively stable. 
You also do not want to be overly invested in fixed-income securities, such 
as bonds and cash equivalents, or you probably will not achieve an after-tax 
return that is equal to or more than the inflation rate. Accordingly, that is why 
financial planners and investment advisors recommend approximately a 60 
percent equity / 40 percent bond and cash mix throughout retirement.
The “Three-Legged Stool” of Retirement Savings
Historically, financial planners have tended to view saving for retirement as 
consisting of three legs of a retirement “stool”:
Pension income from an employer-sponsored retirement 
• 
plan, such as the traditional defined-benefit plan
Personal savings income from either a tax-deferred 
• 
­personal savings plan, such as an IRA, or a taxable mutual 
fund account
Social Security income
• 
Recently, however, given the rapid increase in defined-contribution plans, 
wherein investment risk is transferred to the employee or participant, a fourth 
leg of retirement-plan earnings has also been included among retirement 

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
228
savings. As such, the stool is really more like a table—one that needs to be 
“set” more and more by your own retirement-plan contributions.
Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans
Most medium- to large-size employers now offer their employees the oppor-
tunity to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Generally 
speaking, most employer-sponsored retirement plans today fall under the 
classification of defined-contribution plans (sometimes lumped together 
under the heading of profit-sharing plans). The plan of choice in this category is 
often a Section 401(k) plan, which is a type of profit-sharing plan wherein the 
employer may choose at its discretion whether to make a separate contribu-
tion in any given year. Unfortunately, though, according to a recent survey by 
the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, almost 23 percent of eligible 
employees do not participate in their employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. This 
is a mistake! Particularly in cases where the employer matches all or some 
portion of the employee’s before-tax contribution, the employee is essentially 
leaving found money on the retirement-savings table. Moreover, even if the 
employer does not match a portion of employee contributions to the plan, 
the employee is still contributing to a 401(k) plan with before-tax dollars. 
As a result, not only does contributing to a 401(k) plan represent an opportu-
nity for the employee to save for their retirement, but it also allows them to 
reduce their current income taxes at the same time.
As a substitute for defined-contribution plans, employers may elect to offer their 
employees a second category of retirement plans known as a defined-benefit 
plan (or pension plan). But as has generally been well documented, defined-
benefit plans are a dying breed of employer-sponsored retirement plans due to 
their complexity and cost. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 
today only about 20 percent of retirees receive a pension check from a defined-
benefit plan—and for workers now in their 20s, the outlook is even worse. It is 
likely that 10 percent or fewer of those workers will receive a monthly pension 
check. For the employer, this is a positive trend; but for the employee, it is not so 
favorable, because they assume responsibility for funding their retirement. Hence, 
in addition to the lack of a promised retirement benefit, the now-predominant 
defined-contribution plan requires considerable investment expertise on the 
part of the employee—a trait that many do not possess.
The retirement outlook for younger workers, the vast majority of whom 
will not be offered a defined-benefit plan during their working years, is not 
all bad, however. Certain defined-contribution plans dictate that employer 
contributions are not discretionary. For example, a money-purchase plan 
requires mandatory employer contributions equal to a percentage of 
employee salary, plus investment of those contributions on behalf of the 
employee at their direction. Furthermore, due to a recent law that equated 
the percentage deduction of a mandatory-contribution employer plan, such 

Plan Your Financial Future
229
as a money-purchase plan, to that of a discretionary-contribution plan, such 
a Section 401(k), profit-sharing plans have become much more popular. You 
should respond in one of two ways:
Participate in and contribute to a defined-contribution 
• 
plan in whatever amount you can afford. Remember, 
the lump-sum amount you need to accumulate for a 
comfortable retirement is substantial.
Educate yourself as much as possible about the concepts 
• 
of investment risk and return. Know the minimum amount 
of risk you are willing to assume for the maximum 
possible amount of return you wish to achieve.
Contribute to your employer-sponsored retirement plans first and before you 
attempt to separately contribute to any personal tax-deferred savings (such as 
an IRA) or taxable investments. In this manner, you can best take advantage of 
any matching contributions your employer may choose to make to encourage 
you to save for your retirement.
Personal Savings Plans
If you wish to supplement the retirement savings you are accumulating in an 
employer-sponsored retirement plan, you may want to consider allocating 
additional money into either a tax-deferred or a taxable personal savings 
plan. Tax-deferred personal savings plans include the traditional deductible 
IRA, the traditional nondeductible IRA, and the Roth IRA (although qualifying 
Roth IRA distributions are actually tax-free). There are also rollover IRAs, 
which are used as receptacles for lump-sum distributions from employer-
sponsored (defined-benefit and defined-contribution) retirement plans. 
All these types of IRAs may be established without the assistance of your 
employer, although other types of IRAs—notably the Simplified Employee 
Pension (SEP) IRA and the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees 
(SIMPLE) IRA—must be established and contributed to by the employer on 
behalf of the participating employee.
The traditional deductible IRA is the oldest and best-known type of IRA. 
The annual amount that may be contributed to this type of IRA is established 
by law, but whether this same contribution amount may be deducted on the 
owner’s income-tax return depends on a number of factors:
If neither spouse is an active participant in an employer-
• 
sponsored plan, such as a Section 401(k), or if a single 
taxpayer is not an active participant, then contributions 
to the traditional IRA are deductible without regard to 
the participant’s adjusted gross income (AGI) in the year 
of contribution.

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
230
If one spouse is an active participant in an employer- 
• 
sponsored plan but the other spouse is not—for example, 
one spouse stays at home—then the non-participant 
spouse may deduct contributions to their traditional 
IRA as long as the couple’s AGI is less than a specified 
annual amount in the year of contribution (in 2013, it is 
$178,000).
If both spouses are active participants, or if a single 
• 
taxpayer is an active participant in an employer-sponsored 
plan, then the deduction is phased out if their income 
exceeds specified annual AGI ranges in the year of contri-
bution (in 2013, for jointly filing taxpayers, $92,000 to 
$112,000; and for single taxpayers, $58,000 to $68,000).
The important point to take away from these complex rules is that if you are 
a relatively high-wage earner and participate in a retirement plan offered by 
your employer, you are likely prohibited from deducting your contribution 
to a traditional deductible IRA. As such, you have only two other options to 
personally save: either take advantage of a traditional nondeductible IRA or 
elect to open a Roth IRA.
Traditional deductible IRA contributions may be invested in any type of asset, 
with three specific exceptions:
You cannot invest IRA contributions in collectibles such 
• 
as stamps, coins, and antiques.
You cannot invest IRA contributions in life insurance 
• 
policies (although annuities are permitted).
You cannot write yourself a promissory note and invest 
• 
in that manner; that is a form of borrowing, and borrow-
ing of any type is strictly prohibited from an IRA.
An individual or a married couple may also make traditional nondeductible 
IRA contributions up to the same specified annual amount as those of a 
traditional deductible IRA. But there are no complex rules or AGI limitations 
associated with nondeductible traditional IRA contributions. If you are a high-
income wage earner and cannot otherwise contribute to a Roth IRA, you 
should consider contributing to a nondeductible IRA. Note, however, that 
you should do this only after fully maximizing whatever contributions you can 
make to an employer-sponsored plan, because those contributions are fully 
deductible from your taxable income without regard to how much you earn.
For example, assume that you are making $200,000 annually and that your 
employer offers a Section 401(k) plan. Because you make too much money, 
you are prohibited from deducting your contributions to a traditional IRA. 

Plan Your Financial Future
231
Therefore, you should first contribute as much of your salary as you can 
afford and is permitted under law on a pretax basis to your employer’s Section 
401(k) plan. You should then make a contribution to a traditional IRA—in this 
case, a traditional nondeductible IRA—even though you cannot deduct the 
contribution in the current year.
A second option to consider in the event that you cannot make a deductible 
contribution to a traditional IRA is to make this same contribution to a Roth 
IRA. The Roth IRA was introduced in 1998 and for the most part is still an 
extremely underutilized personal-savings retirement plan. It does have its own 
annual AGI contribution limits, meaning that very high-income wage earners 
(like the taxpayer in the previous example) cannot contribute. For most of 
us, however, a Roth IRA is a very effective personal retirement tool if you do 
not distribute the funds you put into it until at least five years after its estab-
lishment and are at least 59-1/2 years old. Why? Because if you meet these 
requirements (a qualified distribution), the withdrawal made from the Roth 
IRA is completely income-tax-free. In addition, unlike with either form of tradi-
tional IRA, you can make contributions to a Roth IRA after you have reached 
the age of 70 and 6 months, meaning that throughout your retirement, assum-
ing you are within the AGI limits, you may continue to accumulate wealth.
The major disadvantage of the Roth IRA is that your annual contributions are 
never income-tax deductible, meaning you cannot deduct those contributions 
on your income tax return. But in exchange for this disadvantageous tax treat-
ment going in, distributions from a Roth IRA that has been owned for more 
than five years are taxed extremely favorably going out. Specifically, not only 
are the earnings generated from Roth IRA investments income-tax-free at the 
time of distribution, but so are the contributions. This is not the case with 
the traditional deductible IRA, where only the earnings, not the contributions, 
are income-tax-free.
Social Security
If you want to get into a disagreement quickly with a business colleague or 
friend, just ask them their opinion of the Social Security system. Many people, 
particularly younger individuals, do not believe that Social Security benefits 
will be available for them when they retire. They believe this even though they 
have paid into the system for most—if not all—of their working years. To 
view Social Security in this way is probably a mistake: your ability to receive a 
benefit under the system is a contract between you and the federal govern-
ment. Thus, despite all the political hand-wringing over the Social Security 
system, Congress is likely to do whatever it takes to shore up the system and 
make good on its part of the contract.
Who is eligible to receive Social Security retirement payments? Anyone who 
is fully insured under the system. A fully insured individual is any worker 

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
232
who has earned 40 quarterly credits (worked for ten years) before their 
full retirement age under the system. A nominal amount of income must be 
earned each quarter (for example, $1,160 in 2013) for a credit to be awarded, 
but most of us easily exceed this amount ($1,160 per quarter’s worth of 
earnings equates to only $4,640 of annual earnings in 2013).
Once you are fully insured, you—and, usually, your surviving spouse—are 
entitled to Social Security retirement benefits at a certain age. Many people 
think the age at which they will receive retirement benefits under the system 
is 65, but your full retirement age (FRA) actually depends on your date of 
birth. For instance, if you were born in 1962 or after, your FRA is age 67, not 
age 65. Table  16-1, which is also included in Social Security publications, will 
help you determine your FRA and when you and your spouse are entitled to 
unreduced retirement benefits under Social Security.

The third column of the table shows the FRA for the surviving spouse when 
they are entitled to retirement benefits from your employment record. It is also 
possible for the spouse to be entitled to retirement benefits as a result of their 
own employment and earned credits under the system. In that case, the spouse is 
entitled to the greater of the retirement benefits computed under your employ-
ment record or those determined using their own employment history.
Unlike Medicare, it is also possible for a retired worker under the Social 
Security system to receive retirement benefits before age 65 or the otherwise 
applicable FRA. If you are fully insured, you may elect to receive permanently 
reduced benefits as early as the first full month after your sixty-second birthday, 
regardless of your date of birth. Whether you should elect to do so is the 
subject of the next section of this chapter.
When Should I Elect to Begin Receiving Social 
Security Retirement Benefits?
According to Social Security Administration figures, approximately 70 percent 
of all beneficiaries are collecting reduced benefits because of early retirement. 
Is this the correct decision?
The choice to receive Social Security retirement benefits early is a complex 
one and should take into account several factors. Certainly, if you are in poor 
health at age 62 or have an unfavorable family history with regard to your 
expected future health, it is prudent to elect to receive Social Security 
benefits early. Given a number of reasonable assumptions, the break-even 
point between making an early election and delaying the receipt of benefits 
until you reach your FRA under the system is approximately age 81 or later. 
As a result, if you believe you will live beyond age 81, you are generally better 
off delaying the receipt of Social Security retirement benefits until your FRA.
Individuals who are fortunate enough to decide between the early receipt of 
Social Security benefits versus delaying the receipt of those benefits may be 
categorized into two groups: those who can or want to continue ­working 
after age 62, and those who do not need to work after age 62 because they 
can fund their retirement years through personal retirement savings and/or  
an employer-sponsored retirement plan. If you plan to continue working 
after age 62, you need to be aware that your Social Security benefits will be 
reduced by $1 for every $2 received in excess of a specified amount (for 
example, $15,120 annually in 2013). As a result, if you anticipate making more 
than this amount at whatever post-retirement job you decide to take, it will 
prove beneficial for you to delay the collection of your benefits until your FRA, 
when no benefit penalty exists.

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
234
The actual percentage reduction suffered by a 62-year-old recipient depends 
on their date of birth and how far they are from the FRA. Benefits are reduced 
on a sliding scale, ranging from a total of 20 percent for individuals born 
before 1938 who retired at age 62 to 30 percent for individuals born in 1960 
or later who elect to take early benefits. For more information, you may wish 
to consult the reference table found on the US Social Security Administration 
website (www.ssa.gov), which lists the percentage reduction you will suffer 
for early receipt of benefits, depending on your date of birth.
Your other option is to postpone collecting benefits until you turn 70. If you 
do so and reach your FRA on or after 2013, the increase in retirement benefits 
for each month of delay is two-thirds of 1 percent of your otherwise-payable 
normal retirement benefit. This works out to an increase in benefits of 6 to  
8 percent for each year you delay—a relatively reasonable rate of annual 
return, particularly in a volatile stock market.
How should you decide what to do? Should you take benefits early at age 62, 
delay until your FRA under the system, or postpone your receipt of benefits 
until you are 70? Perhaps the simplest way to make this decision is to ignore 
alternative uses of the money and plot the percentage reductions and increases 
based on your monthly retirement benefit payable at FRA. You can determine 
the amount of your otherwise-payable monthly benefit by contacting the SSA 
or referencing the projected payment estimates found on the statement the 
SSA is required to send to you each year. Then run the numbers on a spread-
sheet and determine which decision gives you the most gross benefit over 
your anticipated life expectancy. When you apply actuarial life-expectancy 
tables, if you live exactly as long as the tables predict, you should have the same 
amount of gross benefit, regardless of which option you choose.
There is one other factor to consider with respect to the receipt of Social 
Security retirement benefits. Benefits are income-tax-free for the majority of 
Social Security beneficiaries; but for taxpayers with relatively modest annual 
incomes, up to 85 percent of all benefits received must be included as income 
for federal income-tax purposes. Special step-rate thresholds apply. The first 
of these thresholds requires inclusion of 50 percent of all benefits, and the 
­second threshold mandates an 85 percent inclusion. Currently, these two thresh-
olds of modified AGI are as follows, depending on taxpayer filing status:
• 
Single taxpayer: $25,000 and $34,000
•

When computing modified AGI for the purposes of Social Security benefit 
taxation, it is important to keep in mind that you must add back to your regu-
lar AGI any tax-exempt interest income you may have. Thus, a retiree whose 
investment portfolio consists primarily of municipal bonds or municipal bond 
mutual funds will likely pay more when filing their return than a retiree whose

portfolio is heavily weighted with stocks. This is all the more reason a retiree 
should continue to diversify their portfolio among equities, corporate bonds, 
and cash or cash-equivalent asset classes.
Understanding Distribution Options from  
an Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan
Depending on plan provisions, four basic options are available to a participant 
in an employer-sponsored retirement plan when you terminate employment 
or retire:
Take a lump-sum distribution from the plan.
• 
Receive an annuity or other periodic distribution from 
• 
the plan.
Roll over the distribution to an IRA or to your new 
• 
employer’s retirement plan.
Leave the accumulated funds in the employer’s plan.
• 
This last option is infrequently offered, because most sponsoring, past 
employers do not want the responsibility of continuing to manage and invest 
your retirement monies. Of the three remaining options, most participants 
choose a lump-sum distribution if it is available. Presumably, this is because 
most participants believe they can invest the retirement monies at least as 
well as the plan trustee. In reality, though, many people choose the lump-sum 
option because they think they need the money. This is unfortunate, because, 
given the power of tax-deferred compounding, the younger the participant, 
the more advantageous it is to roll the distribution into an IRA and continue 
the tax deferral. Alternatively, if you elect to receive the distribution in a lump 
sum, you must first pay income taxes on the total and then may use only the 
net amount for your personal needs.
The decision to receive an annuity or other periodic distribution option is 
the most common and prudent course of action for a retiring or soon-to-be 
retired participant. The primary advantage of selecting the annuity option 
from an employer-sponsored plan is that you cannot outlive their money from 
the plan. But this does not mean the employer is underwriting the annuity 
for you. Rather, most employers transfer the risk of future investment per-
formance and liability to an insurance company at the time that you retire. 
Thus, they buy a commercial annuity on behalf of the participant to fund their 
retirement payment obligation.
The fact that most employers purchase a tax-qualified annuity with the 
employee’s retirement monies raises the issue of whether you are better off 
taking a lump-sum distribution and purchasing the annuity yourself. This is 
i

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
236
not a simple question and is the subject of a separate discussion with respect 
to the use of annuities in retirement, but here are some general guidelines to 
assist you in making this decision:
If you are married at the time of taking an annuity 
• 
payout from most employer-sponsored plans, under law, 
the plan must provide for at least a 50 percent joint and 
survivor annuity for your spouse unless your spouse 
waives the survivor annuity in writing. This protection 
for your spouse in turn reduces your monthly annuity 
payment, although there are alternatives to provide for 
your spouse while also ensuring that your monthly 
payment amount is higher.
If you purchase the annuity yourself, investigate a payment 
• 
term with at least a guarantee of payment to your survivor: 
for example, a life annuity with a period certain. This 
ensures that if you die before the end of the period (for 
example, 20 years), your survivor will receive payments 
for the remainder of the term.
Consider the purchase of an 
• 
immediate fixed annuity 
if you need to begin annuity payments as soon as possible. 
Conversely, if you do not need the money immediately, 
consider a low-cost variable annuity with a lifetime guar-
antee withdrawal benefit (GWB) rider or guaranteed 
minimum income benefit (GMIB) rider.
Try not to annuitize the annuity (use up the principal of 
• 
the annuity) during your lifetime, but live off the ­earnings 
from the annuity’s underlying investments. This will 
ensure that the greater of the annuity’s account value or 
death benefit will pass on to your heirs.
Annuities can be expensive, so look for as low-cost an 
• 
annuity as possible.
If the annuity you are considering does not provide as 
• 
high an annual return as the annuity your employer will 
otherwise purchase for you, you are better off letting the 
employer provide the benefit. Before you make this deci-
sion, ask your employer’s human resource office what the 
internal rate of return on their annuity will be. In other 
words, what assumed discount rate is used to determine 
the present value of your monthly annuity payment?
Because more and more defined-contribution retirement plans are being 
offered by employers, a lump-sum payment option may be your only choice 
of distribution. If, on the other hand, you are fortunate enough to be entitled 

Plan Your Financial Future
237
to a pension from your employer’s plan, an annuity payout or other periodic 
­distribution will likely be among your distribution options. Assuming an annuity 
­payout is available, you should consider the advantages of that payout very care-
fully if you are concerned about the longevity risk associated with retirement.
Required Minimum Distributions
By April 1 of the year following the year in which you reach the age of 70 
and 6 months, you must generally begin to take taxable distributions from 
either an employer-sponsored retirement plan or a traditional IRA. Note that 
there is an exception to this rule for workers who have not yet retired as of 
age 70 and 6 months. In that instance, a required minimum distribution does 
not have to be made until April 1 of the year following the year in which the 
worker retires. For each subsequent year after your required beginning date, 
you must withdraw a required minimum distribution by December 31 of that 
year. Because the amount of distribution you must take in a given year is estab-
lished by tax law, these distributions are often referred to as required minimum 
distributions (RMDs).
The RMD for any given year is computed by dividing your account balance 
in the employer plan or traditional IRA as of December 31 of the preceding 
year by an applicable divisor or distribution period. This divisor or distribution 
period is determined by referencing your age as of December 31 of the 
distribution year in an IRS table known as the Uniform Lifetime Table. Here is 
a portion of that table for participants age 70 through age 80.

Once you begin distributions, each subsequent divisor goes down by a factor of 
approximately one. This is because you are getting older and your life expec-
tancy is, accordingly, reduced. For example, assume you were born in June 
1943 and are age 70-1/2 as of year-end 2013. Further, assume that the account 
balance in your traditional IRA was $500,000 as of year-end 2012. (Remember, 
you have to use the previous year’s account balance in computing the neces-
sary RMD.) Your RMD for 2013 is $18,248 ($500,000 divided by 27.4). You 
may delay this distribution until April 15, 2014, but doing so requires you to 
take two distributions for that year (one for 2013 and one for 2014). Next, in 
2014, you divide your year-end 2013 traditional IRA account balance by 26.5 
(because, by year-end 2014, you will have reached age 71). All things consid-
ered, you are probably better off from a tax standpoint if you take the first 
distribution in 2013 and the second in 2014. If you do not take any distribution 
or fail to take the correct amount of RMD, the IRS will penalize you in the 
amount of 50 percent of the difference (that is, what you should have taken as 
an RMD and the amount of distribution you actually made).
The Uniform Lifetime Table is used for all situations and individuals with one 
exception: if you are married and your spouse or beneficiary is more than ten 
years younger than you, a different table is used. This second table, known as 
the Joint and Last Survivor Table, is based on the actual joint life expectancies 
of the respective spouses. Although the Joint and Last Survivor Table also 
reflects a divisor that begins when you turn age 70 and 6 months (or age 70 as 
shown on the table), the applicable divisor is a greater number, thus allowing 
for a smaller taxable RMD.
There are also post-death RMDs that must be made when a plan participant 
or IRA account owner (including a Roth IRA owner) dies before the entire 
account balance has been distributed. The application of these rules is based 
on, among other factors, the individual named as the designated beneficiary of 
the plan or IRA. If the spouse is named as the beneficiary, they are a favored 
subsequent owner and may therefore roll over the remaining account balance 
to their own IRA, free of income tax. It is important to note, however, that 
as of 2007, a non-spousal beneficiary of an employer-sponsored plan may also 
take advantage of the rollover provisions to an IRA. Accordingly, as a plan 
participant, if you name a child as the beneficiary of your Section 401(k) plan, 
they may now transfer the money accumulated in that account directly into 
a properly titled inherited IRA and stretch the distributions over their own 
lifetime. To title this IRA properly, it must read as follows: “John Doe IRA 
(deceased 00-00-07 or later) for the benefit of Mary Doe, adult daughter.”
Be careful. According to recently issued IRS notices, an employer-sponsored 
retirement plan does not have to allow a non-spouse beneficiary to make a 
direct transfer to an inherited IRA. Further, a non-spouse beneficiary who 
inherited funds from an employer-sponsored plan before 2006 cannot take 
advantage of the direct-rollover opportunity. If you inherit a retirement plan 

Plan Your Financial Future
239
account balance from someone other than your spouse, the first step is to 
check with the plan administrator to see if the plan has accorded you the 
opportunity of a direct rollover.
No Loopholes
You may wonder if there is a planning technique you can adopt to avoid 
making a taxable RMD from your employer-sponsored retirement plan or 
traditional IRA. In other words, as a higher-income retiree, you may not need 
the money and not want to pay taxes on the distribution. Unfortunately, there 
is no longer a planning technique that precludes the necessity of an RMD. One 
of the most popular alternative planning techniques to avoid making an RMD 
used to be as follows: in years when you did not wish to take an RMD, you 
transferred the previous year-end account balance from a traditional IRA to a 
Roth IRA before December 31 of the required distribution year. Then, after 
January 1 of the next year, you transferred (or recharacterized) the money 
back to the traditional IRA. Thus, the previous year’s traditional IRA account 
balance was zero, and no RMD was necessary for the distribution year.
Under current federal tax rules, however, this technique does not work. Rather, 
as the owner of a traditional IRA, you must make an adjustment to the previous 
year-end balance of the account to reflect the return of any recharacterized 
Roth IRA transfers. In other words, you must look back and add the money that 
you subsequently transferred to the Roth IRA to the traditional IRA account 
balance of zero. If you refuse to do so, the IRS will penalize you in the amount 
of 50 percent on any difference or shortfall. Bottom line: do not do this, or you 
will unnecessarily deplete your hard-earned accumulation of wealth.
IRA Rollovers and Conversions
A rollover is a direct or indirect income-tax-free transfer of all or part of the 
participant’s account balance from one employer-sponsored retirement plan, 
such as a Section 401(k), to another employer-sponsored plan or IRA. Thus, 
continued tax deferral of the plan assets and earnings is achieved, at least until 
the participant reaches age 70-1/2 and is required to start taking an RMD. 
An additional advantage of this planning technique is that, if you roll over the 
account balance to your IRA, you are still in control of the money and can 
direct your investment decisions yourself.
The mechanics of an IRA rollover are relatively simple: you take the money or 
distribution from your employer’s retirement plan and transfer it to a previ-
ously established or newly established IRA on your behalf. But these mechanics 
can be deceiving and troublesome if you do not properly transfer the money. 
For example, once you receive the distribution from the employer plan, 

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
240
you have only 60 days in which to roll over or deposit the funds into your 
IRA. If you exceed this time frame, you must pay income taxes on the amount 
that you failed to roll over. Further, if you have the distribution check made 
out in your name, under law, the employer must withhold 20 percent from 
the amount you are due. As such, you only net and roll over 80 percent of the 
total account balance to which you are entitled. You can get this 20 percent 
withholding tax back when you file your income-tax return the next year, but 
why wait? There is a better way.
To get around the 20 percent withholding tax, ask that your employer directly 
roll over the distribution to your new employer’s retirement plan (if the plan 
will accept the money) or your IRA. The easiest way to do this is to have your 
employer’s human resources department make the distribution check payable 
to the trustee of your new employer’s plan or the custodian of your IRA. 
In other words, have your employer cut the check on your behalf, otherwise 
known as an FBO check (FBO stands for “for the benefit of”). In this way, you 
avoid the application of the 20 percent withholding tax.
For example, assume that you are 45 and have recently changed jobs. You 
have an account balance of $200,000 in your previous employer’s Section 
401(k) plan and are entitled to a lump-sum distribution from the plan, because 
you have separated from service. To avoid the 20 percent withholding tax, 
you have two planning options:
If your new employer has a Section 401(k) plan that will 
• 
accept the $200,000 account balance, ask your previous 
employer to make the distribution check out to the new 
employer’s plan trustee on your behalf.
Roll over the distribution into your previously established 
• 
or newly established traditional IRA with a check made 
payable to the IRA custodian on your behalf.
In this example, assuming that you have both choices (a new 401(k) or a new 
IRA), which is preferable? This is a common question confronting many Section 
401(k) participants who either do not need the money from the 401(k) plan 
or wish to continue the tax deferral. Consider this: if you directly roll over 
the distribution to the new Section 401(k) and then subsequently leave your 
new employer when you reach age 55, you may take the total 401(k) balance 
without the imposition of the 10 percent premature-disposition penalty that 
otherwise applies to employer-sponsored retirement plans. Alternatively, this 
is not possible if you roll over the distribution to your own traditional IRA; in 
that case, you must generally wait until the year in which you reach age 59 
and 6 months to take the money without penalty. Furthermore, if you choose 
the new 401(k) plan option and like the investment choices offered to you 
under that plan, you may self-direct those investments and perhaps achieve a 
greater return than the IRA.

Plan Your Financial Future
241
Whatever choice you make, the younger you are at the time you receive the 
distribution, the more advantageous it is for you to roll over the money and 
continue the tax deferral.
IRA Conversions
Prior to 2010, it was the law that you could not convert your traditional 
IRA to a Roth IRA if your AGI exceeded $100,000 in the year of conversion. 
However, now there is no income limit, providing a potential planning oppor-
tunity for those who are willing to pay the income tax due on the proceeds 
at the time of conversion. There are two reasons for converting your IRA to 
a Roth IRA:
You believe you will be in a higher income tax bracket at 
• 
retirement than you are currently and will pay no subse-
quent tax when you distribute the account balance from 
the Roth IRA.
You plan to keep the converted assets in the Roth IRA for a 
• 
considerable period of time (more than five years) and will 
make up the dollars expended in payment of taxes due at 
the time of the conversion. To ensure that this will be ­the 
result, you should pay the up-front tax from assets other 
than those in the traditional IRA. Doing so will permit you 
to invest an even greater amount in the Roth IRA.
Converting your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA raises the possibility of a very 
intriguing—and potentially very profitable—income-tax strategy:
1.	 If you have not done so already, establish a nondeductible 
traditional IRA.
2.	 Make the maximum allowable annual contributions to this 
nondeductible IRA for as many years as possible before 
conversion.
3.	 Just prior to your planned retirement, convert the entire 
account to a Roth IRA.
What is the result? Well, remember that you have already paid taxes on the 
money that you have contributed to the nondeductible traditional IRA—in 
other words, you made those contributions with after-tax dollars. Therefore, 
the only tax you owe on the nondeductible account when you make the 
conversion to the Roth IRA is on the earnings generated from the nondeduct-
ible account. In return for this relatively small amount of income tax due, your 
new Roth IRA will grow income-tax-free forever. Although it does not get any 
better than this when it comes to accumulating and growing your personal 
wealth, there is one catch: you should have only one traditional IRA (deductible 

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
242
or nondeductible) at the time of conversion. If you have more than one IRA, 
the IRS will assume that the conversion is coming pro rata from each IRA, 
and thus you will owe more tax.
For example, assume that at the time you convert your nondeductible IRA 
to a Roth IRA in 2013, you also own a traditional deductible IRA. The non­
deductible IRA has an account balance of $50,000, and the deductible IRA has 
an account balance of $250,000. Further, assume that you have made after-tax 
contributions of $40,000 to the nondeductible IRA and must pay tax on $10,000 
of earnings ($50,000 less $40,000). Because the converted amounts will be 
distributed pro rata from both the deductible and nondeductible IRAs, you 
must treat a total of $300,000 ($250,000 plus $50,000) as potentially subject 
to tax. As a result, you owe taxes on $42,000, not just $10,000, in 2013. Note: 
The $42,000 is determined by multiplying the fraction of ($50,000 divided by 
$250,000) times $250,000—or $50,000—and subtracting the product of (0.20 
times $10,000)—or $2,000—from the $10,000 of earnings—or $8,000.
If you want to contribute to a nondeductible IRA, you are probably ineligible 
to take advantage of a deductible IRA in the first place due to AGI limitations 
and active-participation requirements. However, if you do have a traditional 
deductible IRA and participate in a Section 401(k) or other employer-
sponsored plan, ask your employer if you can do what is called a reverse 
rollover. That is, roll over your deductible IRA account balance to the Section 
401(k) plan, leaving you with only the one nondeductible IRA—and without 
the worry of the pro rata rule.
The Use of Annuities in Retirement Planning
According to the McKinsey Consumer Retirement Surveys, the proportion 
of US working-age adults who consider the lack of a guaranteed retirement 
income to be an extremely important risk increased from 28 percent in 2004 
to 61 percent in 2009. As such, immediate fixed or variable annuities with a 
lifetime GWB rider at the time of retirement have increased in importance. 
This reflects the primary advantage of using an annuity in retirement planning: 
annuities allow you to own a safe investment with a guaranteed lifetime income 
stream. In other words, as the annuitant, or person receiving the annuity 
payments, you cannot outlive your money.
Annuities offer other advantages in planning for the financial aspects of 
retirement:
If you purchase a deferred variable annuity, you have 
• 
the opportunity to grow your account balance through 
investment in mutual funds as part of the annuity’s sub-
accounts. It is also possible to purchase a GMIB rider 
with this form of annuity, ensuring a minimum amount of 
guaranteed investment return on your money.

Plan Your Financial Future
243
You can plan the timing of income receipt to take advan-
• 
tage of years when you are in a lower tax bracket.
If you have purchased a nonqualified annuity (one 
• 
­purchased with after-tax dollars), such as a nondeductible 
IRA, you only have to pay tax on the earnings accumu-
lated in the annuity at the time of distribution.
You never have to make required minimum distributions 
• 
from a nonqualified annuity and therefore can leave the 
entire account balance to your heirs at your death.
When should you consider purchasing an annuity as part of the lifetime 
wealth-accumulation and -distribution process? When you want

But as a general rule, you should not consider the purchase of a nonqualified 
annuity or any after-tax retirement-planning savings vehicle until after you have 
annually contributed all that you can on a pretax basis to your employer-
sponsored plan or deductible IRA.
How Much Should I Withdraw Annually 
During Retirement?
To steal the name of a popular game show from many years back, the $64,000 
question is, “How much should I withdraw annually during retirement?” Before 
you can answer, you need to ask three corollary questions:
1.	 Over what time frame should my retirement money be 
expected to last?
2.	 In what assets should I invest to have the least probability 
of outliving my retirement money?
3.	 Once I begin making withdrawals, what retirement 
­monies should I access first to most effectively minimize 
income tax due?

Chapter 16 | Planning for the Financial Aspects of Retirement
244
With respect to the first question, several academic studies have determined 
that a 4.5 percent annual withdrawal rate, adjusted for inflation each year, 
provides the greatest chance that a retiree will not outlive their money. 
Therefore, you should assume a retirement distribution period of approxi-
mately 30 years with a 4.5 percent after-inflation withdrawal rate. Specifically, 
studies have shown that you have only about a 10 percent chance of outliving 
your money over that period using the optimal 4.5 percent withdrawal rate.
The second question begs the issue of what you should invest in during your 
preretirement period to optimize your chances of not outliving your money. 
Empirically, it has been shown that a constant asset allocation of approximately 
60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds and cash or cash equivalents in your 
retirement savings portfolio affords you the greatest chance of not outliving 
your money. Specifically, I suggest that your retirement portfolio should consist 
of a 40 percent allocation to large capitalization, blended stocks, or mutual 
funds (blended means a combination of value and growth stocks), a 20 percent 
allocation to international stocks, a 20 percent allocation to intermediate-
term investment-grade bonds, and a 20 percent allocation to cash or cash 
equivalents.
Once you begin making annual retirement withdrawals, there is a basic rule 
of thumb for minimizing income tax on those withdrawals:
Withdraw money first from taxable accounts, thus 
• 
reducing your future tax bills as much as possible.
Next, withdraw funds from tax-deferred retirement 
• 
accounts, such as a traditional deductible IRA, where RMD 
requirements apply beginning at age 70 and 6 months.
Last, tap Roth IRA monies, because no taxes are paid on 
• 
qualified distributions made from those accounts.
To summarize the process of planning for your financial needs in retirement: 
keep a constant allocation of 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds and cash or 
cash equivalents in your portfolio, and withdraw only a real rate of 4.5 percent annu-
ally from a portfolio of taxable, tax-deferred, and Roth IRA accounts, in that order. 
If you follow this rule, you will have a very high probability (approximately  
90 percent) of not outliving the money you have saved for retirement.
Now let’s move on to other, non-financial aspects of planning for retirement, 
such as where you will live and what you will do to experience a prosperous 
retirement.

Planning for  
the Lifestyle 
Needs of 
Retirement
Now that you have decided how you will finance your retirement, you need 
to consider where you will live and what you will do during your retirement. 
For many retirees, the choice of where to live is actually fairly simple: they 
continue living in the home they purchased prior to retirement. But there are 
many choices to make regarding where you will live, including what type of 
facility you will live in, as discussed shortly. What you will do in your retire-
ment, however, is more complicated.
Many newly retired individuals, who worked for 35 to 40 years, need to find 
a new identity once they retire. This is not easy. While you are working and 
thinking about retiring, the first thing most casual acquaintances ask is what 
you will do when you stop working. Part of this chapter is dedicated to helping 
you answer that question once you are retired.

Housing Options for Retirees
There are at least ten housing options for the newly retired individual:
Single-family dwellings
• 
Town homes
• 
Condominiums
• 
Apartments
• 
Living with one or more of your children
• 
Independent-living communities
• 
Assisted-living communities
• 
Continuing-care retirement communities (CCRCs)
• 
Skilled nursing-care facilities
• 
Traditional nursing homes
• 
Recently, several more types of housing have been added to this list of options, 
including row homes and lofts, but these are likely to be of more interest to 
your children or younger generations.
Single-Family Dwellings
Many members of the baby boomer generation grew up with plentiful single-
family dwelling choices, many of which could be found in planned communi-
ties. As boomers have advanced in their careers, they have typically purchased 
larger and more expensive houses.
Upon retirement, at least some boomers—particularly those with children 
who are now independent—wish to downsize their homes, meaning they seek 
smaller and less expensive ones. Builders are well aware of this trend and are 
attempting to meet the lifestyle needs of retirees looking to downsize. This 
strategy may permit boomers and other newly retired individuals to access 
the equity in their homes, which are typically the single largest financial asset 
they own. If they are lucky enough to receive sufficient funds for this equity, 
boomers may even be able to pay off their mortgages, one of the financial keys 
to a prosperous retirement.
As a retiree, if you choose to remain in a single-family dwelling during retire-
ment, you should determine where you want to live. In addition to the choice 
of the subdivision or community where you will buy, you must also decide in 
which region of the country and state you would like to live. These decisions 
are often relatively easy to make, because retirees generally choose to live 
close to one or more of their children and grandchildren. You should also 

Plan Your Financial Future
247
consider the income-tax status of the state you choose. Some states, notably 
Florida, Texas, and Arizona, do not have state income taxes, which contributes 
to their allure as retirement havens. Others, including California and New 
York, are known for relatively high state income taxes. Still others, such as 
Colorado, provide partial exclusions for income derived from pensions. If the 
tax implications of where you live are important to you (remember, inflation 
and taxes are the two biggest threats to your accumulated wealth), you should 
consider carefully the state in which you will live during retirement.
If you wish to live in a single-family dwelling, even one you have downsized to, 
you should be aware that you will need to continue maintaining and improv-
ing that dwelling. As you advance in age, depending on your health, this may 
become a burden. If you are unable to maintain your home, you will have to 
call on your children for help (if they live close by) or pay someone to do  
certain necessary daily and weekly chores. The next two options—town 
homes and condominiums—may provide a resolution to this problem.
Town Homes
According to Webster’s dictionary, a town home is “usually a single-family 
dwelling of two or three stories that is connected to a similar house by a 
common sidewall, thus forming a continuous group.” The town-home owner 
also owns the land on which the town home sits. In essence, this means a pur-
chaser of a town home owns their own individual unit but may be surrounded 
on both sides or above and below by other owners.
Residing in a town home may not be how you envision retirement living, but if 
it is, be aware that, unlike with an apartment, you own rather than rent. If you 
have a mortgage on your town home, you are entitled to deduct the interest 
on that mortgage for tax purposes, just as a single-family dwelling owner can. 
Town-home owners also typically pay a monthly maintenance fee to a hom-
eowner’s association. The amount of this fee varies greatly, depending on the 
location and quality of the property, but it usually covers maintenance of the 
common areas of the development. A town home is appropriate for a retiree 
who does not want the burden of property maintenance and does not mind 
living closely with multiple neighbors.
Condominiums
Condominiums are much like town homes, with two significant differences: 
the owner owns not only their individual unit, but also an additional percent-
age of the surrounding property; and the condo unit may be on any floor, not 
just from the ground up. The condo owner does not own the ground on 
which the condo is located. Furthermore, because they own an additional per-
centage of the surrounding property of their condo, condo owners typically 
face more homeowner restrictions than do town-home owners.

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
248
As with town homes, condo owners have to pay a monthly maintenance fee, 
although this fee may cover more property-maintenance and -upkeep features. 
For example, balcony and patio repair may be covered by fee payments made by 
condo owners, whereas town-home owners may have to pay for these repairs 
themselves. As such, condos are best for retirees who want others to maintain 
the exterior of their property and reside and interact with other owners.
Apartments
Apartments may be thought of in several ways for retirees (for instance, retirees 
may reside in apartments in independent-living, assisted-living, or continuing-
care facilities), but the important feature to understand is that the apartment 
dweller rents rather than owns. As such, you are not entitled to favorable 
income-tax treatment, such as being able to deduct any portion of your rent as 
an itemized deduction. Most renters take advantage of the standard deduction 
and do not itemize their deductions when they file their tax returns.
Living with One or More of Your Children
For many retirees, living with one or more of their children is the least 
favorable of all the housing options. However, whether due to poor health 
or lack of funds, they often have no other choice. If you live with one or 
more of your children, try not to be a burden to them. Help out around the 
house and offer to pay your fair share of the rent or mortgage. If you are in 
poor health, make sure your child can adequately attend to your daily needs. 
If your son or daughter works, they may not be able to care for you, so you 
might want to consider investigating the option of adult day care.
Another frequently overlooked consequence of living with your child is that, 
if the child is married, their spouse must also approve of your residing in the 
house or apartment. Many marriages of adult children can be strained (some 
to the point of divorce) if the child and their spouse do not agree on how to 
take care of the parent.
Independent-Living Communities
Independent-living communities are designed for retirees who are fully capable 
of attending to their daily living needs without assistance. Usually, an inde-
pendent-living community is age-restricted and may even be gated or feature 
restricted entry. Sometimes, considerable amenities, such as the use of golf 
courses and tennis courts, may be offered in exchange for the payment of hom-
eowner’s fees by community residents. Homeowner’s fees also generally cover 
lawn service. Accommodations include single-family dwellings, town homes, 
and apartments.

Assisted-Living Communities
Assisted-living communities generally combine the attributes of independent-
living communities with limited nursing-home benefits. Assistance is provided 
for bathing, dressing, and other activities of daily living (ADLs). Assistance in 
administering medications to retirees or seniors is also typical. Lodging in such 
a community varies from small cottages or apartments to larger-scale housing.
An important point to understand if you or your parent moves into an assisted-
living community is that you are likely eligible to receive benefits under a 
long-term care insurance policy. Long-term care eligibility usually requires the 
inability to satisfy at least two of six ADLs. For example, not being able to 
dress or bathe yourself is typically enough to qualify for benefits, as is needing 
assistance with eating, transferring from a bed to a chair, and using the toilet. 
Medicaid assistance from the state may also be available if you qualify.
Continuing-Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs)
CCRCs combine the independent-living, assisted-living, and nursing-home 
approaches to retirement living in that they segregate retirees according to 
the level of care they require. Generally, there is a fairly hefty fee for entry 
into a CCRC. In addition, residents are expected to pay ongoing monthly 
maintenance fees, which vary in amount based on the level of care needed. 
Some CCRCs charge a fixed amount for maintenance rather than a varying 
fee, although you may be disadvantaged by this method if you require only 
independent living. The type of CCRC may be distinguished by whether any 
portion of the entry fee is refundable, as well as whether the monthly mainte-
nance fee is fixed or flexible.
CCRCs are becoming more popular, in part because the retiree does not have 
to move residences as their health deteriorates and they require more care. 
However, CCRCs are not available in all states and, if they are permitted, are 
usually lightly regulated. As with assisted-living coverage, individuals who need 
the assisted-living level of care or nursing-home care can access the benefits of a 
long-term care insurance policy, provided they meet the eligibility requirements 
of the policy (for example, the inability to perform two or more ADLs).
Skilled Nursing-Care Facilities
Skilled nursing-care facilities and nursing homes are sometimes thought of 
synonymously, but Medicare makes a differentiation between the two. Basically, 
a skilled nursing-care facility provides acute care, whereas nursing homes are 
designed to meet chronic care needs. Both skilled nursing-care facilities and 
nursing homes provide 24-hour assistance by a registered nurse or other 
medical professional. Keep in mind, though, that nursing-home care is more 

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
250
long-term in nature, and nursing-home residents typically do not require as 
much daily attention as those in need of skilled nursing care. Medicare pays a 
limited benefit for skilled nursing-care attention, but it does not cover nursing 
home or custodial care.
The requirements that must be met in order for Medicare Part A to cover 
skilled nursing-care facility expenses are as follows:
You must have been hospitalized for at least a three-day 
• 
period.
You must enter the facility within 30 days of hospital-
• 
ization at a physician’s direction. You do not need to go 
directly from the hospital to the facility to be covered by 
Medicare, but you do need to enter the facility within the 
30-day period.
You must be making improvement as certified by your 
• 
doctor or other medical specialist; in other words, if you 
are not making either mental or physical improvement 
during the period of Medicare coverage, payment of 
expenses will not be afforded (for example, payment of 
expenses for Alzheimer’s disease is not a qualifying condi-
tion, because mental deterioration is inevitable).
If you meet these three requirements, Medicare will pay for 100 percent of 
your expenses during your first 20 days of residence at a skilled nursing-care 
facility. After that, you are subject to a government-specified daily patient  
co-payment through day 100 of your stay. After you have received 100 days of 
skilled nursing-care benefits, Medicare Part A will no longer provide coverage 
in a given benefit period.
Nursing-Home Care
Traditional nursing-home care is continual or chronic in nature, which is one 
of the reasons it is referred to as custodial care, and you pay a sizable monthly 
fee for coverage. For example, as of 2013, the average monthly expense for 
nursing home care in a semi-private room is approximately $6,850 per month, 
or $82,200 per year. Depending on the state in which the nursing home is 
located, the monthly expense may be much higher.
There is no precise way to determine when you or your parent should enter a 
nursing home, but usually a logical progression occurs, wherein seniors move 
from independent living to assisted living to a nursing home. Adult children 
who have to make the decision to move their parent or parents into a nursing 
home typically experience a great deal of angst before and after the decision is 
made. Sometimes, if more than one child is involved in the discussion, there is 
disagreement with respect to the best time to take such a step. Furthermore, 

Plan Your Financial Future
251
if the senior is mentally competent, there may be troubling discussions with 
them before they enter the nursing home. The living-with-a-child option is 
frequently tried in the interim.
There are three ways to pay for nursing-home care, although impoverish-
ing yourself to achieve Medicaid coverage (the third way) is not much of an 
option. The other two ways are from your own savings—private pay—or via 
receipt of long-term care insurance benefits. You should be aware that, at 
$82,000 annually, it may not take you or your parent long to deplete all private 
savings and then have to turn to other alternatives, such as the children pay-
ing for the parent’s care out of their own pockets. If you do not want this to  
happen and you can qualify, buy a tax-qualified long-term care insurance policy 
or life insurance policy with a long-term care benefit rider.
Using Your Home to Fund Retirement:  
Reverse Mortgages
You are likely familiar with the terms mortgage and mortgage note, because 
you probably had to execute such a note to help finance the purchase of 
your house. You might also have mortgage insurance, which lenders generally 
require if you cannot make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the pur-
chase price of your home. Seniors may now have another option involving a 
mortgage note: a reverse mortgage, with the term reverse coming from the fact 
that instead of you paying the lender, the lender pays you.
A reverse mortgage is a means of accessing the equity in your home, and 
seniors are the most likely candidates for such mortgages, because they 
usually have considerable equity built up in their homes. With a reverse mort-
gage, the homeowner is able to remain in the home and usually receives a 
monthly payment from the lender based on a percentage of the principal 
due on the home. In some cases, this payment may take the form of a lump 
sum instead of a periodic monthly payment; but if the senior is looking for an 
income stream during retirement, a monthly payment is the preferred alterna-
tive. Under law, the minimum age to qualify for a reverse mortgage is 62, and 
the senior cannot take a mortgage for more than the home is worth at the 
time of the loan. If there is an existing mortgage on the home, it must first be 
paid off with the proceeds of the reverse mortgage.
Here is an example of how a reverse mortgage is structured and how you may 
be able to use it. Assume that you are at least age 62 and otherwise qualify for 
a $150,000 reverse mortgage (there are no income or health-status require-
ments with a reverse mortgage). You have an existing mortgage of $100,000 
on your house. You will have enough money from the reverse mortgage to 
both pay off your existing mortgage and benefit from $50,000 in cash to use in 

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
252
whatever manner you wish. A reverse mortgage is even more advantageous if 
you have no original mortgage, because then you have the full $150,000 avail-
able for your use.
If you do qualify, does this sound too good to be true? There are some facts to 
consider before entering into a reverse-mortgage arrangement:
No monthly payments are due on the mortgage while it 
• 
is outstanding. However, when you die or sell the house, 
the loan must be repaid. If you are married at the time of 
your death, the loan typically does not have to be repaid 
until the death of your surviving spouse, but it then must 
come out of the spouse’s estate, thereby reducing the 
amount that subsequently passes to your children or 
other heirs.
Like a home equity loan, you may receive the proceeds 
• 
from a reverse mortgage over a set term, in lifetime  
payout, or via a line of credit. If you take the proceeds in 
a line of credit, there is a growth feature built into most 
reverse mortgages that benefits you if your home appre-
ciates in value over the years (in other words, your pay-
ments from the reverse mortgage may increase).
In general, the amount of money you receive from a 
• 
reverse mortgage depends on your age. The older you 
are, the more money you will receive.
A reverse mortgage does 
• 
not affect your receipt of Social 
Security or Medicare benefits, and the payments are not tax-
able or considered taxable income (that is, the 50 percent 
or 85 percent special step-rate thresholds do not apply).
Because of the closing costs associated with a reverse 
• 
mortgage, you should not enter into the arrangement if 
you intend to sell your home within two to three years 
after you begin to receive the proceeds. You will not 
financially be able to recover the closing costs in such a 
short period of time.
This last point speaks to a very important consideration you should be 
aware of before executing a reverse mortgage: such mortgages are relatively 
expensive. There may be other, less expensive ways to access the equity in 
your home, such as a home equity loan or line of credit. These should be inves-
tigated before committing yourself to the drawbacks of a reverse mortgage.

Do I Need Life Insurance During Retirement?
Once you retire and your children become independent, you may wonder why 
you need life insurance. This is particularly the case if you are divorced or sepa-
rated from your spouse. If you are thinking about ditching your life insurance 
policy, though, you may need to think again, particularly if you have a high net 
worth (say, $5 million or more) and are involved in estate-planning and estate 
tax–reduction techniques. After all, life insurance remains a very effective way 
to pay both any estate taxes you may owe at death and the final expenses 
associated with settling your estate, because it is purchased with considerably 
discounted dollars from what your estate will receive in death benefits.
For example, assume that you purchase a $250,000 annual renewable-term life 
insurance policy and die during the term of the policy’s coverage. Depending 
on a number of factors, including your age and health at the time of purchase, 
the premiums you paid for coverage may be extremely low. If you assume a 
total premium payment at your time of death of $25,000, your estate receives 
a discounted dollar benefit of $225,000 ($250,000 less $25,000). In addition, 
your heirs receive a total dollar, income-tax-free benefit of $250,000 upon 
receipt of the life insurance proceeds.
Be careful here. If you do not title or arrange for the purchase of the $250,000 
term life insurance policy properly, the death proceeds from the policy will 
be included in your gross estate for estate-tax purposes, thus adding to your 
estate-tax problems. The simple way around this, of course, is to title the 
policy in your spouse’s or adult child’s name. But if you do this, you add to 
the spouse’s or child’s gross estate. Further, what if the new owner does not 
make the premium payments on the policy? The policy will then lapse, and 
your intended beneficiaries will lose the insurance protection on your life. 
The better way to arrange for the titling of life insurance is to establish an 
irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT).
If you are married at the time you enter into retirement and are entitled to a 
pension, you have a different problem, commonly referred to as “the pension 
dilemma.” Specifically, under current law, if you are to receive a pension (not 
a lump-sum distribution from a Section 401(k) plan), you must provide for a 
survivorship payment on the pension to your spouse. When you do this, your 
own annuity or pension payment is reduced, which may potentially impact your 
future cash flow.
For example, assume you are 65, married, and entitled to a pension payment 
from your company’s pension (defined-benefit) plan of $2,000 per month, or 
$24,000 per year. This amount is payable to you in a single life annuity form, 
meaning when you die, the pension terminates, which also means your spouse 
must replace $24,000 of lost income. To avoid this possibility, you must elect—
unless your spouse elects to waive it—a joint and survivor payout so that your 
spouse is protected upon your death. However, because your pension payment 

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
254
must now be spread over two lives instead of one, it is reduced, sometimes 
by as much as 30 percent. Using the numbers in this example, this means your 
pension payment is now $16,800 ($24,000 times 0.70). Taken over a 25-year 
life expectancy, you sacrifice approximately $180,000 of lifetime benefits that 
may otherwise have been payable to you ($7,200 per year difference in pay-
ments times 25). Of course, the sacrificed benefit becomes even larger, the 
greater the pension payment is.
One option that allows you to retain those benefits is to have your spouse 
consent in writing (signed by a notary) that they waive the joint and survivor 
benefit. But if you proceed with this option, you are right back to where you 
started: leaving your spouse without loss-of-income protection at your death. 
Therein lies the pension dilemma. A preferable option is to elect the single 
life annuity from the pension and then purchase a life insurance policy for the 
amount of the sacrificed benefit if paid in the joint-and-survivor form (in the 
example, $180,000) and name your spouse as the policy beneficiary. Doing so 
has the advantage of partially converting potentially taxable pension benefits 
to your spouse to nontaxable insurance proceeds. In the financial world, this 
is known as the pension-maximization planning technique, founded on the idea 
that you use some of the additional pension payment you receive ($7,200 per 
year, in the example) to pay the premiums on the life insurance policy in order 
to keep the policy in force until the time of your death. Indeed, you can likely 
purchase much more coverage than $180,000 with a $7,200 annual premium. 
This technique works particularly well when the plan participant’s spouse is in 
poor health. In such instances, the cost for the amount of insurance needed to 
provide income for the poor-health spouse for their remaining life (assuming 
the plan participant predeceases the spouse) may often be less than the cost 
of providing the survivor benefit from the retirement plan.
Why doesn’t everyone entitled to a pension payment from an employer-
sponsored plan take advantage of the pension-maximization technique? A pri-
mary reason is that the 65-year-old, soon-to-be-retired individual may not be 
able to qualify for life insurance coverage because of poor health. Another is 
that life insurance is simply too expensive at that age. Finally, there is always 
the risk that premiums will not be paid and the insurance will not be there 
when needed. You need to look closely at a number of factors—including 
health, age, cost, and whether the pension payment is adjusted for cost of liv-
ing each year—and see if the pension-maximization technique is right for you. 
Hopefully, you will do this with the assistance of a competent financial advisor 
or life insurance agent.
Retiree Health Insurance
Health insurance coverage for retired individuals is becoming less common. 
Among businesses with 200 or more employees in 2012, approximately only 
25 percent of them provide retiree health insurance, according to US News 

Plan Your Financial Future
255
and World Report. The statistics are even worse among businesses with fewer 
than 200 employees. Studies have shown that no more than 5 percent of 
these small businesses can afford to offer retiree health insurance.
What should you do if you want to be insured against poor health during 
retirement? It depends on your age and whether you are working enough 
hours to be eligible for your employer’s group health insurance policy. Once 
you reach age 65, you probably will not be concerned about private health 
insurance coverage, because you will be eligible for Medicare. If you are newly 
retired but not yet 65, however, you do not have a great many options.
Your first option is to exercise your COBRA rights. Under the COBRA law of 
1985, once you leave your job—as long as you were not fired for gross miscon-
duct—you may remain on your previous employer’s group health insurance 
coverage for a period of up to 18 months. To do so, as noted in Chapter 5, 
you must pay your former employer’s share of the group premium as well as 
your own previous share. But you should not overlook the opportunity to 
take advantage of these rights if you retire before age 65. Alternatively, once 
you reach age 65 and qualify for Medicare, your younger spouse or dependent 
children may continue group coverage under the COBRA law for a period of 
up to 36 months.
A second option is to begin to fund a health savings account (HSA), which is 
established much like the traditional or Roth IRA forms of saving for retire-
ment but includes a high-deductible individual health insurance plan. You may 
make a tax-deductible annual cash contribution to your HSA and then use 
this contribution, plus its earnings, to reimburse yourself for medical expenses 
income-tax-free. Moreover, once you become eligible for Medicare, you may 
draw on your HSA funds tax-free to pay your share of monthly premiums for 
Medicare Part B and any other co-insurance you share with the government 
under the Medicare system.
A third option is to purchase an individual health insurance policy. Although 
such policies are relatively expensive, you can save money by being a prudent 
shopper of policies, remaining healthy, and taking advantage of certain tech-
niques. For example, if you are between ages 55 and 64, consider separating 
your coverage from that of your family at the time of application. Typically, 
individual health insurance is underwritten by companies according to the 
age of the oldest participant in the plan. Thus, if you have a younger spouse, 
you may be able to classify them for separate coverage under the plan and 
then combine their age with yours for a more favorable overall rating. You 
may also wish to consider titling the health insurance policy in the name of 
the younger spouse to ensure that they continue to have coverage once you 
become eligible for Medicare.
Another idea that is similar to paying premiums on individual health insurance 
coverage is to pay a monthly fee for service to a health maintenance organization. 

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
256
In return for the payment of this fee, you can receive the services of medical 
professionals for any medical condition that may present as you age. There 
will be some months (hopefully many months) when you do not need health-
care related services, but it is nice to know that treatment will be provided at 
little or no additional cost when you do need it.
If you find individual health insurance premiums or monthly service fees to be 
so high that they are prohibitive, investigate state-guaranteed policies. Typically, 
these types of policies are efforts by state governments to cover the unin-
sured or those who are so unhealthy that no insurance company will provide 
coverage. To become eligible for state risk pools, you must be rated as a high-
risk, unhealthy individual, and you must have been rejected by private insurers. 
If you can withstand the blow to your ego with respect to being classified in 
such a manner, you may be able to obtain relatively inexpensive coverage.
Medicare and Medicare Supplemental 
Insurance (Medigap)
Both Medicare and Medicare supplemental policies (Medigap) were discussed 
in Chapter 5 as part of the first step in the PADD approach to wealth accu-
mulation and management—protecting yourself, your family, and your property. 
However, you might find it helpful to be reminded of the considerable gaps in 
Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Once you become eligible for Medicare, 
you should purchase the standardized Medigap policy that is most relevant to 
your needs and health status at the time. I hope you have heeded the advice in 
this book with respect to your possible long-term health care needs and have 
been (or will be) paying the premiums on a long-term care insurance policy. 
Remember, neither Medicare nor private Medigap policies cover long-term 
care expenses, except in a limited manner, so it is up to you to provide for 
such coverage.
So, I am Retired! Now What?
You experience a significant life change when you retire, no matter your age. 
Among the issues you should consider when you retire is the need to establish 
a new identity, but there are also other lifestyle-related issues. Among these 
are the following:
Will you continue to work, even if it is only part-time?
• 
Do you plan to pursue educational opportunities that 
• 
you were too busy to consider while you were employed 
full-time?

Plan Your Financial Future
257
Do you plan to travel? What will you do for recreational 
• 
activities?
Perhaps most important, how do you accommodate the 
• 
change from employment to retirement?
Let’s consider these issues in more detail.
Future Work
In recent surveys, over 70 percent of baby boomers (individuals born between 
1946 and 1964) said that they planned to continue working in some capacity 
during retirement. This statistic may be somewhat misleading, because in many 
instances boomers will have to continue working due to poor savings habits 
and lack of planning, but there is no doubt that the members of this genera-
tion will be more active in their retirement than previous generations were. 
Employment of some kind, even if part-time, may be useful, because it eases the 
transition from a working career to the more leisurely time of retirement.
If you will continue to work once you are retired, you need to consider the 
impact of your earnings on your eligibility to receive Social Security benefits. 
For example, if you elect to receive Social Security retirement benefits early 
(beginning at age 62), be aware that an earnings limit applies until you are 65 
or until your otherwise specified full retirement age (FRA) under the Social 
Security system. If you are under your FRA throughout a given calendar year 
and earn more than a specified amount ($15,120 in 2013), then $1 of Social 
Security benefits is withheld for every $2 you earn in excess of this limita-
tion. Further, this earnings limit is separate and apart from any income-tax 
requirements to which you may be subject. In other words, between the age 
of 62 and your FRA, not only will your Social Security retirement benefits 
be reduced, but you will have to pay income taxes on those benefits if your 
income exceeds either of the special step-rate thresholds.
You should also consider the possibility of self-employment during retirement. 
As part of their desire to stay active, many boomers have started their own 
businesses. According to a recent survey by BusinessWeek magazine, boomers 
are twice as likely to pursue self-employment than the generations that retired 
before them. This is particularly true for boomers with professional skills, such 
as medical doctors, lawyers, accountants, and financial planners. Moreover,  
it is generally advantageous from an income-tax perspective to become self-
employed, because self-employed individuals usually are better able to benefit 
from certain tax deductions and credits than are salaried employees.
Keep in mind, however, that there are also many risks to self-employment, 
chief among them the willingness to assume the financial risk associated with 
becoming self-employed. Most businesses do not generate a profit until at 
least three years from when the business was started. In the meantime, these 

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
258
businesses must find a way to cover expenses during the years when a profit 
was not generated. Hence, many self-employed individuals seek financial assis-
tance from banks and other sources of capital to run the business in its for-
mative years. Typically, banks require a personal guarantee of repayment on 
any monies loaned. This often means that if you become self-employed and 
require the bank’s financial assistance, you must pledge personal assets, such 
as your house, as collateral for the loan. Venture capitalists—private money 
lenders—are even more demanding: they may require not only a personal 
guarantee, but also a percentage of the profits once the business becomes 
profitable.
Unless you consider yourself a risk-taker—the primary attribute of any entre-
preneur—you may wish to remain in the employ of a larger company. For 
instance, Walmart has become known for aggressively seeking senior workers, 
and other companies are quickly doing the same, given the wealth of experi-
ence that today’s retirees bring to any business.
Education
Under current tax law, a taxpayer’s unreimbursed educational expenses may 
be deducted as a miscellaneous itemized deduction if either
1.	 The education maintains or improves a skill required in 
the taxpayer’s employment or other trade or business
2.	 The education meets the explicit requirements of the tax-
payer’s employer, imposed as a condition of employment
Collectively, these requirements may be characterized as the business expense 
educational deduction. But this deduction is not available for educational 
expenses that are personal, which is likely the case if you are retired and not 
working for a firm or company.
What should you do, then, if you are retired and want to pursue a degree or 
return to the college coursework you always meant to finish? Normally, if you 
withdraw money from a traditional or Roth IRA before you reach the age of 
59-1/2, you pay a 10 percent early distribution penalty in addition to regular 
income tax (you would pay tax on the contributions and earnings from a tra-
ditional IRA, but probably only on the earnings from a Roth IRA). There is an 
exception to this penalty when you use the money in payment of qualified higher-
educational expenses, however. If you are a retiree under the age of 59-1/2, you 
can withdraw money from your traditional or Roth IRA if the expenses incurred 
are for the education of you, your spouse, your children, or your grandchildren 
and include only tuition, fees, and books used in a degree program. Meanwhile, if 
you are over age 59-1/2, you pay neither a penalty nor income tax on a qualified 
Roth IRA distribution made for purposes of education.

Plan Your Financial Future
259
A second suggestion is to do what increasing numbers of traditional col-
lege students are doing: request financial aid. There is no age maximum on 
financial-aid packages offered by schools or the government. As a result, if you 
can demonstrate a need for the money to attend school, just like your chil-
dren or grandchildren, you may be awarded financial aid. In addition, if you are 
attempting to fund your post-retirement education from your traditional IRA, 
the assets accumulated within that account are sheltered from the financial-
aid need analysis; in other words, they are not counted against you.
Finally, consider borrowing for your education from an employer-sponsored 
retirement plan, such as a Section 401(k). In practical effect, you are bor-
rowing from yourself to fund your education, but you are doing so at an 
extremely favorable interest rate—usually only a percentage point or two 
above the prime rate. The funds you borrow from a retirement plan are still 
tax-deferred and are not subject to income tax when you borrow them. Then, 
when you pay the funds back, they return to your retirement account, and all 
you have sacrificed in the meantime are any earnings that could have been 
made on the account if you had not taken the loan.
Travel and Recreation
As mentioned in Chapter 16, the standard rule of thumb in saving for retirement 
is to attempt to replace approximately 75 percent of your pre-retirement gross 
income for use during your retirement years. This amount comes from the 
presumptions that you will be saving less, paying a lower amount of taxes, and 
not commuting (or commuting very little) during retirement. But what if one 
of your retirement goals is to travel extensively or spend considerably on rec-
reational activities that you postponed while working? In this event, should you 
strive to replace more than 75 percent of your pre-retirement gross income?
Studies have shown that even with increased expenses for travel and recre-
ation, the most you should budget for your retirement is probably 90 percent 
of your pre-retirement gross income. Still, if your pre-retirement gross income 
averaged $100,000 per year, this means you need to save for an amount of 
$90,000 per year in today’s dollars (after accounting for the effects of infla-
tion). This is not an insignificant sum. Keep in mind, however, that travel and 
recreation do not usually add substantially to the total amount of retirement 
dollars needed. The expense that most retirees typically underestimate is the 
cost of health care during their retirement years.
Under federal tax law, there is a possibility that some of the travel costs 
you incur during retirement may be income-tax deductible. But these travel 
expenses must be primarily for and essential to medical care. Thus, a trip 
to an out-of-state specialty facility, such as the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or 
Sloan-Kettering Medical Center in New York City, may be deductible within 
limits. To remain within these limits, you cannot deduct meals on the trip, 

Chapter 17 | Planning for the Lifestyle Needs of Retirement 
260
and the deduction for lodging is restricted to an amount that is not lavish 
or extravagant. Even if you can pass these tests, though, you still may not be 
able to claim a deduction unless the aggregate total of your medical expenses 
exceeds 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI) after any health 
insurance reimbursements. (However, note that the 7.5 percent of AGI limita-
tion remains in effect for 2013 through 2016 for taxpayers age 65 and over 
as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.) As a 
result of these limitations, the chances are slim to none that you will receive a 
travel expense deduction in the pursuit of most noncatastrophic medical care. 
Similarly, some taxpayers have tried to deduct from their taxes the cost of liv-
ing in a warm locale during the winter after getting a note from their physician 
that it is advisable to do so for their good health. Nice try, but the US Supreme 
Court has ruled that such expenses are primarily personal and not medical, 
thus denying the claim for the average taxpayer.
Accommodating Change
For many retirees, the most difficult part of retirement is not what we have 
discussed so far, but rather the simple fact that their daily life has changed. 
For example, before retirement, when you got out of bed each morning, you 
had somewhere to go and something to do. This routine changes considerably 
when you retire.
Just as you need to prepare for the financial aspects of retirement, you also 
need to prepare for the lifestyle change that retirement brings. Many seminars 
and workshops are available to help you deal with retirement issues and life as 
a retiree, but the most important lifestyle challenge you will face at retirement 
is establishing a new purpose for your life. This may be as simple as being 
there for your children or grandchildren, or it may involve working part-time. 
Whatever you do, you should strive to maintain good physical health and keep 
mentally active. Keeping mentally active does not necessarily entail writing the 
next great American novel, but it does mean that exercising your mind is an 
integral part of a fulfilling retirement. Also, cultivate as many friendships as 
possible during your retirement years, because studies show that retirees are 
generally happier when surrounded by family and friends.
If you can accept change and, hopefully, thrive on it, you will probably find 
yourself among the 90 percent of Americans who say they are very pleased 
with their retirement and are very happy with the lifestyle decisions they have 
made while in it.
This chapter and the previous one have addressed what is likely everyone’s 
number-one financial goal: personal retirement. But as with life, the personal 
financial process is not so simple, because different people may have differ-
ent—or other—financial planning goals. Among these goals may be starting 
your own business, buying a second home, and eventually selling a substantially 
appreciated personal residence. These goals are the focus of the next chapter.

Planning for 
Other Lifetime 
Financial Goals
Although most people’s number-one financial goal is planning for a comfort-
able retirement, you may have other financial goals that you wish to include 
in your wealth-distribution process. Among these may be starting your own 
business (and perhaps subsequently selling that business), buying and selling 
a personal residence, purchasing a second or vacation home, or investing a 
windfall, such as lottery winnings or a substantial inheritance. This chapter 
considers all these goals in turn and, to the extent possible (you cannot really 
plan to win the lottery), discusses how to achieve their attainment.
Starting Your Own Business
The term entrepreneur is defined in Webster’s Dictionary as “someone who 
organizes, manages, and assumes the risk of a business.” Does that sound like 
something you would enjoy? If it does, you are not alone, because many individ-
uals of all ages (particularly baby boomers who are just beginning retirement) 
harbor the dream of starting their own business. However, according to the 
Small Business Administration, the sad fact is that approximately 56 percent 
of start-up businesses fail within five years. Another 33 percent fail within two 
years of beginning operation. Therefore, your business has an approximately 
40/60 chance of being successful.

Chapter 18 | Planning for Other Lifetime Financial Goals

Numerous books have been written on the subject of how to avoid becom-
ing a failed business owner. To summarize all these ideas, success in starting 
your own business comes down to the same initiative that applies throughout 
the financial-planning and wealth-management process: you have to plan to be 
successful.
The following are five commonly agreed-on steps you can use to help ensure 
your success when starting a business:
1.	 Begin a business in a trade, skill, or service that you know.
2.	 Write a business plan.
3.	 Consider your form of business operation. Do you wish 
to operate as a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, 
or limited liability company?
4.	 Recruit individuals to the business who possess strengths 
that are different from your own.
5.	 Give some up-front thought to how you will pass on the 
business to others—usually family members—if that is 
important to you.
Begin a Business with What You Already Know
According to a study by the Kaufmann Foundation, a center for research and 
education for entrepreneurs, people ages 55 to 64 are more likely than those 
in any other age group to start their own business. In part, this is because 
these individuals are retiring or getting close to retiring from the workforce 
and are preparing for their retirement years. It is also because people of this 
age group have readily transferable skills that can help them start and grow 
their own business. For example, if you have worked for all or the majority 
of your career in product development, who knows more than you about 
that particular product and how it may be adapted to the broader consumer 
market? Alternatively, if you have worked in sales for the duration of your 
career, who knows better than you how to sell this or some other product? 
Meanwhile, if you are younger than 55, starting your own business may be 
more difficult, because you probably have not accumulated sufficient financial 
resources and expertise to do so.
Regardless of your specific area of expertise, all successful entrepreneurs 
share several common characteristics. Among these are a take-charge atti-
tude, organizational skills, and enormous self-confidence in their own abilities. 
In addition, for lack of a better description, entrepreneurs are skilled at think-
ing outside the box; that is, they are able to think creatively of other potential 
uses for a given product or service. Bill Gates, for instance, was told many 
times that consumers would have no need for personal computers (PCs), 

Plan Your Financial Future
263
yet he persisted in his vision that consumers would accept and subsequently 
demand access to this technology. In essence, what Bill Gates saw was not the 
physical box that was to become the PC, but rather what that box could do 
for people to make their lives easier. As such, he proved his ability to think 
outside the box and is among the richest men in the world because of it.
Write a Business Plan
A critical mistake that many young entrepreneurs make is failing to write a 
business plan before they open the doors of their new business. Just as it is 
troublesome to structure your personal finances without first having written 
a forward-looking budget, it is terribly difficult to operate a business profitably 
if you do not anticipate where that business is going—and what risks you have 
to assume to get it there.
Not only is a well-thought-out business plan key to operational success, but 
it is also an important document for raising business capital. It is very unlikely 
that you will be able to fully finance your start-up and its first few years of 
business operation out of your own pocket, particularly if you are young. 
Instead, you will probably have to seek capital from friends or family or—
more likely—a bank. And guess what? Most banks will not lend you the neces-
sary money before they have seen and analyzed your business plan. Similarly, if 
you seek financing from a venture capitalist or a private equity group of inves-
tors, they are exceedingly likely to ask you to prove to them in writing how 
you intend to grow the business and what untapped niche your product or 
service will fill in the marketplace. A business plan forces you to think about 
the answers to these questions.
The components of a business plan are up to you, but among the more com-
mon parts are the following:
A detailed description of your product or service
• 
A marketing plan and strategy
• 
The management team you plan to assemble
• 
Financial plans and projections
• 
Timelines for accomplishing certain metrics
• 
An analysis of the potential problems and risks you will 
• 
encounter when bringing your product or service to 
market, including a competitive SWOT (strengths, weak-
nesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis

Chapter 18 | Planning for Other Lifetime Financial Goals
264
Estimates of start-up costs and profit-and-loss projections for the next three 
to five years should also be included, as should a break-even financial analysis. 
Many websites and books are available to assist you in drafting and imple-
menting a business plan, so refer to them often and before you begin business 
operations.
After you take the time to write a thorough and complete business plan, you 
may decide that you don’t want to start the business after all. In that case, the 
business plan served its purpose: it convinced you that the time is not right to 
begin your business and that perhaps you should think again before pursuing 
your entrepreneurial dream.
Consider the Form of Business Operation
Often, business plans outline the form of operation that the business will 
take. This is particularly true if you plan to start the business with partners. 
Under law, if a business is to have two or more owners, it cannot take the 
form of a sole proprietorship (the most common form of business operation 
today). Instead, a multiple-owner business must be a partnership, a regular 
(also known as a C) corporation, an S corporation, or the increasingly popular 
limited liability company (LLC), which is now permitted in all 50 states. Note 
that most states do permit the formation of a one-member LLC in lieu of a 
sole proprietorship.
Commonly, any potential business owner should consider three primary for-
mational issues before beginning business operations:
The possibility of incurring personal liability for any busi-
• 
ness acts or operations
The ease of the business entity’s formation and its ability 
• 
to assist the owner in raising capital
The income tax consequences of operating the business 
• 
in a particular form
Briefly, the following three sections detail some concepts to think about with 
respect to each of these issues.
Possibility of Personal Liability
In both the regular and S corporation forms of doing business, as well as in 
the LLC form, the business owner’s liability is limited to the amount they 
have invested in the business. Conversely, in the sole-proprietorship and  
general-partnership forms of conducting business, the owner or partner 
retains unlimited personal liability for all acts of the business; in other words, 

Plan Your Financial Future
265
no distinction is made between the business entity and the business owner or 
owners. As a result, the business’s creditors (including the bank) may foreclose 
on the owner’s personal assets to satisfy any outstanding obligations.
It is possible in some states to operate your business like a sole proprietor-
ship but otherwise limit your personal liability. This may be done by structur-
ing a one-owner business as a single-member LLC. The LLC entity may be 
formed relatively easily by filing standard documents with your Secretary of 
State or other prescribed office and declaring that you wish to operate as a 
single-member LLC. Alternatively, a business attorney can advise you of the 
consequences of conducting your business in this form.
Ease of Formation and Ability to Raise Capital
The sole-proprietorship approach to conducting business is the easiest to 
form. No formal documents are required by the state, and you may simply 
hang out a sign and open your doors to business (although in some cases you 
may need a state license to conduct the business). However, the relative ease 
with which you can form a sole proprietorship should be balanced against the 
assumption of personal liability that is inherent in operating your business in 
this manner.
There is also no written agreement necessary to conduct your business as 
a general partnership. Nonetheless, it is generally prudent to spell out the 
obligations and capital contributions of each partner before the partnership 
begins operation. At some point in the future, the partnership may dissolve 
and dispose of partnership assets and obligations, and this process generally 
proceeds much more smoothly if the possibility was considered at the time of 
commencing business operations.
The regular and S corporation forms of doing business both require the fil-
ing of articles of incorporation with the state. Note that an S corporation is 
simply a regular corporation that has elected to be taxed as a partnership for 
income-tax reasons. If you plan to do business as a corporation, you need to 
seek the services of an attorney. Although it is possible to form a corpora-
tion or LLC on your own without legal assistance, consulting with an attorney 
before you do so is generally advisable.
With respect to raising capital for the business, there is one clear winner 
among the various forms of business operation: the regular or C corpora-
tion. That is because this type of corporation may issue both common and 
preferred stock shares and solicit financing from the public through the sale of 
such shares (an initial public offering [IPO]). Nonetheless, given the complex-
ity of forming a business as a regular or C corporation, not to mention the 
double taxation of corporate income, most start-up businesses shy away from 
corporate organization, at least initially.

Chapter 18 | Planning for Other Lifetime Financial Goals
266
Income Tax Consequences
Fortunately, all business entities, with the exception of the regular corporation, 
may be categorized as flow-through entities for income-tax purposes. This 
means all business income and losses are reported on the owner’s individual 
tax return—not through the filing of a separate tax return. Because most 
start-up businesses experience losses in their first few years of operation, the 
impact of added business income on your individual tax return probably will 
not be significant. But the attribution of tax losses that you can take as a busi-
ness owner on your tax return may assist greatly with your cash-flow needs. 
Remember, in many cases the cash flow of the business and of the business 
owner are one and the same. Unlike capital losses, which are restricted to no 
more than a $3,000 income-tax deduction in any one calendar year, ordinary 
businesses losses are fully deductible without limitation. As such, a loss may be 
incurred by the business in one year and offset against the business owner’s 
other taxable income in that same year.
For example, assume that you have elected to conduct business as a sole 
proprietorship and experience a business loss of $10,000 in your first year 
of operations (after considering any income you received from the business). 
You report all of this loss on Schedule C of IRS Form 1040 and offset any 
other non-business income by the $10,000 loss. You can do this regardless of 
whether you itemize your deductions for income-tax purposes.
The one exception to flow-through tax rules is the regular or C corpora-
tion form of doing business. If you conduct business this way, a separate tax 
return, with the application of a separate set of tax brackets, is required. As 
with individual tax rates and brackets, corporate tax rates are progressive in 
nature. As such, it is possible to have some corporate income taxed at a lower 
marginal tax rate than that of the corporation’s shareholders. Keep in mind, 
however, that this advantage is usually offset by the fact that corporate income 
is double taxed: once at the corporate entity level and again when it is paid 
out in the form of a dividend to shareholders. In addition, business losses may 
only be taken by the separate corporate taxable entity and may not be applied 
against the owner’s individual taxable income.
Recruit Individuals with Different Strengths
It is very unlikely that you (or any other potential business owner, for that 
matter) possess the myriad skills necessary to conduct and grow your busi-
ness in the way you anticipated when you first drafted your business plan.  
In reality, you probably need the services of others to ensure the success of 
your business. As such, you should try to recruit individuals to your business 
with strengths and skills that are different from your own, to fill any gaps that 
may arise as you develop and operate your business. For example, if you pos-
sess strengths in product development, you should hire someone with the 

Plan Your Financial Future
267
marketing skills to sell that product. If you can sell, you need to ensure that 
the product you are selling is of the utmost quality, so seek out someone who 
is skilled at product development.
Business Succession
It is estimated that 70 percent of family businesses do not survive the transi-
tion from the original founder or founders to a second generation of family 
members. Why? Because most business founders fail to plan for the succes-
sion of their business. Although the failure to plan for succession may be due 
in part to the founder’s temperament (for example, when the founder acts as 
if they are immortal and succession will never occur), perhaps the major rea-
son founders fail to plan for the succession of their business is that they just 
do not wish to talk about the possibility of their eventual death or disability.
One way to preemptively address the eventual succession of your business 
is to include provisions for possible successor owners in your business plan 
before you begin operations. Doing so has the advantage of forcing you to 
think about how you will pass on the business to others without the atten-
dant pressure of developing a formal estate plan. The most probable succes-
sor owner is a family member who either previously worked in the business 
or has indicated an interest in taking it over. But a trusted non-family-member 
employee with many years of experience in the business is also potentially a 
worthy successor.
Regardless, if you want the business to continue after your death or disability, 
you must develop a business-succession plan. This should be accomplished 
in as tax-efficient a manner as possible for the sake of the business seller 
(usually a senior family member) and the buyer (usually a junior or younger-
generation family member). Accountants and tax attorneys may provide an 
invaluable service in this regard and should be consulted as early as possible 
in the business-succession process.
Buying a Personal Residence
The tax implications of buying and selling a personal residence were addressed 
in Chapter 11. The discussion here focuses on saving enough money to buy 
a home (particularly a first home) and the types of mortgages available to 
finance such a large purchase. The actual cost of a home depends on local 
market conditions, but you should attempt to save at least 20 percent of  
the purchase price so as to avoid the additional cost of private mortgage 
insurance. Let’s consider an example.

Chapter 18 | Planning for Other Lifetime Financial Goals
268
Assume that you are considering the purchase of a starter home for $150,000. 
In this case, you should attempt to save at least $30,000 as a 20 percent down 
payment on the home. How long will it take you to accumulate $30,000? The 
answer depends on how much money you can save each month, as well as 
the rate of return you can earn on those savings. If you can put away $500 
per month and earn a 6 percent before-tax rate of return on those savings, 
you will have $30,000 after approximately 53 months of saving. However, if you  
can earn a 12 percent before-tax rate of return (in other words, double your 
rate of earnings), you will achieve $30,000 in savings six months earlier, after 
approximately 47 months. Of course, if you can save more than $500 per 
month, you can achieve the needed down payment even sooner. Keep in mind 
that there are mortgages that allow you to put down less than 20 percent  
of the home’s purchase price, but the conventional mortgage marketplace  
(at least until subprime mortgages were introduced) requires 20 percent as 
a minimum.
Just as with any other financial goal, to save the funds necessary to buy a home, 
you have to plan to do so. This goes back to the financial-planning funda-
mentals discussed in the first section of the book: you must establish a savings 
strategy and then implement it. If you need to prepare a budget to allow you to 
accumulate the necessary savings, then you should do so. You must have the 
discipline to save, or you will not accumulate wealth.
Mortgages
Historically, four primary types of mortgages have been offered to home- 
buyers, although recently a fifth—the interest-only mortgage—has been added 
to the mix. Each is discussed in turn in the following list, along with some fac-
tors to consider before choosing which is most appropriate for you. Keep in 
mind that regardless of which type of mortgage you choose, all demonstrate 
a primary advantage of investing in real estate: the use of borrowed money to 
leverage an investment and thereby achieve a greater return on your money.
• 
Conventional mortgage: This is a fixed-rate mortgage for 
the term of the loan—usually 15 or 30 years—that gives 
the borrower a guarantee that the interest rate will not 
increase. These types of mortgages are for individuals 
who have a stable cash flow and anticipate this stability to 
continue in future years.
• 
Adjustable rate mortgage (ARMs):  With this type of mort-
gage, the interest rate charged may change on a monthly 
or yearly basis according to some specified index or 
benchmark, such as the current yield on the ten-year US 
Treasury note. ARMs are for individuals who want lower 

Plan Your Financial Future
269
monthly payments and do not anticipate remaining in the 
home for a considerable period of time.
• 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage: The payment 
of this mortgage is guaranteed by the federal government 
and as such normally has a lower interest rate than a 
conventional mortgage. A low down payment is also a 
feature of the loan. FHA mortgages are usually available 
only to lower-income homeowners.
• 
Veterans Administration (VA) mortgage: This type of mort-
gage features the same federal guarantee of repayment as 
that for FHA mortgage but is for veterans of the armed 
services only. A feature of the loan is that no down payment 
is required.
• 
Interest-only mortgage: In this form of mortgage, the bor-
rower pays only the interest on the loan for a specified 
number of years. Little reduction of loan principal is pos-
sible, thereby effectively preventing the borrower from 
building much, if any, equity in the home. When executing 
an interest-only mortgage, the borrower is anticipating 
that the fair market value of the home will appreciate 
from the purchase price, allowing a payoff of the mort-
gage balance from any sale proceeds. By their very nature, 
interest-only mortgages should only be executed by  
relatively risk-aggressive individuals.
Purchasing and Using a Vacation Home
Purchasing a vacation home is a direct form of real-estate investment. Although 
sometimes a vacation or second home is rented out and generates rental 
income for the purchaser, more times than not such a home is purchased 
as a private getaway for the purchaser and their family. As a result, treating 
the home as an income-producing investment in lieu of an income stock or 
fixed-income bond portfolio probably is not foremost in the purchaser’s mind. 
Moreover, if the purchaser does rent out the vacation home for more than   
14 days per year, the IRS will tax it as a rental. This could push the purchaser into 
the next marginal income tax bracket, resulting in higher overall income taxes.
Presuming that you, as the purchaser, are buying a vacation home for your 
own private use or that of your family, you can use several techniques to 
take maximum advantage of the tax laws. The first, known colloquially as   
a like-kind exchange or Section 1031 exchange, may allow you to defer taxes on 
the gains realized from the sale of the vacation home. The second, known as   
a qualified personal residence trust (QPRT), is an estate- or transfer-tax 

Chapter 18 | Planning for Other Lifetime Financial Goals
270
planning technique that allows you, if certain conditions are met, to exclude the 
fair market value of the vacation home from taxation in your gross estate.
Like Kind Exchanges
Let’s first discuss like-kind exchanges. Under Section 1031 of the income tax 
code, it is possible to execute a nontaxable exchange of one investment 
property for another investment property. However, it is not possible to execute 
this same exchange if either property is held for personal use. As a result, if 
you plan to use your vacation home for more than 14 days during the year 
(which is likely, because you probably bought the home for personal use), you 
are definitely out of luck, because it will not qualify as a nontaxable or like-
kind exchange. Alternatively, assume that, for whatever reason, you plan to 
use your vacation home for only one week during the year. In this case, you 
could argue that the vacation home is strictly held as an investment property, 
and nontaxable exchange treatment should be possible. The key word here, 
though, is possible, because the law is unclear with respect to the taxable result 
of an exchange of vacation homes wherein each home is used by the owner 
for fewer than 14 days out of the year. This is certainly aggressive tax planning, 
but it may work if the facts are right.
Section 1031 nontaxable exchange treatment is much more clear-cut if you 
rent out your vacation home instead of owning it for personal use. In that 
case, assuming that you keep your personal use of the vacation home lim-
ited to 14 days or fewer during the year, it probably will qualify as a like-kind 
exchange, and any realized gain will be deferred. Remember, though, that the 
tradeoff for the deferral of gain is the annual reporting of all income from the 
home as a rental property.
QPRT
Now let’s move on to the second planning technique involving a vacation 
home: the QPRT. In a QPRT, the vacation home must definitely be used as a 
second personal residence. As such, you cannot rent out the vacation home 
for any period of time during the year. As a result, if you subsequently estab-
lish a QPRT and make the vacation home part of its corpus, you may poten-
tially exclude the fair market value of the home from your gross estate and 
avoid estate tax on that value.
The mechanics of the QPRT technique are as follows:
1.	 Establish a QPRT with the assistance of an estate-planning 
attorney.
2.	 Retitle the vacation home in the name of the trustee of 
the QPRT.

Plan Your Financial Future
271
3.	 Provide for your right to use the home for a period of 
years. Be careful: if you die during the period of time when 
you have the right to use the home, the value of the home 
at your death will be included and taxed as part of your 
gross estate.
4.	 Transfer the title to the home at the end of this period of 
reserved use to a separately named trust beneficiary or 
beneficiaries (typically, your adult child or children).
Note that it is also possible to stipulate that the trust beneficiary lease the 
vacation home back to you at the end of the reserved period. In this instance, 
although the value of the home will be excluded from your gross estate, the 
trust beneficiary will have to report taxable lease income. Nevertheless, you 
can further reduce your gross estate by the amount of the lease payments 
you are making. For example, assume that you are 65, are in a high marginal 
estate-tax bracket, and establish a QPRT, funding it with a vacation home as 
the corpus of the trust. You reserve the right to use the vacation home for 
a period of 15 years, or until you turn 80. If you die before age 80, the fair 
market value of the home is included in your gross estate. But if you survive 
the term of the trust, the value of the home is totally excluded from your gross 
estate. In addition, if you still wish to use the home, you can enter into an 
arm’s-length rental arrangement with a family member as the trust beneficiary 
when you turn 80.
Carefully consider the practical consequences of establishing a QPRT. If you 
establish the trust and do not outlive the trust term, you are in no worse tax-
able shape than you would be if you had done nothing. Therefore, for only the 
cost of establishing the trust, you can possibly enjoy a sizable potential estate 
tax savings. In addition, you have also defended your wealth from one of the 
often-cited primary threats to its distribution at your death: the imposition 
of taxes.
Investing a Windfall: So You Won the Lottery!
There are ways you could come into unexpected money or experience a 
windfall other than winning the lottery. Among these is the receipt of a sub-
stantial inheritance, the awarding of an unexpected bonus, or the settlement 
of a sizable lawsuit in your favor. Still, when most people hear the term windfall, 
they think of winning the lottery. What do you do after you learn that you 
hold the lucky winning numbers resulting from an investment of only a dollar 
or two?

Chapter 18 | Planning for Other Lifetime Financial Goals
272
The following are three commonsense tips to be used in managing  
unexpected wealth:
• 
Do not tell anyone—most of all, do not tell the media! 
This will allow you to make important financial decisions 
about how to invest the windfall without everyone telling 
you what you should do with the money. The obvious 
exception to this rule is that you do want to consult with 
financial and legal professionals about how best to invest 
the money.
• 
Decide how best to receive the money—that is, in a lump sum 
or over time. If you tend to be a spendthrift, structure the 
payment so it is received over time. Alternatively, if you 
consider yourself a pretty good investor and saver, you 
may wish to take the lump sum. Regardless, both forms 
of payment are immediately income-taxable, so you will 
receive a greatly reduced after-tax amount.
• 
Invest the money, at least for the time being, in a money 
market mutual fund or savings account that you can eas-
ily access without fear of losing any principal. This will 
enable you to meet with a financial expert with respect 
to how you should invest the money for both your short-
term and long-term needs. Further, it should help you 
avoid making any immediate bad investment decisions 
when your judgment may be clouded by the excitement 
of coming into so much money.
Remember a basic rule of debt management: pay off high-interest debt imme-
diately, such as credit card interest. With such a significant windfall of money, 
you should be able to get rid of your credit cards entirely and pay cash for all 
future expenses.
This chapter concludes the section of this book that discusses how to distrib-
ute your accumulated wealth during your lifetime. Of course, one inevitable 
event remains in anyone’s lifetime: their death. This brings us to the next sec-
tion of the book, which covers distributing your wealth at death, and the topic 
of estate planning.

Distributing 
Wealth at Death
VI
P A R T  

Estate Planning
We have now reached the last stage in a person’s financial life (and physical 
life, for that matter): death. In this chapter, we discuss how to distribute wealth 
to your spouse, family members, or other specified individuals or charities 
when you die. Estate planning and the distribution of an individual’s assets at 
death may best be thought of as the second component in the last step of the 
PADD process: distributing your lifetime accumulation of wealth at death so as 
to benefit others.
Most people think of estate planning as a lifetime mission to avoid the 
­possible imposition of sizable (some would say punitive) estate taxes, but 
estate planning is actually much more than that. More properly, the ­process 
can be described as the efficient distribution of an individual’s property to 
the ­person’s heirs in the proper amount at the proper time. The proper 
amount in this ­context means generally whatever distribution among your 
heirs is the most ­preferable; ­however, the term takes on special meaning for 
­high-net-worth ­individuals, who must distribute the assets of their estate in 
a ­transfer-tax-efficient ­manner. Meanwhile, the proper time is not only at the 
decedent’s death, but also when they are still alive. Lifetime gifting is a very 
prudent and effective way to distribute your wealth on a trial basis to see how 
your intended heirs manage and use the property you give them. If you do not 
like the way your intended beneficiaries are using the assets you have gifted 
them, in most cases you have the opportunity to amend your estate plan.
As a general rule, everyone should prepare certain estate-planning documents 
regardless of whether they believe they will owe any estate taxes at death. 
Among the estate-planning documents that almost all individuals should have 
are these:
A last will and testament
• 
A financial durable power of attorney
• 
A medical or health care durable power of attorney
•

Chapter 19 | Estate Planning
276
A declaration as to medical and surgical treatment  
• 
(commonly referred to as a living will)
A personal letter of instructions
• 
We begin our discussion of these documents specifically and the estate ­planning 
process generally with the last will and testament.
Do I Need a Will?
The short answer to the question of whether you need a will is yes. Regardless 
of your personal and financial circumstances, a last will and testament  
allows you to express how you wish your property to be distributed to your 
­beneficiaries when you die. The writing of a will also permits you to name 
an individual of your choosing to administer your estate at your death. If you 
do not do either of these things, your estate will probably be distributed not 
only how the state in which you reside when you die wants it to be but also 
by whom this state chooses to administer your estate. This process, known 
as intestate succession, can be summarized as the execution of the will 
that the state has already written for you. If you do not like the state’s will—
to the extent that you even know what that is—the private writing of a will 
to carry out your personal wishes in the manner you deem fit is a prudent 
­estate-planning technique.
The writing of a will is particularly critical for a young married couple with 
minor children, because a will is the only document that allows them the 
opportunity to name a guardian for their children. It is not necessary to name 
a guardian if one of the natural parents is still living when the other dies. But 
what about the unfortunate circumstance in which both natural parents die 
in a common disaster or accident? In that event, the court (known here as 
the probate court) names a guardian if a will is not in place. If either set of 
­grandparents of the minor children is alive, they may be a likely choice. But 
what if your parents (the children’s grandparents) are in poor health or do not 
reside close to you at your death? If this is the case, the court will probably 
look to a sibling to assume the guardianship role. If neither a grandparent nor 
a sibling (or any other family member) is close by or even exists, the court 
will look to a trusted friend or perhaps a foster family. Regardless, as a young 
married individual, if you do not wish for the court to decide the fate of your 
minor children, be proactive and write a will providing for a guardian.
Keep in mind, however, that parents must do more than just name a guardian 
for minor children in their will. Your parent or sibling may be able to assume 
the guardianship role for your minor children, but what if this individual is 
not very good at handling the money you leave them for the children’s care?  
If this is the case, you may wish to consider including a trust in your will for the 
­purposes of receiving and investing the money on behalf of the children for

later distribution. You need to name a trustee for this trust—but ­remember: 
the skills necessary to effectively perform the legal duty of a trustee are not 
the same as those of a guardian. In other words, the empathetic skills of a 
person suited to be a guardian and the financial skills most important for a 
trustee may not be present in the same person or family member. As such, 
you may wish to name a separate individual for each role. If you do, make sure 
these individuals can work together effectively. After all, you will not be there 
to serve as a go-between if your guardian and trustee do not get along, and 
your minor children may suffer the consequences.
If you do include a trust in your will for the benefit of your children (known 
in estate planning as a contingent trust, because it takes effect only on 
the contingency of the simultaneous death of both parents), you need to 
change all your beneficiary designations to include the name of the trustee.  
It is ­particularly important to name the trustee as the contingent or ­secondary 
beneficiary of a life insurance policy on your life; otherwise, the insurance 
company will need to obtain a probate court order allowing it to pay out the 
proceeds to the trustee. Moreover, under the laws of all states, a minor cannot 
take title to property in their own name. If you have left property to a minor 
child in your will and have not named a guardian, the court must appoint a 
guardian to receive the property on the child’s behalf. All things considered, 
it is much easier to complete the necessary components of estate planning 
while you are alive so as to avoid these consequences.
Given its importance, why do many individuals never write a will? For two 
primary reasons:
Writing a will reminds us of our own mortality, a topic 
• 
that many people do not wish to consider.
Many people believe the writing of a will is prohibitively 
• 
expensive.
With respect to overcoming the first objection, consider the situation in 
which you may leave your survivors if you do not write a will. More than likely, 
your survivors will want your passing to be as easy as possible on them—
and knowing that they have been provided for in your will give them great 
­comfort. Further, if you have gone so far as to establish a trust in your will, 
you may direct the disposition of your property at a time when you believe 
it will be most appropriate for your survivors. This is colloquially known as 
­speaking from the grave, and the more direction you give in your ­estate-planning 
­documents, the louder you speak.
The cost objection to writing a will is often resolved by investigating your 
alternatives. For example, most attorneys charge a flat fee for drafting a will, 
with this charge varying according to the amount of drafting that must be 
done. A simple will, or one that does not involve any estate-tax planning, 
may not cost more than several hundred dollars—or even less, if it is part 

Chapter 19 | Estate Planning
278
of a package of estate-planning documents drafted by the attorney. In addi-
tion, any number of websites now have standardized wills and other estate-
planning documents that you may wish to consider using. But you should use 
these resources only after you have spoken with a competent estate-planning 
­attorney in the state where the documents will be effective.
Leaving Property via Beneficiary Designations
It is possible to avoid the probate process and leave your property to others 
via beneficiary designations, such as those included with your life insurance 
policy, IRA, and retirement plan at work. Although many educated ­consumers 
are aware of this possibility, what about property for which a beneficiary 
­designation is not possible, such as your checking and savings accounts, 
­brokerage accounts, and articles of personal or real property? Unfortunately, 
each of these must be considered separately when it comes to distributing 
property to others.
Checking and savings accounts may only be left to others by a will (or your 
state’s laws of intestate succession). If you are married, you may wish to 
­consider titling these accounts in joint tenancy with right of survivorship to 
your spouse. If you title the accounts in such a manner, they will pass directly 
to the other named joint tenant, and not under a will, at your death. However,  
be aware that during your lifetime, each spouse owns 100 percent of the 
­monies in the accounts and can do with them as they wish—without the 
consent of the other spouse. If you are not married but nevertheless want a 
­second name on your checking and savings accounts, ask your bank to ­establish 
a joint account for convenience only (otherwise referred to as a convenience 
account). In most states, titling your accounts in this manner means the sec-
ond party to the account may withdraw monies from the checking or savings 
account—but only for the benefit of the primary joint tenant. At death, a con-
venience account may or may not be left to the second party without having 
to write a will, depending on the law of the particular state.
Brokerage accounts are usually easier to pass directly to others without ­writing 
a will. As mentioned in Chapter 14, if you are working with a ­stockbroker,  
ask them to title the brokerage account using a transfer-on-death (TOD) 
form. As with an IRA or retirement plan, you need only name a beneficiary 
for the account and fill out the requisite form for the broker or mutual fund 
family to honor the request. But be aware that if you have not completed a 
TOD form for your brokerage account during your lifetime, your will or state 
law will dictate its disposition at death. Note that a bank has a similar form, 
known as a payable-on-death (POD) form, to provide for the passing of bank 
accounts directly to a named beneficiary.

279
The disposition of personal property articles at death may not be of much 
concern to many decedents. This is because either they do not have ­significant 
articles of value or they simply wish to leave their personal property for ­others 
to sell or dispose of. However, if a particular piece of property is an antique 
or has been passed down through several generations of family members, you 
should attach to your will a “statement of personal property” memorandum 
to dictate the disposition of the item. All states provide for this statement. As 
long as the statement is incorporated by reference in your will, and as long 
as your will includes certain default provisions, you do not need to complete 
the statement at the time you execute your will. Rather, you may subsequently 
describe the articles you wish to leave to others and sign the statement at a 
later date. In other words, you have time to consider future circumstances in 
deciding how best to dispose of valuable items.
Finally, in most states, individually titled real property (such as your home) may 
be separately distributed via a beneficiary deed. The purpose of completing this 
deed is primarily to avoid the necessity of probating the real property or home 
at your death. As such, the proper completion of a beneficiary deed can be a 
substitute for the execution of a will in the disposition of such ­property. Keep in 
mind, however, that the state may or may not require the filing of the deed for it 
to be effective, so you should check your state laws after ­completing the deed.
Titling Property
We now move on to what is known as the poor man’s will in estate planning—
titling all or most of your property jointly so that it may pass to a beneficiary by 
operation of law in the state where you die. Proceeding in this manner means 
you may not have to write a will at all, although, as just discussed, you may wish 
to do so for other reasons. Keep in mind that although titling property jointly 
with another person is a simple and effective method of ­transferring your 
property at death, you may need to reconsider for estate-tax reasons. After 
all, leaving property via joint tenancy to a surviving tenant who already owns 
significant amounts of property in their own name may add to the survivor’s 
potential estate-tax liability.
For example, assume that you own property with a fair market value of  
$5 million jointly with another person at your death. Depending on when the 
survivor dies and the estate-tax exemption amounts at that time, the survivor 
may end up owing a sizable amount of estate tax if they already own $5 million 
of property in their own name prior to receiving your property. Note that this 
may be a concern for both spouses and non-spouses who are the surviving 
joint tenants of another person’s property.
If you do not believe you will have an estate-tax problem at your death, ­owning 
property jointly with another person may substitute for the ­beneficiary 
­designation that is possible with other assets. In this case, even if you do 

Chapter 19 | Estate Planning
280
write a will and leave your property to someone other than the surviving 
joint  tenant, the will provision is generally ignored and the property passes by 
operation of law to the surviving tenant.
Should I Avoid the Probate Process at Death?
As discussed in Chapter 14, the probate process can best be described as the 
act or process of proving the legal validity of a will. But this entails  numerous 
steps and court intervention, which may lead to both excessive cost and 
delay in distributing your property to heirs. For these reasons, among others, 
many decedents wish to avoid the process entirely. There are three primary 
methods by which individuals can avoid probate:
You may use a beneficiary designation whenever  possible 
• 
to leave specific property to a named individual or 
individuals.
You may title property with survivorship rights. In most 
• 
states, this means titling property jointly with another 
person; but even in community-property states, such as 
California and Texas, it is possible to elect rights of survivor-
ship with respect to property acquired during a marriage.
You may establish and transfer assets to a revocable living 
• 
trust.
Due to its popularity, the revocable living trust (RLT) deserves additional 
explanation. In order for the assets in an RLT to avoid probate, they must 
be transferred out of the individual names of the owners and retitled in the 
name of the trustee. It is possible, however, and very common, for the original   
owner to also name themself trustee of their RLT. To do so, the owner must 
simply prepare and file a quitclaim deed that transfers the title to the property 
from their individual name to their name as the trustee. For this to occur 
properly, a trust document must exist at the time the title is transferred.   
If no such document exists, the retitling from individual owner to trustee is 
not legally valid, and all relevant property must be probated.
Even if you write an RLT document, keep in mind that only the property that 
is actually retitled in the name of the trustee may avoid probate. Accordingly, 
many individuals couple the drafting of an RLT with a pour-over will, which is 
executed for the express purpose of transferring forgotten and after-acquired 
property into the RLT. In other words, the will “pours over” this property to 
the RLT at the decedent’s death and distributes it according to the terms of 
the trust. Because certain pieces of property are still owned by the decedent in 
their name at the moment of death, the property passing via the will is  subject 
to the probate process. Nonetheless, the fair market value of this property is 
typically so nominal that many state laws provide for an exemption.

281
We have now discussed the reasons for avoiding probate and the primary 
methods available to individuals who wish to do so. But this discussion begs the 
question: should you avoid the probate of assets at your death? After all, there 
are several advantages to probate. It provides a mechanism to clear title to the 
decedent’s property, and it also implements the provisions of the ­decedent’s 
will. Another frequently overlooked advantage of the probate ­process is that 
it protects the decedent from an untimely filing of claims by their lifetime 
creditors. For example, let’s say you own a small business and have many 
creditors at the time of your death. If your interest in the small ­business 
undergoes ­probate, the business creditors must file their claims against the 
estate within nine months of your death—or another ­specified period under 
state law—or they are forever barred. As such, should you ­anticipate the ­filing 
of some unknown creditor’s claim at your death, forcing these creditors 
into a ­time-specific period to make their intentions known is prudent estate 
planning.
Ultimately, the only person who can make a decision about whether you want 
your estate to avoid probate is you. You should recognize the advantages 
of having your property probated at death and keep in mind that probate’s 
frequently cited disadvantages—cost, the potential for delay, and the public 
nature of the process—may not be so important that you should skip the 
process altogether.
Estate Taxes
Estates taxes may be assessed at both the federal and state levels (for ­example, 
New York has an estate tax), but typically only the federal tax rates are of 
­concern to most decedents. Regardless, be aware that your state may have a 
lower exemption level than federal law for the taxation of gross estates, so you 
may end up owing estate tax at the state level even if you are not required 
to file a return or pay tax at the federal level. If federal or state estate taxes 
are likely to be due on either your or your spouse’s estate, you may want to 
include some tax-planning measures in your will or trust. The inclusion of 
these measures initially makes the writing of a will or trust more costly, but 
the planning will pay for itself many times over in estate taxes saved.
Estate taxes at the federal level are part of what is known as the unified transfer 
tax system. In practical effect, this means the tax rates and brackets are the 
same regardless of whether you make a lifetime gift of property to others or 
transfer this property to others at your death. Thus, operationally, any lifetime 
taxable gift you make reduces the amount of property you can leave to your 
heirs or beneficiaries at death.

Chapter 19 | Estate Planning
282
Assume, for example, that in 2013 you make a taxable gift of $1 million to some-
one other than your spouse (when an unlimited deduction applies). Although 
you pay no federal gift taxes—remember, an allowance of $5.25 million is 
­permitted before any gift tax is due—you have reduced your current ­aggregate 
$5.25 million estate-tax exemption to only $4.25 million. If you die with a 
­taxable estate (after adding back in the lifetime gift) of $5,250,001 in 2013, that 
$1 of additional property is taxed at a marginal tax rate of 40 percent.
Note that the reduction of your exemption for estate-tax purposes does not 
mean you should avoid lifetime gifting (in most instances, you should engage 
in as much lifetime gifting as possible). Rather, this means, first, that you should 
take advantage of the annual gift-tax exclusion ($14,000 per person in 2013), 
because this exclusion is applied before you begin to calculate tax liability on a 
taxable gift; and second, and perhaps even more important, you may be able to 
exclude the subsequent appreciation of gifted property from your estate. For 
instance, in the example, let’s say you do not die until 2015, and the property 
gifted in 2013 appreciates 50 percent over the course of those two years. 
Because you previously gifted the property, you will avoid estate taxes on 
$500,000 (or the 50 percent of appreciation).
Once your taxable estate has been computed upon your death, your ­executor 
may apply a specified amount of credit—known in estate-tax language as the 
unified credit—against your tentative estate tax due. As with income tax, a 
credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction against taxes, so what you should really 
be concerned about is the amount of that credit in the year of your death. In 
turn, that credit equates to an amount of property that may be transferred 
estate-tax-free to others at your death (hence the term exemption equivalent). 
For example, in 2013, the amount of allowable unified credit is $2,045,800, 
which is equivalent to an exempted property amount of $5.25 million.
Let’s look at another example. Assume that you die with a taxable estate 
of $5.25 million in 2013 and have made no previous lifetime taxable gifts 
that operate to reduce this amount. The applicable unified transfer tax table 
indicates that the estate-tax liability on this $5.25 million of property is 
$2,045,800. Because you have an allowable credit equal to that same amount, 
you may reduce your tax liability by the allowable credit, resulting in an actual 
tax due of zero ($2,045,800 tentative tax liability less the $2,045,800 unified 
credit amount). When you hear estate planners say that you will not pay any 
estate taxes unless you die with property in excess of $5.25 million in 2013 
(or the otherwise applicable exemption equivalent for the year of your death), 
what they are really telling you is that you qualify for a unified credit that is 
equal to the estate tax due on $5.25 million.
The preceding discussion of the complexities of the estate-tax system should 
make clear that you need to understand how the federal estate-tax system 
works and what measures you may adopt to reduce the amount of your ­taxable 
estate at death. This is in part why you should contact a financial planner or

estate-planning attorney. Nevertheless, the more you can ­educate yourself 
with respect to the estate- and gift-tax laws, the better you will understand 
the planning techniques you may undertake to minimize those taxes.
Toward that end, examine the following two very important tables, which 
relate to estate-tax transfers and estate-tax planning. Table 19-1 reflects the 
tax brackets and marginal tax rates that apply to taxable transfers through 
2009–2013 and forward (for decedents who died in 2010, the estate tax was 
repealed, although an election could have been made by the decedent’s estate 
to pay the tax). Table 19-2 specifies the amount of applicable unified credit 
and exemption amounts for those same years.

The Importance of Durable Powers  
of Attorney
Although many people use the terms disability and incapacity interchangeably, 
they are not the same thing. In the context of understanding and applying 
powers of attorney, it is important to recognize that their use is only triggered 
in the event of legal incapacity (or incompetency). In other words, the individual 
granting the power of attorney may be physically disabled and still be legally 
competent to conduct their financial and health-related affairs.
Let’s review some of what we discussed in Chapter 14 in considering how to 
plan for your own physical or mental incapacity. First, there are two parties 
to a power of attorney: the principal, or the individual granting the power; and 
the agent (also known as the attorney-in-fact), or the individual responsible 
for carrying out the duties of the power. It is essential for the principal to be 
legally competent when granting power of attorney to the agent; if they are 
not, the power cannot be effective. Moreover, unless the power of attorney 
is specifically written to continue in the event of the principal’s incompetency 
(a durable power of attorney), the power of the agent to act on behalf of the 
principal will terminate on the date of the principal’s incompetency. In other 
words, a nondurable power of attorney is not effective just when it is needed 
most—on the date of the principal’s inability to act.
There are two types of powers of attorney. The first is used for the ­management 
of the principal’s property, including their financial accounts, subsequent to the 
principal’s incompetency. This is frequently referred to as a financial or general 
durable power of attorney (DPOA), because it covers a multitude of financial 
situations in which the agent may act on behalf of the principal. It is also 
­possible to limit the power of the agent to act through the writing of a special 
or limited DPOA.

A DPOA becomes effective in one of two instances: either immediately  
(at the time at which the principal grants powers to the agent) or in the future 
(when the principal becomes legally incompetent). If the power becomes 
effective immediately, it is referred to as a regular or non-springing DPOA. If the 
power does not become effective until the principal becomes incompetent, it is 
referred to as a springing DPOA. If the power is springing, there must be some 
method of determining when the principal has become legally ­incompetent. 
Normally, legal incompetence is determined by the mutual agreement of at 
least two physicians that the principal cannot act on their own behalf and 
needs the assistance of the agent. Because a principal may derive comfort 
from knowing that they have not relinquished immediate control over their 
property, many times they execute a springing DPOA. However, this concern 
is exaggerated in the majority of cases: typically the designated agent is a 
trusted family member and is exceedingly unlikely to act until it is clear that 
the principal cannot do so.
The second type of durable power of attorney provides for a surrogate or 
substitute to make decisions with respect to the principal’s health. This type 
of power commonly goes by the name of a medical durable or durable power 
of attorney for health care (DPOAHC), although it may have a different name in 
your state (for example, a medical proxy). In contrast to the general DPOA, the 
DPOAHC is always springing in effect. In other words, as long as the ­principal 
is able to give informed consent with respect to their own health care, the 
medical community will look to the principal to do so. It is only in the event 
that the principal is not able to give consent that the advice of the agent  
is sought.
The selection of an agent to make medical decisions on a principal’s behalf 
should be considered even more carefully than the selection of an agent of a 
DPOA. Although some individuals may not be overly concerned about their 
financial affairs or who takes over these responsibilities in the event of their 
incompetency, the same probably cannot be said when it comes to their health. 
It is essential that the principal give considerable thought to the individual 
whom they choose to make medical decisions on their behalf. Note, too, that 
the individual named as the power of attorney for a principal’s health need not 
be the same individual named to manage the principal’s money or property.
How should you proceed with planning for your own possible ­incompetency? 
Do you need one or both of these powers of attorney? Yes, and you ­preferably 
should draft both documents—even if you do not see the need for a ­separate 
last will and testament. Statistics show that your chances of becoming 
­incompetent at any given time are much greater than your chances of dying, 
so the importance of writing durable powers of attorney cannot be stressed 
enough. To assist you in the writing and implementation of these documents, 
samples of the general DPOA and DPOAHC are included in Appendixes C 
and D. Alternatively, you should seek out an estate-planning or elder-care law 
attorney to aid you in the drafting of these documents.

Chapter 19 | Estate Planning
286
Durable powers of attorney are a simple and, by and large, effective way to 
plan for incompetency, but their use presents several potential problems. First, 
if the powers are dated (say, more than three to five years old), the third party 
to whom the power is presented may not recognize their validity. Moreover, 
this third party (typically a financial institution) may ask the principal to 
­execute their own durable power of attorney form in order to protect itself 
from possible liability when honoring the power. This is particularly a concern 
if, between the time the original DPOA was written and the time the power 
is needed, the principal becomes incompetent. As a general rule, you should 
ask the third party how long it is likely to recognize the validity of a general 
DPOA before executing one.
The other problem with a DPOA, whether related to a principal’s finances 
or to their health care, is that, under law, the power terminates on the death 
of the principal. As a result, in cases where minor children depend on the 
­principal to act on their behalf, a DPOA could present a problem if the 
­principal dies. Fortunately, one of the advantages of writing a revocable living 
trust (RLT) as part of your estate-planning process is that doing so may serve 
as a very ­effective method of planning for your own incompetency. Specifically, 
in ­contrast to a DPOA or DPOAHC, the power of a successor trustee to 
act on behalf of the grantor of a RLT does not terminate on the death of the 
grantor. Instead, a successor trustee may continue to act without impunity. 
In some states, because of this feature, many financial institutions prefer to 
­recognize the legal validity of a RLT rather than that of a DPOA.
For example, assume that you granted a general DPOA on behalf of your 
oldest son ten years ago. Given the datedness of the general DPOA, some 
financial institutions may refuse to recognize its validity while you are still 
alive. Next, let’s say you become incompetent while the general DPOA is in 
effect. In this case, your son may not be able to act on your behalf as power 
of ­attorney. Finally, let’s say you die tomorrow. Upon your death, the power 
of your son to act on your behalf will be effectively terminated. All of these 
problems may be avoided if instead of, or in conjunction with, the DPOA, you 
execute a revocable living trust naming your son as the successor trustee.
Living Wills
Unlike a DPOAHC, which can take effect in a variety of medical situations,  
a living will takes effect only in the event of a terminal illness. In other words, you 
must be in a terminal condition and not expected to recover for a living will 
to go into effect. Due to recent medical advances, hospitals and other types of 
health care facilities can keep terminally ill patients alive for days or months by 
allowing a respirator to breathe for them or feeding them ­intravenously—or 
both. As a result, in most states, you are permitted to execute a living will that 

Plan Your Financial Future
287
directs health care facilities to act in one of three ways in the event that you 
become terminally ill:
The health care facility must maintain an artificial means 
• 
of life for you for an indeterminate amount of time.
The health care facility must immediately discontinue the 
• 
artificial means of life after you are pronounced terminal 
by two or more physicians.
The health care facility must maintain the artificial means 
• 
of life for a period of days—usually seven to ten—at your 
discretion.
Many individuals select the third option, but there is no proof that, after ­spending 
a certain number of days or weeks on life support, you will partially or fully 
recover. Usually the result is the opposite: if you have not ­recovered after a 
specified period of time, you are probably not going to recover. Unfortunately, 
this makes the execution of a living will that much more difficult, because most 
people do not wish to consider that they may find themselves in a terminal 
condition.
Unlike a DPOAHC, which names a substitute decision-maker with respect 
to health care matters, a living will is a personal directive from you to your 
physician specifying how you wish to be treated if you are terminally ill. As 
a matter of procedure, after executing a living will, you should give a copy to 
your family doctor and other physicians. Fortunately, the process of writing a 
living will is made easier by the publication in most states of a preprinted form 
that you can fill out prior to entering the hospital. Early completion of this 
form permits you to discuss with your physician the ramifications and possible 
unintended consequences of your decision.
Should you execute a living will? If you have not written a DPOAHC or 
­medical proxy, you should. If you have already written a DPOAHC, you should 
check to see if any living-will provisions are already included in that document. 
Some states permit an individual to dictate in a DPOAHC both living-will 
directions and to whom durable power of attorney for health care should 
be given. As a result, you need complete only one document, instead of two, 
to address any conceivable medical decision that may need to be made in 
the case of your incompetence. Keep in mind, though, that this course of 
action may make it more difficult for your physician to determine what type 
of medical ­treatment you would prefer to receive. Consequently, it is all the 
more important (whether you have both a living will and a DPOAHC or one 
all-inclusive document) that you also communicate orally to your spouse or 
other close family member what should happen in the event you suffer a 
­life-threatening condition.

Chapter 19 | Estate Planning
288
A sample copy of a living will—sometimes referred to by its proper name 
of Declaration as to Medical or Surgical Treatment—and a DPOAHC are 
included in Appendix D.
Personal Letter of Instructions
A final, often-overlooked document that you can use to aid in the distribution 
of your wealth upon your death is a personal letter of instructions. This letter 
is an informal writing from you to the executor of your will, reminding them 
to contact certain individuals and perform certain tasks in the event of your 
death. Such a letter often also includes directions as to where the executor 
may find the original copies of your last will and testament, information on 
any trusts you have executed, forms specifying powers of attorney, and living 
wills. The letter should also specify how you wish to have your body handled 
subsequent to your death, as well as any other special wishes, such as organ 
donation.
It is important to understand that you do not have to draft a personal letter 
of instructions in any particular form, nor do you need to consult an attorney 
to draw one up for you. Rather, the form of and the inclusions in the letter 
are limited only by your current and anticipated circumstances (and perhaps 
by your creative skills). A sample personal letter of instructions as used by an 
attorney in his financial- and estate-planning practice is included in Appendix E.
When Should I Change My Estate Plan?
You should periodically review your estate-planning documents to ­consider 
whether your objectives have changed. To conclude this chapter, the ­following 
are some important events that may cause you to consider changing your 
estate plan, amending your current will or trusts, or rewriting those ­documents 
entirely:
You have moved from one state to another. In this case, 
• 
it is good practice to have your will or any other estate-
planning document reviewed by an attorney who is 
licensed in your new state of residence.
You have had a significant change in family circumstances, 
• 
such as the birth of a new child or the death of a named 
or intended beneficiary to your estate.
The executor or guardian you have selected for your 
• 
estate can no longer serve.
r

Plan Your Financial Future
289
There has been a substantial change in the estate- or 
• 
gift-tax laws subsequent to the implementation of your 
estate plan.
You have come into a substantial inheritance (or another 
• 
significant change in the amount of property that may 
be taxed) after the writing of your estate-planning 
documents.
Any other important distribution or estate-planning 
• 
objective has changed since you first implemented  
your plan.
In amending your plan or documents, it is prudent to seek the assistance of  
a financial planner or estate-planning attorney or both.
Now let’s move on to techniques for engaging in philanthropy, which is a 
common estate-planning objective of many individuals, particularly those of 
high net worth. The topic of charities and charitable planning is so vast that it 
warrants a separate chapter. We look at the topic first from the standpoint of 
how to choose a charity to benefit from your largesse. Then we discuss how 
to best structure the gift or testamentary bequest to benefit that charity.

Philanthropy
We conclude our look at wealth accumulation and management by consider-
ing a common financial-planning goal of many individuals, particularly married 
couples without children or those who are unmarried: benefitting, either at 
death or during their lifetime, the charity of their choice.
Before we begin this important discussion, allow me a note of caution: most 
taxpayers are aware that the government offers taxpayers an income-tax 
deduction for charitable gifts made during their lifetime. Although taking 
advantage of this deduction is a valuable tax-avoidance technique, you should 
not let your desire to reduce your taxes outweigh practical cash-flow man-
agement. In other words, just because the charitable income-tax deduction is 
permitted does not mean you should make a transfer to charity if this transfer 
will jeopardize your ability to maintain your standard of living. Your analysis 
should be quite the contrary: if you cannot afford to make a gift to charity dur-
ing any given year, do not make such a gift. Furthermore, although you might 
consider it unfair tax policy, it is the law that you must be able to itemize your 
income-tax deductions before deducting any contributions to charity. If you 
are unable to itemize your deductions (as is the case for many individuals, 
unless you have a mortgage on your house), then you must take only internal 
satisfaction in giving to the charity of your choice.
Choosing a Charity to Benefit
For income-tax purposes, there are two types of qualifying charitable organi-
zations: a public (also known as a 50 percent) charity and a private (also known 
as a 30 percent) charity. Each of these charities gets its percentage name from 
the respective maximum limitation that you, as the donor, may deduct as a 
percentage of your adjusted gross income (AGI) in the year when you make 
a charitable contribution. For example, assume that you have decided that 
during the current tax year, you wish to make a sizable gift of $50,000 to the 
20
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 20 | Philanthropy
292
American Red Cross to benefit the victims of recent hurricanes. However, 
your AGI for this year as reported on your IRS Form 1040 is only $80,000. 
Thus, you are limited to an allowable itemized deduction of only $40,000 for 
this gift ($80,000 times 0.50) during this tax year. The remaining $10,000 must 
be carried over and deducted in a subsequent year, for up to a period of five 
years, when your AGI for that year is at least $20,000 ($20,000 times 0.50).
For transfer-tax purposes, on the other hand, there is no taxable difference 
with respect to which type of charity you benefit. Regardless of whether the 
charity is public or private, you receive an unlimited deduction equal to the 
amount of property that passes from you to the named charity at your death 
or during your lifetime. Keep in mind, though, that if you care to also benefit 
a noncharitable beneficiary, such as yourself, before transferring the property 
to charity, you must do so through the use of a specific form under tax law. 
Otherwise, the transfer-tax charitable deduction will not be permitted.
For example, assume that you are interested in benefiting your alma mater 
with a charitable gift of income-producing property at your death. But dur-
ing your lifetime, you need the income from this property to maintain your 
current standard of living. Under current tax law, you must structure this 
split-interest transfer in one of only a few allowable ways, including a private 
transfer in trust (commonly known as a charitable remainder trust) or via a fund 
that has been previously established by your alma mater (commonly known 
as a pooled income fund).
Public Charities
A public charity is one that receives broad public support and is not estab-
lished by a private individual. Examples of public charities are the American 
Red Cross, the United Way, the Salvation Army, and the American Heart 
Association. Public charities can also include local churches, as well as hos-
pitals operated by a religious order or municipality that are not-for-profit for 
income-tax purposes. In addition, educational institutions are public charities—
and they need not serve a particular demographic to be considered as such. 
Given the amount of tuition and fees that many of us pay for higher education, 
you may not immediately think of your alma mater as a qualifying charitable 
institution, but that is indeed the case. It makes no difference whether the col-
lege or university is publicly supported or privately operated; the educational 
institution to which contributions are made is considered a public charity.
All public charities afford the donor an income-tax deduction of up to 50 percent 
of your AGI in any one tax year. However, depending on the type of property 
given to the charity, this percentage amount may be further limited. For instance, 
if you make a gift of appreciated stock to a public charity, you may be limited to 
a deduction of no more than 30 percent of your AGI in the year of contribution. 

Plan Your Financial Future
293
The word may here is emphasized, because the actual deduction you can take 
depends on whether you ultimately choose to deduct the full fair market value of 
the stock or only your cost basis in the stock. There is a tradeoff: if you choose 
to deduct the full fair market value of the stock from your taxable income, you 
are limited to a deduction of 30 percent of your AGI in the year of contribution. 
Alternatively, if you choose to deduct only your cost basis in the stock, you may 
deduct up to 50 percent of your AGI (depending on whether this basis equals 
50 percent of your AGI for that year).
For example, assume that you previously paid $40,000 for 500 shares of XYZ 
stock. The value of these shares has appreciated to $50,000, giving you a 
potential capital gain of $10,000. You wish to give the shares to the Salvation 
Army in a year in which your AGI is $90,000. You have two choices:
You can subsequently deduct the appreciated fair mar-
• 
ket value of the shares ($50,000) and deduct $27,000 
($90,000 times 0.30) in the year of contribution. You can 
then carry over the remaining $23,000 of allowable chari-
table deduction ($50,000 less $27,000) to a period not 
exceeding five years from the date of the contribution.
You can deduct your cost basis of $40,000 in the shares 
• 
in the year of contribution. This amount is less than 50 
percent of your AGI ($90,000), so the full $40,000 deduc-
tion is permitted. But if you make this choice, you are 
not permitted to deduct any additional appreciation with 
respect to the shares or the remaining $10,000 ($50,000 
less $40,000).
In most instances, it is to your benefit to elect the first option, because you 
avoid the capital gains tax that would be imposed on you if you sold the appre-
ciated stock rather than gifting it to charity. An exception to this basic rule, 
however, occurs when the gifted stock has not experienced much apprecia-
tion from the time you bought it until the time you donate it to charity. In such 
cases, the basis election is preferable for income-tax purposes.
There are also restrictions on the income-tax deduction you may take for any 
tangible personal property, such as a painting, once it is given to charity. These 
restrictions, known as use-related and use-unrelated income-tax rules, are based 
not only on the type of property given, but also on the use the charity makes of 
the property once it is received. According to these rules, if the charity’s use 
of the property matches that for which it was intended, the property can be 
considered use-related, and you may take a deduction for its full fair market 
value. Nevertheless, the 30 percent AGI limit applies in the year of contri-
bution unless the taxpayer elects to deduct only their basis in the donated 
property. On the other hand, if the charity does not use the property in the 
way it was intended, the property is considered use-unrelated, and the donor 

Chapter 20 | Philanthropy
294
is limited to a total charitable deduction of no more than the amount paid for 
the property. As a further limitation, if you are an artist and created a painting 
yourself before gifting it to charity, you are not permitted to take any income-
tax deduction whatsoever, save for the cost of the materials you expended to 
create it in the first place.
For example, assume that you, as a collector of fine art, gift to a local university 
a painting you purchased. Although the university has an art museum, it intends 
to show the donated painting in its administration building. As a result, the 
university is making use of the painting in a use-unrelated manner. Accordingly, 
as the donor, you are limited to a charitable deduction of no more than what 
you paid for the painting. Alternatively, if the university featured the painting 
in its art museum, you would be entitled to a charitable deduction for the 
current fair market value of the painting, because the university featured the 
painting in a use-related manner. Note that if you were the original painter of 
the painting, you would be entitled to a charitable deduction only for the cost 
of the materials you used to create the painting. This is the tax result regard-
less of the use the university made of the painting.
As the previous discussion makes clear, the tax rules with respect to charitable 
income-tax deductions are extremely complex. As a result, you should only 
make gifts to charity after consulting with a tax advisor or financial planner.
Private Charities
A private charity is best described as any charity that is not considered to 
qualify as a public charity. In actual practice, a private charity or private founda-
tion is any charity other than a church, an educational organization, a hospital, 
or a governmental unit. Examples of well-known private charities include the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Rockefeller 
Foundation.
The tax rules permitting an income-tax deduction for contributions to a pri-
vate charity are similar to those for contributions to public charities, except 
that the percentage limitations are even further restricted. For example, a gift 
of appreciated stock to a private foundation is subject to a deduction of only 
20 percent of a donor’s AGI in the year of contribution, as opposed to the 
30 percent deduction that donors to public charities are eligible to receive. 
This is also the case where a gift of use-related tangible personal property is 
made and the donor does not elect to claim only their basis in the property 
as the allowable total deduction. Meanwhile, a gift of cash to a private charity 
is restricted to a contribution-year deduction of only 30 percent of AGI, as 
opposed to the 50 percent deduction that applies to a public charity donee.
Table 20-1 documents the most important deduction limits with respect to 
gifts made to charity during the lifetime of a donor.

295
Substantiation Requirements
As a taxpayer, once you have determined what type of property to give to 
which form of charity and in what amount, you need to be concerned about 
proving what you gave or substantiating the amount to the IRS. The law used 
to be that the donor only had to obtain a written receipt from the charity if 
their cash gift exceeded $250 in the year of contribution. For gifts of tangible 
property, the donor did not need a qualified appraisal establishing the fair 
market value of the gift unless it was reasonably estimated that the property 
exceeded $5,000 in value.
These rules changed, however, beginning with charitable contributions made 
in 2007. Now, regardless of whether they constitute cash or property, all 
contributions of any amount that are made to a public or private charity 
must be substantiated. In practical terms, this means unless you can produce 
either a bank record or a written communication from the charity indicating 
the amount of the contribution, the date of the contribution, and the name of 
the charity, your charitable income-tax deduction may be disallowed. To date, 
it is a bit unclear how the IRS intends to enforce this rule. Nevertheless, at a 
minimum, offering-plate cash contributions to your local church, synagogue, 
or mosque may need to be re-thought, and you may need to ask your place of 
worship for a written receipt at the time you make the offering.
Gifts to Charity Using Trusts and Annuities
Gifts made to charity in qualifying split income form for income tax deduction 
purposes must generally be made either in the form of trust or in exchange 
for an annuity from the charitable institution. The following discussion pro-
vides the specifics for each form.

Charitable Trusts
There are two prevalent types of charitable trusts: the charitable lead trust 
(CLT) and the charitable remainder trust (CRT). A CLT makes pay-
ments of income interest to a charity during its term. Then, at the end of the 
trust’s term, the remainder of its assets are passed to a noncharitable ben-
eficiary in an attempt to zero out any estate taxes that may be due from the 
donor’s estate.
For example, assume that you have established a CLT as part of the provisions 
of your last will and testament. At death, you direct that $1 million be placed 
in this trust to benefit first the American Humane Society and subsequently 
your two adult children equally. From this bequest of $1 million, the Humane 
Society is to receive a payment of $80,000 for the next 20 years. Using a table 
to determine the present value of your total future bequest to the Humane 
Society, the executor of your estate determines that the estate is entitled to 
a charitable deduction of approximately $997,000. As a result, you have effec-
tively zeroed out the value of the subsequent transfer of the trust property 
to your two children, as well as any potential estate tax that may be assessed 
on this same transfer. In other words, your two children receive the trust 
property estate-tax-free.
The second (and more popular) type of charitable trust, is a CRT, which pays 
the donor (or another beneficiary) income during the donor’s lifetime and 
then, at the time of the donor’s death, transfers all remaining assets to the 
donor’s charity of choice. This type of trust comes in two basic forms: a CRT 
that provides a fixed annuity payment to you throughout your lifetime (other-
wise known as a charitable remainder annuity trust [CRAT]); and a CRT that 
provides a fixed percentage of the trust assets, as revalued annually, to you during 
your lifetime (otherwise known as a charitable remainder unitrust [CRUT]).
There are additional requirements for both CRATs and CRUTs to qualify for 
income-, gift-, and estate-tax deductions. But it is important to recognize that 
if you, as the donor, establish either trust during your lifetime, you are afforded 
two deductions: an income-tax charitable deduction during your lifetime for the 
present value of your future bequest to charity, and an unlimited estate-tax 
charitable deduction upon your death for when the gifted property eventually 
passes to charity. As such, if you intend to benefit a qualified charity at your 
death, you should likely establish a remainder trust now and take advantage of 
the double tax benefit for income- and estate-tax purposes.
Both CRATs and CRUTs are irrevocable trusts, but there are two basic differ-
ences between these two types of CRTs. First, whereas a CRAT’s fixed annuity 
payments may eventually cause your purchasing power to decline as inflation 
rises, a CRUT is capable of keeping pace with or exceeding the annual inflation 

Plan Your Financial Future
297
rate. Because the CRUT guidelines include an annual income payment based 
on a fixed percentage of trust assets, as revalued annually, you may be able 
to keep ahead of inflation and preserve the future purchasing power of your 
trust payments. Second, unlike a CRAT, where no additional contributions of 
property may be made once the trust has been established, a CRUT permits 
subsequent gifts of property.
Because both CRATs and CRUTs are customized, privately drafted docu-
ments, it is necessary to seek the assistance of a competent estate-planning 
attorney in drafting them. If you are worried about the out-of-pocket costs 
involved in the implementation of either document, you should ask the attor-
ney to estimate the amount of money you will save in income and estate taxes 
by forming a CRT. Then compare this figure on a present value basis to the 
attorney’s fee. In most instances, the present value of the tax savings will more 
than exceed the cost of establishing and maintaining the trust throughout 
your lifetime.
Charitable Gift Annuities
If you want to obtain the same benefits offered by a CRT without having to 
hire an attorney, you may want to consider purchasing a charitable gift annuity 
(CGA), which allows you to donate cash or property to a charity in exchange 
for the charity providing you with a lifetime stream of annual income. Like 
CRAT payments, CGA payments are often distributed in a predetermined, 
fixed amount and thus may cause your purchasing power to diminish as infla-
tion rises. However, it is possible for the charity to purchase a cost-of-living 
rider on the annuity so that your payments keep pace with inflation.
Be aware that, as with other charitable transfers, the transfer of assets in 
exchange for a CGA is irrevocable, meaning once you begin to receive ­benefits, 
there is no turning back. In addition, keep in mind that if you decide to ­purchase 
a CGA, you need to ensure that the present value of your annuity payments 
is less than the present value of the future property that will pass on to the 
qualified charity. If these amounts are equal, or if the present value of your 
annuity payments exceeds the present value of the future property that will 
pass on to charity, you are not entitled to a charitable income-tax deduction. 
For example, assume that the American Diabetes Association has purchased 
a CGA on your behalf, and you have determined that the present value of the 
annuity payments you receive from this CGA is $500,000. The present value of 
the future property you pass on to the American Diabetes Association must 
exceed $500,000. Otherwise, you are not entitled to a charitable income-tax 
deduction—even if you itemize your deductions.

Chapter 20 | Philanthropy

Hail, Hail to Your Dear Old Alma Mater
If neither CRTs nor CGAs interest you as vehicles to advance your philan-
thropic endeavors, you may want to consider contributing endowment funds 
to your alma mater through a pooled-income fund. Such a fund is created 
and maintained by a sponsoring educational institution, which then commin-
gles your contribution with those of other donors and invests the sum total 
on its own behalf. The investments made by the institution and fund manager 
cannot include tax-exempt securities, such as municipal bonds, but aside from 
this special provision, the pooled-income fund operates much like a standard 
mutual fund.
The mechanics of participating in a pooled-income fund are relatively simple. 
First, you are contacted by your alma mater’s planned-giving office, which 
explains to you the terms and restrictions of the fund. Next, you transfer 
property (usually cash) to the fund, which gives you an income interest in the 
fund for life, with the remainder interest in the cash or property passing to the 
educational institution. Your actual payment to the fund is determined by your 
pro rata share of the annual earnings generated by the fund manager. You are 
then entitled to a charitable income-tax deduction based on the annual return 
of the fund for your particular age and actuarial life expectancy.
For example, assume that you are 55 and transfer $100,000 in cash to your 
alma mater’s pooled-income fund. The fund, as managed by the university, gen-
erates an annual return of 6 percent. When consulting the applicable table, you 
find that approximately 33 percent of your original $100,000 transfer will pass 
to your alma mater upon your death. As such, you are entitled to a charitable 
income-tax deduction of $33,000 ($100,000 times 0.33). As long as your AGI 
in the year of contribution does not exceed $66,000 ($66,000 times 0.50), you 
are entitled to deduct your entire contribution. Note: If your AGI in the year of 
contribution is less than $66,000, you are entitled to carry over the difference 
and deduct it in the future, up to a maximum period of five years.
Private Foundations
A private foundation is usually established by an individual or family as either a 
not-for-profit organization (known as an operating foundation) or a charitable 
trust (known as a nonoperating foundation). An operating foundation uses the 
bulk of its income to actively run its own charitable functions, as in the mainte-
nance of a museum, library, or historical property. In contrast, a nonoperating 
foundation does not engage in or actively run any charitable activity directly, 
but rather only disburses funds to other charities for their own use.
Perhaps the best-known private foundation in existence today is the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation, a family foundation whose objective it is to 

Plan Your Financial Future
299
“bring innovations in health and learning to the global community.” More spe-
cifically, the foundation is dedicated to caring for individuals in Africa who 
have been afflicted with HIV or AIDS. Categorized as an operating founda-
tion, because the Gateses personally engage in and use their own money to 
further its charitable activities, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently 
attracted a pledge of $30 billion from mega-investor Warren Buffett to assist 
in its day-to-day operation and stated mission.
Typically, a private foundation is established by the pooling together of a prin-
cipal fund of money—commonly referred to as an endowment—that is subse-
quently invested. Only the investment income generated from the fund—and 
not the principal—is spent, either as disbursements to other charities or to 
service the charitable works of the foundation, leaving the principal to grow. 
The foundation must not pay dividends to its shareholders, although it may 
pay reasonable compensation for services rendered by its directors, officers, 
and employees. Under current law, after a certain period of time, the founda-
tion must make qualifying annual distributions totaling at least 5 percent of its 
net investment assets.
A major advantage of contributing to a private foundation is that the donor 
is entitled to an income-tax deduction in the year when the contribution is 
made. However, as with the charitable deduction income-tax limitations previ-
ously discussed, the donor’s tax deduction is generally limited to no more than 
30 percent of their AGI in the year of contribution. Additionally, the deduction 
for contributions of appreciated stock or any other type of long-term capital 
gain property is limited to the donor’s cost basis in the stock, which cannot 
exceed 20 percent of their AGI.
Wealthy donors are primarily interested in establishing private foundations 
because of the considerable flexibility that is afforded to them with respect 
to the management of the foundation’s investment funds. In other words, the 
donor of a private foundation may control the investment and distribution of 
the foundation’s assets, as well as train other family members to eventually 
manage the wealth that is accumulated in the foundation. The donor may also 
customize the investments of the foundation to meet any specific charitable 
objectives they believe are not being adequately addressed by other public or 
private charities.
Is the establishment of a private foundation right for you or your family? 
Unless you have substantial funds at your disposal to create and operate the 
foundation, it probably isn’t. But that does not mean you are precluded from 
making a contribution to such a foundation if you agree with its objectives. If 
you do decide to make a contribution to a private foundation that has been 
approved by the IRS as a qualified charity, you are entitled to a charitable 
income-tax deduction in the year of contribution—although in a somewhat 
reduced amount than that afforded by a contribution to a public charity.

Donor-Advised Funds
Another possible option to further the philanthropic goals of an individual 
or family is to establish a donor-advised fund (DAF), which is an arrangement 
whereby a donor makes a gift to a giving account that is managed by a com-
mercially available mutual fund. After contributing to a DAF, the donor can 
then make recommendations as to the fund’s future disbursements to any 
qualified public charity. Because the donor can only make recommendations, 
the sponsoring mutual fund is under no legal obligation to carry out or imple-
ment the donor’s requests. Nevertheless, most DAFs do implement their 
donor’s wishes.
DAFs have several benefits. First, they offer donors the opportunity to create 
a low-cost, flexible vehicle for charitable giving that is structured as an alter-
native to direct gifting or the creation of a private foundation. There are no 
setup costs to establish a DAF, and annual fees currently run at approximately 
0.60 percent for the DAF and an additional 1 percent or so for expenses asso-
ciated with the management of the mutual fund or funds. Additionally, unlike 
the minimum 5 percent disbursement requirement that is applied to private 
foundations, DAFs are not subject to mandatory distribution rules.
What about the tax benefits of establishing a DAF? First, because a DAF is 
technically an extension of a public charity, donors are eligible for the same 
maximum income-tax deduction they would receive were they to contribute 
to a 50 percent organization. Next, current tax law affords those who donate 
appreciated securities to a DAF an income-tax deduction for the full fair 
market value of the donation. In addition, by donating appreciated securities 
to a DAF and then advising the fund to make donations to several chari-
ties, donors may obtain tax advantages without the necessity of transferring 
these securities in kind to the recipient charities. Finally, donating to a DAF 
offers a way to avoid capital gains taxes that would otherwise be due on the 
appreciated securities if they were converted to cash before being gifted to 
a charity.
For example, assume that you are the owner of 1,000 shares of ABC stock, 
which has appreciated over the years from $20 per share to $100 per share. 
Further, assume that you are in the highest marginal income tax bracket of 
39.6 percent, which means your capital gains tax rate is 23.8 percent in 2013 
(including the 3.8 percent Obamacare surtax). You want to donate your 1,000 
shares of ABC stock to your public charity of choice, and because you are 
aware that the charity is likely to cash in those shares upon their receipt, you 
make the tax mistake of selling the securities yourself first and subsequently

gifting the cash to the charity. Your net cost in making this charitable gift is 
$79,440, which is computed as follows:
$100,000
Cost of donation
+ 
$  19,040
Capital gains tax due (($100,000 less $20,000) times 0.238)
$119,040
Total cost
− 
$  39,600
Income tax saved ($100,000 times 0.396)
$  79,440
Net cost of gift
Now, suppose that instead of making your charitable gift in this manner, you 
donate your 1,000 shares of ABC stock to a DAF. You then advise the DAF’s 
managing mutual fund to transfer the cash proceeds of the stock to your 
public charity of choice. Accordingly, your net cost in making this charitable 
gift, using the DAF as a tax-exempt intermediary, is only $60,400, which is 
computed as follows:
$100,000
Cost of donation/total cost (no capital gains tax due)
− 
$  39,600
Income tax saved ($100,000 times 0.396)
$  60,400
Net cost of gift
In other words, by avoiding the administrative and tax costs that you incur 
when making the gift of appreciated securities directly to your public charity 
of choice, you effectively save $19,040.
There is one final tax-planning principle you must keep in mind if you are 
planning to gift property to a qualified charity. If the property appreciates in 
value from the time you purchase it until the time you plan to gift it to charity, 
let the charity subsequently sell the property. If you proceed in this manner, 
no taxes of any kind will be due, because the charity is a tax-exempt entity. 
Alternatively, if the property depreciates in value from the time you purchase 
it until the time you plan to gift it to charity, you should sell the property 
before gifting it to charity. Doing so permits you to take advantage of the loss 
in property value on your income-tax return. If you do not claim the loss 
before gifting, the allowable loss is lost forever, because the tax-exempt chari-
table entity cannot take it either.
If you are interested in establishing a DAF, shop the idea around first. Different 
mutual funds charge different annual fees to operate, which reduces the 
amount of monies that can go to the charities you wish to benefit.
In summary, the following are the planning techniques you may wish to con-
sider in accomplishing your philanthropic objectives. In all cases, at least one 
tax deduction, and in some cases two or three (income, gift, and estate tax) 
deductions, may be permitted:
An outright or direct gift to charity
• 
A charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT)
• 
A charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT)
• 

Chapter 20 | Philanthropy

A charitable gift annuity (CGA)
• 
A pooled-income fund
• 
A private operating foundation
• 
A private non-operating foundation
• 
A donor-advised fund (DAF)

With this chapter, we have concluded our journey of planning for your finan-
cial future and, specifically, slowly and consistently becoming wealthy in that 
future. It is now time to summarize the PADD process and reap the rewards! 
That is the focus of the final chapter of this book.

Reaping  
the Rewards
This book has introduced you to a new method of ordering your financial life 
and planning for your financial future. It has also developed a novel definition 
of the term wealth—a definition that goes beyond the traditional meaning of 
accumulating enough financial riches to ensure that your current or desired 
standard of living is maintained throughout your working years and subse-
quent retirement.
How do you go about ensuring that you are wealthy in the fullest sense of the 
word? This book suggests that this sought-after status may be best achieved 
by following the PADD wealth-accumulation and -management strategy:
Protecting yourself, your family, and your property
• 
Accumulating wealth
• 
Defending your wealth
• 
Distributing your wealth during your lifetime and at death
• 
Broadly, this process may be thought of as following these financial-planning 
steps:
1.	 Insuring yourself, your family, and your property against 
the possibility of significant loss
2.	 Taking advantage of benefits that are offered by your 
employer
3.	 Investing in financial or real assets—or both
21
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 21 | Reaping the Rewards 
306
4.	 Minimizing the effects of inflation on your portfolio as 
much as possible
5.	 Practicing effective tax-planning and -management techniques
6.	 Preparing for your children’s higher education
7.	 Planning for your retirement years
8.	 Distributing your estate at death to your intended benefi-
ciaries in as transfer-tax-efficient a manner as possible
Maximizing the implementation of these steps is not easy. If it was, this book, 
and many others on the topic of effective personal financial planning, would 
not be necessary. However, it should be comforting to know that you are not 
alone in meeting this challenge. A number of professional advisors, among 
them Certified Financial Planners (CFPs), Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), 
securities and insurance professionals, and estate planning attorneys, stand 
ready to assist you in meeting your financial-planning and wealth-accumulation 
goals. Alternatively, if you believe you are skilled and disciplined enough to 
take on this challenge yourself, you should by all means do so.
Attending to your financial life and affairs is analogous to Scarlett O’Hara’s 
famous line in Gone with the Wind: “Oh, fiddle-dee-dee. I’ll think about it tomor-
row!” In other words, the longer you put off thinking about the financial plan-
ning process, the longer it will be before you become wealthy—and the sooner 
a financially challenging tomorrow will arrive. If this book has accomplished 
nothing else, I hope it has provided you with some basic principles and knowl-
edge with which you can begin to take control of your financial life. If you 
adopt the process described in its pages, you will reap the greatest reward 
of all: a financially worry-free and independent life that you can enjoy to the 
fullest with family and friends.
I wish you good planning.

Life-Sustaining Procedures
If at any time my attending physician and one other qualified physician certify 
in writing that:
I have an injury, a disease, or an illness which is not curable or reversible, and 
which, in their judgment is a terminal condition, and I have been unconscious, 
comatose, or otherwise incompetent so as to make or communicate respon-
sible decisions concerning my person, then I direct that, in accordance with 
_____(State of Domicile)_____ law, life-sustaining procedures shall be with-
drawn and withheld pursuant to the terms of this declaration. It is understood 
that life-sustaining procedures shall not include any medical procedure or 
intervention for nourishment considered necessary by the attending physician 
to provide comfort or alleviate pain.
Moreover, it is my request that the term “terminal condition” be interpreted to 
include a state of permanent unconsciousness (permanent vegetative state).
Artificial Nourishment
If the only procedure that I am being provided is artificial nourishment, I direct 
that artificial nourishment shall also be immediately discontinued when it is the 
only procedure being provided. Notwithstanding any direction with respect 
to the discontinuance of artificial nourishment, if my attending physician has 
determined that pain results from such discontinuance, such physician may 
order that artificial nourishment be provided to me, but only to the extent 
necessary to alleviate such pain.
Other Specific Requests:

Relation, if any:	             __________________
as my Agent to make health care and personal decisions for me if I become 
unable to make such decisions for myself, except to the extent I state otherwise 
in this document.
The term “health care” as used in this document includes all medical treat-
ment, the provision, withholding, or withdrawal of any health care medical 
procedure, including surgery, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or service to 
maintain, diagnose, treat, or provide for a patient’s physical or mental health or 
personal care, unless such authority is otherwise limited by this document.
Creation of Medical Durable Power of Attorney
By this document I also intend to create a Medical Durable Power of Attorney. 
This Durable Power of Attorney shall take effect only upon my inability to 
give informed consent, disability, incapacity, or incompetency, and shall continue 
during such inability to give informed consent, disability, incapacity, or incom-
petency. I have prepared this document while still legally competent and of 
sound mind. If these instructions create a conflict with the desires of my 
­relatives, with hospital policies, or with the principles of those providing care, 
I ask that my instructions prevail.
General Statement of Authority Granted
Subject to any limitations in this document, I grant to my Agent full power and 
authority to make health care decisions for me to the same extent that I could 
make such decisions for myself if I had the capacity to do so. This authority shall 
also include all acts related to my personal care and any residential placement 
and/or medical treatment. In making any decision, my Agent shall attempt to 
discuss the proposed decision with me to determine my desires if I am able 
to communicate in any way.

Appendix D | Declaration as to Medical or Surgical Treatment  
  and Medical Durable Power of Attorney
330
In exercising this authority, my Agent shall make health care decisions that 
are consistent with my desires as stated in this document or otherwise made

are not known to my Agent, then my Agent shall make the decision for me 
based upon what my Agent believes to be in my best interests.
Access to Medical Records
My Agent shall have complete access to my protected health information, as 
the personal representative of my estate, for all purposes under the HIPPA 
Act of 1996 (45 C.F.R. Sec. 164.502 (g) (1) and (2), and pursuant to _____
(Applicable State Law)_____ state law (State Statute _____(Applicable State 
Statute)_____). There is no limitation on the information I authorize to be 
disclosed and there is no limitation on the period of time for which information 
may be requested or disclosed.
Advance Medical Directive
My Agent shall be permitted to execute an advance medical directive with 
respect to the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in 
accordance with the provisions of _____(Applicable State Statute)_____ if 
determining, after conferring with my attending physician, that a CPR directive 
is appropriate.
Autopsy, Anatomical Gifts, Disposition of Remains
I authorize my Agent, to the extent permitted by law, to make anatomical 
gifts of part or all of my body for medical purposes, authorize an autopsy, and 
direct the disposition of my remains.
Designation of Alternate Agent
If the person designated as my Agent is not available or unable to act, I desig-
nate the following person to serve as my Alternate Agent to make health care 
decisions for me as authorized by this document.

for a court to appoint a Conservator for my estate, the same nomination and 
order as for Guardian is hereby made.
General Provisions
Hold Harmless and Third-Party Reliance
All persons, including attending physicians, or entities who in good faith 
endeavor to carry out the terms and provisions of this document shall not be 
liable to me, my estate, my heirs, or assigns for any damages or claims arising 
because of their action. However, if any person shall endeavor to ­challenge 
the authority of my agent in bad faith, or intentionally contradict any provision 
of this document, my estate shall not be liable and is not obligated to pay any 
fees or expenses arising out of the action or actions of my agent  acting on 
my behalf.

If any provision of this document is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not 
affect the other provisions, which can be given effect without the invalid provi-
sion, and to this end the directions in this document are severable.
Statement of Intentions
It is my intent that this document be legally binding and effective. If the law 
does not recognize this document as legally binding and effective, it is my intent 
that this document is taken as a formal statement of my desire concerning

American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012: An act signed into law by US 
President Barack Obama on January 2, 2013. The Act, resulting from so-called 
“Fiscal Cliff” legislation, allowed Bush-era tax rates to sunset after 2012 for 
individuals with an annual income over $400,000 and families with an annual 
income over $450,000. The Act also added a top marginal rate of 39.6%, pro-
vided for a permanent “patch” of the alternative minimum tax, revived many 
expired tax extenders, and provided for a maximum estate tax of 40 percent 
with a permanent $5.0 million (as indexed for inflation) transfer-tax exclusion.
annuity: An insurance product that features an equal stream of payments 
over the owner’s/annuitant’s lifetime. An important retirement-planning tech-
nique, because the product ensures against the risk of superannuation, or the 
risk of a retiree outliving their accumulated retirement monies.
asset  allocation: A method of allocating or dividing up an individu-
al’s ­collection of assets or portfolio among several asset classes, usually 
cash or cash equivalents, stocks, and bonds. Such allocations also include

staple of a properly prepared investment policy statement used by many 
financial advisors.
B
basis: An income-tax term meaning, first and foremost, the amount of money 
contributed by a taxpayer in the purchase of any real or financial asset. 
Sometimes alternatively referred to as an individual’s cost basis in property, it 
is used to determine the amount of taxable gain or loss in the sale of assets.
behavioral finance: A branch of finance that studies the interrelationship of 
psychology and investor behavior; an alternative to the traditional theory of

ior. An important precept of behavior finance is prospect theory, which essen-
tially posits that investors fear losses more than they value gains.
beneficiary: The individual named in a legal document, such as a trust, who 
benefits in the event of the writer’s or creator’s death.
bonds: A type of financial instrument commonly issued by corporations or 
governments to raise capital for needed projects or functions. Sometimes

debt obligation reaches maturity.
C
capital gain: An income-tax and financial term meaning the increase in value 
or appreciation of the asset from the date of purchase to the date of sale. 
If such assets are owned for a requisite period of time, currently more than 
one year from the date of purchase before they are sold, a favorable tax rate 
is awarded by the taxing authorities.
capitalization rate: A percentage rate or number applied to the future 
income from property (typically, real property) to determine its current 
value. For example, if the net operating income from an apartment complex 
is $500,000 and a capitalization rate of 20% is applied or divided into that 
income, the current value of the complex is estimated at $2,500,000.
cash value insurance: A type of life insurance that builds on the owner’s 
behalf a cash reserve that may be accessed by the owner during their lifetime. 
Common types of cash value insurance include whole life insurance, universal 
insurance, variable insurance, and variable universal life insurance.

erty left to a non-charitable beneficiary, usually the donor’s child or children.
charitable remainder trust (CRT): An irrevocable trust used in estate 
planning that is designed to provide either a fixed or variable income stream 
annually for a certain period of time to a non-charitable beneficiary (typically, 
the donor), with the remainder of the property left to a qualified charity.

by the government that provides data on the probability of an individual 
becoming disabled during their lifetime.
common law property system: One of two property law systems (the 
other being the community property system) that permits the titling of 
property individually, even in the event of marriage. Currently, this is the 
system of property law in 41 of the 50 states.
community property system: One of two property law systems (the 
other being the common law property system) that does not permit the 
titling of property individually while married; that is, any property acquired by 
either spouse during marriage generally belongs to “the community” and not 
the individual separately. Currently, this is the system of property law in 9 of 
the 50 states, most notably California and Texas.
contingent trust for minors: A trust created in each parent’s will specifying 
a trustee and provisions for the parent’s property in the event of the simulta-
neous death of the parents. It is important that the trustee work in concert 
with the parent’s named guardian for the sake of the children who benefit 
from the trust property.
correlation: A measure of the movement of two variables, such as financial 
assets, in relation to each other. For example, if one financial asset declines in 
value at the same time another increases in value, the assets are said to exhibit 
negative correlation. The use of correlation is a key factor in the proper 
diversification of a portfolio of assets.

Glossary

custodial account: A type of account, commonly used in planning for a 
child’s higher education, where monies are set aside on behalf of a minor 
child but are managed by the child’s parent or custodian. Such accounts are

(UGMA) account or a Unified Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) account.
D

that guarantees a specified benefit amount or level at the date of the 
participant’s retirement; commonly offered only by large corporations and 
government entities.
defined-contribution retirement plan: A tax-qualified employer profit-
sharing (or other type of) plan that establishes an individual account for each 
plan participant. Plan benefits consist of the amount accumulated in each

ment. The most common and popular type of defined contribution plan is a 
Section 401(k) retirement plan.
dependent care credit: An income tax credit or dollar-for-dollar reduction 
against a taxpayer’s income-tax liability because the taxpayer has incurred child-
care expenses for a child under the age of 13. The maximum amount of credit 
is determined by tax law on a sliding-credit basis, with the maximum capped 
under law, regardless of the number of children receiving dependent care.
disclaimer trust: A type of trust used in estate planning that allows 
individual(s) to benefit from property that is otherwise refused or disclaimed 
by the named beneficiary or heir.

or author’s legal incapacity or inability to act; currently permitted by all 50 states  
in some form.
E

expected family contribution (EFC): The amount of money that a family 
is expected to contribute to pay for a child’s higher education as determined 
by completing the Free Application for Student Financial Aid (FAFSA) form 
provided by the federal government.
F
401(k) plan: A type of tax-qualified profit sharing plan that provides for 
before-tax salary-reduction contributions to be made by the employee. Such 
plans must not only be generally nondiscriminatory (all eligible employees must 
be permitted to participate), but also must meet special nondiscrimination 
rules if the employer matches employee contributions with additional monies.
family foundation: A type of private charitable foundation that is funded 
primarily by one family. Such foundations may be either operating or nonop-
erating in nature. An operating family foundation uses the bulk of its income 
to actively run the daily operations of the fund, whereas a nonoperating family 
foundation only disburses monies to other charities for their own use.
flexible spending account (FSA): A type of “cafeteria plan”—a plan under 
which employees may choose between cash and nontaxable fringe benefits—
that is funded through salary reductions elected by employees each year. 
Among other provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
of 2010, employee salary reductions used to provide for health-care reim-
bursement from an FSA are capped at $2,500 annually beginning in 2013 and 
indexed for inflation thereafter.
floater: An insurance term used to describe personal property that travels 
with the insured and remains insured wherever the insured is currently 
traveling. Commonly used in conjunction with the term personal articles and 
indicates insurance on property, such as jewelry or personal keepsakes.
G
grantor: The individual who creates or establishes a revocable or irrevocable 
trust. This term is also used in tax terminology to mean the possible individual 
who is taxed on income generated from trust property as determined under 
a series of rules collectively referred to as the grantor trust rules.
H
highly compensated employee (HCE): A specific definition of certain 
employees who are the focus of the nondiscrimination rules determining, in 
part, whether a retirement plan is “tax-qualified” or granted certain tax advantages. 

Glossary
342
Specifically, to be qualified for tax purposes, the plan cannot discriminate in 
favor of HCEs. An HCE is either an individual who owns a certain nominal 
percentage of the business (such as more than 5 percent) or an employee 
who makes in excess of a specified amount of annual salary.
I
immediate fixed annuity: A popular form of retirement product whereby 
the retiree turns over to the insurance company a lump sum of money in 
exchange for a fixed annuity payment that begins immediately (or, typically, 
within 30 days).
intestate succession: A series of state laws that specifies who inherits 
property at a decedent’s death when the decedent dies without having 
written a last will and testament.
irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT): A trust whereby the owner of 
a life insurance policy irrevocably relinquishes those ownership rights to a 
designated third party, the trustee of the trust. The death proceeds from the 
life insurance policy are removed from the owner’s gross estate, and a trustee 
is chosen who can provide needed liquidity to pay taxes and other expenses 
incurred in the administration of a decedent’s estate.
J
Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS): Also referred 
to as owning property jointly. A type of property ownership (most commonly 
found in common law property states) that is distinguished by automatic 
survivorship rights upon the death of the first joint tenant. The primary 
advantage of JTWROS property is that title passes automatically to the survivor 
without the necessity of the probate process.
L
Lloyds of London: A specialist insurance market, located in London, England, 
where syndicated members join together to insure risks. Most commonly 
known for insuring hard-to-insure or unique risks, such as Betty Grable’s legs 
or famous baseball pitchers’ throwing arms.
M
managed care health insurance plans: A type of health insurance plan 
noted for its emphasis on preventative medicine and characterized by such 

Plan Your Financial Future
343
features as a network of physicians and copayments by insureds. Examples 
of managed care plans are health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and 
preferred provider organizations (PPOs).
marginal income tax bracket: The rate on a specified amount of the 
taxpayer’s next dollar of income. Very important for income-tax planning 
purposes, because it affects tax decision-making.
master limited partnership (MLP): A type of limited partnership invest-
ment that is publicly traded (as contrasted to a private limited partnership, 
which is not publicly traded and does not have an active market if the owner 
wishes to sell their interest in the partnership).
mutual fund: More properly known as an open-ended investment company. 
A type of company that pools money from shareholders and invests in a 
variety of securities, including stocks, bonds, and money-market securities. 
Mutual funds generally continuously offer new shares to investors and redeem 
old shares.
N
net unrealized appreciation (NUA): A very favorable income-tax 
advantage given to the distribution of employer shares in a qualified retire-
ment plan. Specifically, tax is not imposed on the appreciation of employer 
shares from the date of contribution to the date of distribution until the date 
of sale of those shares. Then, upon that sale, tax is imposed only at favorable 
long-term capital gains rates.
O
ordinary income: A term used in income-tax planning to distinguish the 
taxation of salary and wages from that of the sale of assets (or capital gains 
or losses). Currently, the tax rate on salary and wages (ordinary income) is  
35 percent, but historically it has been as high as 90 percent.
overfund: A generic term used in the context of estate planning meaning that 
improper use of the transfer-tax marital deduction has occurred. For example, 
if the second deceased spouse’s estate is overfunded, it means too much prop-
erty has been transferred to them from the first deceased spouse’s estate. 
As such, the couple cannot engage in efficient estate-tax planning as a unit.

Glossary
344
P
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010: Otherwise 
colloquially known as Obamacare, an Act signed into law by US President 
Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The law is designed to provide coverage 
to over 32 million uninsured or under-insured Americans. The law reforms 
Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs; reforms insurance 
markets; and establishes new state-based exchanges. To finance the cost of 
health care, the law imposes varying levels of taxes on insurers, employers, and 
individuals. It also implements an individual mandate that all individuals must 
have health insurance beginning in 2014 or incur a penalty tax.
payable-on-death (POD) form: A form used with bank checking and 
savings accounts that specifies who is to receive the individually titled account 
at the death of the owner. The form’s primary advantage in estate planning 
is that it permits the transferred monies to pass automatically to the named 
beneficiary without the necessity of the probate process.
personal automobile policy (PAP): The most common form of automobile 
policy issued by insurance companies, as based on Insurance Services Offices 
(ISO) forms. It includes parts such as liability, bodily injury, property damages, 
medical payments, and collision.
pooled income fund (PIF): A trust generally created and maintained by 
a public charity, such as a public or private university or not-for-profit hospital.   
Used in estate planning both to provide a lifetime charitable income-tax deduc-
tion and to benefit the public charity at the donor’s death.
portfolio diversification: A fundamental investment technique used to 
reduce the risk associated with capital market investing. This technique is 
characterized by the purchase of securities both within and across asset 
classes, such as stocks and bonds or stock and bond mutual funds.
pour-over will: A will used in conjunction with a revocable living trust that 
distributes or “pours over” to the trust any assets that have not been titled 
in the name of the trust during the grantor’s lifetime or any assets that the 
grantor may have acquired after the trust retitling first occurred.
price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio: The number by which the expected earn-
ings per share on a stock investment is multiplied to estimate the stock’s 
proper value. Also sometimes referred to as the earnings multiplier.
Q
qualified charity: A charity that is “qualified” for income tax purposes, 
meaning it has met certain requirements that allow contributors to take 
advantage of an income-tax deduction once a contribution is made to the 
charity. The charity can be either public or private.

qualified educational institution: A ubiquitous term used throughout 
federal tax law with respect to allowance of certain taxpayer deductions and 
credits. This term is also used in student financial aid programs administered 
by the US Department of Education. It applies to virtually all accredited public, 
nonprofit, and proprietary post-secondary institutions and, specifically, institu-
tions eligible to disburse financial aid under Title IV of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965, as subsequently reauthorized.
qualified personal residence trust (QPRT): An irrevocable trust whereby 
the grantor of the trust transfers ownership of their personal residence 
(or vacation home) to another but retains the right to occupy the resi-
dence for a period of years, at which time title to the residence passes to the  
beneficiaries of the trust.
R
rabbi trust: A trust established to hold property used for financing a deferred-
compensation plan, where the funds set aside are subject to the employer’s 
creditors. As a result, the trust achieves an income-tax deferral of funds set 
aside on behalf of the beneficiary/corporate executive.
real estate investment trust (REIT): An investment (usually in the form 
of a publicly traded trust) that holds portfolios of real estate investments.
recognized: An income tax term often used by accountants to describe taxable 
income resulting from an economic event (such as the sale of an asset).
revocable living trust: A very important estate-planning technique that 
permits the grantor to avoid the probate process at death but still control 
and enjoy the benefits from their lifetime property. Contrasted with an irre-
vocable trust, which may achieve transfer-tax savings but cause the grantor to 
lose control of their property during their lifetime.
Roth 401(k): A relatively recent type of retirement plan that features the 
combined advantages of 401(k) contributions and Roth accounts at the time 
of distribution. The Roth contributions are included in the participant’s gross 
income when they are made but generally are not included in the participant’s 
gross income when they are distributed.
Roth IRA: A type of individual retirement account (IRA) under which contri-
butions may be made up to a specified limit on an after-tax or nondeductible 
basis. Withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax free, presuming certain requirements 
are satisfied. A Roth IRA is the second form of personal savings plan available 
to help fund retirement, with the other being a traditional deductible IRA.
rule of 72: A simple rule that may be used to estimate how long it will 
take for a given sum or deposit of money to double in value by dividing the 

Glossary
346
rate of return into the numerator of 72. For example, if an investor achieves 
a before-tax rate of return of 8 percent compounded annually, it will take 
approximately nine years for the given sum of money to double in value 
(72 divided by 8 = 9).
S
Section 529 private savings plan: A form of college savings plan, governed 
under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, whereby the account owner 
contributes cash to the plan for a beneficiary, and the contribution is then 
invested according to the terms of the plan. When the beneficiary attends 
college, the funds in the account plus all the earnings may be used to pay for 
the beneficiary’s tuition and other college expenses income-tax free.
special needs trust: A type of trust established by clients who have children 
who are mentally or physically disabled and are entitled to receive supplemental 
Social Security Income (SSI) benefits or other types of governmental assistance. 
If structured properly, such a trust may permit the parents to furnish benefits to 
the developmentally disabled child without disqualifying the child from receiving 
governmental assistance.
standard homeowner’s (HO) policy: A type of homeowner’s insurance 
policy that follows Insurance Service Offices (ISO) format and is written on an 
“open perils” basis. It ensures that losses to the home are covered, regardless 
of the peril or cause of the loss, unless specifically excluded under the terms 
of the policy.
stock: An evidence of ownership of a corporation. A major attribute of stock 
ownership is the ability to vote for the board of directors of the corporation 
that issued the stock.
T
tax-qualified annuity: A tax term referring to the purchase of an annuity 
by the sponsor of a qualified retirement plan on behalf of the plan participant. 
Such annuities are characterized by the lack of any tax basis in the plan, thus 
making the entire annuity payment income-taxable to the participant at the 
time of payment or distribution.
term insurance: A type of life insurance that is characterized by its tem-
porary nature. In other words, for the insured’s beneficiary to receive the 
insurance proceeds or death benefit, the insured must die within the stated 
term of the policy.

Plan Your Financial Future
347
time value of money: A finance theory that posits a “dollar is worth more 
today than in the future,” given that this dollar can be invested to generate 
additional monies.
traditional IRA: An individual retirement account or individual retirement 
annuity under which deductible contributions, up to certain limits, and invest-
ment earnings are tax-deferred. Interest earned and gains received while 
inside the protection of the traditional IRA are free of federal income tax until 
withdrawn. IRAs can also be offered on a nondeductible basis for individuals 
who cannot qualify for a deductible contribution.
transfer-on-death (TOD) form: A form used by securities firms to specify 
who is to receive the individually titled account upon the owner’s death. The 
form’s primary advantage in estate planning is that it permits the transferred 
funds to pass automatically to the named beneficiary without the necessity of 
the probate process.
trust: A legal arrangement whereby property is transferred or set aside on 
behalf of a beneficiary and the distribution of that property is postponed or 
delayed by the grantor until some point in the future. Used for a wide variety 
of purposes in estate and financial planning, but particularly to pass property 
to family members either during the grantor’s lifetime (inter vivos) or at their 
death (testamentary).
trustee: The legal owner of the property transferred into trust by the 
grantor. The trustee has a legal duty, known as a fiduciary duty, to act in the best 
interests of the trust beneficiary(ies) at all times.
U
umbrella liability insurance: An alternative to increasing personal liability 
limits in either an automobile or homeowner’s insurance policy. Generally, 
the umbrella policy has high individual liability limits and can also protect the 
insured from personal risks, such as the risk of libel or slander, that are not 
typically covered under the underlying policies. A necessary part of protection 
planning for high-net-worth individuals.
V
volatility: A commonly used term to describe the daily movements of the 
financial markets. For example, if the market index averages are significantly 
different today than they were yesterday, the market is said to be extremely 
volatile.

Glossary

W
wealth replacement trust: A type of irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) 
that is used to replace the value of property left to a qualified charity at the 
grantor’s death but that would otherwise pass to an heir or family member of 
the grantor. In such trusts, a life insurance policy is purchased on the life of the 
grantor, with a family member named as the beneficiary.

This book is dedicated to Peggy, Dawn, Grant, 
and Megan, my own personal reasons for wealth 
management and accumulation.

Foreword
It is my pleasure to write this foreword to the book Plan Your Financial Future, 
by my friend and associate, Keith Fevurly, MBA, JD, Esq., LLM (Taxation), CFP. 
I have my own very successful financial-planning firm, Integra Financial, Inc., 
in Greenwood Village, Colorado, and currently have some $40 million of 
assets under management. Every day, Integra Financial addresses and solves 
the financial-planning issues discussed by Keith in this book for a roster of 
upper-middle-class and upper-class families. From his ability to teach financial 
planning in CFP classes to his prowess at analyzing complex investment, 
retirement, and estate-tax issues, Keith’s expertise is unsurpassed. He boils 
down complex issues and explains them in terms that both our clients and 
you can understand.
In this book, Keith describes a novel way of analyzing and putting into 
place the personal financial-planning process, which he entitles the PADD 
process. The first step in this process is protecting yourself, your family, and 
your property. Next comes accumulating wealth, a section that will likely 
be of the most interest to a broad range of consumers and those who are 
engaged in financial planning in order to achieve financial independence. 
Third, Keith looks at the defense of accumulated wealth, notably discussing 
income-tax planning, with taxes being one of the two great “usurpers” of 
wealth (the other being the impact of inflation). Finally, Keith takes up the 
“fun” part of the financial-planning process: the distribution of accumulated 
wealth during an individual’s lifetime, notably retirement, as well as at death, 
which is the date of focus for most estate-planning techniques. Keith also 
provides a glossary of financial-planning terms at the conclusion of the 
book and cross-references these terms in each chapter by boldfacing them. 
Although there are no guarantees in life, particularly in today’s volatile 
economic marketplace, if you follow the process outlined in this book, 
you will have a more-likely-than-not chance of accumulating and preserving 
wealth during your lifetime.

It is our hope that this book will give you a level of comfort about your 
financial future. I like to say that my retired and debt-free clients live not 
only in different neighborhoods than those who are struggling financially 
but on different planets. Using the strategies presented in this book, with or 
without a good financial advisor, can help you to live on a different planet 
with the few others who actually achieve financial success. That is a rare feat 
in today’s marketplace!

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Willis G. Ashby, CFP, for writing the foreword to this 
book. I also would like to thank all the financial planners and wealth managers 
I have taught over the years. To be an effective teacher, the instructor should 
learn at least as much from his students as he teaches them. I can honestly say 
that has been my experience!
Thank you also to the Apress Business Team, particularly Morgan Ertel and 
Rita Fernando. You folks are the best!
