About the Authors
Larry Ullman is the Director of Digital Media Technologies at DMC Insights, Inc., a firm
specializing in information technology. He is the author of four other computer books. In
addition to writing, Larry develops dynamic Web applications, conducts training semi-
nars, and is an Extension Instructor for the University of California at Berkeley. He’s been
working with Apple computers for more than 20 years, starting with the Apple IIe back in
the dark (or monochrome) ages.
When he’s not tinkering on his Mac, he spends his time reading, working on his fixer-
upper of a house, and, given the time, napping in front of the fireplace. Larry currently
lives outside of Washington, D.C., with his wife of eight years, Jessica.
Marc Liyanage is a senior software engineer at futureLAB AG, a research and development
company focusing on emerging Internet, telecommunications, and wireless technologies.
He’s been using and programming Macintosh computers professionally for 15 years for
desktop publishing, video and TV screen design, and software development. He’s been
a UNIX user and software engineer for the past eight years in the Internet/ISP industry,
doing commercial Web application work and large-scale ISP systems design and imple-
mentation using open source software packages. He has also taught classes on XML and
trained junior software engineers.
He’s been a Mac OS X user and developer since the first beta versions, and he’s very
excited about the Panther OS because it brings together the elegance of the Macintosh
with the power of UNIX. In his spare time, he runs the developer-oriented Mac OS X Web
site www.entropy.ch, writes Cocoa software, and tinkers with his Mac.
His spare-time interests include graphic design, typography, and digital photography.
He enjoys watching and reading science fiction movies and books. Marc lives in Zurich,
Switzerland.
Dedication
We dedicate this book to the good people at Apple. Thanks for designing wicked hard-
ware, putting out the best operating system we’ve ever used (that’d be Panther), giving
away some top-notch software, and for demonstrating that there’s nothing wrong with a
computer that’s cool, feature-rich, secure, and stable.
Marc would like to also dedicate this book to his mother, Martina.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Our thanks to Wiley and to Carole McClendon at Waterside.
As always, thanks to Jess for her support and willingness to listen to me complain.
A special shout-out to David S. just for being a swell guy.
Thanks to my excellent co-author, Marc, both for his much-needed assistance with this
book as well as for the copious amount of work and support he has done for the Mac OS X
platform over the years.
Last but not least, my sincerest gratitude goes out to you, the reader.
—Larry Ullman
First and foremost, big thanks to Larry Ullman for inviting me to join him on this book

Introduction
W
e’re fairly smart people, and presumably you’re a really smart
person (you are looking at the right book, after all), but it still
seems like technology has eclipsed our ability to understand it.
Even the magical Mac — the symbol of all things easy in computers — is
overladen with features and gadgets and pretty lights. Make no mistake:
We all like features and gadgets and pretty lights, but how are we supposed
to make sense of it all and just do what we want to do, quickly and easily?
By reading this book, of course!
But if that isn’t enough to convince you (and we can’t imagine why not;
after all, we’ve never lied to you before), take a moment or two to read
through this Introduction. You’ll see where we’re coming from, what this
book offers, and how it’ll make you fall in love with your Mac all over again.
Saving Time with This Book
The Timesaving Techniques For Dummies books focus on high-payoff
techniques that save you time, either on the spot or somewhere down
the road. And these books get to the point in a hurry, with step-by-step
instructions to pace you through the tasks you need to do, without any
of the fluff you don’t want. We’ve identified more than 60 Techniques that
Mac OS X Panther users need to know to make the most of their time. In
addition, each Technique includes lots of figures that make following
along a breeze. Decide for yourself how to use this book: Read it cover to
cover if you like, or skip right to the Technique that interests you the
most.
In Mac OS X Panther Timesaving Techniques For Dummies, you can find
out how to

Tame time-consuming tasks: Because we demystify the inner workings
of Mac OS X Panther for you, letting you in on more than 60 tips and
tricks along the way, you can spend more time on creating great results
and less time on fiddling with a feature so that it works correctly.

Introduction
2
How This Book Is Organized
As devoted Mac users, we’ve amassed a gazillion
pieces of useful knowledge. By sheer luck, it turned
out that these little pieces could be organized into
Techniques, which are chapter-like sections grouped
by application or the general theory being dis-
cussed. These Techniques, it turns out, are sorted
into larger parts, which we’re calling (appropriately
enough) parts (we’re clever that way). We give you
the highlights as to what the parts are all about here,
but remember that you can approach this book how
you want to. Read a part straight through, skip from
Technique to Technique, or just pick out the little
pieces most relevant to the way you work. This book
has a structure, but you can be a free thinker. You
own a Mac, after all!
Part I: Starting, Stopping, and Running 
Your Mac Faster
This first part of the book focuses exclusively on
how to get the machine and operating system to
load and run faster — in other words, how to speed
up the process between pushing the power button
and actually doing anything. While we’re at it, we
also discuss some faster aspects of the installation
process and the easiest ways to shut down and log
out. These might be the basics of using your com-
puter, but even here, you find ways to do things
more efficiently.
Part II: Optimizing Your Interface
This part of the book discusses specific topics such
as files, applications, and so forth. This is the gen-
eral guide to doing anything better. The heart of Part
II is navigation techniques, both with the keyboard
and the mouse. You also discover how to customize
the Finder, windows, and the Dock. All in all, the
absolutely most-universal and most-helpful time-
saving techniques are here.

Take your skills up a notch: You’re already 
familiar with the basics of using Mac OS X. Now
this book takes you to the next level, helping
you become an even savvier Mac user.

Customize Mac OS X to meet your needs:
Spending some upfront time customizing Mac
OS X so that it works faster, more reliably, and
more like how you work on a daily basis can 
save you time (and aggravation) later.
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with certain assumptions about
the reader, and this one is no exception. Don’t be
alarmed: We’re not looking for an advanced degree
in computer science or the ability to recall long lists
of Mac trivia at parties. What we do expect of you
are two things:

A Macintosh, running Panther (Mac OS X v.3):
Well, to be perfectly frank, if you aren’t running
Panther (but are running another version of Mac
OS X), you’ll still be able to get a lot of things out
of this book; you just won’t be able to do every-
thing this book says you can do. This require-
ment is more of a highly advisable suggestion.

Basic familiarity with your computer: In some
ways, this is the same kind of For Dummies book
you’ve come to know and love, but it’s not the
kind that shows you how to plug in a printer or
save a document. (It will show you how easy it is
to share a printer on a network and how you can
save documents faster, though.) We promise that
you won’t be overwhelmed by anything in this
book, but keep in mind that you won’t be spoon-
fed, either.
Having a fast Internet connection will help you get
the most out of this book, and so will a little extra
spending money (but just a little). But neither of
these are required as long as you have a Mac and a
willingness — or a need — to discover how to use
your computer better.

Part III: Handling Files (And Other Stuff) Quickly
Like a teenager’s closet, your Mac is full of stuff. Who
knows what it all is? Okay, we know, and we think
you should, too. Although your hard drive might not
yet be bursting, there’s always going to be a lot of
junk in there. This third part of the book demon-
strates how to best organize, manage, and find your
(and your computer’s) stuff. You’ll also see how to
save disk space and remove clutter by trashing
unnecessary files.
Part IV: Improving Application Performance
Included on your computer (see Part III) are 
applications — software that does stuff with other
stuff (not to be too technical about it). You won’t
read about any one specific application here but
rather pick up some useful knowledge for using any
application more efficiently.
Part V: Cranking Up Your Internet Activities
As Homer Simpson says, “They have the Internet on
computers now.” Well, the man’s never been more
correct. Accessing e-mail and the World Wide Web
are why many people have computers. Most folks
spend a decent portion of their computing life in this
realm. Part V covers Web browsers, performing
searches, using e-mail, and other timesaving online
techniques. Tips on managing spam and using
Google effectively can save you minutes per day —
minutes you could spend surfing the Internet.
Part VI: Optimizing Your Network
The networking section of the book is Part V’s 
counterpart. Although not every user has advanced
networking needs, most could benefit from using
locations, working with an iDisk, and knowing how
to easily connect to other computers when the time
comes.
Part VII: Fast and Furious Multimedia
Apple markets itself as the multimedia machine, and
with good reason: The free software that comes with
the operating system is exceptional. In the multi-
media section of the book, we take a few of these
applications and demonstrate how to more effi-
ciently use them.
Part VIII: Security and Maintenance 
Okay, so your Mac pretty much takes care of itself.
Still, a little TLC couldn’t hurt. Part VIII (that’s eight
to you and me) offers you all the motherly advice
you can use on viruses, creating backups, keeping
your software up-to-date, and the like. Think of this
as the An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure section of the book.
Part IX: The Scary Or Fun Stuff
Whether you know it or not, your Mac is a powerful
machine capable of some really, really cool things.
The final part of the book strongly emphasizes our
friend, the Terminal, with a nod given to AppleScript.
If you’re looking for something more fun and less
scary, check out the Technique on using your cell-
phone with your Mac as well as the one on screen
savers.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book, as you’ll soon see, has a lot of visual stuff
in it to serve as your roadmap. You know . . . different
fonts and icons, indentations, and a few funny char-
acters. Here’s a Rosetta stone as to what they all
mean:

Keyboard shortcuts: This book has a healthy
amount of keyboard shortcuts in it. These use 
a conjoining plus sign to indicate that two (or
more) keys should be pressed in harmony. So
when you see something like Ô+A (the Select All

Introduction
4
These icons reemphasize the timesaving point
being made in a certain section. If you don’t
feel like reading through all those pesky words
and get tired of our trite jokes, look for these.
This icon means that you’ve seen this idea
before, you’ll see this idea again, and you
ought to keep it in mind. These are publish-
ing’s version of sticky notes. 
For crying out loud, don’t do anything marked
with this icon! If you don’t believe anything
else that we say, trust us on these warning
icons. Think curiosity and cat here and how
that went. You won’t see many warnings in
this book, but when you do, understand that
you might be about to take an irrevocable step. 
Comments and Questions
We’d like to think that this book was everything you
wanted or needed, and that you have no more com-
ments, problems, questions, and the like. But writing
can be a cruel mistress (we don’t know what that
means, either, but it sounds bad), and no book is
ever comprehensive. If you have something to say 
or ask, here are some places to turn:

Wiley (www.dummies.com): You can contact
Wiley, the publisher of this book, at its For
Dummies Web site. Feel free to leave all sorts of
feedback, including praise (Woo-hoo!), complaints
(D’oh!), and requests (that’s okay, too).

Mac OS X Panther Timesaving Techniques For
Dummies, the Web site (www.dmcinsights.com/
mactst): At Larry’s Web site, we’re maintaining a
separate section that focuses solely on this book.
Its contents will vary, but basically you’ll find
news, links to useful Web pages, and extras (as
we create them). Plus, you’ll also find our con-
tact information and the link to the supporting
forum.
shortcut), you should press and hold Ô, press 
A once, and then release both. Something like
Control+click means that you hold down the
Control key while clicking the mouse button
once.

Menu bar: The menu bar is the thing going
across the entire top of your window. It has all
the, you know, menus.

Menu sequences: Sequences of menus are refer-
enced with an arrow. For example, Go➪Recent
Folders means that you should click the Go menu
(on the menu bar) and then choose the Recent
Folders submenu from there.

Apple menu: The Apple menu, represented by
the Ú symbol, is that blue Apple symbol in the
upper-left corner of your window.

Application menus: When we refer to an applica-
tion menu, we mean the menu that has the title of
the application and appears between the Apple
menu and the File menu. So in the Finder, it’s
called Finder; in Microsoft Word, it’s called Word;
in iTunes, it’s called iTunes.

Monospace font: Web sites (URLs) and e-mail
addresses are in their own special monospace
font, which looks like www.apple.com. Onscreen
messages and text in the Terminal also look
like this.

User entry: Stuff you should type appears in
bold, like this: Type How now, brown cow?.
Icons Used in This Book
This book is littered with lots of little tidbits and
notes, set aside by different icons. In due time, 
you’ll probably identify the pattern for what each
icon represents, but here’s a quick heads-up.
Tips are just extra ideas that we think you’ll
appreciate. Although not life-altering, tips are
our way of saying, “Hey, you know what else
you could try?”

Mac OS X Panther Timesaving Techniques For
Dummies, the support forum (www.entropy.ch/
mactst/): Marc has established a forum at his
Web site where you can ask questions about the
book, about us, and about your Mac. Not only
will we reply (probably faster than we’ll get to an
e-mail), but you’ll also hear what other readers
have to say.

E-mail the authors: If you’d like to contact 
us directly, you can e-mail us at mactst@
dmcinsights.com. Although we do respond to
every e-mail we receive, there’s no guaranteeing
how quickly that’ll happen. Don’t get us wrong:
We absolutely appreciate the feedback, but there
are only so many hours in the day.
Keep in mind that normally the quickest way to
answer a general Mac question is to search Google.
Also, if you’re having problems with a particular
application, you’ll have the best luck contacting the
manufacturer of that application. But still, if you
drop us a line via one of the above methods, trust
that we’ll do our best to help out.

Installing Panther
without the Hassle
B
efore you can discover the magic of Apple’s latest, greatest operat-
ing system, you need a version of it running on your Mac. You might
even wonder whether Mac OS X Panther is right for you. Because
you’re holding this book, the answer is presumably yes, but to explain
why, we begin this Technique by discussing some of Panther’s benefits
and new technologies.
The installation process itself has a few variables, and comprehending
the different choices can not only save you time during the installation
process but also give you a more reliable operating system over the long
haul. You should also be able to make knowledgeable decisions about
formatting and partitioning your disk drive before you install the OS.
Finally, we show you how to breeze through the Setup Assistant (Apple’s
program for easing you through the startup process) and then wrap up
with a discussion of foolproof file transfers.
What Panther Can Do for You
The benefits of using Panther break down into two broad categories:
operating system improvements and better versions of Apple’s many
wondrous applications. What you’ll find in Panther itself is

A new style of Finder windows with improved navigation, much better
search capability, and built-in actions (which are kind of like contextual
menus)

The return of Labels, the much maligned — but still used — Mac OS 9
feature that dropped off the radar in previous versions of OS X

Greatly improved Open and Save dialogs for applications

Exposé, which is a fantastic tool for immediate access to open windows
and documents

Built-in fax software that allows you to send and receive faxes via your
computer without third-party applications

Technique 1: Installing Panther without the Hassle
10

Surprisingly easy security provided by FileVault,
which is an encryption tool for your folders and
files

The ability to more readily access different user
accounts thanks to Fast User Switching
Because the other Apple applications are critical to
the functionality of the operating system as a whole,
most of the applications that Apple provides with
Panther have also had a makeover and some new
ones have even been created. Specific benefits of
these include

The introduction of Font Book, which is a font
management application that can take the place
of third-party tools for most users.

Even more reasons to use Mail, which is Apple’s
aptly named e-mail client (see Technique 33).

A speedier and more useful version of Preview,
which is Mac OS X’s default viewer for PDF docu-
ments and images. More importantly, Preview
now supports many common PDF features like
hyperlinks, bookmarks, and full-text searching.

Modest changes to Address Book (personal infor-
mation management software), giving it even
more cause to be a regular resource for every
Mac user. 

A new version of the popular iChat messenger
service, iChat AV. You can now save oodles of
time and money doing video or audio conferenc-
ing with your computer and a FireWire-enabled
video camera. (This application is available to
Jaguar users for $29.95.)

The advent of Xcode, which is a tool for creating
applications. Xcode is a sophisticated new ver-
sion of Project Builder, which developers will
love and the general public can safely ignore.
(This application is available to Jaguar users at
no cost.)
All these improvements, new applications, and fea-
tures can be yours for the low, low cost of . . . okay,
the not-so-low cost of $129. But that’s a beauty of an
operating system.
The price of Panther ($129) is the same
whether you’re upgrading from Jaguar or buy-
ing a version of OS X for the first time. 
To further convince you, consider that an overriding
benefit of installing Panther is that you’ll be using
the most current version of Apple’s operating sys-
tem. This means that you can take advantage of all
of Apple’s future development of applications and
patches, which will be designed with Panther in mind.
If you own more than one Macintosh, consider
the Family Pack version of Panther, which gives
you license to install the OS on up to five
machines for the bargain price of $199. If time
truly is money, this tip alone could save you
hours!
Minimum System Requirements
In order to use Panther, Apple recommends that you have
one of the following computers:

Power Mac G5

Power Mac G4

Power Mac G3 (Blue and White)

PowerBook G4

PowerBook G3 with built-in USB

iMac

eMac

iBook
Apple also recommends that you have at least 128MB of
RAM (we recommend 256MB or more, but you can get
away with less if you never use Panther’s Classic mode), a
supported display, and at least 2GB of available disk space.
(You need 3.5GB if you want to install the Developer Tools
as well.) You’re welcome to attempt to install Panther even
if you don’t meet the above requirements, but you do risk
having a bum computer and wasting a whole heck of a lot
of time in the process.

Managing Your Disk Drives
11
Choosing an Installation Method
If you just purchased a brand new Mac, making your-
self the envy of the neighborhood, you should be sit-
ting there with a fresh copy of Panther purring away.
In that case, you can skip ahead a bit to the section
“Working with Setup Assistant” to see how to whip
through the Setup Assistant. If you don’t have Panther
installed yet but are the proud owner of some shiny
new installation discs, it’s time to put them to use.
Before you begin, take a minute to think about what
type of installation you want. You have three options:

Upgrade a previous version of Mac OS X:
Upgrading is the easiest and least time-
consuming option to use — in the short run, 
that is. One drawback, however, to upgrading 
an existing OS is that your hard disk will be
become bloated with deadwood files. The result-
ing OS can be a little buggy, inheriting problems
from its predecessor.
If you want to install Panther and get on with
your life with a minimum of fuss, choose the
upgrade option.

Erase and Install: This option is the most taxing
and time-consuming (and drastic) of the three. On
the bright side, you do end up with an untouched
hard drive and a brand spankin’ new OS. On the
other hand, you wipe out all your files and appli-
cations in the process.
Absolutely, positively do not use the Erase and
Install option unless you’ve got multiple back-
ups of all your files, drivers, and software. This
option does exactly what it says: erases the
contents of your entire hard drive.

Archive and Install: This happy medium
between your other two install choices creates a
new system folder with new copies of all the OS
stuff, but it also allows you to maintain all the
user files and non-Apple applications. Although
Apple doesn’t promote this feature as the recom-
mended type of installation, we’re quite fond of it
ourselves. It gives you the benefit of a clean sys-
tem folder (without the deadwood created by an
upgrade) without the serious drawback of having
to reinstall all your applications and files.
The Archive and Install option throws all the
existing system files and Apple applications in
a folder called Previous Systems. After you’re
convinced that no valuable information has
been overwritten by the recent installation,
delete this folder to clear up space on your
hard drive.
Managing Your Disk Drives
Along with deciding what type of installation you
want to perform, another topic worth your consider-
ation before you install Panther is the formatting and
partitioning of your hard drive (or drives). To clarify:

Formatting a disk drive is the process of erasing
its contents and telling the blank drive how to
structure the files stored on it.

Partitioning a disk drive is the process of break-
ing a single drive into multiple volumes. Your
computer still has the same number of physical
hard drives, but the operating system behaves as
if there were more. (Each volume appears as a
separate drive in Finder and other software.)
Practically anything you do with the Disk
Utility application requires erasing your entire
hard drive. Although Disk Utility warns you
before it does anything so drastic, we’d advise
you not to use the application unless you’ve
first backed up everything that you need.
Both of these tasks are accomplished by using the
Disk Utility application (see Figure 1-1), which can be
found in the Utilities folder and on the first Panther

• Figure 1-2: Click the Installer menu to access Disk Utility.
Formatting a volume
To format a volume with Disk Utility:
1.
Click the volume icon in the left column. 
(A disk’s volumes appear under the disk’s icon.)
2.
Click Erase.
3.
Select a Volume Format.
The Volume Formats are
 Mac OS Extended
This used to be the default format and is the
safest choice.
 Mac OS Extended (Journaled)
Journaling support has just recently been
added by Apple. You don’t really need to
understand the details of what it does to
appreciate that it allows you to more accu-
rately recover your computer in the event of a
disaster. Feel free to use this format because
Apple now uses it as the default.
 UFS (Unix File System)
If you choose to format with UFS, you render
the hard drive unrecognizable by some oper-
ating systems (in particular, OS 9). For this
reason, we’d advise you to stay away from it.
installation disc. If you have multiple drives or vol-
umes, Disk Utility can format or partition any volume
except for the one on which it resides (because it
can’t erase itself). If you want to format or partition
the drive that contains Disk Utility, you need to use
the installation discs.
• Figure 1-1: The Disk Utility application manages your
hard drives.
If you plan either an Upgrade or an Archive
and Install installation, do not reformat or par-
tition your hard drive because there will be
nothing to upgrade or archive. If you’re per-
forming an Erase and Install, the installer can
handle basic formatting (but not partitioning)
for you.
1.
Start your computer with the first Panther
installation disc.
2.
At the first screen that appears (for language
selection), select Open Disk Utility from the
Installer menu (see Figure 1-2).
3.
Follow the appropriate steps in one of the next
two sections to either format or partition your
drives and volumes.

Managing Your Disk Drives
13
4.
Enter the volume’s name (see Figure 1-3) in the
Name box.
• Figure 1-3: Reformatting a disk’s volume.
5.
Click Erase to reformat the volume.
When reformatting a hard drive, you can
choose to Zero All Data (available by clicking
the Options button). Doing so will exponen-
tially increase how long it takes to reformat
the drive, but it’s the best way to both clean
the drive and ensure that it’s working properly.
Partitioning a disk drive
To partition a disk drive into multiple volumes:
1.
Click the drive’s icon in the left column.
The drive will have a strange name consisting of
the size and model of the device.
2.
Click the Partition tab.
3.
Select a scheme from the Volume Scheme drop-
down menu (see Figure 1-4).
A volume’s scheme refers to how many parti-
tions you want to create. Hard drives 20GB or
larger can be nicely divided into two partitions.
• Figure 1-4: Opting for two partitions as the volume’s
scheme.
4.
One at a time, select every partition in the 
volume scheme window (named Untitled 1 
and Untitled 2 in Figure 1-4). Type a name in
the Name box and select a format type in the
Format drop-down list for each.
Disk Utility automatically partitions a disk into
equally sized volumes. You can override this
by clicking and dragging the bar that sepa-
rates the volumes in the scheme window.
5.
Click the Partition button to enact the changes.
Using RAIDs
If your computer has multiple hard drives, you can establish
a RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks or Redundant
Array of Independent Disks, depending upon whom you
ask) on them with Disk Utility. A RAID treats multiple drives
as one single device, offering either better performance or
better reliability (or sometimes both), depending upon how
it’s defined.
Unless you’re doing high-end video or image processing or
are supremely concerned about a disk drive failure, a RAID
is a waste of disk space. Remember: Creating a RAID on
your disk drives erases all the current content.

Technique 1: Installing Panther without the Hassle
14
You can also begin installing Panther by hold-
ing down the C key while your computer
starts up or selecting Mac OS X Install Disc 1
in the Startup Disk preferences panel (assum-
ing the CD is in the CD drive).
3.
Select the language that you want to use and
then click Continue.
4.
Read through the introductory text on the first
two pages, clicking Continue to go on.
The information presented on the second page
is duplicated in the Read Before You Install
PDF file found on the first installation disc. It
mostly covers Panther’s compatibility issues.
5.
Accept the license agreement by clicking
Continue in the main window and then Agree
on the sheet that appears from the top of the
window.
You don’t have to accept the license 
agreement — unless you want to install
Panther, that is. If you click Disagree, you exit
the installer and are returned to your normal
operating system world. One could argue,
therefore, that to save time, you just skip
reading the agreement (because you have 
to agree with it regardless). We’d never be so
irresponsible as to suggest that you skip read-
ing the agreement, though. (Cough, cough.)
6.
On the Select a Destination page that appears,
select the destination drive for the installation
but don’t click Continue just yet (see Figure 1-6).
The installer will present a list of available vol-
umes where you can place Panther. The installer
will even mark the recommended destination with
a green arrow and unusable destinations with a
red X.
Installing Panther
The installation process is fairly obvious, particu-
larly after you understand the options, but we’ll 
run through the steps and highlight a few important
considerations nonetheless. To install Panther:
1.
Update your computer’s firmware.
Apple always recommends that you do this,
pointing you to www.apple.com/support/
downloads. Once there, click your computer
model under Updates by Product in the right-
hand column. This will take you to a results page
where you probably won’t find an update for
your firmware. We’re not suggesting that you
skip this step, but don’t be surprised if it’s less
than fruitful.
2.
Insert the first Panther disc into the disc drive
(make sure that you have all three CDs), double-
click the Install Mac OS X icon, click Restart
(see Figure 1-5), and wait for your Mac to reboot.
• Figure 1-5: Restart your computer to begin installing
Panther.

Installing Panther
15
• Figure 1-6: The destination determines where Panther
will be installed.
If you have a decent-sized hard drive (20GB
or more), hopefully you partitioned it into two
or more separate volumes. If so, you can do a
clean install of an OS onto the second volume,
maintaining all your files and applications on
the original volume, just in case. See “Managing
Your Disk Drives” for more information on
partitioning.
7.
Before you leave the Select a Destination page,
click Options at the bottom of the window.
8.
In the Options dialog that appears (see Figure
1-7), select the appropriate installation method
(see the earlier section “Choosing an Installation
Method”). Click OK to close the Options dialog
and then click Continue in the Select a
Destination window.
Your choices are
 Upgrade
 Archive and Install
 Erase and Install
• Figure 1-7: The Options dialog is where you select your
installation type.
If you select the Archive and Install option,
you absolutely, positively want to select the
Preserve Users and Network Settings check
box; otherwise, you’ll need to recreate all your
files from the archive, which is an unnecessary
hassle.
If you select the Erase and Install option, you
have the choice of formatting with either the
Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or Unix File System
(UFS) formats. You almost certainly want the for-
mer, but read the “Managing Your Disk Drives”
section for more information.
If you perform an Erase and Install of Panther,
all your existing applications — along with your
files — are wiped out. If you don’t have all the
application disks and serial numbers written
down somewhere, you also lose some software
in your transition.

Technique 1: Installing Panther without the Hassle
16
 Additional Speech Voices: The speech voices
only require 29MB of space, but that’s 29 more
megabytes than necessary if you never use
them. We don’t. You probably won’t either.
 Fonts: Although Apple’s been kind enough 
to include the fonts, an informal poll of ours
concluded that most Panther users don’t read
much text written in Inuktitut or Gujarati. If
that accurately describes you, drop all the
fonts, along with the standard Asian ones
(Japanese, Chinese, and Korean). You’ll save
yourself 172MB of room (possibly for MP3s) 
in the process.
 Language Translations: If everyone using the
computer primarily reads and writes English,
deselect the 389MB of language translations
that the OS will never use.
 X11: This option is admittedly close to our
hearts and requires a meager 82MB of space.
Installing it will open up your Mac to a whole
world of free (free!) software and make these
geeky authors proud. X11 provides a graphi-
cal user interface to UNIX applications, such
as the GIMP image manipulation tool, games,
various text-editing programs, and a wide
array of scientific tools. Although these UNIX
applications will not look or act as nice as
native Mac OS X applications, the ability to
run them is still very valuable, and the price 
is right.
If you don’t install the BSD Subsystem, be
aware that you won’t be able to use many of
the more techie features of Panther, including
a few that we list in this book. This includes
command line utilities and some Internet and
networking software.
11.
After you select what you want installed, click
OK to close. You can also click Easy Install to
cancel the customization. Lastly, click Continue
in the main installation window.
12.
On the final installation page, click Install to
begin the actual installation process.
9.
On the Installation Type page that appears,
click the Customize button at the bottom of 
the screen.
10.
In the Customize dialog that appears, 
deselect all the features that you won’t use 
(see Figure 1-8).
• Figure 1-8: Customize your installation to fit your needs.
The most important timesaving consideration
when installing Panther is to avoid installing 
features that you’ll never need. This will save
you time now and disk space in perpetuity. The
options that you can choose to forgo include
 BSD Subsystem: The BSD Subsystem takes 
up about 222MB of space but is well worth it,
particularly if you’re anything but the most
basic Panther user. Don’t skimp on this one!
 Additional Applications: The Additional
Applications include Internet Explorer, StuffIt
Expander, iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, iCal, and
iSync. You’ll probably want all of these, but 
go ahead and drop those you won’t use.
 Printer Drivers: If you don’t have a printer,
you won’t need these at all, so deselect this
option and save a whopping 922MB of disk
space. If you do have a printer, choose to
install the drivers that correspond to the
make and model of your printer.

Working with Setup Assistant
17
You can quit the installer any time up until
you click the Install button. After you do that,
get out a good book because you’ll have to
wait out the installation (easily 15–30 minutes,
depending upon your computer and the
installation choices made).
13.
The first step that the installer takes is to check
for problems on the destination volume. You
have the option of skipping this step (click Skip
in the lower-right corner), but you should let
the installer do its thing.
If the installer fails while checking the integrity
of your disk, you need to use Disk Utility to
perform repairs before attempting the installa-
tion again.
14.
When the installation finishes, your computer
automatically restarts. (You can also click
Restart at the prompt.)
15.
If necessary, follow the onscreen instructions
to insert discs 2 and 3.
After your computer reboots — and is therefore
running off the new OS on your hard disk — the
installation process might continue if you’ve
elected to install some of the optional compo-
nents listed in Step 10. For example, if you’re
installing extra fonts and printer drivers, you’ll
be prompted for disc 2; if you elected to install
X11, disc 3 will be required.
The installer CDs can also be used for three
administrative purposes: changing the Startup
Disk, resetting a password, and accessing a
version of Disk Utility not running on the main
hard drive (see “Managing Your Disk Drives”).
Each of these is accessible through the Installer
menu.
Working with Setup Assistant
If you perform an Erase and Install installation of
Panther, or if you’re using your computer for the
very first time, you get the magic of the Setup
Assistant when your computer reboots. Like its
Windows counterpart, Setup Assistant asks you a
series of questions intended to make using the com-
puter easier. Here are the highlights of the process
so that you can whip through it more quickly:
1.
Select your language.
2.
Select your keyboard layout.
For both of the preceding steps, the defaults 
will most likely work. Apple’s kind enough not to
display all the options, but you can get them by
clicking the box at the bottom of the window.
3.
Decide what you want to do for an Apple ID.
You have three options:
 Enter your existing ID, if you have one.
 Create a new Apple ID.
 None of the above.
You already have an Apple ID if you’ve registered
for any of the special areas at www.apple.com or
if you have a .Mac account (which will be the
same as your Apple ID).
If you don’t already have an Apple ID or a .Mac
account, we strongly recommend creating one,
which will give you a 60-day trial .Mac account. 
If you like the trial, you can pay for a permanent
account. We both have one and think it’s well
worth the $99 yearly price.
You can get a free trial .Mac membership
when you go through Setup Assistant.
Because we refer to some .Mac stuff through-
out this book, you really ought to consider
signing up, even temporarily.
4.
If you want, register.
Unlike Windows XP, which requires activation of
the operating system, you can forgo Panther reg-
istration entirely. If you don’t feel like registering,
press Ô+Q to quit the registration application.
You will then be given the option to skip registra-
tion entirely (and continue with Setup Assistant),
shut down the computer, or cancel.

Technique 1: Installing Panther without the Hassle
18
Your Internet service provider should give you
detailed connection information to use during
the Internet setup process.
8.
Select your time zone, confirm the current date
and time, and start using Panther!
Transferring Files Flawlessly
In Technique 14, we discuss how to organize and
maintain your files and folders. Panther comes with
a good implicit organization scheme that you really
ought to follow. If you do so, you can restore all your
documents, bookmarks, e-mail, and so forth merely
by copying the contents of your old Home directory
to your new user directory. Even if you use the pain-
less Archive and Install installation option, saving the
contents of the Users folder to an external source
before you begin installation (hard drive, CD-ROM,
DVD) is a prudent move.
While we’re at it, we recommend that you have at
least one reliable backup of all your data at all times.
If you’re installing a new version of the operating
system, you want two or more backups that use 
different media. (You can never be too careful.)
The Backup application is provided free 
to .Mac users. Version 2 of the application can
back up files to your iDisk, a CD or DVD, and
even external hard drives.
Be sure that your backups aren’t in a proprietary for-
mat (for example, the Retrospect Express cataloging
system; www.dantz.com) because you won’t be able
to get to the data until your computer can read that
format again.
We highly recommend making a CD-ROM of
installed applications that also contains a text
document with all your serial numbers. This
fairly simple step makes restoring the software
on your computer a snap!
5.
Create your user account.
To create your account, enter your full name, 
the short name (which the computer will treat 
as your username), and a password. Ideally, 
your short name should consist only of letters, 
numbers, and the underscore, and be eight 
characters in length or shorter.
You can skip the password and verify prompts
if you’d rather not have a password. This will
expedite many tasks but will also make your
computer far less secure.
6.
Select your Internet access type and then click
Continue.
There are four options:
 Two different ways of setting up an EarthLink
account.
 Use your existing Internet service.
 I’m not ready to connect to the Internet.
7.
Follow the prompts to complete the Internet
setup.
As long as you didn’t select I’m Not Ready to
Connect to the Internet in Step 6, you’re led
through a connection setup wizard. If you’re
using an existing service, have your Internet
information written down and ready for when
you go through Setup Assistant. Getting the
information correct here will save you the hassle
of configuring your network later, although you
always have that option.
You need to know some combination of the 
following:
 Connection type (telephone modem, cable
modem, and so forth)
 User name
 Password
 Phone number (for telephone dialup)
 Subnet mask, router address, DNS hosts, and
Domain Names (for DSL, cable modems, and
other networks)

Starting Up 
with Speed
A
fter you get Panther installed on your computer, it’s time to get it
humming. In this Technique, we discuss various ways to get your
computer up and running as fast as possible. The timesaving ideas
that we discuss here cover from the time you press the power button to
using the actual applications.
We begin by pointing out the benefits of never shutting down your com-
puter, which helps you start faster and is a reasonable option for many
Panther users. Then we follow through steps that you can take to choose
which Mac operating system (OS) to boot into if you have different ones
installed on your machine. Finally, we show you how to best manage
computers in a multiuser environment, concluding with how to bring 
up your must-have applications as soon as you log into Panther.
Faster Startups: Never Shut Down
Although obvious, many people never think of this: The fastest way to get
your computer to start up is to never shut it down. Even on the fastest
machines, the startup process takes several minutes — minutes that you
don’t need to spend sitting idly. The Unix operating system — which is at
the heart of Mac OS X — was designed to run 24 hours a day, and your
Mac is perfectly capable of this as well. Granted, keeping your computer
on all the time will rack up the electrical bill a few cents per month, but
that minimal extra cost can be easily offset by your increased productivity.
Now, we’re not arguing that you should never shut your computer down,
but here are some different ways to limit shutdowns:

Put the computer to sleep overnight, rather than shutting it down.

Set the sleep mode (see Figure 2-1) by clicking the Show Details button
from the Sleep tab of the Energy Saver panel.
Technique
Save Time By
 Always keeping your
computer on
 Selecting the proper

 Loading applications

Technique 2: Starting Up with Speed
20
• Figure 2-1: You can adjust your computer’s sleeping
habits in the Energy Saver panel.
You can access the Energy Saver panel by
choosing System Preferences from the Apple
menu and then clicking on Energy Saver
under Hardware. Figure 2-1 shows the Energy
Saver panel for a laptop, which has a few more
features than the same panel on a desktop
machine.

Turn off the monitor (desktop users only).

Close your laptop’s monitor to engage the sleep
mode (laptop users only).

Leave the computer active but engage the screen
saver.
If you’re not going to use your computer for
days on end (like during a long holiday), shut
it down. Our main point is that you don’t have
to shut down your computer on a nightly basis.
If you prefer to shut down your computer
nightly and bring it back up in the morning,
look into using the scheduling capability built
into the Energy Saver panel (see Figure 2-2).
You can have your computer automatically
start up at a certain time every morning.
• Figure 2-2: If you consistently use your computer on a
regular basis, use the scheduler to start up
automatically.
Laptop Power-Saving Suggestions
If you’re running a laptop from its battery, be prudent
when choosing to shut down the computer versus putting
it to sleep. Sleep mode requires very little energy from your
computer. Conversely, starting up the machine (as well as
shutting it down) is a huge drain on its battery. In
Technique 3, we discuss some energy management sug-
gestions in more detail.

Speeding Up Login
21
Booting into a Different Mac OS
Many OS X users still use OS 9, thus creating a dual
operating system computer. If you need to choose
which operating system to boot into, here are some
ways to make this process faster and easier:

Use the Startup Disk (see Figure 2-3) preferences
panel to set the most commonly used operating
system. This OS should be your default, allowing
you to change the game plan only when using
another Mac OS. Click the lock icon to set this
choice, thereafter requiring a password if some-
one wants to change Startup Disk preferences.
• Figure 2-3: Use Startup Disk preferences to choose your
primary OS.

Have your computer prompt you with a list of
available operating systems by holding down the
Option key while the computer starts up. Doing
so generates a prompt (it will take a while) of the
installed operating systems. Click the one that
you want and then click the right arrow to boot
into the selected operating system.
If your computer is off and you need to start
up in other than the default operating system,
hold down the Option key after you’ve turned
on the computer.

Boot up from a system CD-ROM by holding down
the C key while the disc is in the drive.

If you happen to have both OS X and OS 9
installed on the same disk drive, automatically
boot into OS X by holding down the X key at
startup.
Booting from External Drives
The later versions of Jaguar (OS X 10.2) finally introduced
the ability to boot from an OS stored on an external drive.
This support is also included in Panther (OS X 10.3). Thanks
to this, you now have the option of installing an entire OS
on a FireWire drive and using that as the need arises.
Although this might seem like an unnecessary feature, it
can be quite helpful. For example, if you want to experi-
ment with a beta version of a new OS, install that on an
external drive. If you think that you’ll occasionally need to
use OS 9 (or Classic), place it on that FireWire drive. Doing
so will speed up the performance of your computer (it
won’t have to track multiple operating systems) and also
save disk space on your primary drive.
Speeding Up Login
If your computer has multiple users, you have the
same types of questions that you have with multiple
operating systems:

Should a user be automatically logged in?

If a user should be automatically logged in,
which user?

How do you quickly switch to another user?
Panther includes many nice touches for using the
computer in a multi-user environment. Simplify and
speed up the login process like this:

If you use the computer more often than other
users, set the computer to automatically log in
under your username by following these steps:
1. Open the Accounts panel under System
Preferences.
2. Click Login Options at the bottom of the
left-hand column.

Technique 2: Starting Up with Speed
22
Keep in mind that if you log on automatically,
anyone who has physical access to your com-
puter now has the power to use your computer
without restraint. If your computer stays at
home and you trust your dog, this might not
be an issue; otherwise, be aware of this fact.

If you must use the login prompt, select the List
of Users radio button in the Login Options section
of the Accounts panel. Doing so will allow you to
skip typing in your username while still requiring
a password.

Again, if you must use the login prompt, at the
prompt, type the first letter of your name and
press Return. Assuming that letter isn’t used by
multiple users, this will quickly get you to the
password prompt.
Security versus Convenience
As we say many times throughout this book, you might
have to compromise security for greater convenience (or
speed). In many of the examples of this book, you need to
decide whether you want something to be easier or more
secure. Mitigating factors in making this decision include

Whether or not you share your Mac

What type of information is stored on your Mac

Who might have physical access to your computer

What kind of potential exists for your computer being
stolen
For example, the most secure login method is to require
users to enter both a username and password to log into the
computer, but this is really annoying if you are the only one
who uses and has access to your Mac. In this case, automati-
cally logging in as yourself, but password protecting sensitive
files on your computer (such as a Quicken document) and
keeping regular backups of everything makes sense.
In the course of this book, you find many techniques for
making things convenient and many for making things
secure. In the end, only you can decide where on that scale
your total Mac usage should fall.
3. Select the Automatically Log in As check box.
4. Select your username from the drop-down list
(see Figure 2-4).
• Figure 2-4: Use the Login Options in the Accounts panel to
secure and speed up access to your computer.
5. Click the lock in the bottom-left corner to
make this setting permanent.
Any locked System Preferences panel needs to
be unlocked in order for changes to be made.
Unlocking a panel requires an administrator’s
password. If you are the only administrator of
your Mac, using the lock on any System
Preferences page means that no one else can
change that setting.
Keeping Peace with Multiple Users
Setting yourself as the default user might miff your co-users,
but it’ll save you time, and that’s all we’re really concerned
with here, right?
Besides, Panther’s new Fast User Switching feature (which
we discuss in Technique 5) makes the automatic login much
less of an inconvenience for the other users of the computer.

Starting Applications Automatically
23
Starting Applications
Automatically
After your computer is up and running and you’ve
logged in, you’re ready to start working with appli-
cations. In Part IV, we discuss applications in detail,
but we can discuss at least one related technique
here. From the Accounts panel, you can set applica-
tions to launch automatically when you start up
your computer.
1.
Open the Accounts System Preferences panel.
2.
Select your username from the list on the left
(assuming that you have multiple users).
3.
(If necessary) Unlock the panel by clicking the
lock icon in the lower left-hand corner and
entering the administrative password.
4.
Click the Startup Items tab (see Figure 2-5).
• Figure 2-5: Larry’s list of must-be-running applications
are included in his Startup Items.
At this stage, you have two options:
 Click the plus sign at the bottom of the
Startup Items window, navigate to the appli-
cation using the Open sheet that appears,
select the application, and press Return.
 Open your Applications folder and drag-and-
drop the application(s) into the Accounts
panel. We find this method to be much, much
faster.
5.
After you’re finished, click the lock icon to
finalize the changes.
Speed up the startup process by disabling
automatic startup applications when you won’t
need them: Hold down the Shift key after log-
ging in. This trick will work only if you’ve gone
through the login panel (it won’t work with
automatic logins).
Startup Items: A Techie’s Technique
Another (far more geeky) way to make things automatically
happen when you turn on your computer is to use the
Startup Items folder, located in /System/Library. Every
item here gets its own folder, and the script within that
folder is automatically called when the computer turns on.
Unlike the login panel, these items are run for all users.
If you’re comfortable with scripting, using the Startup Items
folder is a great way to do some things, such as starting a
database application each time that the computer runs.
Marc has created a shell script for exactly that purpose
(automatically starting the MySQL database server), which
can be downloaded from www.entropy.ch/software/
macosx/mysql. You can use this example (if you’re feeling
adventurous), or those already on your system, as tem-
plates for how to get really geeky with Panther.
The slightly less geeky (and, frankly, easier) solution is to
use an AppleScript that runs your startup routine. An
example is developed in Technique 60. This can then be
added to your Startup Items in the Accounts panel.

when it’s launched. Use Safari’s General prefer-
ences panel to set a Home page and indicate that
all new windows should open with that.
If it’s applicable, you can even select a file to open at
startup by adding it to the Startup Items list. Select
the Hide check box next to a Startup Item (refer to
Figure 2-5) to have it load without the visual fuss.
Your computer must expend some time and a
bit of power to start up applications. Therefore,
you should only add those to your Startup
Items list that you absolutely will use every
time you start the computer.
While you’re messing around with System
Preferences is a good time to have the auto-loading
applications do their things. For example:

Set Mail to automatically check for new e-mail
every so many minutes, using Mail’s General
preferences panel (see Figure 2-6).

Running Panther
Faster
L
ike many of the other techniques in the first part of the book, those
in this Technique show you how to save time by adjusting system-
wide settings. They’re of the “do it once and forget about it” variety.
First, we cover a ridiculously cheap shareware application called System
Optimizer X, which fine-tunes your computer for improved performance.
We tested it ourselves, read the technical specifications, and were
impressed by the reviews — now we think it should be part of your sys-
tem, too. Much in the same vein, you then discover how to manually tune
your computer by disabling some of Panther’s unused features. Doing so
will pare down a hefty OS (as much as possible, that is).
For those of you using a laptop, we give some attention to the related
ideas of energy management and extending your battery’s life. Finally, 
we cover the best ways to improve the performance of your computer
through hardware.
Optimizing Your System with Shareware
One of the great things about the Mac OS X system is that where there’s a
need, there’s shareware (and often freeware, too). One such application,
System Optimizer X (available from www.mkd.cc/sox/ for the low, low
price of only $12), fine-tunes several aspects of the operating system.
The manufacturer’s claim — and the evidence seems to support these
claims — is that System Optimizer X will


Handle automated tasks that Panther has set to run overnight
Mac OS X has several maintenance-type tasks set to run when you’re
not using the computer. Most of these are therefore scheduled to run
during the middle of the night or early morning. For many users,
these routines are never executed because their computers are off at
those times. If you do regularly shut down your machine, System
Optimizer X addresses these maintenance needs.

• Figure 3-2: Mounting the DMG file creates this 
disk image.
5.
Launch System Optimizer X by double-clicking
the installed application in the Finder.
6.
Click Go Ahead at the prompt.
This gives the application permission to install
the files that it needs to run.
We’re not saying that it will happen, but just in
case the application wreaks havoc on your
machine, it’s a very good idea to run a thor-
ough backup before optimizing the system
(see Technique 48). Again, we have not expe-
rienced any problems, but System Optimizer
X works on your system files and removes
some cached data, so you can never be too
careful.
7.
After the installation is complete, you’ll be 
presented with the main window.
To optimize your system:
 1. Click the lock in the lower-left corner.
 2. Enter your system’s administrative 
password.
 3. Click the Optimize button.
8.
After the optimization process is complete
(which could take a good half-hour or more),
click the Restart button (see Figure 3-3).

Give you feedback on what it’s doing
If that hasn’t convinced you to use this application,
follow these steps to install and use System
Optimizer X for a free trial. If you’re pleased with 
the results, keep and pay for it; otherwise, you can
easily uninstall it.
1.
Download the most current version of the
application from www.mkd.cc/sox/ (see 
Figure 3-1).
• Figure 3-1: System Optimizer X helps speed up 
Mac OS X.
2.
Double-click the downloaded file (which will be
named something like SystemOptimizerX406.
dmg.gz) to expand the file with StuffIt.
3.
Double-click the resulting disk image file
(again, named something like
SystemOptimizerX406.dmg, depending upon
your version) to automatically call the Disk
Utility application to mount it as a drive.
4.
Install System Optimizer X by dragging the
folder on the disk image (see Figure 3-2) into
your Applications or Utilities folder.

Disabling Unnecessary Features
27
• Figure 3-3: To notice the optimization effects, you must
restart the computer.
Because it takes a while before the first time
System Optimizer X does its thing, you might
want to start it before you go to lunch (or
maybe take a nap).
9.
After your computer restarts, open System
Optimizer X again to execute the remaining
optimization techniques (click each tab —
Maintenance, Internet, and so forth — for
details).
10.
If you appreciate the application and decide 
to keep it, be certain to register by going to
www.mkd.cc/sox and clicking the Register link 
(it’s only $12). 
11.
After you register, use the Schedule tab to set
up routine maintenance.
MDK Software recommends that you run the
System (through the Optimize tab) and Cache
optimizations monthly and the Maintenance
routine weekly (or more often).
Disabling Unnecessary Features
Larry has a friend who was annoyed by how slowly
her computer was performing. After taking a look,
he quickly discovered one culprit: animated icons
dancing around on her Desktop. Our point isn’t to
make you question Larry’s choice of friends and
their computer know-how, but this: There’s fre-
quently an inverse relationship between features
and performance. The more features you have
turned on and running, the more your computer
has to do. The more your computer has to do, the
slower it becomes. The trick is to find a balance
between functionality and speed.
Common speed-enhancing techniques are

Removing CD-ROMs from your disc drive when
you’re not using them.
Your Mac has to keep track of all mounted disks
(and discs), be they CD-ROMS, DVDs, or external
hard drives. Tracking discs does require some
processor effort, which could be better used
elsewhere.

Removing external disks when they’re not
being used.
Keeping an eye on large FireWire drives takes a
noticeable toll on your Mac. (Dismounting and
unplugging an external drive might cut that 
electricity bill a bit, too.)

Turning off the iDisk synchronization.
Panther has better built-in support for iDisk than
its predecessors. Your iDisk can be always avail-
able for access and can also be in synchroniza-
tion at all times. What this means, though, is that
your computer is constantly checking on the sta-
tus of your iDisk and updating it. This is a drag in
terms of performance, network speed, and disk
space. To disable automatic synchronization, do
the following:
Having an iDisk is one of the benefits of pay-
ing for a .Mac account (we discuss both in
Technique 41). Simply put, the iDisk is 100MB
of online storage. There’s a little more to it
than that — like a .Mac Web page, an easy way
to download software, and a method for shar-
ing documents online — but that’s the gist of
the idea.

Technique 3: Running Panther Faster

• Figure 3-5: The Sharing panel provides easy access to
different services.
The good people at Apple were smart enough
to have all the Sharing items turned off by
default. If you change these settings, try to
remember that so you’ll turn them back off
again when the time is right. For example, if
you’re traveling (and therefore not on your
normal network), you don’t need to enable
File or Print sharing.

Trying not to overburden your Internet con-
nection. Imagine simultaneously listening to
online music through iTunes, running ESPN’s
GameCast Java applet to follow a Cubs game,
instant messaging your friends, and transferring
files via FTP. For some inexplicable reason, your
computer is incredibly sluggish. By making bet-
ter decisions (your friends can wait, so turn off
iChat, and wouldn’t you rather listen to a CD 
anyway?), Panther will start purring again.
 1. Click on .Mac, found under the Internet &
Network section of the System Preferences
panel.
 2. Click the iDisk tab and either deselect the
Create a Local Copy of Your iDisk option
(see Figure 3-4), or select the Manually radio
button under Synchronize.
• Figure 3-4: Turn off the iDisk synchronization option for
better performance.

Turning off the items in the Sharing panel if
they’re not going to be used regularly (see
Figure 3-5).
Panther supports several different kinds of 
services — Personal Web Sharing, Personal File
Sharing, Printer Sharing — but using each of
these requires an actively running process.
Although most sit quietly in the background,
waiting to be used, you don’t need to have them
turned on if you aren’t regularly using them.
Click Sharing under the Internet & Network sec-
tion of System Preferences to access the panel
and see Technique 39 for more information
(including the related security issues).

Longer Battery Life
29
Because of how Mac OS X manages CPU and
memory usage, most open applications won’t
affect the overall performance when they’re
not being used. You can save yourself time
without bringing the computer down by not
continually closing and reopening applications.

Turn off your AirPort Card when you’re not
online.
Using an AirPort Card requires some processing
and battery power. If you’re not currently online,
turn off the AirPort Card. See Technique 37 for
other wireless network-related ideas.
Longer Battery Life
If you’re using a laptop, the life of your battery
directly affects how fast you can get things done. If
you don’t believe us, try doing, well, anything on a
dead battery with no outlets in sight. To minimize or
altogether eradicate such occurrences, keep in mind
the following principles:

Disable unnecessary features. See the previous
section of this Technique.

Keep running applications to a minimum. It’s
not running applications that drain the battery
as much as starting and stopping them does.
Open only the applications you need and keep
them open until you’re finished.

Minimize how often the computer has to access
the hard drive. Writing to and reading from drives
of any type is a big drain on a laptop’s battery. In
particular, most of the iLife applications suck the
blood from your battery. Avoid listening to iTunes,
editing videos in iMovie, or working with iPhoto
unless you really have to or don’t mind the
shortened battery life.

Remove CDs and DVDs from the disc drive.

Change your energy settings to Longest Battery
Life. Head over to the Energy Saver panel (see
Figure 3-6) under System Preferences. One of the
default configurations is Longest Battery Life
(assuming you have a laptop). This option auto-
matically configures your display, sleep, and
other settings accordingly.
• Figure 3-6: Laptop users should stay on top of the Energy
Saver panel.
If you’re using a laptop, get in the habit of
enabling the battery status in the menu bar
(see Figure 3-6) while you’re not wired and
disabling it otherwise. You’ll want to monitor it
when you’re on battery, but it only clutters up
your screen otherwise.

Keep the screen as dim as possible. A fair portion
of your battery’s power will go into illuminating
the monitor. To maximize your battery’s life, dim
the monitor as much as you can (use the screen
brightness keys on the keyboard to do so). If
you’re working in a particularly dark place or at
night, you can get away with almost entirely dim-
ming the monitor while still being able to read it.
If your laptop is running off the battery but
you’re not actively using it and you want to
keep it awake (for example, if it’s processing
something or playing iTunes), dim the monitor
to the point of blackness  — you will save
yourself lots of power for later use.

Don’t play DVDs or CD-ROM-based games on
your laptop. Nothing drains a battery more
quickly.

Technique 3: Running Panther Faster
30
Any of the above places will install the new hardware for a
nominal cost (maybe $30, depending upon the item in
question).
If you don’t mind a little tinkering — and are willing to
assume the risks involved — new RAM, hard drives, and
video cards can often be installed using only basic tools.
You’ll most likely find installation instructions either with the
purchased hardware or online. Search Google or the
AppleCare Knowledge Base (http://kbase.info.apple.
com) for specifics.

Add more RAM ($40–$200). Adding RAM is 
far and away the most foolproof method for
improving your computer’s performance. RAM
has become cheaper and cheaper and is ridicu-
lously affordable these days. If you haven’t
maxed out your computer’s RAM capabilities,
consider doing so now.
We recommend that you have at least 384MB
or more of RAM in your computer. You don’t
necessarily need to go up to 2GB, but 512MB
is a nice, even number and befitting most
Panther users.

Purchase a faster hard drive ($80–$300). Sadly,
Apple stopped using SCSI hard drives some time
ago, opting to go with the cheaper but slower IDE
drives instead. If you don’t feel like upgrading to
a SCSI drive (which isn’t even an option for lap-
top users), consider buying a faster IDE drive.
Most laptops use a 4,200 rpm drive by default,
but 5,400 rpm drives can be acquired for a few
dollars more. Desktop machines commonly use
7,200 rpm drives, but these can be replaced with
10,000 rpm drives without breaking the bank. We
admit that the performance gap between SCSI
and IDE drives has closed over the years, but
there’s still wiggle room for speed improvements
in your machine.

Purchase an external FireWire drive ($150–
$400). If you need more storage space but do 
not want to replace your existing hard drive, add
an external one. Such a device can be used only
when you need it and can be shared among many
computers.
Faster Performance through Energy
Management
Most computer users don’t think about energy manage-
ment, although it has a profound effect on both the com-
puter’s performance and a laptop’s longevity. Apple set up
energy management to work very well without help, but you
might occasionally find reasons to make adjustments. Most
users can and should keep the energy settings — found in
the Energy Saver panel of System Preferences — on
Automatic. The more curious user might want to consider
switching among Highest Performance, DVD Playback, and
Presentations, as the need arises. The latter two are particu-
larly effective under their corresponding conditions: For
example, each of them disables sleep mode.
Improving Performance 
through Hardware
You can do a fair amount of tweaking by using the
built-in Panther software and running shareware, 
but if you really want to enhance your computer’s
performance, you’ll have to part with some cash.
Here are some hardware improvements that you 
can make from least to most expensive:
If you’re looking through this book in a library
or bookstore, we highly recommend that you
purchase your own copy (or better yet, buy
several, and you’ll never need to read the same
copy twice). The small price is well worth the
timesaving techniques!
How to Upgrade Your Hardware
If you’re not the type of person that likes to open up a com-
puter and mess around with the insides, you have a couple
of options for getting the job done:

Have it performed at the store where you purchase
the upgrades

Go to an official Apple store

Take your Mac to an authorized Apple dealer, such
as CompUSA

Improving Performance through Hardware
31

Install a better video card ($150–$400). People
who aren’t hard-core gamers often don’t value 
a good video card and frequently fail to realize
how a faster card improves the overall perform-
ance. Everything that happens on the screen has
to go through this device, so the performance
impact is real. Laptop users have little to no
room for improvement in this area, but desktop
users have many options. Consider buying a new
card with as much RAM possible (64MB is fair)
and use that Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)
slot if you have it.
Ideally, any video card that you purchase
should also support Panther’s Quartz Extreme
acceleration, which is a great benefactor to
performance.
Make sure that the video card manufacturer
supports Panther by providing the appropriate
drivers. If they don’t, you either won’t reap the
performance benefits or the card might not
work at all. Check a manufacturer’s Web site
for compatibility information before making
the investment!

Replace the motherboard (desktop users only,
$400–$900). This is a pricey step and comes
close to being impractical because mother-
boards are often almost as expensive as a new
computer. But if you have a nice machine that
you want to work with, you can upgrade to a
newer, faster processor for a few hundred big
ones.

Get that new Mac ($900–$3,000). It used to be
that as a Mac user, you knew that you would
spend more for your computers, get less in
return, and have fewer options than your
Windows friends, but those days are long gone.
Apple has had great success in developing sepa-
rate computer lines (professional and home)
with a decent range of prices and capabilities.
You can now pick up an impressive eMac for
under a grand and a low-end iBook for just over
that amount.

Take out a second mortgage and get that new
dual-processor G5, with all the RAM that you
can, and a new 23-inch studio display ($5,000).
Buy us one while you’re at it.

Save Time By
 Killing stalled-out 
applications

problems with the Activity
Monitor
Technique
When Good
Applications 
Go Bad
I
’m sure we all agree that Panther is a most excellent operating 
system — perhaps the best that we’ve ever used. However, we still
encounter the occasional problem or misguided application that
mucks up the works. Fortunately, OS X brought us protected memory,
meaning that a stalled-out application will no longer bring down the
whole machine. But stalled applications do gum up the works and leave
your computer hanging. In this Technique, we show you the best and
fastest ways to monitor and shut down problematic software. In an ideal
world, you’d never need to know these techniques, but in reality, follow-
ing these steps can keep your system going.
Slaying Stalled Apps with the Dock
Panther has a few different ways to kill errant applications. The best-
known method is to press Ô+Option+Esc to bring up the Force Quit
Applications window (see Figure 4-1).
• Figure 4-1: The Force Quit
Applications
window allows you
to shut down
applications.

Gaining Better Performance through Activity Monitoring
33
You can also bring up the Force Quit
Applications menu by selecting Force 
Quit from the Apple menu.
An alternative method for killing an application is to
use the Dock. Here’s how:
1.
Before you proceed, think back to make sure
that you haven’t assigned this application some
monumental task (such as heavy image or video
processing) that can explain its sluggishness.
2.
If an application is not responding, click and
hold its Dock icon to bring up a contextual
menu (see Figure 4-2).
• Figure 4-2: Clicking and holding a Dock item brings up a
contextual menu.
3.
Press the Option key while still clicking the
Dock icon to get the Force Quit option (see
Figure 4-3).
4.
If the contextual menu for the application 
(created in Steps 2 and 3) reads Application 
Not Responding and you can’t think of a good
reason why, select Force Quit.
5.
Wait a couple of minutes to let the system stabi-
lize; then reopen the application.
You should always attempt to quit an applica-
tion in the usual way before performing a
force-quit. Also get in the habit of giving your
quits and force-quits a few moments to work
before trying to nuke them.
• Figure 4-3: Pressing the Option key gives you the Force
Quit option.
Gaining Better Performance
through Activity Monitoring
One of Panther’s lesser-used applications is the
Activity Monitor, found in the Utilities folder. This
application does exactly what you’d think: It moni-
tors the activity of the computer. The interface of
the application is a bit techie, but it can be a very
useful tool for catching problems and fine-tuning the
performance of your computer. For example, you
can set up a floating CPU window that allows you to
continuously monitor your CPU’s activity. You can
use the CPU window to catch apps that might be
slowing down your system performance. Follow
these steps to set up the window:
1.
Open the Activity Monitor, located in the
Utilities folder.
2.
Choose Monitor➪Floating CPU Window and
either Show Vertically or Show Horizontally
(see Figure 4-4).
By default, the Activity Monitor does not display
a floating CPU window. This step creates one that
remains visible even after you hide the Activity
Monitor application.

Technique 4: When Good Applications Go Bad
34
• Figure 4-5: The Activity Monitor creates a bar graph
indicating CPU usage.
• Figure 4-6: The Activity Monitor can also be represented
by a history graph of CPU usage.
The Activity Monitor’s Dock icon can be used
to show CPU usage or history (Figure 4-6);
disk or memory usage; or network activity.
• Figure 4-4: Choose a type of floating CPU window to
display: Horizontal or Vertical.
Instead of using the menu bar, you can also
create the floating CPU window by pressing
Ô+4 or Ô+5.
3.
While you have the Activity Monitor open,
adjust the update frequency by choosing
Monitor➪Update Frequency➪Less Often.
Setting the Activity Monitor to update less 
frequently will minimize the performance
effect that running the monitor has on your
computer.
4.
If the floating CPU window (see Figure 4-5)
turns to solid green or solid green and red 
for more than a few seconds, some program 
is using up all the available processing power
(thereby bringing down the performance of
everything else).
5.
Click the Activity Monitor icon in the Dock and
press Ô+1 to bring up the Activity Monitor
screen (if it isn’t already).
The Activity Monitor icon either looks like the
monitor image next to the Finder in Figure 4-5 or
it can be a graph itself (see Figure 4-6).

Gaining Better Performance through Activity Monitoring
35
6.
Click the %CPU column so that CPU usage 
is displayed by process in descending order
(see Figure 4-7).
• Figure 4-7: Sort by the CPU usage to see what
applications are hogging the machine.
In Figure 4-7, Microsoft Word is the guilty party.
7.
If a process name appears in red, the applica-
tion is no longer responding and needs to be
shut down.
8.
Determine whether it’s reasonable to kill the
application.
If the application in question is performing some
intensive task (like iMovie compositing a video
clip or iPhoto importing pictures), then the high
CPU usage makes sense. However, if you haven’t
asked the application to do something taxing or
it’s a normally less intensive application (like
Safari), you’ll know there is a problem.
9.
If the application should be stopped, try 
quitting it.
If so, highlight the application and click the stop
sign icon in the toolbar (Quit Process), which will
attempt to kill the application through normal
means.
10.
If the application still hasn’t stopped, force it to
quit by using one of the methods outlined in
“Slaying Stalled Apps with the Dock,” earlier in
this chapter.
If you have some time to kill or just really
want to know what your computer is doing
and why, the Activity Monitor is the perfect
tool to spend some time with.
Understanding Processes
In the Unix world, a process refers to an active (that is, run-
ning) application, daemon (a special type of constantly run-
ning utility), or other service. (In fact, the Unix operating
system blurs the lines between these ideas.) Panther uses
the same notion of processes, of course, and therefore
introduces an idea that may be foreign to many. The
Activity Monitor displays not only your open applications
but also behind-the-scenes system processes.
To learn more about any particular process, click the
Process ID in the Activity Monitor and then press Ô+I. This
brings up another window with details for that particular
application, as shown in the following figure. When you’re
done with your investigation, be sure to click Close to close
the window — not Quit, which will attempt to shut down
the process.
Another tool for monitoring your performance is
iPulse, which is a shareware application created 
by the good people at the Iconfactory ($12.95 at
iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp). iPulse tracks the
CPU, memory, and hard drive usage and displays
them graphically on the Desktop or Dock. It’ll even
monitor network activity.
If you want a free solution that only monitors CPU
usage, check out Xload (http://s.sudre.free.fr/
Software/Xload.html). If you are using a multi-
processor Mac, it will even report on each processor
individually.

Save Time By
 Logging out in different
ways
 Switching between users
quickly
 Shutting down fast
Technique
Logging Out and
Shutting Down
W
hen it’s time to call it a night, you want to get off your Mac as
quickly as possible. In this final Technique of Part I, we show
you a few inside tips for speeding up that process, covering the
range of options: You can choose to log out of your computer, switch
over to another user’s account, or shut down the computer.
Logging Out
Before we discuss logging out techniques, it should be made clear that
logging out of your computer is only necessary under two conditions:

The Mac is being used by more than one person.

You want to make sure no one messes with the computer while you’re
away from it.
If neither describes your situation or how your Macintosh is used, stick
with your one login account and continue on your merry way.
If you share the computer and want to log out with ease, try any of the
following:
1.
Go to the Apple menu and select Log Out User (where User is your
name; see Figure 5-1).
2.
If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching (see the next section of this
chapter to find out how), go to the user menu in the upper-right 
corner of the screen and select Login Window (see Figure 5-2).
Fast User Switching is a must-use feature of Panther for multi-user
computers.

Logging Out
37
• Figure 5-1: The Apple menu gives the option of 
logging out.
• Figure 5-2: The user menu is new to Panther.
3.
Press Ô+Shift+Q to quit all applications and 
log out.
You’ll get a warning message like Figure 5-3.
• Figure 5-3: Logging out the standard way causes this
annoying prompt.
To cut a step out of the log out process, hold
down the Option key when selecting Log Out
from the Apple menu or while pressing the
keyboard shortcut. This eliminates Apple’s
warning.
4.
At the log out confirmation prompt (refer to
Figure 5-3), press Return to log out or Esc 
to cancel.
Unless you are using the Fast User Switching method
of logging out, there are two considerations you
should remember:

Each logout method closes any open applications.

If you have an unsaved document in any applica-
tion, you cannot log out until you opt to Save or
Don’t Save that file.
Neither of these options applies to Fast User
Switching, as the state of your account remains 
the same (all open applications remain open).
Every method of logging out — including Fast User
Switching — does these two things, though:

Automatically attempts to log you out after two
minutes if you don’t choose to either Log Out or
Cancel (see Figure 5-3).

Takes you to the main login screen after logging
you out.

Technique 5: Logging Out and Shutting Down
38

Click the Edit button and take a picture of yourself
using an attached camera.
If you have a FireWire video camera connected to
your Mac, your image appears in the Edit window
and you can click the Take Video Snapshot button
to make a literal iconic representation of yourself.

Click the Edit button, and then click the Choose 
button to find the image on your Mac.
If you click Choose in the Edit window, you get a 
dialog (like the Open/Save ones) so that you may
navigate to and select an image on your hard drive.
The user icon you select also is updated in your Address
Book and in iChat. If you like switching icons frequently,
both iChat and the Edit window from the Accounts panel
will remember your most frequently used images. 
If you want to temporarily log out of your
machine with the intention of returning to
your work, enable Fast User Switching and log
out from the user menu.
Adding User Icons
Each user on a Mac running Panther can have their own
icon. This icon appears next to their name in the System
Preferences➪Accounts panel, in the main login screen, and
in the Fast User Switching menu. Besides being a nice repre-
sentation of you and your personality, user icons make find-
ing your login name from among a list of names easy. You
can change your icon using the Picture tab after selecting
your account in the System Preferences➪Accounts panel.

Securing Your System 
with a Screen Saver
On the other hand, if what you really want to accom-
plish by logging out is to protect your computer
while you’re away from your desk, here’s an easier
answer. You can instead use your screen saver and
set it to require a password to deactivate.
1.
Open System Preferences by selecting System
Preferences from the Apple menu.
2.
Click Desktop & Screen Saver under Personal.
3.
If the panel appears in the Desktop mode, click
the Screen Saver tab (see Figure 5-4).
• Figure 5-4: The Screen Saver preferences panel.
4.
Make sure that the screen saver is set to start
after a certain length of time.
For a higher level of security, set a hot corner
that will start the screen saver. This way, you
can immediately enact the screen saver before
you leave your desk. Otherwise, you’re trusting
that no one gets to your machine between the
time you leave and when it turns on.
Hot, Hot, Hot Corners
Your Mac has a feature called hot corners, wherein you can
assign special meaning to the different corners of your
screen. So, for example, moving the mouse into the upper-
left corner may turn on your screen saver and moving the
mouse into the lower-left corner may engage Exposé.
Moving the mouse back out of a corner reverts the screen
to its previous state (turns off the screen saver or Exposé, in
these examples).
Hot corners are enabled and assigned using either the Hot
Corners button in the Screen Savers panel (see Figure 5-4)
or by using the Active Screen Corners section of the
Exposé tab (see Technique 13).
5.
Choose View➪Security.
6.
In the Security panel (see Figure 5-5), select the
Require Password to Wake This Computer from
Sleep or Screen Saver check box.
• Figure 5-5: You can password-protect your computer
through the Security panel.
While in the Security panel, you can also set
your computer to log out after so many min-
utes of inactivity. You might find this option to
be great (because it’s more secure) or a pain
(as you’re consistently logging back in).

Fast User Switching
New to version 10.3 of the Mac OS X is the Fast User
Switching feature, and it’s a wonderful addition for
those who share their computer. The main benefit of
Fast User Switching is that it allows a user to log out
without quitting every application. To enable Fast
User Switching, do the following:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click Accounts under the System heading 
(see Figure 5-6).
• Figure 5-6: Configure Fast User Switching from the
Accounts panel.
3.
In the Accounts panel (see Figure 5-7), click
Login Options at the bottom of the left column.
4.
In the panel that comes up next, check the
Enable Fast User Switching option (see 
Figure 5-8).

5.
To switch to another account, select it from the
Fast User Switching menu (refer to Figure 5-2).
6.
Enter a password for the user selected in Step 5
and click Log In (see Figure 5-9).
• Figure 5-9: Enter the proper password to log in as
another user.
7.
To return to the previous account, or to log in
under another account, repeat Steps 5 and 6.
If multiple users are sharing a Mac, the Fast
User Switching feature allows them to switch
between accounts (and therefore preferences,
Home folders, and more) without losing their
place or re-establishing the work environment
upon return.
Making the Quick Exit
After you finish for the night (or morning or after-
noon) and it’s time to close up for the day, you prob-
ably want to shut down your computer. Every Mac
user knows how to do this, but not every Mac user
knows how to do it as quickly as possible.

The old fashioned method is to select Shut
Down from the Apple menu (refer to Figure 5-1).

You can also shut down your computer by
pressing the power button on your Mac or key-
board. This brings up a prompt of options (see
Figure 5-10). At this prompt, press Return to shut
down your computer, Esc to cancel, S to sleep,
and R to restart, or click the appropriate button
with your mouse.
• Figure 5-10: Use this prompt to specify what action your
Mac should take.
From the Energy Saver panel (in System
Preferences), you can set your computer to
automatically shut down at set times. This is
great for lab environments or for those who
tend to forget to shut down their computers 
at the end of the day.

Hold down the Option key while you select
Shut Down from the Apple Menu. Holding down
the Option key causes your computer to shut
down immediately without any other prompts.
The Option key trick for suppressing the con-
firmation prompt also works for restarting the
computer, putting it to sleep, or logging out.


Part II
Optimizing Your
Interface


6
Working with
Displays
T
he distant ancestor of today’s Macs, the Apple IIe, had a small glass
monitor that supported two colors: black and green. Today’s mod-
ern computers come equipped with beautiful monitors, some of
them liquid crystal display (LCD) or plasma flat-screen, capable of dis-
playing millions of colors, and with a viewing area of nearly two feet. But
there’s more to your monitor than just the physical hardware: You also
use many pieces of software to control what you see and how you see it.
In this Technique, for starters, you find out a thing or two about what
screen resolution is, how to choose the proper setting, and how to easily
manage these settings. Then you work with color management in Panther,
using ColorSync. We discuss how Mac OS X handles fonts, why you might
want to adjust that behavior, and how to do it. Finally, we cover how to
configure your Mac to make the best use of multiple monitors. Determining
and setting the optimal resolution for your monitor gives you more screen
space to work with, a better interface, and more reliable results (for graphic
designers). In short, the steps in this chapter make doing the things you
need to do easier.
Managing Your Display Resolution
Most beginning computer users, whether they use a Mac or a PC, never
concern themselves with the display resolution. So why should you?
Because adjusting the display resolution directly affects everything you
do with your computer. (Because it all goes through the monitor, right?)
Monitors create everything that you see onscreen by using pixels, which
are small squares of colored light. Your screen resolution is set in terms
of pixels, such as 800 x 600 pixels. Common measurements for standard
monitors are

Technique 6: Working with Displays
46
You set screen resolutions from the Displays dialog:
1.
Choose Apple Menu➪System
Preferences➪Displays.
2.
Making sure that the Display tab is selected
(see Figure 6-2), select a higher resolution than
the current (presumably default) one.
The screen sizes available for use depend upon
the display itself and the video card in the com-
puter (in particular, the amount of VRAM —
Video RAM — that it has).
• Figure 6-2: Control your screen resolution from the
Displays dialog.
3.
Select the Show Displays in Menu Bar 
check box.
Marking this check box creates a monitor control
in the menu bar (shown in Figure 6-3), saving you
trips to the Display panel.
You should click the Detect Displays button
whenever you add or remove another moni-
tor, including a projector. Doing so allows your
Mac to recognize what monitors are currently
in use. Alternatively, you can select Detect
Displays from the pop-up menu that appears
when you click the menu bar Display icon.

1600 x 1200

1920 x 1440
Those of you who use laptops or a cinema display
will also find these weird ratios:

896 x 600

1152 x 768
The screen resolutions used on a display corre-
spond to its aspect ratio. Like televisions, most
traditional monitors use a 4:3 (width:height)
ratio. Most Apple laptops and all Apple cinema
displays use a 16:9 ratio (like a movie theater
screen or a widescreen television).
These numbers refer to how many pixels comprise
the width and height of the monitor; therefore, a
higher resolution has more pixels. How does this
affect you in practical terms?
If an icon — for example, for a folder — takes up 
42 x 42 pixels, a higher resolution means that you
can display more folder icons in the same monitor
space (because the high resolution offers more 
pixels). However, each individual folder icon is
smaller because 42 pixels takes up less monitor
space. Compare the images on the left and right
side of Figure 6-1. A higher resolution allows you
to display more stuff, but everything is smaller.
• Figure 6-1: A folder icon at two different resolutions.
A higher screen resolution might increase
your productivity (you’ll spend less time tog-
gling around), but also your need to see an
ophthalmologist (you’ll be looking at tiny,
tiny things onscreen).

Adjusting the Colors

• Figure 6-3: The little monitor icon in the menu bar can be
used to control display settings.
4.
Set the Number of Recent Modes drop-down
box to 3, if you have that option.
The Recent Modes drop-down menu dictates
how many resolutions appear in the menu bar’s
Display menu. You probably have no reason to
show more resolutions than three unless you’ve
got some hog-wild resolution switching going on.
5.
Close the Displays panel.
6.
Experiment with the new monitor setting.
If it’s too hard on the eyes, use the menu bar
Display tool (refer to Figure 6-3) or the Display
menu (see Figure 6-2) and switch to another 
resolution.
7.
Repeat Step 6 until you find the best resolution.
As a compromise for your vision, you can use
a high resolution but also increase the default
font sizes of the system (see “Handling Fonts”
later in this chapter) and your applications.
Many of the Display menu’s features and
more are duplicated in the shareware applica-
tion SwitchResX (available from www.madrau.
com for $15). It brings added support to some
monitors and allows you to create bookmarks
for display settings that can automatically be
used when certain applications are started.
Virtual Desktops
Another method of getting more screen space for your
buck is to use an application like CodeTek’s VirtualDesktop
(www.codetek.com, $30). This program creates virtual
desktops. A virtual desktop is exactly like the Finder’s
Desktop except that you can have many of them instead of
just the one.
After you create multiple desktops, each can have its own
personality. By that, we mean that each individual Desktop
can have its own background, Dock, set of preferences,
open windows, and even open applications. For example: If
you have multiple projects going on at once, a different
Dock can be used for each environment. Or, you can have
one Desktop in which you’re playing games and using
iTunes and another where you’re actually working.
This idea, strange as it might seem to many, is familiar terri-
tory for users of the Linux operating system. Linux (and
other variants of Unix) primarily uses the Gnome or KDE
application as its version of the Finder. Each of these appli-
cations supports multiple desktops.
You might like the idea of virtual desktops — and you might
not — but if you’re whittling away time one afternoon, it’s
certainly worth your consideration. The free, demo version
of CodeTek’s VirtualDesktop allows you to use two different
virtual desktops, which should be sufficient to get a taste for
the idea.
Adjusting the Colors
Your monitor does not necessarily display colors
in a manner that’s consistent with other users’ 
monitors: It’s a foreign concept to many computer
users and a hard lesson for the novice graphic
designer to learn. In fact, historically, the colors 
of a Mac have been slightly brighter than those of a
Windows PC. This is because coloring is a software
issue. To help adjust for these variations, you can
create different profiles with Apple’s ColorSync
application. For example, you can calibrate different
color profiles for different purposes (graphic design,

Technique 6: Working with Displays
48
4.
Click the Calibrate button to begin the auto-
mated calibration process.
The Display Calibrator Assistant appears (see
Figure 6-5).
• Figure 6-5: Use the Display Calibrator Assistant to create
your monitor’s color profile.
5.
Follow the onscreen instructions to create your
profile.
The assistant is easy to use and has clear
instructions to help you through the process.
The Display Calibrator Assistant even offers
an expert mode, although if your needs are
advanced enough to require that, you probably
don’t need our help.
If you have a laptop, you can also adjust the
brightness of your monitor from the Display
panel, although doing so will throw off your
colors.
6.
To change from one profile to another, select
from the available options in the Color section
of the Display panel (Figure 6-6).
Your Mac probably comes with a couple of 
profiles and every profile you add also is listed
here. Select the new profile to make the switch.
general use) and then switch among them from the
Display panel. To create a custom ColorSync profile:
1.
Choose Apple Menu➪System Preferences➪
Displays to bring up the Display panel (refer
to Figure 6-2).
2.
Make sure that the Colors drop-down menu is
set to Millions and that the Refresh Rate drop-
down menu is set as high as possible.
The number of colors is just that: how many 
different colors the monitor will display.
Although we can’t name 256 colors (let alone
a million), we can definitely tell the difference
between the two settings on the monitor.
The refresh rate determines how often every-
thing on the screen is redrawn. (When you 
see computer monitors on television and in
movies with lines scrolling down the page, a
refresh is taking place.) The higher the num-
ber that you select in the Display panel, the
faster the refresh. Even though you’ll probably
never be aware of it, except on the lowest 
settings, higher refresh rates are easier on
the eyes.
3.
Click the Color tab (as shown in Figure 6-4).
• Figure 6-4: The Color panel of the Displays dialog.

Handling Fonts
49
• Figure 6-6: All of the available profiles appear under
the Color panel of the Displays System
Preferences panel.
Graphic designers can create a Mac profile 
for everyday use and a Windows profile for
seeing how their work will look on that other
operating system. After you create the 
two profiles, switching between the two
is a snap!
Handling Fonts
Along with the color scheme and screen resolution,
another parameter that you can adjust that affects
your overall Panther experience is how the system
treats fonts. On your Mac, you can adjust how the
operating system handles anti-aliasing. As any graphic
designer will tell you, anti-aliasing minimizes the
jagged edges of characters to produce a smoother
appearance. Like the refresh rate issue, this is some-
thing that you might not consciously appreciate,
but it could have a subtle effect. You can adjust 
anti-aliasing by using the Appearance dialog:
1.
Open System Preferences, and under the
Personal heading, click Appearance.
2.
At the bottom of the Appearance dialog that
appears (see Figure 6-7), select the appropriate
font smoothing style.
• Figure 6-7: The Appearance dialog adjusts many cosmetic
and user interface settings.
 If you’re using a traditional monitor, choose
Standard.
 If you’re using a flat-screen display (such as a
plasma cinema display or a laptop), select
Medium.
 If for some reason you want the least amount
of font adjustment possible (like us, when
writing this book), use Light.
 If none of these options apply to you and
you’re overwhelmed by the roughness of the
fonts, opt for Strong.
3.
Just below the Font Smoothing Style menu,
determine to what point sizes font smoothing
should be applied.

Technique 6: Working with Displays
50
Using Multiple Displays
Many Mac users already benefit from the Mac’s ease
of using multiple monitors. Graphic designers and
video editors frequently use multiple monitors in
order to improve workspace efficiency. High-end
applications such as Apple’s Final Cut Pro, Adobe
Photoshop, and even Macromedia Dreamweaver
have so many windows open at once that you almost
need to have one monitor for open windows and
another for the work in progress itself. Laptop users
can dock their machine to another monitor, using
both it and the laptop’s built-in display simultane-
ously. (The same principle applies if you hook a 
Mac up to a projector for a presentation.) In all of
these cases, the user needs to be able to manage
the various displays, which is pleasantly simple
with Panther.
To configure your Macintosh to work with two 
monitors (or a monitor and a projector), follow
these steps:
In order to use multiple monitors with your
Mac, you need an extra video-out port. Laptop
users have an extra by default; desktop users
need a second video card or a video card with
two ports.
1.
Connect both displays to your Mac.
When connecting any new display, turn the 
display (monitor, television, or projector) off,
make the connection, and then turn the display
on. You do not have to turn your Mac off when
connecting a display. 
2.
Open the Displays dialog in System
Preferences.
3.
Click the Detect Displays button.
This button brings the new monitor to the Mac’s
attention.
You do not need to restart your Mac to 
connect or disconnect another monitor.
From this menu, you can choose 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, or
12. Any font of the size that you choose or smaller
will be anti-aliased. Those larger won’t be.
4.
Close the Appearance dialog.
The higher the font number set for smoothing
in the Appearance dialog, the greater the toll
that it’ll take on your computer’s performance.
Shareware Options
Unsanity Software (www.unsanity.com) is the maker of
Silk, a haxie (a little computer hack) for manipulating fonts.
The $10 application enables the text-rendering capabilities
that Panther has thanks to its Quartz foundation. The result
will be anti-aliased (smoother) fonts in all Carbon-ized
applications such as the Netscape and Mozilla browser. Silk
also allows you to more finely adjust the system fonts. If you
really like a cleaner look, it’s worth considering.
TinkerTool, a must-have freeware application provided by
Marcel Bresink (www.bresink.de/en), adds many differ-
ent customization options to Panther. It’s been so popular
in its many incarnations that its features frequently end up
in later versions of OS X. One adjustment that TinkerTool
can make is what fonts to use as the default system fonts, as
shown in the following figure. 
By adjusting these fonts, you can have a more personalized
interface, correct for a screen resolution’s settings, and
more accurately control when font smoothing takes place.

Using Multiple Displays
51
4.
Click the Arrangement tab in the main display
window.
When using the Displays dialog with multiple
monitors, you will see two separate windows.
The main display window (see Figure 6-8)
appears on the display that also has the Dock
and the menu bars. The second display (see
Figure 6-9) appears on the subordinate monitor.
• Figure 6-8: The main display panel controls the
arrangement of multiple monitors.
5.
In the main display, move the monitor icons
around so that they correspond with their 
literal relation to each other.
The two connected displays are represented
by the two blue squares in the box below the
Arrangement tab (refer to Figure 6-8). The
main display is indicated by the white bar going
across the top of the one icon, which represents
the menu bar. When you understand which icon
represents which monitor, you can click and 
drag the icons to arrange them the same way
your displays are physically arranged. If you
are using a monitor and a projector, then how
they are arranged in the Displays panel doesn’t
matter (as the screens are not next to each
other), but you still need to visualize how
the two screens meet up. 
• Figure 6-9: A secondary display panel controls only
the resolution and color settings for the
second monitor.
If you are using two monitors in a non-mirroring
format, you have essentially one large work-
space created by virtually combining the two
display areas. Consequently, the cursor scrolls
off the edge of one monitor and onto the
other. For those to work best, the monitors
should be arranged in the Displays dialog as
they are physically arranged in your work area
or you need to comprehend how the cursor
gets from a monitor to the projector’s screen
(by scrolling off of one side or the other).
6.
Move the menu bar icon to dictate which moni-
tor is the primary. (The primary monitor will
have the menu bar and the Dock.)
As we said in Step 5, the white bar on the top of
the one display icon represents the menu bar.
You can click and drag this from one monitor
icon to the other in order to set the primary
computer. Your primary computer will show the
menu bar at the top, the Dock, and any mounted
volumes on your Desktop (if it’s set to do so).
If you possess two monitors, you can either use
them to display two different things simultaneously,
or to have them mirror each other. Mirroring means
that both monitors display the same thing at the

Technique 6: Working with Displays
52
4.
Use the menu bar Display icon to turn mirror-
ing on and off as necessary.
When giving a presentation, you can use your
Mac’s ability to easily turn monitoring on and
off to your advantage. If you want both moni-
tors to present the same information, turn 
mirroring on. If you’d like to do something
without everyone in the room seeing it, tem-
porarily turn off mirroring and then use the
nonprojected display.
Quartz Extreme
Panther now supports a feature called Quartz Extreme.
Quartz is the underlying technology that handles 2-D
graphics, which is most everything that you see on a daily
basis. A system that uses Quartz Extreme performs signifi-
cantly faster than one that isn’t.
Unfortunately, running a second monitor might disable the
Quartz Extreme feature because it requires AGP 2x
(Advanced Graphics Port) with 16MB VRAM. Running
Quartz Extreme on two monitors requires a video card that
can provide these minimum requirements for each. In
order to see whether your system is Quartz Extreme-
accelerated (as shown in the following figure), check out
the free Quartz Extreme Check tool on Marc’s Web site
(www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/).
same time — which is useful when giving presenta-
tions because you can work on your computer while
still controlling the overhead projection. The cursor
moves in sync on both displays. To use mirroring:
1.
If you haven’t already, enable the Display
menu bar icon (see “Managing Your Display
Resolution,” earlier in this chapter).
The Display menu bar tool provides you with
quicker access to your monitor settings,
including mirroring, resolution, and detecting
new displays.
2.
Click the Display menu bar icon and select
Turn On Mirroring from the menu that appears
(see Figure 6-10).
3.
Still using the Display menu bar menu (refer to
Figure 6-10), set the appropriate screen resolu-
tion for both monitors.
In earlier versions of OS X, both monitors had to
use the same resolution for mirroring to work;
fortunately, this is no longer the case.
• Figure 6-10: Control mirroring and the resolution of
both monitors by clicking the Display
menu bar icon.

Speedy Keyboard
Navigation
I
f you read only one Technique in this entire book, make it this one. If
you read only two, read the next one, too. Both of these chapters dis-
cuss keyboard shortcuts: quickly gettting around and doing stuff with
your fingers firmly placed on the keys. Remember: Every time that your
hands have to leave the keyboard to access the mouse, you lose seconds
that could be better spent typing (or playing games).
We’ve divided all the requisite keyboard navigation techniques into two
broad categories: moving around within Finder windows and the more
specific “Getting Places” section, which discusses how to get yourself to
different spots on the computer and your network. The first and longest
section of this chapter covers all the ins and outs of navigating windows,
which are the basic unit of the Finder. This is preceded by a brief intro-
duction to the various keyboard shortcut symbols that you find in
Panther — a sort of Rosetta stone for these commands. We also cover
the Desktop because not everything you do takes place inside a window.
The final section is something of a catch-all that shows you how to quickly
access different parts of your Mac. These shortcuts can be used inside or
outside of Finder windows.
Keyboard Characters
Many of the keyboard navigation techniques can be found onscreen, for
example, in the Go menu (see Figure 7-1). To use these shortcuts, you
have to first know what the different symbols mean. In case you never
knew or simply forgot, Table 7-1 shows how Panther symbolically
refers to the modifier keys (Ô, Option, Control, Shift, and Del):

Moving Around in a
Finder Window
Navigation, manipulating, and otherwise using the
Finder windows is such an integral part of getting
the most out of Panther that we devote this and the
next three Techniques to covering it. In Panther, the
windows are highly customizable so that users can
tweak them to their own particular preferences.
If you really, really, really want to be able
to use your Mac faster, learn to type well.
Knowing how to type is infinitely quicker
than hunting and pecking. It’ll also improve
the speed benefits of these keyboard shortcut
chapters.
The Finder has many different shortcuts, which
might leave beginning users a bit overwhelmed at
first. The shortcuts can vary depending on what
view mode you’re using. The Finder supports
three view modes:

Icon view

List view

Column view
In this Technique, we discuss some keyboard short-
cuts that work regardless of the view mode and then
cover those that work only in a particular view mode.
While in a window, use Ô+1 to switch to icon
view, Ô+2  to go to list view, and Ô+3 for 
column view.
Navigating in any view mode
These navigational tips apply regardless of the view
mode being used:

Type a letter to go to the first item whose name
begins with that letter.

Moving Around in a Finder Window
55

If multiple items begin with the same letter, type
two or more letters to be more selective.

Press Tab repeatedly to jump alphabetically
through a window’s contents.

Hold down Shift while pressing Tab repeatedly
to scroll backwards alphabetically through a 
window’s contents.

Press Ô+[ or ] to move backward or forward,
respectively, like how clicking the Back and
Forward buttons in a Web browser works. This
even includes returning to previously used
view modes.
A Finder window can contain any combination
of files, applications, folders, network links, and
even volumes (hard drives, removable drives,
discs). We use the generic items to collectively
refer to all these things. (In other words,
items means things you might find in a
Finder window.)

Use Ô+~ (the tilde, found in the upper-left corner
of the keyboard) to toggle among the open win-
dows and the Desktop.

Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to
move as you would expect (namely, left, right,
up, or down).
Which view mode you use is best determined
by context and personal tastes. Technique 10
discusses the merits of each individually and
helps you decide when you should use which.
Navigating in icon view
The icon view mode (see Figure 7-2) shows the 
window’s contents as, well, icons. Although icon
view also shows each item’s name, you mostly see
the icons themselves. The basic shortcuts described
in the previous section also work in icon view.
• Figure 7-2: Icon view mode is familiar to every Mac user,
although yours may look slightly different.
Use Ô+1 to switch to icon view.
In addition, here are some Ô options that you can
use to navigate in icon view:

Press Ô+↑to go up one level (to the parent
folder, as Panther describes it).

Use Ô+↓to go into the selected folder (see the
Ch 10 folder in Figure 7-3).
• Figure 7-3: In icon view, a folder is marked as selected
when the name is highlighted in the selection
color.

Press Ô+W to close the Finder preferences
panel.
If you enable this option, Panther opens up a new window
every time you open a directory. We find that this habit cre-
ates a very busy work environment, so we prefer to simply
use Ô+Shift+O to manually request a new window when
we need one.
Navigating in list view
The list view (see Figure 7-4) shows the contents of
a folder as an itemized list. It always lists the names
of the items, but may also display various other
properties. (You can customize what properties
are shown. For more information, see

• Figure 7-4: The list view mode.
Use Ô+2 to switch to list view.
Here are some basic commands for navigating
through list view:

Use the up and down arrows to move up and
down the list.

Press the right arrow on your keyboard to
expand a selected folder (see Figure 7-5). This is
the equivalent of clicking on the little right-point-
ing triangle next to an item’s name with your
mouse pointer.

Use the left arrow to close an expanded folder,
assuming that it’s selected. This is the equivalent
of clicking on a down-pointing triangle with your
mouse.

Press Ô+O to go into a selected folder.
Ô+O is the keyboard shortcut for opening
items in general. You can use it to navigate
by opening a folder, to start an application
by “opening” its icon, or to open a file.

Press Ô+Shift+O to open the currently selected
folder in a new window.

Window with That?
If you really like windows, you can set the Finder to open all
directories in their own new window. To do so:

preferences panel.
2.
Select the Always Open Folders in a New
Window check box.

• Figure 7-5: Expand a selected directory by using the right
keyboard arrow.
On top of these basic commands, all the Ô keyboard
shortcuts that work for the icon view also work in
the list view. For a refresher on those, refer to the
section, “Navigating in icon view.”
Navigating in column view
The column view mode is the most complex of the
three. It works a little like the list view mode but also
allows you to navigate forward and backward by
viewing the hierarchy as a series of columns within
the Finder window (see Figure 7-6).
• Figure 7-6: The curious but extremely useful column view
mode.
Use Ô+3 to switch to column view.
Here are some frequently used shortcuts for
column view:

Use the up and down arrows to move up and
down within a column.

Press the right arrow to move one column to the
right (see Figure 7-7).
• Figure 7-7: The right arrow moves you into a subfolder’s
listing column.

Use the left arrow to move one column to
the left.
When in column mode, the currently selected
item is highlighted using your selection/high-
light color (blue in these images). The gray
highlight in preceding columns indicates
which folder’s contents are listed in the current
column. For example, in Figure 7-7, the cur-
rently selected item is the folder called OS X
TT for Dummies, which is highlighted in the
selection color. The items listed in this column
are all in the Books folder, which is highlighted
in gray in the previous column.
The quickest way to navigate through
columns is to type the initial letter of an
item to select it, and then press the right
arrow to move to the next column. Repeat
until you find the item or directory you are
looking for.
Panther offers you the choice of using column view
as your default view mode. To do so:
1.
Get yourself over to the Finder by clicking the
Desktop or the Finder icon in the Dock.

upon how you’ve customized your Desktop (for
example, what disks, servers, and devices will
appear there). The basics are

Pressing the arrow keys works as expected, mov-
ing you up, down, left, and right.

Pressing the Tab key moves you alphabetically
from item to item.

Pressing Shift+Tab moves you reverse alphabeti-
cally from item to item.

Typing the first letter or two of any item’s name
selects that item.
Within Open/Save dialogs, Ô+D is the short-
cut to your Desktop.
The following four shortcuts all require the ever-
popular Ô key:

Ô+N creates a new Finder window showing the
default directory.
Use the Finder’s preferences to determine
which directory a new window should open
(refer to Figure 7-8).

Ô+Shift+↑takes you to the boot disk drive
on the Desktop (the volume on which the 
running operating system is installed; see 
Figure 7-9).

Ô+O opens a folder, volume, file, or 
application.

Ô+↓opens a folder or volume.

of its own, most of which will get you to a Finder

Getting Places
The final type of navigational shortcut that we dis-
cuss shows you how to get to important spots on
your Mac. These work whether you are in a Finder
window or just on the Desktop itself. The first three
are the most critical:
Most of these keyboard shortcuts are dupli-
cated — and listed — in the Finder’s Go menu
(refer to Figure 7-1).

Ô+Shift+A takes you to the Applications 
directory.

Ô+Shift+U goes to the Utilities directory.

Ô+Shift+H moves you to your Home folder.
These are also handy typing tips, but many users
might never need them:

Ô+Shift+K brings up the window displaying avail-
able networks.

Ô+K brings up the Connect to Server prompt.

Ô+Shift+I mounts your iDisk (for .Mac users
only).

Ô+? retrieves the Help Viewer application. (This
is technically Ô+Shift+/ because you need to
press the Shift key to get the question mark.)
One of the shareware applications that we 
discuss most often in this book is LaunchBar,
created by Objective Development (www.
obdev.at; $39 for businesses, $20 for per-
sonal use, free for limited use). Use LaunchBar
to quickly and easily get to applications, send
e-mails, open Web pages, and more without
ever leaving your keyboard. In fact, that’s the
entire point: LaunchBar lets you do many
common tasks just by typing short abbrevia-
tions. See Techniques 21, 30, and 33 for spe-
cific examples.
Another method of getting around your computer is
to use Full Keyboard Access. Full Keyboard Access
enables you to use the Tab, arrow, and other keys to
select onscreen items. To enable this:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click Keyboard & Mouse.
3.
Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab of the
Keyboard & Mouse panel that appears.
4.
Select the Turn on Full Keyboard Access check
box (see Figure 7-10).
5.
Under Description, click any of the right-
pointing arrows to expand a section.
6.
Mark the box next to a shortcut or shortcut
group to enable or disable it.

original settings.
• Figure 7-11: The Keyboard Navigation shortcuts can really
minimize the need to use the mouse.
After you select the Dock by pressing
Control+F3, you can toggle from icon to icon
by using the left and right arrow keys or Tab
and Shift+Tab. Press Return to select a high-
lighted icon.
Pressing Control+F4 repeatedly rotates
you through every open window in every
open application. Control+F5 takes you 
to the toolbar of the currently active
window.
When you’re in the toolbar of a window, use
Tab and Shift+Tab to move around. You can
use the spacebar to select an item, just like
clicking it with your mouse.
• Figure 7-10: Use the Keyboard Shortcuts tab to enable
Full Keyboard Access.
The Keyboard Shortcuts panel is a potent tool
for those who know how to use it. You can
even use it to add your own customized 
shortcuts. See Technique 8 for some further
examples.
The default keyboard shortcuts, listed in the
Shortcut column of Figure 7-11, primarily use the
Control key in conjunction with your function keys.
Under the Keyboard Navigation heading in Figure
7-11, you’ll see that:

Control+F2 takes you to the menu bar. (It’s
just like clicking the menu bar with your 
mouse.)

Control+F3 takes you to the Dock.
To change any of the default shortcuts, double-
click the shortcut and hold down the shortcut
keys that you would prefer. Click the Restore

61
Using Go To Folder
In the Finder, the Ô+Shift+G keyboard shortcut brings up
the Go To Folder dialog, which you can use to quickly nav-
igate to specific directories. 
Using the Go To Folder dialog offers the following benefits:

A new Finder window is opened if one isn’t open
already.

If a Finder window is open, Go To Folder operates
within it.

Tab completion (which allows you to type just a few
characters and then press Tab to complete the entry)
saves you from typing in long names.

The Go To Folder dialog is case-insensitive.

For those familiar with the cd command, the Go To
Folder dialog works identically to it.
The only trick to using Go To Folder is that you need to
know the path name for that destination. A path name is
the path of folders that you must follow to find something
on the computer. For example:

The base (root) level is /.

Apple’s e-mail client is in /Applications.

A file on Larry’s Desktop would be under
/Users/larry/Desktop (where larry is the short
username that he registered with).

Larry’s Desktop could also be written in shorthand as
~/Desktop, where ~ (the tilde) represents the cur-
rent user’s Home directory.

A folder on a secondary volume would have a 
path name of /Volumes/volumename/
foldername.
This might seem like more trouble than it’s worth, but if
you have a basic understanding of where things are on
your computer, Panther will really help you out.
To start:
1.
Bring up the Go menu prompt by pressing 
Ô+Shift+G.
2.
Start typing the path name with either
 ~/ (refers to your Home directory)
 / (refers to the root or base level of the 
computer)
3.
Begin typing the first letter or first few letters
of the directory that’s next in the path name.
For example, if something is in your Documents
folder, type Do or Doc after the ~/. If it’s on your 
second hard drive, type /Vo.
4.
Press the Tab key to have Panther complete
the directory name.
Or, if you wait just a moment, the directory name is
automatically filled in.
5.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the full path name
of the folder that you want to explore is 
written out.
(continued)

Technique 7: Speedy Keyboard Navigation

6.
Press Return or click Go to load that directory
in a Finder window.
All in all, Go To Folder is a really smart way to quickly hop
to specific destinations on your computer. Further, getting
comfortable with this system makes the transition to using
the Terminal for command line tasks less daunting. (And
most power users eventually get around to taking the
Terminal for a spin.)

Essential Keyboard
Shortcuts
I
n the preceding Technique, we discuss and demonstrate most (if not
all) of the keyboard navigational techniques that you can use to get
around in Finder windows specifically and the operating system as a
whole. In this Technique, we follow with a discussion of the other key-
board shortcuts.
We begin with a hodgepodge of keyboard combinations that you ought
to know if you don’t already. These combinations cover a number of 
common tasks. Then we go over application-related shortcuts: those
key combinations that are used to navigate among open applications
and those that work within all applications. Finally, this Technique 
covers the function keys and how to set your own keyboard shortcuts.
The Most Essential of the Essential 
Keyboard Shortcuts
This and the preceding Technique present a cornucopia of useful and
worthy keyboard shortcuts, but you might have difficultly memorizing
them all. These, therefore, are the most important all-purpose shortcuts:

Pressing Return is the same as clicking OK, Yes, Continue, or whatever
the default action is for a button in a prompt (see Figure 8-1).
• Figure 8-1: The Return key is the same as clicking the highlighted button.

Bring up this panel by selecting Preferences
from the Finder menu and clicking the
General tab.
• Figure 8-3: Use the Finder’s preferences to adjust a new
window’s default behavior.

Ô+Delete sends an item to the Trash.

Ô+Option+Delete takes the Trash to the curb
(which is to say, empties it).
Those are the most critical keyboard shortcuts, but
here are a few more that are easy to remember and
quite useful:

Ô+W closes the active window.

Ô+Option+W closes every open window.

Ô+M minimizes an open window.

Ô+Option+M minimizes every open window.

Pressing Esc is the same as clicking Cancel.

Ô+A selects everything in the currently used
directory or document.

Ô+C copies the selected (or highlighted) text or
image to the Clipboard.

Ô+X deletes the selected (or highlighted) text or
image and stores it on the Clipboard.

Ô+V pastes the current contents of the
Clipboard into the current document, window, or
other location.

Ô+Z undoes the previous action, whatever it is.
Most people know that the Ô+Z trick works
in applications to undo the last action, but it
also functions in the Finder. You can use this
shortcut to undelete a deleted (but not
trashed) file, or to unmove something. Pretty
much whatever you just did can be undone
with Ô+Z.

Ô+O opens anything (folders, files, volumes, or
applications).

Ô+F brings up the Find prompt (see Figure 8-2
for an example of a Find prompt; this one is
from Safari).
• Figure 8-2: Safari’s Find prompt.

Ô+Option+N creates a new folder within the cur-
rent directory.

Ô+N creates a new Finder window.
In the Finder Preferences panel, you can use
the New Finder Windows Open drop-down
box to set in which directory each new Finder
window automatically opens (see Figure 8-3).

Application Shortcuts
65

Ô+P prints a document.

Ô+I brings up the Get Info prompt, where you
can find information about (as well as control)
some of the properties of a file, a folder, or an
application.

Ô+J brings up a window’s (or the Desktop’s)
view options.

Ô+Shift+Q lets you log out.
The previous shortcuts work in the Finder and some
of them also function within applications (particu-
larly those by Apple). These shortcuts are more par-
ticular to the Finder:

Ô+D duplicates the currently selected item or
items.
If you can’t or don’t want to remember that
Ô+D duplicates items, you can always select
the item, copy it by pressing Ô+C, and then
create the duplicate by pasting the copied
item with Ô+V.

Ô+L makes an alias to the currently selected
item or items. An alias (what Windows calls a
shortcut) is a reference to an item. These are 
discussed in Technique 15.

Ô+R locates an original file that an alias or a
pointer represents.
The Ô+R shortcut is most useful in two spe-
cific instances. In the Finder, if you select an
alias, it takes you to the item that the alias
points to. In iTunes, if you select a particular
track, Ô+R takes you to the physical file on
your computer.

Ô+T adds the selected item to the window’s side-
bar (see Technique 10 for more).

Ô+E ejects the selected disk or disc. (This disc
could be an external FireWire hard drive, a Zip
or floppy disk, a CD-ROM or DVD, or a mounted
disk image.)
Universal Access
Panther users with special needs should seriously consider
using Universal Access, which is a special set of accessibility
tools for improving the standard Panther interface.
Universal Access information can be found in the Universal
Access System Preferences panel, and most of the relevant
shortcuts are repeated under the Keyboard Shortcuts sec-
tion of the Keyboard & Mouse panel.
For starters, Universal Access provides keyboard shortcuts
to useful visual tools, such as zooming in and out, toggling
between color and black and white, and adjusting the con-
trast. Furthermore, you can set Universal Access to help use
the keyboard by conforming to your typing abilities. For
example, Panther can be set to consider a sequence of
modifier keys the same as pressing all the keys simultane-
ously (for example, pressing Ô followed by Option and
then O would be equated with Ô+Option+O).
Application Shortcuts
Pretty much everything that you do on your Mac
takes place within an application (technically, 
everything you do takes place within an application
because the Finder is considered an app). Most
Panther users have several applications open at any

Technique 8: Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
66
Safari, Internet Explorer, and a few other appli-
cations all have a command similar to Ô+Tab.
You can use Ô+~ (tilde) to toggle among the
open windows.
Working with many applications and windows has
two primary considerations: switching among them
and clearing out the clutter. Knowing how to hide
current and background applications goes a long
way towards creating a neater workspace and giving
you better peace of mind.

Use Ô+H to hide the current application.

Use Ô+Option+H to hide all the background
applications.
Exposé, Panther’s new window management
tool, creates special mouse and keyboard com-
mands to access all the open windows for the
current application or the whole operating sys-
tem. Get thee over to Technique 13 to find out
all about it.
Getting Fancy with Ô+Tab
Strange is it might seem, you can also use your mouse (or
other input device) in conjunction with Ô+Tab. After you
bring up the palette, you can hover your cursor over an
application’s icon to select it and then release the Ô key to
travel there. You don’t even need to click the mouse for this
to work.
This means that you can perform drag-and-drop actions
with Ô+Tab and your mouse or other input device:
1.
In an open application, select the text, image, or 
whatever you want to copy elsewhere.
2.
Click and hold the selection.
3.
While continuing to hold your mouse click, drag
the selection slightly off in any direction.
4.
Press Ô+Tab to bring up the open application’s 
pallete.
5.
Use either your cursor or Tab to select the desti-
nation application (while continuing to hold both
the mouse button and the Ô key).
one time. Although Part IV of the book really covers
applications in all their glory, here are the highlights
that ought to be second nature.
Technique 22 addresses application switching
in greater detail, discussing several different
shareware applications that can be used
expressly for this purpose. These include
LiteSwitch X (www.proteron.com/
liteswitchx/, $15) and App Switcher
(www.mikeash.com/software/
appswitcher/, free).
Here’s an easy way to switch applications:
1.
Begin by holding down the Ô key and then
pressing Tab to bring up a palette listing the
currently open applications, with the most
recently used application automatically
selected (see Figure 8-4).
• Figure 8-4: The list of currently running applications.
2.
While holding down the Ô key, continue 
pressing Tab to move between the application
icons until the desired application is selected.
Press Ô+Shift+Tab to go in reverse order.
3.
Release the Ô key to bring up the selected
application.

6.
Release the Ô key to bring up the destination 
application.
7.
Position your cursor in the appropriate location
in the new application.
8.
Release the mouse key to complete the move.
This process might seem foreign at first, but it’s remarkably
effective and a good alternative to copying and pasting.
Function Keys
The purpose of the function keys changes dramati-
cally based on whether you’re using a desktop or a
laptop Mac. Desktop Mac users have no default func-
tion key purposes, although many of them are taken
by existing applications and Finder shortcuts.
Laptop users might need to hold down the fn
button to use the function keys for other than
their default purposes.
Laptop users, on the other hand, ought to familiarize
themselves with using these default functions:

F1 dims the display.

F2 brightens the display.

F3 mutes the sound.

F4 lowers the sound volume.

F5 increases the sound volume.

F6 engages the number lock feature, turning the
keypad into a number pad.
piDog Software (www.pidog.com), the maker of
some pretty snazzy Mac OS X software, puts
out an application called SimpleKeys ($15).
SimpleKeys allows you to program the function
keys to automatically insert customizable text
into documents. This might conflict with some
of the many other uses of the function keys, but
if you do find yourself repeating paragraphs of
text over and over again (in e-mail perhaps),
you might want to consider it.
Programming Your Own
Keyboard Shortcuts
The Macintosh has supported programming the
function keys in many ways over the years, but now
Panther includes a beautiful new tool that does even
more. From the Keyboard Shortcuts panel, you can
create your own keyboard shortcuts that call menu
commands. These shortcuts can work in a particular
application or all of them. Here’s a primer on how
to use it:
1.
Open the System Preferences panel.
2.
Click Keyboard & Mouse (under Hardware).
3.
In the Keyboard & Mouse panel, click the
Keyboard Shortcuts tab to bring up that
panel (see Figure 8-5).
• Figure 8-5: The Keyboard Shortcuts panel with some of
Panther’s default shortcuts.
Even if you never want to create your own
keyboard shortcuts, the Keyboard Shortcuts
panel is still great for reminding you of many
of the existing shortcuts that you can use.

A Faster Finder
T
he Mac OS X Finder is a frequently used, yet often underused,
application. It is the main interface for you to access files, applica-
tions, CD-ROMs, and more. Being familiar with it and knowing how
to customize its behavior to suit your tastes is critical to saving time on
your Mac.
This Technique begins with the various Finder preferences that can
be set within Panther. Included after this section is a treatment of the
Finder’s many menus. Then a number of the input-device-related short-
cuts are covered (the “clicking” equivalent of many of the keyboard
shortcuts listed in the preceding two Techniques). Finally, we introduce
and discuss some of the shareware and freeware applications that you
might want to use to improve your Finder.
Finder Preferences
The Finder has two main areas that can be customized (aside from the
Finder windows themselves, which are an entirely other topic; see
Technique 10): one specifically for the Desktop; and another, more gen-
eral, set of preferences. To bring up the Finder preferences panel, either

Press Ô + , (comma).
or

Click Finder on the menu bar and then select Preferences.
To customize the Desktop, press Ô+J or go to Show View Options in
the View menu. This topic is covered in Technique 14.
The preferences panel (see Figure 9-1) is divided into four sections:
General, Labels, Sidebar, and Advanced.

Always Open Folders in a New Window:
Selecting this check box is useful only if you
really, really like having lots of open windows
around.

Open New Windows in Column View: Column
view is the only view mode that can be set as the
default view for new windows.

Spring-Loaded Folders and Windows: Spring-
loaded folders and windows pop open when you
drag something onto them. If you start dragging
a file and hold it over a folder, that folder springs
open so that you can place the file within a sub-
folder. You can even continue to spring open 
subfolders, allowing you to place a file several
directories into your hard drive without 
navigating there first.
Labels
After dropping off the radar in earlier versions of
Mac OS X, Labels — OS 9’s color-coded decorating
tool — has made a triumphant comeback in Panther.
In fact, it’s better than ever. Labels allow you to mark
items with a special highlight color, each color hav-
ing its own particular meaning. To assign what the
different colors represent, do the following:
1.
Open Finder’s preferences panel by pressing Ô
+ , (comma).
2.
Click the Labels button (see Figure 9-2).
3.
Highlight a color name and change the text to
whatever label makes the most sense to you.
4.
Tab to the next label and change that text.
Repeat until a label name is set for each color.
5.
Close the Finder’s preferences panel.
To use the Labels, follow these steps
1.
Select the item or items in a Finder window.
2.
Control+click the item to bring up the contex-
tual menu (see Figure 9-3).
• Figure 9-1: The Finder’s preferences panel.
General
The General section has a few important controls:

Show These Items on the Desktop: We recom-
mend marking all these check boxes, which
makes accessing these items and knowing what’s
connected or mounted to your computer easier.

New Finder Windows Open: Use this drop-down
list to determine what folder is the default folder
when opening new windows. Setting this value
saves you a navigational step (for example, hop-
ping over to your Home directory) with each
new window.
If you keep your Home directory organized as
Apple recommends and you use it accord-
ingly, set the Finder to open all new windows
in the Home directory, where every document
that you need is stored.

• Figure 9-2: The Labels panel with its default values.
3.
Under the Color Label heading on the contex-
tual menu, click the appropriate color.
When you click each color, the contextual menu
shows the label associated with each color to
make the selection easier and more accurate (in
Figure 9-4, the label reads “Urgent”).
In icon view mode, the item’s name is highlighted in
the label color (see Figure 9-5). In list and column
view mode, the entire line is highlighted. After
you’ve begun using labels, you can add the Label
column to the list view windows (see the section
“Show View Options” later in this chapter for
instructions) and then sort by using this value (see
Figure 9-6).
Sidebar
The Sidebar preferences panel (see Figure 9-7)
affects which items appear in a window’s sidebar.
The top half of the Sidebar preferences panel dictates
what appears in the top half of the window sidebar,
whereas the bottom half controls whether three spe-
cific folders — the Desktop, your Home directory, or
the Applications folder — appear in the bottom half
of the window sidebar.
• Figure 9-3: Add a label to an item from its contextual
menu.
Enable or disable those items in the Sidebar
preferences panel that you will not use or
access on a regular basis.
The Sidebar panel is the only place where you
can customize the top half of the window’s
sidebar. The bottom half can also be customized
manually. See Technique 10 for more.

Panther (see Figure 9-8). If you’re most comfortable
dealing with files in this manner, you can set the
Finder to always show the file extensions. (Note: A

The third option under the Advanced panel, which
allows you to select the language for searching file
contents, is often overlooked. In Technique 16, we
show you the how’s and why’s of using this setting
to improve the efficiency of your Finder searches.

or

Pressing Ô+J.
The View Options settings apply to the currently
active window, if one is open and active. If no 
window is open and active, the View Options 
panel applies to the Desktop.
When you apply the View Options to the Desktop
(see Figure 9-9), you control only how items appear
on the Desktop. (View Options can affect Finder win-
dows more dramatically.) The first three settings —
Icon Size, Text Size, and Label Position — do what
you’d expect: control how big an item’s icon is in
pixels, adjust the point size for the item’s name, and
position the item’s name either underneath or to the
right of the item’s icon.
• Figure 9-9: The View Options panel controls both
windows and the Desktop.
If your monitor is set at a high resolution (see
Technique 6), you can increase the size of your
icons and label text to accommodate this.
The final four check boxes in the View Options dialog
affect how items are arranged on the Desktop and
what information is revealed. The most important


Finder: The Finder menu gives you access to its
preferences panel (see earlier in this Technique),
controls the showing and hiding of applications,
and links to Services (see Technique 27).

File: The File menu is for basic file-management
stuff (such as opening and closing) and includes
most of the often-used commands and keyboard
shortcuts.

Edit: The Edit menu, like any application’s Edit
menu, gives you access to editing shortcuts, the
keyboard equivalents of which ought to be sec-
ond nature to any power user. Two interesting
features here show you the contents of the
Clipboard (useful if you forget what you pasted
there) and bring up the Character Palette to
access special characters.

View: The View menu is mostly useful with
respect to windows (see Technique 10). Most
of the options are grayed out (unusable)
unless you’re in a Finder window. The
remaining choices will affect the Desktop.
The View menu lets you customize a selected
Finder window or the Desktop. Conversely, the
Window menu lets you control windows: You
can switch among open windows, minimize a
window, and bring all windows to focus.

Go: The Go menu is a nice little navigational tool,
giving you links and the keyboard equivalents for
quickly accessing common places. We prefer the
keyboard shortcuts ourselves, but the menu
option is nice to have, and you’ll find the key-
board shortcuts listed there as a reminder.

Window: The Window menu controls the open
Finder windows (much like an application’s
Window folder gives you access to the open 
documents in that application). Although it
does give you an easy way to handle the mess
of multiple windows, you might find Exposé to
be an easier solution.

of these is Keep Arranged By, which allows you to
maintain order in an otherwise chaotic universe (or

your Desktop by Name, Date Modified, Date Created,
Size, Kind, or Label.
If you select the Show Item Info check box,
image sizes are displayed along with their
names, and volumes sizes (including remain-
ing space) are listed below their names. The
Show Icon Preview check box turns an
image’s icon into a miniature representation 
of the actual image (in icon view only).
Menus
The Finder, like any other application, has a series of
menus across the top of the display where you can
access commonly used features. The Finder’s menus
are located in two areas:

In the upper-left corner are the standard
menus (see Figure 9-10).

In the upper-right corner are extra and third-
party menus (see Figure 9-11).
• Figure 9-10: The standard Finder menus.
• Figure 9-11: The extended Finder menus, including third-
party additions.
The standard menus include

Apple: The Apple menu is the catch-all for
Panther. Including system tools such as Software
Update and System Preferences, it allows you to
change the Dock settings and your network loca-
tion, and it also lists the most recently used items.
The bottom half of the Apple menu is for force-
quitting applications, shutting down, restarting,
putting your Mac to sleep, and logging out. (Read
more on some of these in Technique 5.)

Menus
75
The right side menu area is a more flexible place;
what’s there depends upon what you’ve enabled.
For example:

The Fast User Switching menu appears here
if Fast User Switching is enabled under 
Accounts.

The system clock reveals itself if set in the Date &
Time control panel.

The display menu makes an appearance if set in

To rearrange or remove an item from the
right-side of the menu bar, hold down the Ô
key while clicking on the icon. Then you can
either drag the item off to remove it (it will
disappear in a cloud of smoke) or drag it side
to side to move it (the other icons will move
out of its way).
AppleScript’s Script Menu
If you’re not already familiar with it, AppleScript is a power-
ful automating tool that has been part of the Mac operating
system for years. It’s so easy to work with that even non-
programmers can grasp its concepts, and yet potent
enough that seasoned programmers will be pleased. Not
only does Panther come with literally dozens of pre-built
AppleScripts, but it even comes with a tool for easily access-
ing them: Script Menu.
To enable Script Menu and add a menu icon for it
1.
In the Finder, navigate to Applications➪AppleScript.
2.
Double-click the Install Script Menu icon.
3.
Click the new AppleScript logo located on the
right side of the Finder menu.
The logo looks like a stylized S, or a scroll.

the UNIX infrastructure, which allows open source
software to run on a Mac. It’s also thanks to the
many easy-to-use tools for developing OS X software,
such as REALbasic, AppleScript, and Xcode. We’ll
quickly mention a few Finder-related tools that you
might want to consider.
TinkerTool
TinkerTool (www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html,
free) is not only an innovator in Mac customization,
it’s also free. TinkerTool is so popular than many of
its features eventually get added to the operating
system itself.
Some of the highlights of what TinkerTool can do
include

Reveal hidden files and folders in the Finder.

Add to the customization options for the Dock.

Further customize the scroll bars in windows.

Determine the different system fonts and adjust
the smoothing of them.

Reset all the “tinkered” settings back to the
Panther defaults.
For more information on working with TinkerTool,
see Technique 53.
wClock
wClock (www.wolfware.com/wclock/, free) is a system
clock replacement program with just a couple of
extra features. The clock’s formatting is customiz-
able, and if you click it in the menu bar, a browseable
calendar appears (see Figure 9-12).
A more potent alternative to wClock is iClock
(www.scriptsoftware.com/iclock/index.
html, $20). Although it’s not free, it comes
with many more features than either the 
system clock or wClock.
• Figure 9-12: wClock’s calendar pops up when you click
wClock in the menu bar.
Changing Themes
Another way to customize your Finder is to adjust what
theme it uses. By default, the Finder uses the Aqua theme,
which controls the appearance of windows, buttons, alerts,
fonts, and more. (Basically everything that gives the operat-
ing system a consistent look from application to application
is set in the theme.)
Changing your theme isn’t for the faint of heart (Apple
generally discourages the practice) and, arguably, has a
minor payoff. But those of you who like to tinker should
head over to www.ResExcellence.com/themes to down-
load different themes and find links to useful shareware.
You’ll probably want one of the following:

ShapeShifter (www.unsanity.com, $20), which lets
you change themes in the least intrusive way possible.

which allows you to change the themes (they call
them schemes). Duality is available in both free and
professional (cost) versions.

ThemeChanger (http://sourceforge.net/
projects/themechanger/), which will also
change themes.
Menu tools
A handful of shareware applications build on the
usefulness of the Finder menus. The most popular
titles are

piPop (www.pidog.com, $20 suggested), from
piDog Software: This application creates menus
underneath your cursor whenever you want (on
the Desktop or in windows), granting access to
applications, mounted volumes, and directories.

Customizing
Windows for Your
Convenience
T
he Finder window is the basic currency of the operating system.
You use the Finder to access applications and files, move items
around, organize your data, and much, much more. Previous ver-
sions of OS X introduced some new window features, and Panther has
raised the bar even more dramatically.
In this Technique, we start by discussing the three different view modes
that you can use in your Finder windows: icon, list, and column, each of
which has its own benefits. Then we show you how to customize the win-
dow’s appearance and features. Part of a window’s feature set is the new
Actions feature, which can expedite many commons tasks. We briefly dis-
cuss these before concluding with how to navigate among multiple open
windows.
Understanding the Different View Modes
The Finder’s window can display the items in a folder in three different
view modes: icon, list, and column. Each has its own benefits (and key-
board shortcuts, see Technique 8), so you should take some time to fig-
ure out which view mode works best under what circumstances. Mostly,
this is a matter of taste, but certain principles can help you make the
best decision.
To switch between the view modes, use Ô+1 for icon, Ô+2 for list,
and Ô+3 for column. If you have trouble remembering these short-
cuts, they correlate to the order of the icons in the window’s toolbar,
from left to right (as shown in Figure 10-1).

Technique 10: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
80
Icon view is limiting if you’re dealing with a directory
containing lots of items or if you’ll be running
through multiple subfolders.
If you’re viewing a directory of images, turn on
Show Icon Preview in the View Options panel
and then use icon view. This displays thumb-
nails of the window’s contents. (After you’ve
selected a window, press Ô+J or select Show
View Options from the View menu to bring
up the View Options panel.)
If Snap to Grid is enabled (meaning that
icons are arranged along imaginary grid lines
instead of free-form), icon view shows a small
grid icon in the lower-left corner of the win-
dow (refer to Figure 10-2).
Windows Backgrounds in Icon View
Icon view mode is the only mode that allows you to cus-
tomize the background of the window. Although this fea-
ture might seem like nothing more than eye candy (and it
certainly can be), it has its advantages as well. The best way
to use the background is to set a different background
color or image for different folders. That way, when you
minimize them, you can more easily know which window is
which by looking at the window’s icon in the Dock.
This allows you to distinguish between them more easily. To
set a background:
1.
Open the window in question.
2.
Bring up the View Options panel by pressing
Ô+J or by selecting Show View Options from
the View menu in the Finder.
3.
Within the View Options panel, select the This 
Window Only radio button (at the top) so that
the changes only affect this window.
4.
At the bottom of the window, select either the
Color or the Picture radio button.
• Figure 10-1: Click the icons to change view modes or use
the keyboard shortcuts.
Icon view
Icon view is familiar territory for almost everyone
and is the default view mode for mounted CD-ROMs
and disk images. Icon view (see Figure 10-2) is best
when you’re dealing with a directory containing only
a few items or if you just prefer the look and feel of
icons. Many people find selecting a group of items
(using the mouse to click and drag) an easy and nat-
ural task in icon view.
• Figure 10-2: A directory displayed in icon view mode.
This is a cool but less usable tip: In icon and
list view modes, Option+Ô+clicking any blank
window space turns the cursor into a hand,
allowing you to move the window contents
around as if it were a piece of paper on your
desk. Release the keys and the mouse button
when you’ve finished scrolling about.

List view
List view is an easy-to-use-and-understand format for
pretty much any user. It has two primary advantages:

Items are displayed as a sortable list.

Technique 10: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
82
• Figure 10-4: View Options displays different choices
based on the current view mode.
4.
Select which columns you want list view to show.
See the guidelines below for more information.
5.
Press Ô+J to close the View Options dialog 
(or click the little red circle in the upper-left
corner).
Here are some good rules for what you might want
to include in list view:

Date Modified: The Date Modified option is most
useful for sorting your windows by modification
date. Doing so brings the most recently altered
file to the top.

Date Created: The Date Created option is slightly
less useful than the Date Modified option but
works the same way.

Different details on an item are displayed simul-
taneously (see Figure 10-3).
• Figure 10-3: The same directory from Figure 10-2, now in
list view mode.
Because of these considerations, list view is the
obvious choice if you need to sort a folder’s con-
tents or view any information (such as size, modifi-
cation date, kind, creation date, and label). Also, if
you need to compare contents of subfolders, list
view is great because you can show multiple sub-
folders within the one window by expanding them.
To get the most out of list view, you must know how
to customize and use the column headings. In an
open window:
1.
Press Ô+J to bring up the View Options (see
Figure 10-4).
2.
Use the radio buttons at the top to make these
options apply to this window only or to all 
windows.
To create a default window setting for all your
windows, select All Windows in the View
Options dialog before customizing the 
settings.
3.
Set the icon and text sizes.
The icon and text sizes can be increased to make
up for a high monitor resolution, or these can
both be reduced to make list view windows show
more in a smaller space.

Understanding the Different View Modes
83

Size: The Size value is quite handy, particularly
if you’re looking for small (such as text docu-
ments) or large (like Photoshop files) items. 
This column can also be used to help you dis-
cern between multiple versions of the same file.
Sizes are not calculated for folders unless the
Calculate All Sizes check box is enabled in the
View Options panel. Keep in mind that it will
take some time to calculate large directories,
so those values do not immediately appear in
a window.

Kind: The Kind attribute of the list view is rarely
illuminating. The information that it lists (for
example, Folder, Microsoft Word document, TIFF
document) can normally be ascertained by the
item’s name and icon. It does, however, allow
you to sort by the file’s type.

Version: Frankly, we haven’t turned on a window’s
Version option in years. We can’t imagine why
you would, either.

Comments: Listing an item’s Comments is very,
very useful — if you use comments, that is. If you
don’t (like most of us), leave it unmarked. You
might use comments to note a text file’s contents
or information about an image.
You can add comments to any item by open-
ing Get Info using the Ô+I keyboard shortcut
or the File menu.

Label: Viewing the Labels, like Comments, is
great if you use them. Frankly, Panther’s Label
system is definitely worth your consideration.
See Technique 9 for information on using Labels
to your advantage.
After you’ve established what columns to use, you
should understand these facts:

The default view is to sort the items by name in
ascending order.
You can control the sorting of your files by
adding special characters to a file’s name.
Filenames that begin with a space always
come first; filenames that begin with symbols
always go last. Just don’t start a filename
with a period or it will become hidden.

Click any column heading to sort the contents
of list view by that column in ascending order.

Click again on the current sort column to sort
the contents by that column in descending
(reverse) order.

You can rearrange the columns by dragging
them, except for the Name column, which is
always in view and is always listed first.
The quickest way to see a long filename
(which can be cut off in list and column view
modes) is to hover the cursor over the
filename. After a brief moment, the file’s full
name appears. To make it appear immediately,
hold down the Option key while you hover
the cursor above the file (see Figure 10-5).
• Figure 10-5: You can view a file’s full name by hovering
your cursor above it.
Column view
Column view mode is unique. It shows a list of a
folder’s contents, like the list view, but without any
of the extra details. Further, column view opens sub-
folders in columns (opening a folder moves you one

Technique 10: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
84
Customizing Windows
Aside from the different view modes that you can
use, you can customize the Finder’s windows in
many ways. The view modes themselves customize
the window’s content area, but you can also cus-
tomize the toolbar along the top, the Sidebar along
the side (appropriately enough), and even tinker
with how the scroll bars appear and function for
larger windows.
Toolbar
The toolbar along the top of the window has been
around and customizable for a while now. Panther
has added to it by adding the Action pop-up (see the
“Using Actions” section later in this Technique) and
the search box. To customize the toolbar:
1.
Control+click the toolbar (see Figure 10-7).
• Figure 10-7: Control+click the toolbar to customize it.
2.
Select Customize Toolbar from the contextual
menu that appears.
This is the equivalent of selecting Customize
Toolbar from the View menu in the Finder. A
Customize Toolbar palette appears.
3.
Add items to the toolbar by dragging them
from the palette to their desired location on 
the toolbar (see Figure 10-8).
column to the right; closing a folder moves you one
column to the left). For these reasons, column view
mode is the fastest for quickly navigating through mul-
tiple directories. You can even set the Finder to use
column view mode by default by enabling the appro-
priate check box in the Finder preferences pane.
To save space in column view mode, disable
Show Icons in the View Options panel.
The trick to using column view mode is knowing
how to change the different column sizes. Here are
some tips:

Click and drag the bottom-right corner of a 
window to expand it. 

Click and drag the two vertical lines separating
columns to adjust one column’s width. The col-
umn to the left of the vertical lines will be resized.

To adjust every column’s width, hold down the
Option key while clicking and dragging any two
vertical lines.
One of the best benefits of column view is
that it previews different file types for you. You
can use it to view images, listen to sounds, and
play movies, as shown in Figure 10-6. You can
enable or disable this feature using the View
Options panel.
• Figure 10-6: Column view mode can show an image or a
movie or play a sound.

Customizing Windows
85
• Figure 10-8: The Customize Toolbar palette.
4.
Remove items from the toolbar by dragging
them off the window.
5.
Use the drop-down list and check box at the
bottom of the window to dictate how much
information should be shown in the toolbar
(Icon & Text, Icon Only, or Text Only) and
whether it should be in small size.
The best way to customize the toolbar depends
upon how you use it. Some options — Get Info, iDisk,
Connect, and Customize — are rarely used and
could be omitted. Others — Burn and Eject — will
also be an option in the Sidebar if you have volumes
mounted there. Finally, almost all the icons have key-
board equivalents or can be re-created by
Control+clicking.
Here are some other toolbar tips and shortcuts that
you should be aware of:

If your window becomes too small to show all
the toolbar features, double arrows appear. Click
them to see the hidden options (see Figure 10-9).
• Figure 10-9: The double arrows create a menu of hidden
toolbar options.

Click the oval button in the upper-right corner of
the toolbar to switch between a fancy Panther
window and a plain version. Strangely enough,
you can also use Shift+click, Control+click, or
Option+click to do the same thing.

Ô+clicking the oval button toggles among very
subtly different versions of the window.

You can also access the Path by Ô+clicking the
window’s title bar. A folder’s path indicates
where the folder is on the hard drive, like
/Users/larry/Desktop/Stuff.
Ô+clicking the window’s title bar is a good
trick to remember. Many other applications
also use this technique to show you the file
path (BBEdit) or your browser’s history (Safari).

Hold down the Ô key while clicking and dragging
to move or remove toolbar items without using
the Customize Toolbar panel.

Drag any icon from the Desktop or a Finder win-
dow to add it to the toolbar.

Control+click the toolbar to switch view modes.
Control+click a toolbar icon or tool to remove
it — or just Ô+drag (it off).

Technique 10: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
86
Using the Window’s Icon to Move Folders
In the title bar of a window, the folder icon that appears
next to the window’s name is the listed folder’s icon.
Therefore, this icon is the same as the icon for the directory
that you would find it in its parent folder. By clicking and
holding the window’s icon, you can move this entire direc-
tory around without going up one folder. For example:
1.
Open two different folders in two different win-
dows in the Finder.
2.
Click and hold the title bar icon of the folder that
you want to move.
You’ll need to click and hold for just a second to
get the system to engage.
3.
Drag this icon into the other window.
4.
Release the mouse button.
You’ll now see the first window as a subdirectory in the sec-
ond. However, the first window is still open; only its location
has changed.
The contents of the Sidebar will also appear in
Open/Save dialogs, thus saving you time navi-
gating around the computer.
The bottom section of the Sidebar is partially cus-
tomizable from the Finder’s preferences panel. This
area should be used to access frequently used direc-
tories, such as
 Your Home folder

The Desktop

The Applications folder

Your Documents folder
Select any object and press Ô+T to instantly add it
to your Sidebar. Similarly, you can drag an item to
the Sidebar to add it or drag it off to remove it.
Sidebar items can also be rearranged by clicking
and dragging them.
You can add a Delete button to the toolbar so
that you can delete a file by selecting it and
then clicking Delete. You can also trash a file
by dropping it on the Delete toolbar button.
Sidebar
The Sidebar (see Figure 10-10) is new to Panther and
contains two separate parts. The top section lists
volumes, mounted disk images, discs, and so forth.
This can be customized under the Sidebar panel of
the Finder’s preferences panel. Anything listed in the
Sidebar can be accessed with a single mouse click.
(These items don’t need to be opened with a double
click.)
• Figure 10-10: The side panel on the left of the window is
new to Panther and customizable.
Resize the Sidebar width by clicking and drag-
ging the dividing line between it and the win-
dow’s contents.
Here are some things that you can do in the top part
of the Sidebar:

Easily access any disk drive.

Access your iDisk without formally connecting to
it. iDisk is covered in Technique 41.

View mounted disk images and discs without
going to the Desktop.

Eject mounted disk images and discs.

Burn CD-Rs and DVD-Rs.

See what servers you are currently connected to.

Using Actions
87
The Ô+T shortcut used to add an item to your
Favorites directory but now adds items to the
Sidebar. There is no longer a shortcut to add
items to the Favorites directory.
Scroll bars
One final area of customization with respect to win-
dows involves the scroll bars that appear on the
right side of the window when the window is too
small to display every item. These settings are
adjusted in the Appearance panel of System
Preferences (see Figure 10-11). You can set the
scrol arrows to appear like the following:
• Figure 10-11: The Appearance panel also controls the
Finder window scroll bars.

Separate, at the top and bottom of the window
or

Together at the bottom of the window
While you’re at it, you can tweak how clicking in the
scroll bar area affects the window or document.
Select one of the following radio buttons:

Jump to the Next Page: Moves a page at a time
or

Scroll to Here: Moves to a particular location
Both of these settings are more for personal taste than
anything, but you should understand what you’re get-
ting when you make your selections. (For the record,
we tend to keep our scroll bars together and set click-
ing in the scroll bar to move one page at a time.)
If you install the free TinkerTool (see
Technique 53), you have even more scroll
bar options, including having both together
at the top and bottom of the window.
The last two settings that you can enable are smooth
scrolling and minimizing windows on double-clicks.
The first makes your scrolling look pretty, but it
really drags down your productivity. Turn off
smooth scrolling for a faster window response. As
for double-clicking windows to minimize them, that’s
handy, but you can also minimize a window by 
single-clicking on the yellow button or by using Ô+M.
Using Actions
Actions are a new feature to Mac OS X’s windows.
They provide a button access point to contextual
menu-like behavior. To access the Actions menu,
click the toolbar button with a gear pictured on it.
If you’re in a directory with nothing selected, the
default Actions are New Folder, Get Info, and Show
View Options (see Figure 10-12).
Use the Get Info Action when in a directory
with nothing selected to get the size of that
directory’s contents.
If you’ve selected an item or items, the Actions menu
is much a like contextual menu (what you’d get by
Control+clicking the items), with the addition of the
New Folder option and the subtraction of the Folder
Actions options (see Figure 10-13).

Technique 10: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
88
Actions are still new to Panther and are therefore a
little underwhelming in their current incarnation. 
We expect this to change when Apple builds more
features into the Actions part of a window.
Another type of actions, Folder Actions, are
discussed in Technique 12.
Moving Windows Around
Despite the fact that Exposé (see Technique 13)
has greatly facilitated moving about open windows,
there are still plenty of other tips and tricks to be
learned. Window management is critical to using the
operating system efficiently, particularly if you open
every folder in a new window. Here are the best tips:

Finder windows use three standard buttons in
the upper-left corner. They are color-coordinated
to represent what they do: red (close), yellow
(minimize), and green (maximize).

Option+click the yellow button to minimize
every open window.

Option+click the red button to close every open
window.

If you place the mouse cursor over an inactive
window’s buttons, they light up, allowing you to
close, minimize, or maximize a window without it
being in front (and therefore active).

You can move background (non-active) windows
by holding down the Ô key and clicking them
with the mouse.

Double-click the toolbar to minimize a window, if
enabled.
The Appearance panel allows you to turn on
the window minimizing feature when double-
clicking the window’s title bar or toolbar.

You can directly access any particular window
by clicking Window in the menu bar and select-
ing from the list of windows.
• Figure 10-12: The Actions as they apply to a directory.
• Figure 10-13: The Actions as they apply to a selected item.


The shortcut Ô+→scrolls you forward through
the open windows. Ô+←rotates you backwards.

Minimized windows are stored in the right-hand
side of the Dock.

By placing your cursor over a window’s Dock
icon, you can see the name of the window (see
Figure 10-14).
• Figure 10-14: A window’s title reveals itself when you
hover over its icon in the Dock.

Technique
Establishing an
Efficient Dock
T
he Dock, that curious little bar at the bottom of your screen, is
such a particular aspect of your operating system that it merits its
own Technique. A new concept to Mac OS X, the Dock has been
much maligned in its various incarnations, but we feel that with the right
treatment, the Dock can be an important ally in the war for productivity.
We begin this Technique with a discussion on customizing and organizing
the Dock, with the focus on making it as useful as possible. Then we
demonstrate the myriad ways that different mouse and keyboard short-
cuts can be used to work with the Dock more efficiently. Finally, we intro-
duce a couple of the more popular shareware applications that add to or
mimic the Dock’s purpose and behavior.
Customizing the Dock
The Dock is like a pet: You need to take care of it. Okay, it’s really nothing
like a pet, but you should still spend a bit of time doing two things: cus-
tomizing its behavior and organizing its contents and layout. You can
customize the Dock’s behavior from the Dock panel of System Preferences
(see Figure 11-1).
• Figure 11-1: Use the Dock System
Preferences panel 
to set the Dock’s
behavior.

Customizing the Dock
91
You can adjust much of the Dock’s behavior
from the Dock submenu of the Apple Menu
(see Figure 11-2). It gives you immediate
access to the Dock preferences panel without
forcing you to navigate through System
Preferences.
• Figure 11-2: The Dock submenu is located under the
Apple menu.
You can adjust the following Dock properties, some
of which are just cosmetic and some of which are
actually useful:

Size

Magnification (whether it’s on and how potent 
it is)

Position on the screen (left, bottom, or right)

The effect used when windows and documents
are minimized into the Dock (Genie and Scale are
your choices)

Whether opening applications are animated

Whether the Dock automatically hides and
shows itself
The size, position, and hiding features of the Dock 
all directly relate to how you interact with your 
computer — and therefore, can have an effect on
your productivity. That being said, how you set 
them is largely a matter of taste. Here are some 
general suggestions:

Automatically hiding and showing the Dock is a
good way to keep your screen clear if you have a
smaller monitor (like 15" or less) or a laptop.

Placing the Dock on the side makes more sense if
you have a widescreen display (where you have
more screen space on the sides than you do on
the top and bottom).

If you use the Desktop a lot and have folders, vol-
umes, and other icons automatically arranged
(meaning that they’re located on the right side of
the screen), don’t put the Dock on the right, or
it’ll always be in the way.

Adjust the size of the Dock so that it’s as small as
reasonable while still allowing you to read it.
The Dock’s size will automatically shrink if the
number of items in the Dock makes it too
large to fit onscreen. In System Preferences,
you can also make the Dock really small, but
use magnification to see the items more
clearly (see Figure 11-3).
• Figure 11-3: Magnification increases an icon’s size as your
mouse goes over it.
The minimizing effect, the animation of opening
applications, and (to a lesser degree) the magnifica-
tion are cosmetic. Turn them on to impress or annoy
your friends; turn them off if you think it’ll make
things happen faster (it really won’t).
The free TinkerTool freeware application
(www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html)
lets you customize your Dock in other ways.
This includes positioning the Dock at the top
of the screen, adjusting the alignment (left/top,
center, right/bottom), making the Dock icons
for hidden applications transparent, and
adding a Dock shadow. It also adds a “Suck In”
minimize effect for those of you who appreci-
ate eye candy.

Technique 11: Establishing an Efficient Dock
92
folders for your current projects and documents
there. If you want, add the Desktop folder there
to immediately access Desktop items.
Use customized icons for your Dock folders
(before adding them to the Dock) to make it
easier to distinguish among multiple folders
stored there. See Technique 15 for instructions
and resources.
4.
Organize your applications so that those used
in conjunction are placed together.
For example, if you regularly use multiple Web
browsers, place these next to each other. If you
use BBEdit (a text editor) with Fetch or Transmit
(FTP applications), line them up.
Icons placed in the center of the Dock are the
most stable because they’re less affected by
the expansion and contraction of the Dock. As
your Dock grows, applications found near the
center of your Dock will remain near the cen-
ter of your screen. Conversely, items on the
ends of the Dock will be moved closer and
closer to the end of the screen, making them
slightly harder to get to.
Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts
for the Dock
To get the most out of the Dock, you must be able to
customize it properly and also use it with ease. This
comes down to understanding the various keyboard
and mouse shortcuts that you can use to perform
common tasks.
With your mouse (or other input device), here are
the basics that you should know:

Click any application’s icon to bring it to the
front.

Click any folder’s icon to show that folder in a
Finder window.

Click the Trash icon to see what’s in the garbage.
Organizing the Dock
The Dock is divided into two sections: the left side
(where applications live) and the right side (where
you’ll find documents, folders, and the Trash). The
two sides are divided by a separator bar: A vertical
line that runs the height of the Dock.
To add any item to the Dock, drag its icon there. To
remove any item (except the Finder and the Trash,
which are permanent), drag its icon off the Dock.
The Dock always shows every icon that you add to 
it as well as other currently running applications
(which are marked with an upward-pointing black
triangle; refer to Figure 11-3).
To organize your Dock:
1.
Remove any of the default icons that you won’t
regularly use; just click and drag them off the
Dock.
Apple likes to give you immediate access to
every Apple application that comes installed on
your Mac, so your Dock has iMovie, iPhoto, iCal,
Mail, the Address Book, and other applications
by default. If you won’t frequently use some of
these (like iMovie), drag the icon off the Dock to
make it disappear in a puff of smoke.
You cannot remove these two Dock icons: the
Finder, which is always on the far left (or the
top, if the Dock is on the side), and the Trash,
which is always on the far right (or bottom).
2.
Add every application that you use on a daily
basis to the left side of the Dock by dragging
their icons from the Finder onto the Dock.
3.
Add frequently accessed folders to the right
side of the Dock by dragging their icons from
the Finder onto the Dock.
We recommend putting your Favorites folder
(which links applications and files that you use
less frequently), your Home folder, and perhaps
your Documents folder on the right side of the
Dock. You should also consider dragging the

Hierarchical Pop-Up Menus in the Dock
Clicking an icon in the Dock takes you to that application,
but clicking folders in the Dock can give you different
behavior:

When you click a folder’s icon, that directory is opened
in a new Finder window.

When you Control+click or click and hold a folder’s
icon, a hierarchical menu is created of the folder’s con-
tents, as shown in the following figure.
Both of these features are quite useful and an easy way to
access your documents. The second method allows you to
navigate directly to a subfolder or document buried deep
inside — the hierarchy of folders is revealed while you navi-
gate. In previous versions of Mac OS X, you were limited to
only a handful of submenus, but now you can literally fill
your screen up with menus to reach the file that you want,
as shown in the following figure.

Click a Dock item to make that item active, open
it if it’s not already open, and reshow minimized
documents or windows.

Click and hold a Dock icon to bring up its contex-
tual menu (or a hierarchical menu for a folder).

Use the contextual menu to quit, hide, and go to
the item’s location in the Finder.

Check the contextual menus for different applica-
tions to see what options they provide.
For example, the Mail application gives you the
option to check your e-mail (see Figure 11-4).
Many others, such as BBEdit, allow you to prese-
lect which open document (in that application)
you want to view (see Figure 11-5).
• Figure 11-4: The Mail contextual menu in the Dock.
• Figure 11-5: The BBEdit contextual menu in the Dock.

Click and drag the Dock’s separator up and down
to adjust the Dock’s size.

You can eject disk images, CDs, DVDs, floppy
disks, Zip disks, and external hard drives by
dragging their icons onto the Trash icon, which
turns into an Eject button.

Technique 11: Establishing an Efficient Dock
94
• Figure 11-7: Use the arrow keys to navigate the
contextual menus in the Dock.
To empty the Trash by using the Dock and
your mouse, click and hold (or Control+click)
the Dock’s Trash icon and then select Empty
Trash from the menu that appears.

Ô+Option+click a Dock icon to hide all the other
applications.

Ô+click a Dock icon to reveal the icon’s original
file in the Finder. This is the same as selecting
Show In Finder from the contextual menu.
You can also control many of the Dock’s settings by
using your input device and the modifier keys. For
starters:

Control+click the Dock separator (the line
between the left and right sides of the Dock) to
access the Dock’s preferences (see Figure 11-8).

Press Option+click while dragging the Dock sepa-
rator to change the Dock’s size to standard icon
sizes.

Pressing Ô+Shift+click while dragging the Dock’s
separator bar left and right allows you to move
the Dock around the screen (from left to bottom
to right).
When using only the keyboard, you are fairly limited
by what you can do with the Dock, but to start:
1.
Make sure that Full Keyboard Access is turned
on in the Keyboard & Mouse panel of System
Preferences (under Keyboard Shortcuts).
2.
Press Control+F3 to access the Dock (see 
Figure 11-6).
• Figure 11-6: Pressing Control+F3 highlights the Finder
icon in the Dock.
Laptop users might have to use
fn+Control+F3 to access the Dock.
3.
Use the arrow keys to move left and right (you
can also Tab+→and Shift+Tab+←).
4.
After an item is highlighted, press the spacebar
to make it active.
5.
Use the up- or down-arrow keys to launch the
contextual menu for that item (see Figure 11-7).
6.
Press Return to select an option highlighted in
the contextual menu.
7.
Press Esc at any time to leave the Dock.
Another keyboard shortcut that you should
remember is pressing Ô+Option+D to show
or hide the Dock.
What you can do with the mouse — or the mouse
and keyboard together — is much more impressive:

Control+click a Dock icon to bring up its contex-
tual menu. You can also just click and hold to 
see it.

Option+Control+click to change the contextual
menu’s Quit option to Force Quit.

Shareware for the Dock
95

An application’s contextual menu allows you to
add the item to the Dock. You can also accom-
plish this by moving a Dock icon, which makes it
a permanent addition.
• Figure 11-8: The Dock’s preferences can be adjusted from
the Dock’s contextual menu.
You can open a file by dragging it onto an
application’s icon in the Dock. The problem is
that the Dock may mistake your intentions
and frequently move the application icon out
of the way so that the file can be added to the
Dock. To make the Dock behave itself, hold
down the Ô key when dragging the file. To
force an application to attempt to open a file,
use Ô+Option while you’re dragging the file
onto the Dock icon.
Shareware for the Dock
After you get the hang of the Dock, investigate some
of the shareware applications that either add to its
functionality or otherwise duplicate its utility. Here’s
a quick summary of the popular candidates:

DragThing (www.dragthing.com, $25) gives you
the ability to have a tabbed Dock (one Dock with
multiple subpanels, each of which can contain its
own items). It’s a very popular application and
consistently reviewed well by Mac users.

Drop Drawers (www.sigsoftware.com/
dropdrawers, $20) is a lot like DragThing with an
extra emphasis on storing stuff (text, images, and
the like) in a Dock drawer.

DockSwap (www.pidog.com/OSX/, $12 suggested)
also allows you to have multiple Docks, switching
easily back and forth among them.

Snard (www.gideonsoftworks.com/snard.html,
$10) is a launcher program, quickly bringing 
up applications, folders, files, and System
Preferences. It can exist as a dockling, pop-up
menu, or menu bar extension.
A dockling is a special type of application that
resides in the Dock and adds extra functional-
ity to your computer. It’s unlike other Dock
items in that you’ll never really use it as a
standalone application.

DockExtender (www.codetek.com/php/
dockext.php, $20) also launches applications,
accesses Web pages, and provides contextual
menus. Highly customizable, it can work as a
dockling, a pop-up menu, or as a menu bar tool.

Saving Steps with
Contextual Menus
C
ontextual menus have been part of the Macintosh operating system
for several incarnations now, and yet still many people underuse
them, or don’t use them at all. Contextual menus provide an imme-
diate listing of options; usually frequently performed tasks for a file,
folder, image, and so forth. Although contextual menus exist in both
applications and the Finder, they differ greatly across applications.
Therefore, this Techique specifically addresses the Finder’s contextual
menus (often abbreviated as just CMs).
First we cover a smattering of the basics about contextual menus, includ-
ing the new contextual menu features found in Panther. Then we discuss,
in greater detail, some of the specific contextual menu items that you can
add to your system. These include many common third-party and share-
ware applications.
Grasping the Basics of Contextual Menus
When you Control+click an item, whether it’s a window, the Desktop, or
an icon, a contextual menu appears, listing the things that you can do
with that item. Different objects in your system offer different options.
For example, here are the CMs for a folder (Figure 12-1), a file (Figure
12-2), and a window (Figure 12-3).

Grasping the Basics of Contextual Menus
97
• Figure 12-1: The default contextual menu for a folder.
If you use contextual menus a lot — and you
really should — and you have a programmable
input device (such as a trackball or mouse),
you must program one of the buttons to act as
a Control+click. Doing so saves countless
hours because you can access common fea-
tures more easily.
The Get Info option is common to all three of the
listed CM examples. A window has the fewest num-
ber of options, by default, whereas files generally
give you the most. Some common uses of the contex-
tual menu include
• Figure 12-2: The default contextual menu for a file.
• Figure 12-3: The default contextual menu for a window.
If you want to know what CM options are
available to you in any application, including
the Finder, Control+click to investigate. Get in
the habit of Control+clicking within windows,
on icons, and in the toolbar of windows.

Technique 12: Saving Steps with Contextual Menus
98
 An archive file
 A resources directory
These files can then be examined, copied, or (if you know
what you’re doing) modified. This concept is not unlike
using a resource editor like ResEdit back in earlier versions
of Mac OS.
As you explore this concept, you’ll notice that the /Library/
Receipts folder tracks what was installed by creating
packages. Also, many installers will come in a package
form. Even most of Panther’s default applications, like Mail,
are packages whose contents can be viewed.
Using CMs with Third-Party
Applications
Many third-party applications, including commercial
apps, shareware, and freeware, take advantage of
Panther’s contextual menus. Here are a few:

Rainer Brockerhoff (www.brockerhoff.net) 
provides, for free, a useful contextual menu
application called Zingg!. It replicates Panther’s
Open With functionality that allows you to open
a file with an application other than the default
application. It takes this principle a small step
further by allowing you to set certain applica-
tions, such as Preview, Photoshop, or BBEdit to
always appear, and for others to never be listed

Creating a new folder within a directory, in 
case you get tripped up with the Ô+Option+N
shortcut.

Adding, deleting, or changing the Label.

Sending the selected item to the Trash.

Opening a file with a specific application 
(see Technique 23).

Archiving an item.
New in Panther is the ability to create an
archive — a zipped (compressed) version — 
of a file or folder. This replicates the DropZip
feature that users of StuffIt Deluxe have had
for years.

Duplicating or just copying the item.

Creating an alias.
Items in the Dock and the Dock itself have
their own contextual menus if you Control+
click a Dock’s icon or Control+click the Dock.
(This menu differs depending on whether 
you click on the Dock separator or in a 
blank area.)
Opening Your Packages
For the more techie user, another nice use of a contextual
menu is that it allows you to view the contents of packages
(special bundles of information presented as one cohesive
item). These are used frequently in Mac OS X, but you can
only view a package’s contents in the Terminal unless you
use the Show Package Contents CM.
1.
Control+click a file with the .pkg extension to
bring up the file’s contextual menu.
2.
Choose Show Package Contents from the CM.
3.
A window of the package’s contents appears. In
it, you will commonly find
 Two text (XML) files that store version and
other information about the package

as an option. Also, you can disable Classic appli-
cations as an option if Classic is not open.

The DesktopPictureCM tool from Azine Software
(www.azinesoftware.com, free) sets a selected
image as the Desktop picture without having to
go through System Preferences.

PicturePopCM from setnan.org (www.setnan.org/
mac/, free) quickly displays a preview of a
selected image or images without using another
application.

QuickAccessCM from Abra Code (http://
free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/, free) grants
you immediate access to commonly used folders,
files, and even applications. With it, you can
move, copy, or even make an alias of a selected
item in another directory.
Abra Code provides a slew of handy contex-
tual menu scripts. They’re all free and available
at free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/.

StuffIt Deluxe (www.stuffit.com, $80) comes
with several contextual menu options. The popu-
lar utility (see Figure 12-4), whose main use is for
compressing and decompressing files and fold-
ers, creates CM tools to immediately archive or
open pretty much anything. You can also access
StuffIt’s preferences through the CM and use
sequential tools like Archive and Mail.

StickyBrain 2 (www.chronosnet.com, $40 or
potentially free for .Mac users) is the Stickies
application on steriods, providing you with an
amazing asset for managing information. This
application creates contextual menus that incor-
porate StickyBrain into nearly any other applica-
tion. See Technique 16 for more information on
StickyBrain.
Search Google or www.versiontracker.com
for more contextual menu applications that
you can use.
• Figure 12-4: StuffIt Deluxe adds many useful items to the
contextual menus.
AppleScript, Contextual Menus,
and You
A special subsection of contextual menus exist
thanks to AppleScript. AppleScript, in case you aren’t
aware, is a programming tool for the Mac. Because
it’s very easy to use but still powerful, it’s remained
a popular application over the years. Without too
much work, you can trigger (or run) AppleScripts in
contextual menus.
Apple has a vast supply of ready-made
AppleScripts available for download. They’re
organized by application at www.apple.com/
applescript/apps/.

3.
Find the AppleScript that you want to run.
If you know how, you can write your own
AppleScripts. Or, you can download one of the
many free AppleScripts from Apple’s Web site
and other online resources. A third option is to
use one of the built-in scripts, found in the
/Library/Scripts folder.
4.
Save the AppleScript in the ~/Library/
Scripts/Folder Action Scripts folder.
5.
Bring up the contextual menu again by
Control+clicking a folder.
It can be any folder.
6.
Choose Configure Folder Actions from the con-
textual menu.
7.
In the Folder Actions Setup window (see Figure
12-6), click the plus sign in the left column.
• Figure 12-6: The Folder Actions Setup window lets you
associate AppleScripts with folders.
8.
Navigate to and select the new AppleScript.
Folder Actions
Folder Actions are Apple-supplied tools that allow you
to associate actions to folders. These actions, in the
form of AppleScripts, can be run whenever the folder
is opened, closed, or moved, or when items are
added to or removed from the folder. To use Folder
Actions, you must first enable them:
1.
Control+click any folder to bring up the contex-
tual menu.
2.
From the resulting contextual menu (see 
Figure 12-5), choose Enable Folder Actions.

Big Cat
Big Cat, created by Ranchero Software (www.
ranchero.com), is a free application that adds the 
ability to run AppleScripts from contextual menus.
It’s kind of like Panther’s Folder Actions, only broader
in scope. Big Cat creates two separate categories of
scripts:

Text: For example, you can copy, open a selec-
tion in TextEdit, or search with Google (see
Figure 12-7).
• Figure 12-7: Big Cat’s textual tools.

Files: These include scripts such as Copy Path
and Make Alias on Desktop (see Figure 12-8).
• Figure 12-8: Big Cat’s file tools, available as a contextual
menu.
Which options you see depend on what’s being
selected when the contextual menu is brought up.
(Hence the name contextual menu.) To install and
use Big Cat:
1.
Download the latest version of Big Cat from
http://ranchero.com/bigcat/.
2.
Double-click it to open the downloaded file,
called something like BigCat1.0.sit.
3.
Open the resulting folder, called something
like Big Cat 1.0.
The contents should resemble Figure 12-9.
• Figure 12-9: The contents of the Big Cat folder.
4.
Move the Big Cat Scripts folder to ~/Library/
Application Support, where ~ refers to your
Home directory.

If you really like Big Cat, consider making a
donation to the cause via the links at the Web
site (www.ranchero.com/bigcat).
After you realize the benefits of Big Cat, you
might want more. The Ranchero Software
Web site has other scripts that you can down-
load and install as well as tutorials to teach you
how to write your own.
5.
Move the file BigCat.plugin to the ~/Library/
Contextual Menu Items folder, again where ~
refers to your Home directory.
If you don’t already have either an Application
Support or a Contextual Menu Items folder in
your Library directory, create one.
6.
Log out of your computer and then log back in.
In this case, you cannot use Fast User
Switching to log out because that does not
close your session.
7.
When you log back in, you should now have
the Big Cat options listed under Scripts.
8.
To install your own AppleScripts to use through
Big Cat, drop them into the text or file subfolder
of the ~/Library/Application Support direc-
tory (see Figure 12-10).

Easily Managing
Windows 
with Exposé
B
rand new to Panther is a window mangement system called Exposé.
Exposé allows you to access and switch among open windows
either throughout the entire operating system or just in the current
application. It also gives you immediate access to the Desktop.
In this Technique, we introduce you to Exposé and all the benefits that it
has to offer. We also show the default mouse and keyboard shortcuts for
using Exposé and how you can alter these. Finally, we demonstrate a few
techniques that you can use, thanks to Exposé. Knowing how to switch
documents within an active application, how to drag and drop files more
quickly, and how to use Exposé without the mouse will go a long way
towards helping you speed through routine tasks.
Introducing Exposé
You enable and control Exposé from the Exposé panel, which is found
under the Personal section of System Preferences (see Figure 13-1).

Technique 13: Easily Managing Windows with Exposé

 You can set another corner to reveal every
open window for the currently active applica-
tion (Application Windows).
 You can set another corner to access the
Desktop (Desktop).
The drop-down lists in this dialog correspond
to their positions onscreen. In other words, the
upper-left drop-down list controls the upper-
left corner of your screen, and so on.
4.
Also in the Exposé panel, you can use the drop-
down lists in the Keyboard section to set your
function keys for these same purposes.
The Exposé panel also allows you to set hot
corners to start and disable the screen saver.
These controls are duplicated — even for
Exposé — under the Desktop & Screen Saver
Control Panel.
You might find all these options intimidating. Here
are our best rules for customizing Exposé:

You might want to skip setting a Desktop short-
cut in Exposé because you can also access the
Desktop by clicking on it or by clicking the
Finder icon in the Dock.

Because the All Windows and Application
Windows features are very similar, place the hot
corners on the same side of the screen and use
contiguous function keys for them.

If your function keys aren’t readily accessible (or,
as with laptops, require the use of the fn key to
work), avoid setting the function key shortcuts.

If your function keys are already being used for
other purposes, skip setting the function keys
and just use the hot corners instead.

If your function keys are already being used for
other purposes, you can add a modifier key to
the keyboard shortcut by holding down the Shift,
Ô, Option, or Control key while you select the
corresponding function key (see Figure 13-3).
1.
Open System Preferences by going to the Apple
menu or clicking its icon in the Dock.
2.
Click Exposé.
3.
In the Exposé panel that appears (see Figure
13-2), set the corner activation settings for
Exposé as follows:
Exposé, like a screen saver, can use a feature
called hot corners. Hot corners are just the cor-
ners of your screen that have been assigned spe-
cial meaning. Moving the cursor into a certain
corner activates a function; moving it out of the
corner deactivates that function. For example, if
you are in Safari, moving into one corner might
reveal the Desktop. When you move the cursor
back out, Safari is revealed again. Before you can
use any hot corner, though, you need to assign
functions to them, in the Exposé panel.
• Figure 13-2: The Exposé panel.
 You can set one corner to show every open
window (All Windows).

Introducing Exposé
105
• Figure 13-3: Exposé can also be triggered by using the
function keys and a modifier key.

Users with multiple displays (see Technique 6)
probably still only have four corners, even
though it might seem that you physically have
eight.
Strange as it might seem, some multiple-display
users might have five or more screen corners. 
If the two displays aren’t aligned exactly, there
can be an extra corner or two between the 
two displays, as shown in Figure 13-4. This 
isn’t necessarily a problem or an asset but 
just a curiosity you should be aware of.

If you have a Mac with a small display (like an
iBook or the 12-inch PowerBook), you might 
find the hot corners a nuisance. They tend to 
do funny Exposé things when your cursor (even
accidentally) nears a corner.

If you have a multi-button input device, you can
set the extra buttons to trigger Exposé, with or
without modifier keys (see Figure 13-5).
• Figure 13-4: The arrangement of your displays dictates
how many corners your system has.
• Figure 13-5: Modifier keys and extra mouse buttons can
be set to use Exposé.

2.
Place your cursor over each window (the rest
of the screen will be dark) to view its title. 
(See the upper-right corner of Figure 13-7.)
• Figure 13-7: Exposé shows a window or document’s title
when you hover the mouse over it.
Exposé shows only open windows. Minimized
documents in the current application are not
revealed.
3.
Click the desired window to make it active.
You can always press Esc to leave Exposé with-
out switching windows or applications.
To switch to a document in another application:
1.
By using either the keyboard shortcut or the
hot corner, bring up all the open windows.
Check out the party in Figure 13-8 (and that’s not
even a particularly busy day).
The most natural way to trigger Exposé is
probably to use the hot corners with the
mouse. For many people, the function keys
aren’t as easy to access and use as the mouse is.
How to Get the Most 
out of Exposé
After you get Exposé set up the way you want it, you
need to know how to get the most out of its potential.
Aside from revealing the Desktop, Exposé either 
displays all the open windows (including Finder 
windows, Web browser windows, and documents) 
or all the open windows for the current application.
Here are the basics for using Exposé.
To switch to a different document within the current
application:
1.
Depending on how you’ve set your System
Preferences, press either the keyboard short-
cut or move your cursor into the hot corner to
bring up all the open windows for the current
application (see Figure 13-6).
• Figure 13-6: The Exposé display for the active application.

How to Get the Most out of Exposé
107
• Figure 13-8: The Exposé display for every open
application.
2.
Place your cursor over each window (the rest
of the screen will be dark) to view its title.
3.
Click in the appropriate window to make it
active.
This tip’s just too cool for school: After you 
use Exposé to show all the open windows and
documents, you can access all the windows or
documents for specific (open) applications by
pressing the Tab key. The end result is much
like rotating through Exposé’s current applica-
tion listing without actively switching from one
application to another. If you have a lot of 
clutter or want to view a particular window or
document in a larger size, this is the way to go.
Dragging and dropping with Exposé
Although the current incarnation of Exposé is not
quite chock-full of features, it does have some neat
tricks and plenty of room here for future additions
as Apple receives feedback on this new tool. One of
the coolest features of Exposé is that you can use it
for drag-and-drop purposes, like when you want to
quickly add an attachment to an e-mail or copy and
paste some text from one application to another.
This might not be obvious to many users on first
exposure (insert groan here), but it’s a really cool
technique. Here’s the skinny:
1.
Select the item or items that you want to drag
and drop from the point of origination (see
Figure 13-9).
• Figure 13-9: To attach a document to an e-mail, first
select it in the Finder.
For example, you can select:
 A file in the Finder to attach to an e-mail
 Text in an e-mail to drop into BBEdit
 An image in Photoshop to view in your Web
browser
 Text in a Word document to copy into another
Word document
 Files to duplicate or move from one Finder
window to another
2.
Begin dragging the selected item by clicking
with the mouse and moving your cursor slightly.
3.
While continuing to hold down the mouse but-
ton, use Exposé to show either all the currently
open windows or all the open windows for the
current application.
Do so by either moving the cursor into the 
correct hot corner or pressing the associated
keyboard shortcut to engage Exposé.
4.
While continuing to hold down the mouse 
button, select the appropriate window or 
document by moving the cursor over it (see
Figure 13-10).

Technique 13: Easily Managing Windows with Exposé
108
• Figure 13-11: Before releasing the mouse button, 
move the cursor to where you want the 
file dropped.
• Figure 13-12: The completed drag-and-drop attaches the
file to the e-mail.
• Figure 13-10: To add an attachment to an e-mail, select
the e-mail’s image.
5.
While (still!) continuing to hold down the
mouse button, activate the highlighted window
or document by pressing the spacebar.
Exposé also automatically switches over to a
document or window if you hover the cursor
over it for a couple of moments.
6.
While (of course) continuing to hold down the
mouse button, move the cursor within the win-
dow or document to where you want to drop
the selected item (see Figure 13-11).
7.
Release the mouse button to complete the drop.
See the results in Figure 13-12.
8.
Apply hot and cold compresses to your tired,
aching, mouse-clicking finger as needed.
Select the e-mail‘s image to add an attachment.

How to Get the Most out of Exposé
109
Using Exposé without the mouse
The last technique that we demonstrate is for those
hard-core keyboard users. You know who you are:
You never take your hands off the keys, and you use
the mouse as a toy for your cat. Exposé can be used
without the mouse at all, although the drag-and-drop
technique that we cover in the preceding section
goes to waste.
1.
In the Exposé panel, make sure that you have
the keyboard shortcuts enabled.
2.
Press the appropriate keyboard shortcut to
launch Exposé.
By default this is
 F9 to see all open windows
 F10 to view all the current application’s open
windows (or documents)
 F11 to head to the Desktop
3.
Use the arrow keys to select the window or 
document that you want.
The arrow keys will move you around the win-
dow listings as you would expect: left, right, up,
and down.
4.
Press the spacebar to make that window or
document active.
5.
If you brought up all the active windows in
Step 2, you can rotate among the windows of
the different active applications by pressing
Tab. Use the arrow keys to select a window 
and the spacebar to make it active.


Part III
Handling Files (And
Other Stuff) Quickly


14
Organizing Your
Home Directory
P
icture this: You’re sitting there reading this book. You’ve got a lovely
Macintosh in front of you. Panther — Apple’s latest and greatest
operating system — is purring along. You might have read Part II of
this book and picked up some navigation tips, discovered how to work the
Finder, organized your Dock, toyed with contextual menus, and (hopefully)
begun using Exposé. But the real question haunting your mind is this:
What do I do with all my stuff? That’s what we tell you in this Technique.
This chapter is all about your stuff: you know, those files and folders that
are in your Home directory, most of which were created by default, and
some of which you might have added. The first section of this chapter is
a primer on the Home directory, how it’s organized, and how you should
most efficiently use it. We then take you on a brief tour of your Library
folder, which is a special area for special files. The third section delves
into the Desktop: what you ought to know about it, and some good ideas
on how to use it. Finally, we discuss the Dock in brief, just to make sure
that you’ve really started using it.
Your Stuff, Your Home Directory, and You
Mac OS X revolutionized the way files are managed on the hard drive (for
Mac users, at least). This is largely thanks to the more secure, multi-user
environment. All users have their own directory, located within the Users
directory on the boot operating system’s hard drive, as shown in Figure
14-1. Each user’s directory is named after the user’s short name, as
entered when the account was created.
Technique

 Understanding your
Home directory’s default
structure

the Library

 Reminding yourself how
great the Dock can be
• Figure 14-1: The Users
directory and 
its contents.

Technique 14: Organizing Your Home Directory
114
The ~ (tilde) within a path name refers to the
current user’s Home directory. For example, if
Marc is logged in, ~ refers to /Users/marc. 
If Larry is logged in, ~ means /Users/larry.
Thus, ~/Documents can stand for either
/Users/larry/Documents or /Users/marc/
Documents, but it is always the current user’s
Document folder.
By default, your Home directory consists of what
you see in Figure 14-2:
• Figure 14-2: The standard user’s Home directory.

Desktop: The Desktop folder contains all the files
and folders stored on the Desktop. Even though
the Desktop might also show volumes, CDs,
DVDs, disk images, and more, those aren’t actu-
ally in the Desktop folder.

Documents: The Documents folder was created
as a place for you to store your, um, documents
(like your Word files, work related projects,
downloaded stuff, and more). Things you’ll look
at, edit, read, delete, create, and so forth all go in
the Documents directory. 
The Documents directory should be the folder
that you work with the most!
In the Users directory, the current user’s Home
folder is always marked by a little house icon.
(See the folder named larry in Figure 14-1.)
Although separating the users this way might seem
like a hassle, here are some benefits:

It’s more secure: Each user can only access his
or her own files (assuming that folks log in as
themselves).

It’s safer for the operating system: Because your
stuff is no longer interspersed with the operating
system’s stuff, you’re far less likely to do some-
thing that messes up your whole computer.
Granted, you can still do something to mess up
your stuff, but we cover how to avoid doing that,
too (see Technique 19).

It’s easier to back up: If you manage your stuff
properly, using the format suggested by Apple,
you can back up every important item — all your
e-mail, documents, pictures, music, and even
application preferences settings — simply by
backing up this one directory.

It’s easier to restore: Should a disaster ever
strike, you can fully recover all of your stuff as
long as you have backed up your Home directory.
Whether you use backup software or just copy
the entire directory to an external drive, restor-
ing your files is never that complicated. 

It’s easier to transfer: If you want to move your
files from one computer or hard drive to another,
copying over the contents of your Home direc-
tory does the trick.

Operating system upgrades are less intrusive:
Whereas previous Mac OS upgrades could affect
your data, OS X upgrades avoid touching the
Users directory altogether, making these transi-
tions less painful.

Your Stuff, Your Home Directory, and You
115

Library: The Library could actually be the most
important part of your Home folder (or second
most important after the Documents folder). 
The Library stores everything that the operating
system needs to know about you. This includes
 Address Book records
 iCal calendars
 Favorites
 Keychains
 The Mail application’s data
 Preferences files
 Web browser bookmarks
 Stickies contents
Because the Library folder is so important, we
discuss it a bit more later in this chapter.

Movies: The Movies directory was intended 
as the default directory for creating movies in
iMovie. It’s one of the few optional folders in the
Home directory.

Music: The Music directory is the iTunes equiva-
lent of the Movies directory. It’s intended to store
your music collection and the text files that
iTunes uses to manage that collection.

Pictures: The Pictures directory is the iPhoto
equivalent of the Movies and Music folders. The
iPhoto application uses it by default, but it’s also
a logical place to store any graphics that you
have.

Public: The Public folder is a special case. It’s
designed to provide a storeroom for files that will
be accessible by other users on your Macintosh
or on your network. Within the Public folder is a
Drop Box folder so that others on your Network
or Mac can give you files (see Figure 14-3).
If a number of files need to be accessible by
everyone on your Mac (such as your iTunes
music), place them in the Shared folder, within
the Users directory. Every user can read from
and write to this folder, making it a great doc-
ument management tool.
• Figure 14-3: Other users can place files in your Drop Box
to pass them to you.

Sites: The Sites folder is for Web pages, which
can be accessed by going to http://localhost/
~username/ or http://your.ip.address/
~username/ (see Figure 14-4).
• Figure 14-4: The Sites folder holds Web pages that can be
accessible through browsers like Safari.
Here are our top ten tips for organizing and using
your Home directory:

Don’t delete or rename any of the existing 
folders.
As a general rule, you can add folders or files
to your Home directory, but you should not
delete or rename any of the default folders. 
In particular, tinkering with the Desktop or
Library folders would be a grave mistake.

Technique 14: Organizing Your Home Directory
116
Create an Installs or Software directory within
your Documents folder to store small applica-
tions that you will probably need to install
again. For example, the driver for your mouse
may only be 2MB in size and needs to be
reinstalled with every major operating system
upgrade. Keeping a copy of the installer saves
you a trip online the next time you need to
install it.

Create a text document listing all the software
and corresponding serial numbers that you use
on your computer — and then store it in your
Home folder.
Print this document out for reference as well
(see Technique 20 for tips on recording serial
numbers and installed software).

Add fonts, contextual menu items, AppleScripts,
screen savers, and other add-ons to the operat-
ing system in the corresponding folders of your
Library, not the system library.

Back up your entire Home directory fre-
quently, often, regularly, consistently, without
fail, and on a regular basis. See Technique 48
for backup utilities and best practices.
Checking Out Your Library
Most OS X users know little about their Library
folder. The Library is, in some ways, the most impor-
tant item in your Home directory. It contains all the
information about you and how you use the com-
puter. Here’s a rundown of some of the Library’s
important folders and how they relate to your use of
the computer:

The Application Support folder contains critical
files for many applications (check it out in Figure
14-5), including
 Your Address Book data
 iCal information (other than calendars)
 Extensions to the Terminal application

Use the Desktop as a temporary storage place.
See “A Cluttered Desktop Is a Sign of a Cluttered
Mind,” later in this chapter.

Use the Documents folder for all your 
documents.
Go wild with it. Organize your documents as 
logically as possible, creating subdirectories for
files by type (or application), purpose (personal,
school, work), and so forth.
Most applications use the Documents folder as
the default place to save or open files. Go with
the flow on this point: It will save you endless
time spent wandering around your computer
in search of a file.

If you have enough disk space, go ahead and
place all your music, movies, and pictures in
the appropriate media folders.
As you’ll see in later Techniques, Apple’s iLife
applications (iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD) can
use directories outside of your Home directory
for their files.

If you create Web sites, place all the associated
files within the Sites directory, not split between
both Sites and Documents.

If an application gives you the option of
installing it system wide or just for your use,
install it just for your use.
If you install it for yourself, the files go into your
Home directory and are retained through any
operating system transitions that follow.

Store smaller-sized software that you simply
must have — such as drivers for an input device
or printer — in your Home directory so that
they’ll be easy to find if you need to reinstall
them.

Checking Out Your Library
117
Third-party applications also use the Application
Support folder for various reasons:
 The LaunchBar utility keeps its settings there.
 The Camino Web browser stores preferences
and bookmarks.
 Big Cat stores AppleScripts for contextual
menus.
 The Fire list of accounts and preferences is
saved here. (Fire is an instant messaging
application.)
• Figure 14-5: Many applications add items to your
Application Support directory.

Extra system alert sounds can be added to the
Sounds subfolder of the Audio directory.

The Calendars directory stores all your iCal data
(see Technique 44).

The ColorSync folder has your ColorSync profiles
(see Technique 6).

Contextual Menu Items contains your added CM
tools (see Technique 12).

The Favorites folder is where aliases to favorite
applications, documents, and folders are kept
(see Technique 15).

You can install your own fonts by adding them to
Fonts.

Additional plug-ins and tools for iMovie can go in
the iMovie folder.

Additional plug-ins and scripts for iTunes can go
in the iTunes folder (see Technique 42).

The Keychains folder stores your keychain, which
contains your passwords (see Technique 52).

The Mail folder has all your Mail application’s
data.

The Preferences folder contains the preferences
files for almost all your applications and even
your operating system as a whole.

Safari stuff is stored in the Safari directory (see
Figure 14-6).
• Figure 14-6: The ~/Library/Safari folder keeps your
bookmarks, viewing history, and more.
As you can see, pretty much everything except for
your applications and your files (images, documents,
and what-not) gets stored in the Library directory.
For this reason, you should treat it with respect and
include it in your daily backups. (You are doing daily
backups, right?)
Aside from backing up your Library folder and
possibly adding a few things to it, don’t mess
around with it unless you really know what
you’re doing. If you delete something you
shouldn’t, you can cause yourself a lot of pain.

Technique 14: Organizing Your Home Directory

Figure 14-8). Yes, that’s right: The Desktop is both a
dessert topping and a floor wax.
• Figure 14-7: The Desktop as viewed in the Finder.
• Figure 14-8: The Desktop as just another directory in a
Finder window.
The main difference between the Desktop and your
other folders is that the Desktop’s contents are
pretty much always visible because it’s the bottom
layer (so to speak) of what’s on your monitor. On the
bright side, anything that’s stored there is readily
accessible. But if you’ve got a lot going on there, it
can quickly become overwhelming.
How Many Libraries Does 
One Computer Need?
Your Macintosh actually has several Library folders on it . . .
three at least. You’ll find a Library folder in the root of the
system disk (/Library), one under the System folder
(/System/Library), and one for each user (~/Library).
Strange as this might seem, these libraries all serve approx-
imately the same purpose. The main differences are the pri-
ority and scope that each Library has.
The /System folder is basically for Apple and only Apple
usage. The /Library folder is primarily for third-party
applications and other developers to install items for all
users. During OS upgrades, Apple won’t mess with the
/Library folder but has carte blanche with /System. For
example, each of these Libraries might have a Contextual
Menu Items folder. Items in your CM folder will only be
available to you. Those in the /System/Library CM folder
are available to every user on the computer and were prob-
ably put there by Apple. In future versions of the operating
system, those CM items might be upgraded. Those in the
/Library folder are available to all users and should
remain unharmed by upgrading the OS. In case you’re the
curious type, note that the contents of the various libraries
are loaded in this order: /Library, /System/Library,
~/Library.
One important consideration with the Libraries is that things
stored in either /Library or /System/Library might be
replaced with every new installation of an operating system.
If you perform an Erase and Install, an Archive and Install,
or even an Upgrade, these contents will likely be replaced or
overwritten. The contents of your Library folder will remain
though, making it a good place to store all your stuff! 
A Cluttered Desktop Is a Sign
of a Cluttered Mind
The Desktop exists in two worlds. First, it’s the 
base level of the Finder, appearing on your screen
underneath everything else (as shown in Figure
14-7). Second, it’s another folder within your Home
directory that can be used to store your stuff (see

A Cluttered Desktop Is a Sign of a Cluttered Mind
119
Because the Desktop is almost always visible
and can become cluttered quickly, we strongly
advocate that you use it primarily for temporary
storage and to access hard drives, CD-ROMs,
and the like. You might even want to create
subfolders on the Desktop for longer term (yet
still temporary) storage to cut down the mess.
Aside from tinkering with how much stuff is lingering
on your Desktop, you can customize its behavior in
three ways:

Use the Desktop & Screen Saver panel of
System Preferences (see Figure 14-9).
This panel allows you to set what color, graphic,
or picture is used as the backdrop of the
Desktop. Although it’s an aesthetic decision, 
having a visually-pleasing Desktop goes a long
way toward preserving your sanity.
To change your Desktop:
1. Control+click the Desktop to bring up the 
contextual menu.
2. Select Change Desktop Background from the 
contextual menu.
3. In the resulting window (see Figure 14-9), select
a broad category from the left-hand column.
Only one of the options behaves uniquely: If 
you click Choose Folder, you are given an
Open dialog to find a folder on your hard
drive. After you find the folder you want, click
Choose or press Return.
4. Click one of the options that appears in the
right-hand column to select a specific color 
or image.
5. Quit the System Preferences panel.
If you really like eye candy, set the Desktop
panel to rotate its picture every so often by
using the Change Picture drop-down list. You
can also do a hack to make screen savers run
as the background to your Desktop. It’s a very
processor-intensive thing to do, slowing down
your computer noticeably, but it’s soooo cool.
See Technique 61 for instructions and helpful
tools.
• Figure 14-9: The Desktop & Screen Saver panel sets the
graphical appearance of your Desktop.

Use the Finder preferences panel (Figure 14-10),
under General.
Here you can indicate whether you want hard
drives, CDs, DVDs, iPods, and connected servers
to appear as icons on your Deskop.

Technique 14: Organizing Your Home Directory
120
• Figure 14-11: If no window is selected, the View Options
control the Desktop.
You’ll want to set the icon and text sizes so that
they’re easy to view but don’t take up too much
space. The arrangement of items is the most impor-
tant consideration. If you keep them arranged by
name, your hard drives, discs, and such appear in
the upper-right corner. Remaining items are listed in
alphabetical order, just as you’d see them in the list
or column view of a Finder window.
Revisiting Our Friend, the Dock
We give a good amount of attention to our friend, the
Dock, in Technique 11. Now that you’re more familiar
with your stuff, we’d like to revisit (or visit, if you
haven’t read that other technique yet) one aspect of
organizing the Dock.
• Figure 14-10: Use the Finder’s preferences to dictate
what volumes are mounted on the Desktop.

Use the Show View Options panel (see 
Figure 14-11), from the Finder’s View menu.
For how your Desktop looks and functions, the
Show View Options panel is the most critical of
the settings panels. Here you can set
 The default size of icons (in pixels)
 The default text size for names of items
 Whether an item’s name (called “label” in this
panel) should appear below or beside (to the
right of) an item
 Whether you want to see an item’s info (for
example, the dimensions of an image or the
size of a hard drive)
 Whether you want to see a thumbnail preview
of images as their icon
 How files should be arranged, if at all

Revisiting Our Friend, the Dock
121
The Dock has two sides: the left, where applications
are docked, and the right, which contains the Trash
and any folders or files that you choose to dock there.
After you get your stuff organized is a good time to
add the key components to the Dock. Some of our
best recommendations for what should be placed on
the right side of the Dock are (see Figure 14-12)

Home folder, and his Favorites all docked.

You can access any directories that you add to the
Dock in hierarchical form by Control+clicking the
directory’s icon (see Figure 14-13). This trick gives
you fast access to those files that you’ll use the most.

Technique
Managing Aliases,
Favorites, and Icons
T
he preceding Technique is all about managing your stuff — the
files, folders, and miscellaneous junk that clutter a computer — but
this one deals with aliases, Favorites, and icons: all the things that
give you quick access to the files and folders that you use most.
This chapter has three main sections, each of which takes a tangential
approach to the contents of your computer. In the first section, we talk
about aliases: what they are, how you create them, and how you’ll want
to use them. In the second, we go into Favorites, which are a specific
grouping of aliases. In the final part of this chapter, you find out about
icons, which are the visual representation for your stuff.
Also Known As: Working with Aliases
Your computer is loaded (perhaps overloaded) with many different things
such as files, folders, and applications. Each of these items is located in a
specific spot on your hard drive, represented by an icon and a filename.
An alias is a secondary pointer to the same item. It can be (and normally
is) located in another location; it can have a different name; and it can
even have a different icon. However, by default, an item’s alias uses the
same icon as the original except for the addition of a little, black arrow 
in the lower-left corner (see the bottom icon of Figure 15-1). The alias is
also created with the same filename except that the word alias is also
appended to the end under most circumstances.
Aliases offer the following benefits:

They allow you to have virtually the same item existing in many 
locations.

They are relatively small in size. For example, the alias of a 6MB MP3
file might only take up a few KB.

They enable you to create groups of aliases to related items without
shuffling around the original items.

Also Known As: Working with Aliases
123

They are very easy to create, manage, and delete.

They make accessing files, folders, and applica-
tions easier without undermining any organiza-
tional structures.
• Figure 15-1: An alias looks like the original file save for
the black, curved arrow.
Here’s how aliases work:

Opening an alias of a file has the same effect as
opening the original file.

Opening an alias of an application is the same as
opening the application by using its original icon.

Opening an alias of a folder opens the original
folder.

Deleting an alias has no effect on the original
item at all.
An alias is not a copy of an item. If you open
and edit the alias of a file, the effect is the
same as if you open and edit the original file.
But if you delete an alias, the original remains.
After you select an item, you can create an alias in
any of four ways:

Press Ô+L.

Hold down the Option and Ô keys while drag-
ging the item with your mouse.
If you use this method, the cursor turns into the
little, curved alias arrow.
If you use the Option+Ô+drag method to
make an alias, it adds the word alias to the
file’s name if you drop the file within the same
folder as the original (because a folder cannot
contain two items with the same name). If you
create the alias in another folder, it does not
add the word alias. In either case, the curved,
black arrow is added to the icon, indicating its
alias status.

Go to the Finder’s File menu and choose Make
Alias (see Figure 15-2).
• Figure 15-2: The Make Alias command is located in the
Finder’s File menu.

original file, you see a prompt (as shown in Figure
15-4) that allows you to reselect the original or
delete the alias.
• Figure 15-4: Opening an alias whose original file cannot
be found generates this prompt.
A UNIX Alias: Symbolic Links
The Macintosh alias is the equivalent of the UNIX symbolic
link (and the Windows shortcut, too, but who cares about
Windows?). A symbolic link is just a secondary pointer to the
original file, application, or folder. Because Mac OS X is
based upon the FreeBSD version of UNIX, you can also
make symbolic links in it by using the Terminal application.
The syntax for linking to a file is ln -s alias_name
original_file_name. If you’re not in the same directory
as both the original and the alias or if you otherwise want to
be exact, you’ll probably want to include the path to both
the link and the original file: ln -s /path/to/original_
file_name /path/to/alias_name. If you want to create
an alias to a folder, the same syntax applies: for example,
ln -s /Users/larry/Sites /Users/larry/Desktop/
Sites_alias or simply ln -s ~/Sites ~/Desktop/
Sites_alias. As with standard aliases, a symbolic pointer
is created by this command, pointing to the original item.
Like UNIX, with the Mac you can create either hard or soft
links. The -s option creates a soft link, and omitting it cre-
ates a hard one. A soft link is exactly like an alias. A hard link
is like having another copy of the data itself and also has
the restriction that hard links cannot traverse volumes. You
really should stick to soft links because hard links are likely
to cause problems in one way or another.
One advantage that the Mac’s aliases have over symbolic
links is that you can move an alias from one location to
another, and it still works — it finds the original just fine.
Conversely, symbolic links can never be moved. They must
be deleted and re-created instead.
The operating system makes use of aliases all
over the place. Items in the Dock, in the left
side of a Finder window, and some menu items
are aliases. You may not be aware of these
aliases and they may not have the little black,
curved arrows, but the principle remains.

Control+click the item and select Make Alias
from the resulting contextual menu.
To find the original item for an alias, select the alias
and do one of the following:

Press Ô+R.

Choose Show Original from the Finder’s File menu.

Control+click the alias and choose Show Original
from the contextual menu (see Figure 15-3).
• Figure 15-3: You can use an alias’ contextual menu to
make aliases or find an alias’ original file.
Remarkably, aliases continue to work no matter
what you do with either the alias or the original file
as long as you don’t remove either from the volume
where it was created. If an alias cannot find the

These are a few of my Favorites things
In Mac OS X, Apple introduced Favorites: a collection
of aliases for your favorite things. By default, your
Favorites were linked as a folder in your Dock, allow-
ing you to access those items by Control+clicking
(or clicking and holding) the icon (see Figure 15-5).
• Figure 15-5: The Favorites folder in the Dock.
In previous versions of Mac OS X, the Ô+T shortcut
added the selected item to your Favorites, but this
feature has been eliminated. (In Panther, that shortcut
now adds the item to the Finder window’s Sidebar.)
But we still like the idea of Favorites, so here’s the
easiest way to add items to your Favorites:
1.
Open a Finder window.
2.
Navigate to the Library folder in your Home
directory (~/Library).
3.
Select the Favorites folder (see Figure 15-6).
• Figure 15-6: Your Favorites folder is located in your
Library.
4.
Press Ô+T to add the Favorites to the window’s
Sidebar (see Figure 15-7).
These first four steps add the Favorites folder
to the Finder window’s Sidebar. You only need
to follow these steps once.
• Figure 15-7: Your Favorites appear in the Sidebar with a
heart-shaped icon.
5.
From the Finder window, navigate to the item
that you want to add to your Favorites.
6.
Select the item.

Technique 15: Managing Aliases, Favorites, and Icons
126
If you can, icon
An icon is the visual representation of an item, and it
tells you a lot about the item in question. Knowing
how icons work and how to manipulate them goes a
ways toward more productively using your computer.
Here are some basics:

All folders use a default icon that looks like a,
well, folder.

Files use an icon showing what application
they’re associated with.

Applications normally use their own custom icon.
How your computer treats icons is dictated by the
View Options panel (see Figure 15-9). You can bring
this up by pressing Ô+J or choosing Show View
Options from the View menu. The View Options
menu controls these icon settings:
• Figure 15-9: The View Options panel controls icon
settings, among other things.
7.
Begin dragging the selected item toward the
Favorites icon in the Sidebar.
8.
While still dragging but before reaching the
Favorites icon, hold down the Option and the
Ô keys so that the Make Alias icon appears
with your dragged selection.
9.
To confirm that the item was added to your
Favorites, click the Favorites icon in the
Sidebar to bring up the directory (see 
Figure 15-8).
• Figure 15-8: A Favorites folder, with aliases for
applications and directories.
Whether you use Favorites is up to you, but
the idea of collecting, organizing, and access-
ing a collection of aliases to your favorite
applications, documents, and files is one 
worth pursuing. After you place items in your
Favorites folder, you can quickly launch appli-
cations, open files, or find directories using the
Favorites link in the Sidebar or the Dock.
You don’t have to limit yourself to only one
Favorites folder. Create a second or a third
Favorites folder and then add these folders to
your primary Favorites directory. This way you
can have subgroups of applications by use or
files by project. Many sequences of steps that
you frequently take can be expedited by using
aliases and Favorites.

Select the Show Icon Preview check box under
the View Options panel to have all images
represented by a thumbnail of the actual
image. This feature is nice but can slow down
your computer when you open directories
with lots of images.
The View Options panel is also discussed in
Technique 10, which covers how to customize
the Finder windows.
In all likelihood, you’re not going to change the
default icons for your files or applications, but you
could (and frequently should) use new icons for
your folders. Doing so helps you more easily recog-
nize a particular folder, whether it’s in a Finder win-
dow or the Dock. You can create your own icons by
using Adobe Photoshop, the open source The Gimp
application, or other graphics software (see the side-
bar “Making Your Own Icons”), or you can download
icons that others have made. Check out these sites:

Making Your Own Icons
If you’re graphically inclined, you can make your own cus-
tom icons without much effort. Two popular tools for doing
so are Folder Icon Maker X (http://homepage.mac.com/
niteowl69, $5) and IconBuilder Pro (www.iconfactory.
com/ib_home.asp, $70), an add-on tool for Adobe
Photoshop. A free alternative is Viou (http://perso.
wanadoo.fr/prime). We haven’t used this last application
ourselves but the price is right and it looks promising.
Here, for example, is how to use Folder Icon Maker X to
create a custom folder icon for Microsoft Word documents:
1.
Launch Folder Icon Maker X.
You’ll see its main window with a generic folder icon
already loaded.
2.
Find the Microsoft Word application in your
Applications folder.
3.
Drag the Microsoft Word icon into the lower-
right quarter of the folder icon of Folder Icon
Maker X (as shown in this figure).

Drag the icon to be customized here.

Save Time By
 Making the most of the
Address Book
 Knowing what applica-
tions are available for
storing and accessing 
tidbits of information
Technique
Managing
Information
Effectively
I
n this Technique, we delve into the applications that you’ll use to 
manage your information. This Technique helps you organize that 
conventional desk drawer crammed with a traditional address book
and a thousand slips of paper.
The first application to discuss is the Address Book, which is much more
useful and important than you might think. It “only” manages a list of
people and contact information, but that’s a pretty big task. Secondly, we
list a few scrapbook-like applications such as Apple’s Stickies, Chronos’s
StickyBrain, and Omni Group’s OmniOutliner. Each of these can be used
to manage and organize sporadic bits of information, sort of like an elec-
tronic Post-it note.
Getting to Know the Address Book
The Address Book has been around since the beginning of OS X, although
the new features added in Panther make it even more useful than ever.
Those features include

The ability to print mailing labels

Autoformatting phone numbers

Creating your own default templates for records

Listing relations, friends, and associates for the people in your
Address Book
BuddyPop (projects.tynsoe.org/en/, $6) creates a pop-up win-
dow for Address Book records. You can use it to navigate to and 
display records as a pop-up window underneath the menu bar (see
Figure 16-1).

Customizing the Template
131
• Figure 16-1: BuddyPop gives you access to Address Book
records without opening up the Address Book.
One good reason to use the default applications that
Apple includes with the operating system (like the
Address Book, Mail, and iTunes) is how well they
work together. Take the Address Book, for example.
If you use it to store and manage your contacts,
you’ll appreciate how nicely it works with Mail. Most
of what the Address Book does is self-explanatory,
so in this Technique, we cover a few techniques and
habits that you might not be aware of . . . but might
find useful.
If you use the Address Book a lot, make sure
that you back up the contents just in case of
disaster. The Address Book database will be
stored in your Home directory (in the Library
folder), but you can manually back it up by
choosing Back Up Database under the
Address Book’s File menu.
If you have Bluetooth and a Bluetooth-enabled
cellular phone, you can dial phone numbers
by using the Address Book (see Technique 54).
Customizing the Template
When you add contacts to your Address Book,
you’re given a default template with set fields of
records that can be entered for each contact, such
as name, e-mail address, and so on. In all likelihood,
these preset fields and formats don’t adequately
reflect the information that you want to record or
use. The first thing that you should do with the
Address Book is to customize this default template.
Taking the time once to create a default
Address Book template makes adding or edit-
ing records easier and more efficient. Also,
understand that changing the template does
not delete nor change any previously existing
records. The template only determines what
fields are part of new records — not what
information is recorded or displayed.
To customize the default Address Book application:
1.
Open the Address Book application.
2.
Choose Preferences from the File menu or
press Ô+, (that’s a comma).
3.
In the Preferences dialog that appears, click
Template (see Figure 16-2).

Technique 16: Managing Information Effectively
132
• Figure 16-3: You can access more options by clicking 
the up and down arrows to create this 
pop-up menu.
5.
Delete all the fields that you won’t be using by
default by clicking the red minus sign next to
an item to remove it.
Your Address Book records must have the
First (name), Last (name), Company, image,
and Note fields. These are the only ones that
cannot be deleted.
6.
Add multiple fields of the same type using the
green button with the plus sign on it.
If you want to have several phone options or
e-mail listings in your default template, click the
green plus button to add another field of that
type. Then select a description from the pull-
down menu. For example, add another e-mail
address by clicking the green button next to
• Figure 16-2: The Template panel allows you to customize
the Address Book’s default template.
4.
Begin by changing any existing fields that you
don’t like to ones that you will use.
For example:
 If you want the template to have a home
phone field by default but no work phone,
change the work phone listing by clicking the
word work next to Phone and selecting home
from the pull-down menu that appears.
 If you want to list a person’s spouse instead 
of friend or assistant, click the word next to
Names (this is “spouse” by default) and select
the appropriate alternative from the pull-down
menu that appears.
 If AOL Instant Messenging (AIM) isn’t the
instant messaging application that you use
most often, change it to another from the
drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 16-3.

Creating Your Own vCard
133
Email (marked as “home”). Then choose “work”,
“other”, or “custom” from the new field’s pull-
down menu.
7.
Use the drop-down menu at the top of the 
window to add any additional fields that you
desire.
Use the top menu (see Figure 16-4) to add new
fields (like a birthday or nickname) or standard
ones that you’ve removed (e-mail addresses and
phone numbers).
• Figure 16-4: Use the Add Field menu to add fields not
currently listed in the template.
8.
When you finish creating the template, close
the Preferences window by clicking the
Close button or pressing Ô+W.
After you finish defining the Address Book
template, go to the Phone panel, where you
can establish the default format for phone
numbers (see Figure 16-5). If you check the
Automatically Format Phone Numbers box,
those numbers that match the default format
are formatted, while others (like international
numbers) are safely left alone.
• Figure 16-5: Use the Phone panel to set the default
format for phone numbers.
Creating Your Own vCard
The Address Book uses the vCard format, which is
the default format for personnel records. If you cre-
ate your own record in the Address Book (the appli-
cation creates a record for you automatically), you
can export the record as a vCard and e-mail it to
friends or co-workers. They can then import it into
their own contacts application, whether they use
Address Book or another such as Mail or Microsoft
Entourage, which saves them the trouble of typing 
in the information.
1.
Open the Address Book application.
2.
Navigate to your record by choosing Go to 
My Card from the Card menu (you can see 
one in Figure 16-6).

Technique 16: Managing Information Effectively
134
Double-clicking the image icon in the edit mode
brings up the image panel (see Figure 16-7). With
it, you can
 Drag an image file from the Finder into the
window.
 Use an attached video camera to take a snap-
shot of yourself.
If you have a FireWire video camera connected
to your computer — like one you would use
for video conferencing with iChat — your mug
appears in this window. You can capture your-
self by clicking on Take Video Snapshot.
 Click the Choose button to navigate to and
select the image to use.
• Figure 16-7: The image panel lets you add a graphical 
or pictorial representation of yourself to 
your card.
• Figure 16-6: My default Address Book record.
You can have more than one record for your-
self (or anyone), but you can only mark one 
as your official record in the Address Book.
This way, you can make different records for
personal or business purposes.
3.
Click the Edit button at the bottom of the card
panel.
You can toggle between edit and view mode
with the Ô+L keyboard shortcut.
4.
Edit your information, adding, changing, and
removing fields as necessary.
You can add other fields to the card by using
the Add Field option under the Card menu.
5.
Add your image — if you want — by double-
clicking the image icon.

Creating and Using Groups
135
After you select your image, click Set to apply
the changes. Then you return to the Card panel,
where you can continue editing your record.
6.
When you’re done editing your record, click
the Edit button to complete the changes.
7.
Choose Export vCard from the File menu.
8.
Save the vCard (see Figure 16-8).
You’ll most likely want to use your name as the
name of the file (with no file extension) and save
it in your Documents or other subfolder of your
Home directory.
• Figure 16-8: Export your vCard to your Documents
directory.
After you create your vCard, you can attach it to
e-mails so that people will be able to add your
record to their virtual Rolodex (whether they use
Address Book or not). If fact, adding and editing
your own card is a great way to feel comfortable
with the process and the application for when you
start adding other people’s information.
You can also access the Export vCard option
by Control+clicking your record and choosing
Export vCard from the contextual menu that
appears.
If someone e-mails you a vCard, add it to your
Address Book by dragging and dropping it onto 
the application.
Technique 33 shows how using the Ô+Y
shortcut, within the Mail application, creates
an Address Book entry for the sender of the
currently selected (or viewed) e-mail.
Creating and Using Groups
The final Address Book technique that we demon-
strate is how to create a group. Every record in your
Address Book can also be a member of one or more
groups. (They don’t have to be, though; a record can
be independent of all groups.) Defining groups
brings you three main benefits:

Better organization for finding a record

Ability to send an entire group (like your family)
updated contact information with the click of a
button

Ability to send e-mails to a defined set of people,
such as everyone in your department, by refer-
ring to the group name in the Mail application
You can create a group in three ways: by using the
New Group From Selection tool, manually, or by
duplicating an existing group.
Using the New Group From Selection tool
The fastest way to create a new group is to choose
New Group From Selection from the File menu.
1.
Click All under Groups to display every record.
2.
Ô+click the names listed in the Names column
to select the group members.

Search or browse through the Address Book
names, adding people to the new group by

5.
To delete a group member, select the member’s
name from under the group listing and then
press the Delete key.
Press Return at the prompt that appears (see
Figure 16-12) to remove the user from this group
only and not from the Address Book as a whole.
3.
Choose New Group From Selection from the
File menu (see Figure 16-9).
• Figure 16-9: The New Group From Selection option eases
the group creation process.
4.
Enter the new group’s name.
After Step 3, a new group is created in the Group
column. This new group’s name (“Group Name”
by default) is highlighted, ready for you to start
typing the new name.
5.
Press Return to complete the transaction.
Creating a group manually
To create a group manually:
1.
Make sure that you’re in Card and Columns
view mode by selecting it from the View menu
or by pressing Ô+1 (see Figure 16-10).

Duplicating an existing group
If you want to create a new group that contains some
of the members of an existing group, you might want
to simply duplicate the existing group and edit mem-
bers accordingly. Here’s how:
1.
Select the existing group in the group listing in
the left-hand column.
2.
Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô+C.
3.
Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô+V to create a

Other Cool Address Book Tricks
Apple put a lot of thought into the Address Book,
and it has its fair share of cool tricks. Here are the
ones that you should know, in case you don’t:

If you change your contact information, use the
Send Updates option (under the File menu) to
automatically e-mail your new information to
others. By selecting among the groups you have
already created, your friends and family can be
notified every time you move or change Internet
providers.

Click the address link for a home page to go to
that site.

Click a person’s e-mail address to be given a
prompt to e-mail them (see Figure 16-13).
• Figure 16-13: The pop-up menu for e-mail addresses in
the Address Book.

Click a person’s phone number to see it in large
type.

Add a phonetic field to records to remind your-
self how a name is pronounced. (It’s up to you to
master the International Phonetic Alphabet.)

Click an address to be given the option of seeing
a map for that address via MapQuest (see 
Figure 16-14).

Technique 16: Managing Information Effectively
138
In the Name box, give the directory any name you want.
The server name, which you enter in the Server box, is the
most important consideration. This will be something like
ldap.company.com. Some servers require you to authen-
ticate yourself with a username and password as well, so
those values can be entered by using this interface. Check
with your network administrator (or whomever controls the
LDAP server) for what the proper connection values should
be. When you enter all the required fields (including Search
Base, Port, and Scope), click Save.
To search for people in a directory server that you config-
ured this way, open the Directories group and then click
the name that you gave your directory. Type a few letters of
the name or e-mail address of the person whom you’re
looking for into the Search text field in the top-right corner
of the window. You will get a list of all entries containing
these letters, as shown here.
• Figure 16-14: The pop-up menu for addresses in the
Address Book.
LDAP Servers
Many organizations, especially larger ones, store informa-
tion about people (such as employees, customers, and sup-
pliers) in central LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol) directories. LDAP is a protocol for querying direc-
tories capable of holding information about millions of peo-
ple, and Apple’s Address Book is able to look up people in
such directory services. The Directories group in the Groups
column in Address Book was created for this purpose.
You add new directories by using the LDAP tab in the pref-
erences panel. There, you can add servers by clicking the
plus sign at the bottom of the window. This brings up the
Add a Directory panel, as shown in this figure.

Organizing and Prioritizing Information
139
Double-click one of the entries to view that person’s record.
If you know that you’ll need the contact information again,
drag the list entry over to your All group to create a local
copy in your Address Book. This way, you have access to the
information even when you’re not connected to a network.
Organizing and Prioritizing
Information
If you’re like us, you have lots of little bits of informa-
tion floating around your head, office, and computer.
The ability to find little things — like a person’s name,
a quote, a computer command, your to-do list, or
whatever — determines whether you’ll be productive
or struggling to keep your head above water in a sea
of chaos. We’ll briefly discuss the many applications
that you can use for these purposes.
Storing random bits of data as Stickies
If you’re not already using Stickies — an Apple appli-
cation that comes with the operating system — you’re
missing out on a useful little tool for storing little tid-
bits of stuff. Stickies are essentially small text files with
Post-It Note–like behavior. Unlike using Text Edit, with
Stickies you can create color-coded notes, quickly
make a note using Services (see Technique 27), and
keep a note at the front of your screen while you’re
using another application.
Some good Stickies tips include the following:

In the Finder and any other Carbon application
(like Mail, Safari, TextEdit, and the Address
Book), create a new Stickie note out of high-
lighted text by pressing Ô+Shift+Y.

Use different colored Stickies for different pur-
poses (see Figure 16-15). You can change a note’s
color using the Color menu and the fonts using
the Font menu or the Font palette (accessible by
pressing Ô+T).
• Figure 16-15: Each Stickie note uses a color that helps
you remember whether it’s personal, work
related, and so forth.

After you find a note color and style that you
like, choose the Use as Default option under the
Note menu to have your Stickies created in that
format by default.

Check the spelling in a note from the contextual
menu (Control+click a note) or choose Edit➪
Spelling.

Stickies support Services (see Technique 27),
meaning that you can access many different
shortcuts from within the Stickies application
(see Figure 16-16).

Technique 16: Managing Information Effectively
140

Check Off (www.ricciadams.com, $5) places a 
to-do list in the menu bar where you can add to 
it and mark items as completed.

BurnoutMenu (www.clichesw.com, $6) also
places a to-do list in the menu bar. Further, it
manages multiple to-do lists and works with iCal,
which is the calendar application that comes
with Mac OS X.
Getting organized with outlining applications
Outlining applications are tools to create lists with a
structure. Unlike TextEdit or even Microsoft Word,
outlining applications make it easier to stay organ-
ized, come up with game plans, and stay on top of
your information. Whether you are planning a Web
site, developing software, or writing a book, an out-
lining application manages your information for you,
making you more productive and keeping key ideas
from slipping through the cracks.
Obviously, you can create outlines with almost
any application, from Stickies or TextEdit to
Microsoft Word or QuarkXPress. The main
benefit of a formal outlining application is the
ease with which it sorts, structures, and man-
ages your content.

OmniOutliner from the good people at Omni
Group (www.omnigroup.com, $30) is Marc’s
favorite outlining application, possibly his
favorite application of all. It can be a very 
basic tool, but it also expands to fit your
needs. It even performs calculations for you.

Inspiration (www.inspiration.com, $70) is
higher priced than OmniOutliner but more
advanced. For example, Inspiration can create
visual (graphical) outlines and flowcharts.
• Figure 16-16: Services provide quick access to common
tasks.

Have a Stickie float above other applications by
clicking it and pressing Ô+Shift+F or choosing
Floating Window from the Note menu. A floating
Stickie will never be hidden by other applica-
tions (it always appears at the “front” of the
screen).

Stickies can also store images, videos, and
sounds. This capability makes Stickies much 
like the long-gone Scrapbook application.
If you like Stickies, you’ll really like StickyBrain,
from Chronos (www.chronosnet.com, $40).
StickyBrain takes the idea behind Stickies and
turns it into a full-fledged, potent application.
It includes graphic backgrounds, different
types of lists, a search feature, and much,
much more.
Prioritizing with to-do lists
If you really need an application for managing your
to-do lists — and you want something more advanced
than just Stickies or a text application — well, have
we got some suggestions for you! Here are two solid
shareware applications whose main purpose is to
create and manage to-do lists:

Working with Files
T
his, the third part of the book, is all about your stuff: where to put
it, how to file it, and what to do with all the things that fill up a
computer. In this technique, we talk about files (as opposed to 
folders or applications) and Panther. We should, therefore, talk a little
bit about how the operating system treats your stuff. Being able to com-
prehend and make the most of this relationship (between the operating
system and your files) goes a long way towards being able to use your
computer more readily.
We begin by discussing a file’s properties. This includes Panther’s nam-
ing conventions, locking files, how to add comments, and more. Then 
we conclude with how to solve some common file problems that most
users encounter eventually. In the process, we get a little technical but
not overwhelmingly so. After all, the benefit of owning a Mac is that you
don’t need to be a rocket scientist to use it.
Understanding a File’s Properties
The files on your computer have many properties, such as name, exten-
sion, size, and type. You’ll work with filenames more than any other 
property, but understanding and manipulating the other file properties
effectively is also important. Doing so can make the time that you spend
on your computer more efficient and secure.
Most of a file’s properties can be parameters for advanced searches
(see Technique 18). 
You can discern some file properties, such as name, extension, size
(depending upon how the window is customized), type, and default open-
ing application, just by looking at the file in the Finder (see Figure 17-1).

• Figure 17-2: Most of the Get Info panel’s subparts are

The General panel
The General panel shows you the basics, almost 
all of which can appear in the list view mode of the
Finder window. The only two things that you can
change here are

Stationery Pad: If you select the Stationery Pad
check box, the currently selected file becomes a
template with its own special icon (see Figure
17-3). When you open a Stationery Pad file,
Panther creates and opens a copy of it, allowing
you to work with the copy without altering the
original.
• Figure 17-1: You can tell a lot about a file just by looking
at its name and icon in the Finder.
These and other properties are not only viewable but
also editable in the Get Info panel. If you’re not famil-
iar with it, it’s about time to become so. After you
select a file, you can bring up the Get Info panel by


We discuss the Get Info panel extensively in this

Panther usage), so you really should get to know
your way around it. In this Technique, we go through
its subparts and how they relate to you and your
stuff. Note that each item on the Get Info panel has 
a right-pointing arrow next to it: Click that arrow to
expand its section and see more information, as
shown in Figure 17-2.

Locked: If you enable the Locked check box, the
file is safeguarded against changes or incidental
deletions. A locked file’s icon features a small
padlock (see the bottom file icon in Figure 17-4).
Locked files can be opened but not deleted nor
altered.

You likely know what a file’s name is and what it
means. (If you don’t, perhaps it’s time you pick up
Bob Levitus’s Mac OS X Panther For Dummies, Wiley
Publishing, Inc.) You can change a file’s name by
these three methods:

Click the filename in the Finder and type the new
name.

name.

144
How Panther Identifies a File
Instead of relying upon name and location to identify a file,
as you or we might, Panther assigns identifying numbers to
them. These values never change regardless of what you
do to the file, short of deleting it. (This is very similar to the
way Panther assigns identifying numbers to running appli-
cations, or, technically, processes.)
The beauty of this system is that it allows you to make all
sorts of modifications to a file without concern for causing
problems or rendering the file unusable.
Although a file’s extension is an issue that has been
mostly hidden from Mac users over the years, it’s
critical for many reasons. The file’s extension (and
kind, which is related) dictates what application is
used by default to open it (see “The Open With panel”
section next). You can change a file’s extension by

Changing the file’s name in the Finder, if the
extension is also shown
Hide or show a file’s extension by checking
the appropriate box in the Name & Extension
panel (refer to Figure 17-5).

Typing the filename and its new extension in the
Name & Extension part of the Get Info panel
When you change a file’s extension, Panther displays
a prompt (see Figure 17-6) confirming whether you
truly want to make this change because it will affect
what application is used to open it. Unfortunately,
you can’t avoid this prompt — Panther is trying to
behave in your best interest. Most commonly, you
might change the extensions on text files, Web
pages, and downloaded files. Doing so is not really a
problem — primarily it just affects what application
will open the file by default — and you can also
change the file’s extension back, if necessary.
• Figure 17-5: The Name & Extension section of a file’s Get
Info panel.
Panther has very few rules for how to name a file,
except for these:

Filenames cannot begin with a period.

Filenames cannot contain a semicolon.

Filenames should not contain a slash.

The maximum filename length is 255 characters,
although you might not be able to see a filename
this large under many conditions.

Two files within the same directory cannot have
the same name.
Strangely enough, you can change the name
or even the location of a file without disrupt-
ing the Recent Documents listing in the Finder
and applications. This is because the operating
system uses a secret, hidden method of refer-
ring to files rather than the more obvious
name and location.

Understanding a File’s Properties
145
• Figure 17-6: Before you can change a file’s extension, you
must confirm the action through this prompt.
Deleting a file’s extension in the Finder is the
same as selecting the Hide Extension check
box in the Get Info panel. Hiding or deleting
an extension does not affect which application
the file is associated with.
The Open With panel
The Open With panel shows you what application
opens a file by default. The pull-down menu also
allows you to change this setting for a particular file.
The Change All button lets you enact the change for
every file of this type. See Technique 23 for more.
The Preview panel
The Preview panel, as you might expect, shows you
a preview of the file. For many file types (text files,
spreadsheets, Web pages, and more), you see only
the file’s icon (see Figure 17-7). For image file types,
this panel shows a thumbnail of the image itself (see
Figure 17-8). With movies and sound files, you can
actually play them by clicking the Play button of the
preview (the right-pointing triangle, Figure 17-9).
• Figure 17-7: The preview of a Word document.
• Figure 17-8: The preview of an image file.

Technique 17: Working with Files
146
By default, the owner of a file is whoever created it — in
Panther, that means your short username for most of your
stuff. Permissions are also based upon groups. Again, by
default, this will be the group that the owner is a member
of. Of course, a user can be part of many different groups,
too, in which case one of those groups will be used.
The UNIX command for changing an owner — which must
be entered using the Terminal — is
chown owner filename
Of course, you’ll need to be an administrative level user in
order to do this. To change the group, you would use
chgrp group filename
or, conversely,
chown owner:group filename
The second file permissions issue is who can do what with
the file. The options are read, write, and execute (for a file)
or search (for a directory). Each of these options can be
specified for the owner, for the group, or for everyone. The
options for a specific file are represented in the Terminal by
a string of eight letters, as shown in the figure here. Starting
from the left, the first letter represents owner write, and the
string is read across in the following order: read, execute;
group write, read, execute; and everyone write, read, exe-
cute. A w means writable, r means readable, and x means
executable/searchable. A dash means that the permission is
not granted, and an initial d indicates that the file is actually
a directory.
In the figure, for example, the file 558129 ch17.doc has
read permissions for everyone and write permissions for
larry. The owner is larry, who is part of the group
larry.
Assuming that you have the permission to do so, you can
change permissions by using chmod. The syntax is
chmod permissions file
• Figure 17-9: The preview of an MP3 allows you to play
the sound file.
The Preview panel of the Get Info panel is
replicated by the column view mode of a
Finder window, where the final column is 
used for the preview.
The Ownership & Permissions panel
The Ownership & Permissions panel of the Get Info
panel is its most complex panel because it’s based
upon a UNIX concept (see the “UNIX Permissions”
sidebar if you really want to know more). The first
rule for this area is not to mess with it unless you
really know what you’re doing.
Permissions are a sticky subject. Toying with
them without fully understanding the ramifica-
tions can affect the security and operability of
your system.
UNIX Permissions
The UNIX operating systems have an elaborate set of per-
missions for files and folders based upon who owns a file
and who can do what with it. It all starts with the owner and
the group.

Understanding a File’s Properties
147
The permissions are assigned by using a three-digit num-
ber (although they can also be adjusted by using an alpha-
betic system). The first of the three numbers represents the
owner’s permission, the second is the group, and the third
is everyone else (others). Each number is made by adding
up the write permissions (worth 4), read permissions (2),
and search/execute permissions (1). A file with 777 permis-
sions is writable, readable, and executable by everyone. To
give yourself write and read permissions and everyone else
just read permissions on a file, use
chmod 622 filename
For more information on any of these tools, type man
chmod, man chgrp, or man chown in the Terminal.
The Comments panel
Adding comments to files, folders, and applications
has been part of the Mac operating system for years,
although most people don’t use them much. Panther
has added a feature — the ability to show comments
in a Finder window — that can make them more use-
ful. As an example:
1.
Select the file in the Finder.
2.
Press Ô+I to bring up the Get Info panel.
3.
Click the arrow for the Comments box if it’s not
currently pointing down.
4.
In the box, type any comments that you want to
add (see Figure 17-10).
5.
Close the panel by clicking the red Close button
in the upper left-hand corner.
6.
Set your window to list view by clicking the
icon in the toolbar or by pressing Ô+1.
7.
Customize the window settings by choosing
Show View Options from the View menu or by
pressing Ô+J.
8.
In the list of options, enable the check box next
to Comments.
• Figure 17-10: Add comments to a file by using the Get
Info panel.
9.
Close the View Options panel by pressing Ô+J
or clicking the red Close button.
You should now see your comments in the
Finder window (see Figure 17-11).
• Figure 17-11: With Panther, you can show comments in
the list view mode.
You can use comments to remind yourself of
the purpose or contents of a file. If a comment
is too long to view in the window, hover your
cursor over it to view the whole thing in a
popup window (as shown in Figure 17-12).
• Figure 17-12: Long comments, like long filenames, can be
seen by hovering the cursor over them.

148
5.
Go ahead and delete the file as you normally
would.
If you don’t want to see the confirmation
prompt every time you go to empty the Trash,
disable Show Warning Before Emptying the
Trash under the Finder’s Advanced prefer-
ences (see Figure 17-13).
• Figure 17-13: The show warning option is an extra level
of protection or annoyance, depending
upon your tastes.
Ejecting stuck disk images
A somewhat common occurrence is that you cannot
eject a disk image (whether a mounted hard drive, a
CD-ROM, or whatever). This usually happens
because Panther thinks that the disk is currently in
use. Even if you promise Panther that it isn’t, your
options are limited. Here are three good ways of
solving the problem:

Quit all open applications and try again.

Log out and log back in using the Apple menu 
or Ô+Shift+Q (but not by using Fast User
Switching).

Ignore the problem for now. The next time you
reboot, you’ll be able to eject the image without
issue.
Shareware Alternatives
If you really, really get into manipulating a file’s properties
(you know who you are), check out these shareware appli-
cations to facilitate the process.

Bare Bones’s Super Get Info (www.barebones.com,
$20) makes altering a file’s type (or kind) easier. It
also lets you work with invisible files and empty the
Trash even when the Finder says you can’t.

piDog Software’s InfoDog (pidog.com/infodog/,
$10 suggested) is similar to Super Get Info but also
has a file browser built into it.

Marc likes File Buddy (www.skytag.com/
filebuddy/, $38), which is like a Get Info tool and
file utility all in one. It not only helps you manage
individual files but also provides system-wide features
and troubleshooting techniques.
Solving Common File Problems
You likely won’t have too many problems when deal-
ing with files in your operating system, but they will
occur occasionally. Here’s your file-specific trouble-
shooting guide:
You’ll minimize some problems by using the
Repair Disk Permissions tool in the Disk Utility.
Run this monthly on the disk volume that con-
tains the operating system for smoother sailing.
Deleting locked files
As a security feature, locked files cannot be trashed.
There is absolutely no keyboard shortcut to over-
ride this. The only way to delete a locked file is to
unlock it first.
1.
Select the file in the Finder.
2.
Press Ô+I to bring up the Get Info panel.
3.
Select the Locked check box to unlock it.
4.
Close the panel by clicking the red Close 
button in the upper-left corner.

Solving Common File Problems
149
Similarly, a file cannot be deleted if it’s cur-
rently in use. This is almost always because the
application that the file was being used in is
still running (and the file itself might still be
open). Close the file and application and try
again.
Finding the original for an alias
If Panther cannot find the original file that an alias
refers to, it gives you a prompt (see Figure 17-14)
with three options:
• Figure 17-14: The error prompt for when Panther cannot
find an alias’s original file.

Delete Alias: Obviously, this option gets rid of
the alias, which fixes the problem.

Fix Alias: If you select what’s behind door num-
ber two, you’ll be presented with a window (see
Figure 17-15) so that you can select a new original
for this alias.
• Figure 17-15: You can use this dialog to navigate to the
file an alias should point to.

OK: If you click OK or press Return, nothing 
happens.
You can also select a new original for an alias
(whether there’s a problem with it or not) by
clicking the Select New Original button under
the Get Info’s General panel (see Figure 17-16).
• Figure 17-16: You can change the original for an alias 
by pulling up Get Info while the alias is
selected.
Sharing files with another OS
This last technique isn’t really a problem-solver for
Mac users — because Panther’s such a great operat-
ing system — but rather for those less fortunate
souls not running Mac OS X. While sharing files on
other operating systems (whether through a network


Avoid using spaces in the filename. (Hint: Use an
underscore instead.)

Keep the file’s extension as part of the filename.
Many operating systems used to or still do rely
on a file’s extension to know what application
should be used to open it.
or a disc), you can ease potential conflicts by abid-
ing by these rules:

Use filenames that are shorter than 32 charac-
ters in length.

Stick to alphanumeric characters in a filename.

Finding Files 
in the Finder
R
egardless of how well you organize your stuff and how on top of
things you stay, you’ll inevitably go looking for a file that you just
can’t find. Old-school Mac users might be familiar with Sherlock
(the file detective), but Panther has converted Sherlock to an Internet-
based search tool, replacing its role in the Finder with two separate tools:
the Search box and Find tool.
The search method that you’ll use most often is the Search box, present
in the Finder windows. This is an easy and fast way to locate what you
need. On a more advanced level, you can use the Finder’s Find tool,
which brings to the table the capability to do more exacting searches as
well as the ability to search for specific content. Finally, to wrap up this
Technique, we discuss some of the ways you can improve the effective-
ness and speed of your searches.
Finder Window Searches
For simple searches, you can’t beat the Finder windows. Although the
search features have been part of the Finder window for some time,
Panther has added some new features, particularly in the speed and
response of your searches. The Search box, by default, appears in the
upper-right corner of the Finder window (see Figure 18-1).
• Figure 18-1: The Finder window Search box.
Use the Search box to perform a case-insensitive search on the names 
of the folders, files, and applications located on your hard drives. The
Finder window search turns up any match found anywhere in a name. For
example, searching for cat brings up files such as Catalog.pdf, subcat.php,
or Pictures of My Cats.

• Figure 18-3: Use the magnifying glass to limit your search
to specific areas of your computer.
2.
If you see the file that you are looking for
before the search is finished, click the Stop 
button (which bears an X) in the lower-right
corner of the window to stop the search.
While the Finder continues its search, it shows
the results in the top panel and the status in the
bottom of the window.
3.
To cancel the search, click the Stop button (X)
in the Search box.
Clicking the Stop button in the Search box stops
the search, wipes out any results, and returns
the Finder window to its previous directory.
4.
After the search is completed or you’ve stopped
it, scroll through the results to see which files
matched the search.
Attempting to scroll through the search results,
let alone open one of these files, while the search
is still going is a pain because the window and its
contents keep changing. We recommend either
stopping the search if you see what you were
looking for or waiting for it to complete.
5.
To more quickly browse through the search
results, click the list headings to sort them 
(see Figure 18-4).
Click to halt an in–progress search.
Click to cancel a search.
If you can’t see the Search box because the
window is too narrow — but you know it’s
there — click the double right-facing arrows in
the upper-right corner and then select Search
from the menu that appears (see Figure 18-2).
• Figure 18-2: If the Search box disappears, you can
retrieve it with the double arrows.
To use the Search box:
1.
Click in the Search box and begin typing the
name of the file or folder that you want to locate.
Alternatively, you can use the Ô+Option+F 
keyboard shortcut to select the Search box.
If you don’t have a Search box in your win-
dow’s toolbar, you can customize the toolbar
to add it (see Technique 10). If the current 
window doesn’t have a toolbar at all, press
Ô+Option+ or choose Show Toolbar from 
the View menu.
The Finder instantly begins searching your hard
drive. Even so, you can continue to type in the
full file or folder name.
The window Search box lets you specify where
you’d like the search to look. The options are
discussed at the end of this chapter, but you
can change this setting by clicking the magni-
fying glass icon in the Search box (see Figure
18-3).

No matter which view mode you use for your
window when the search begins, the results will
always be shown in list view.
• Figure 18-4: Sort the results via the column headings to
browse more efficiently through the results.
6.
To learn more about a particular result, click it
once to select it (see Figure 18-5).
• Figure 18-5: Selecting a returned item in the results
window displays that item’s path in the
bottom window.
7.
Open the file by double-clicking it.
If you didn’t find the file you want, try a different
search term or use the Find window for a more
advanced search.
Hold down the Option key while opening the
file to close the search window at the same
time.
Using the Find Window
For more sophisticated searches, you’ll need to
leave the windows behind and make use of Finder’s
built-in Find command. This has replaced Sherlock’s
Find Files feature and is accessible by using the uni-
versal Ô+F keyboard shortcut or by choosing Find
from the File menu in the Finder.
The Find tool (see Figure 18-6) is to the Finder’s
Search tool what the Stealth bomber is to a paper
airplane. The main difference is that the Find tool
lets you establish multiple parameters for your
search, beyond just the file’s name. You can even use
ranges and conditionals with many of the parame-
ters, greatly expanding the possibilities.
Use the Search In drop-down list of the Find dialog 
to choose what parts of the computer should be
searched. The default options are
• Figure 18-6: Panther’s Find application.

Everywhere: Includes all mounted volumes like
CD-ROMs and even mounted servers.

Local Disks: All the hard drives on the computer.

Your Home directory

Specific Places: The most potent. As a default, 
it enables you to select among the available vol-
umes (see Figure 18-7), but you can also perma-
nently add other search locations to the list.

Technique 18: Finding Files in the Finder
154
The Search for Items Whose section is the most 
powerful part of the Find tool. With it, you can set
one or more search criterion. When you first bring
up the Find tool, two criteria are shown (Name and
Content). You can get rid of an item by clicking the
minus sign button or add more criteria by clicking
the plus button. For each item, you use the pull-
down menu to select your first criteria. Then, more
pull-down menus or text boxes appear, letting you
add more details to that search (for example, a part
of a name or a range for a date).
The available criteria include

Filename: Unlike the window search, the Name
field gives you the secondary option of selecting
whether the entered text should start, end,
exactly match, or simply be in a matched file-
name (see Figure 18-9). With this, you can more
effectively fine-tune the returned results.
• Figure 18-9: The pull-down menus let you further limit 
a search.

Content: The Find by Content feature searches
through the contents of a file (for example a
Word document, a plain text file, or even an
HTML page) for matching text. This is clearly the
most exhaustive search that you can execute.
When using the Find by Content feature, try
to limit the scope of your search as much as
possible. If you don’t, you might as well take
the day off while Panther looks through every
word of every file on your Mac.
• Figure 18-7: The Specific Places search box.
1.
Select Specific Places from the pull-down menu
in the Find tool.
2.
Click the Add button.
3.
Navigate to the directory that you want to add
and then press Return.
Remember that there’s no need to mark your
Home directory or the local volumes because
these have already been flagged by Find.
4.
Select check boxes to use or not use a specific
search location (see Figure 18-8).
• Figure 18-8: Add your Documents directory to the list of
specific locations.
One of the benefits of the specific locations
option is that you can permanently add loca-
tions to the search list but use only certain
ones by marking the check box next to its
name.

Using the Find Window
155

Date Modified or Date Created Dates: If you
have a sense of one of these two dates as they
relate to the desired file, this is a great way to
locate it. In the Find tool, use the first pull-down
menu to select which date you want to work
with, use the second menu to decide whether 
the file should have a specific date or fall within
a range, and use the third menu (if given the
option) for setting that range. Using dates, you
can search for a file whose modified or created
date is
 Today
 Within a certain time period relative to today
(see Figure 18-10)
 Before a particular date
 After a particular date
 A particular date
• Figure 18-10: The date search fields are very flexible,
allowing you to specify specific dates or 
a range.

Kind: The Kind search field lets you limit the
search to whether the file is of a certain type.
The list of types comprises alias, application,
folder, document, sound (audio file), image, or
movie.

Label: If you use Labels, you can also search
over whether the file has a particular label.

Size: If you know the approximate size of the
item in question, you can add a size is greater
than or size is less than search criterion.
Unfortunately, you cannot add two size options
at the same time to create a range of acceptable
values.
The size field is listed in kilobytes. If you need
something in bytes, divide the bytes by 1,000
(or 1,024 to be precise) and use that number.
If you need something in megabytes, multiply
the megabytes by 1,000 (or 1,024) to find the
kilobyte value to use.

Extension: The extension for a file is its (nor-
mally) three-letter indicator of its application
association. Whether you have the system set to
show file extensions or not, you can still search
with this criteria. Unlike Kind (which is more
general), with Extension, you can find a specific
file format, such as a TIFF as opposed to a GIF.

Visibility: Unbeknownst to many, oodles of 
hidden files are lurking around your computer.
This is largely thanks to the UNIX infrastructure
that remains hidden from novice users. You can
use the Visibility parameter to look for visible
files, invisible (hidden) files, or both file types
(Figure 18-11).
• Figure 18-11: You can search for hidden files with the
Find tool.

Type: The file’s Type refers to an old system that
the Macintosh used where each file had a four-
letter type code. Because Apple seems to be
moving away from Types — and you’d have to 
be pretty advanced to use them anyway — we
recommend just skipping this category.

Press Return or click the Search button to
begin the search process.

When the search is complete, click the Size 
column heading to list the returned items by
size in descending order (see Figure 18-14).

information.
9.
Press Delete to delete any selected files that
you decide you don’t need.
You can delete an item from the Search box,
but — and here’s the confusing part — it
remains in the search results listing. The only
difference is that its location will change to the
Trash.
The File Buddy application (www.skytag.com/
filebuddy/, $38) has a great search capability
built into it. If you’re already using this applica-
tion for other purposes, be certain to check
out its Find tool.

Creator: A file’s creator is the application used 
to originally make the file, which could differ
from the file’s extension association. This, like
the Type, is an advanced concept you’re better
off not muddling with.
As a little example of how you might use the Find
tool, here’s how to create a search that locates the
largest files in your Home directory, so that you can
delete those you don’t need any more to clear up
some space.
1.
Open the Find tool by pressing Ô+F in the
Finder or by choosing Find from the File menu.
2.
Select Home from the Search In menu 
(see Figure 18-12).
• Figure 18-12: Your Home directory is a default search
realm.
3.
In the Search for Items Whose section, select
Kind, Is Not, and Folder from the first, second,
and third parameter menus (respectively).
This excludes folders from the search. Because
you want to find the largest files (not folders),
eliminate folders (which can be quite large) from
your search.
4.
Click the plus button to add another search 
criterion.
5.
To eliminate results smaller than about 10MB,
select Size and Is Greater Than from the first
two parameter menus, and then type 10000 in
the KB box (see Figure 18-13).

Incorporating Better Search Techniques

Incorporating Better
Search Techniques
You can improve the quickness and effectiveness of
your searches in many ways, whether you’re using
the Finder windows or the Find prompt. Here are
some of the best tips and techniques:

The Finder window’s search box allows you to
specify where the search should run. Your
options are
 Local Disks: All the hard drives on the 
computer
 Your Home directory
 The Current Selection: In other words, the
directory shown in the current window
 Everywhere: Includes all mounted volumes
Making this selection — before you start typing
the search characters — greatly improves both
how fast the search is executed as well as how
useful the returned results are.

Pressing Ô+J in the search window results panel
(whether you use the window or the Find tool)
brings up the Search Results View Options panel
allowing you to customize all Search results 
windows (see Figure 18-15).

If you use the Find by Content search feature,
minimize the number of languages that the
Finder is considering to speed it up considerably.
Do so by following these steps:
1. Make the Finder active.
Of course, you can do this by clicking the
Desktop, clicking the Finder’s icon in the
Dock, or by pressing Ô+Tab to toggle over.
2. Bring up the Finder preferences by pressing
Ô+, (comma) or by choosing Preferences
from the File menu.
3. In the Preferences panel, click Advanced.
4. At the bottom of the Advanced panel (see
Figure 18-16), click the Select button.
• Figure 18-15: You can customize the search results just
like any other window. 
• Figure 18-16: The search languages can be selected in
the Finder’s preferences.

Technique 18: Finding Files in the Finder

like the index at the back of this book: a cata-
loged reference of where things can be found. 
If you have well-maintained indexes, Find by
Content can use this to quickly return results.
1. Select a folder or volume in the Finder that
you want to index.
The operating system can index any directory,
whether your Home folder, your Documents
folder, or a whole hard drive.
2. Bring up the Get Info panel.
3. Show the Content Index panel by clicking the
arrow next to this heading (see the results in
Figure 18-18).
• Figure 18-18: The Get Info panel has a Content Index
subsection when applied to folders.
4. Click the Index Now button to begin the index-
ing process.
5. In the resulting window (see Figure 18-17),
deselect every language that you won’t be
searching through.
• Figure 18-17: The Find by Content should only use those
languages that you regularly use.
6. Click OK to close the languages window, and
then click the red button to close the
Preferences panel.
In Technique 56, we show you an even better
way to find files than using the Finder. In that
Technique, you’ll discover the Find and Locate
command line tools. You’ll have to use the
Terminal to use these, but they are surprisingly
fast and effective.

If you use the Find by Content feature, you can
improve the speed of the search by maintaining
an index of your content. Such an index is just

159
5. As desired, repeat these steps for other, com-
monly searched (by content) directories.
6. Repeat the indexing process on a regular
schedule (like weekly) if you do a lot of Find
by Content searches.
7. Use the Get Info panel to delete a directory’s
index if you find yourself not using it.
Although indexes greatly improve the speed
of your Find By Content searches, they also
take a while to create and take up a consider-
able amount of disk space. Don’t go crazy with
indexes, particularly if you never make use of
them, or else you’ll quickly clutter up your file
system.

Slimming Down
Your Hard Drive
I
t never fails to happen: All that extra space you thought you’d never
fill up is suddenly gone. It’s a sad fact that’s just as true whether you’re
talking about a new house or an apartment or that 60GB hard drive
that you believed would allow you to download the whole Internet to
your computer. Eventually the time comes to either clean house or
upgrade.
Knowing what you can get rid of and how to do it saves you the time and
expense of upgrading a hard drive (and makes your computer perform
slightly better). This begins with doing nothing: that is, not installing
applications and files that you won’t use. After that, you should look at
getting rid of the files on your hard drive that are no longer needed. You
can do this manually with a little prudent knowledge. Third-party appli-
cations that help you remove the hidden system files you no longer need
are also available. Finally, we send up some warning flares to remind you
of those things you absolutely, positively shouldn’t get rid of.
Avoiding Unnecessary Installations
If you’ve read Technique 1, you know that during the Panther installation
process, you can customize your installation so that only those features
you need are installed. A new Panther installation can take anywhere
from a few hundred megabytes to two whole gigabytes.
Because you cannot easily uninstall parts of Panther, you’re better off not
installing them in the first place — assuming you won’t need them, that
is. The worst offenders, in terms of disk space, are

Printer drivers: Panther supports many common printers — which is
great — but it does so at a huge cost of disk space. Installing all the
printer drivers would take nearly a gigabyte. This is definitely one area
where you should use some judgment about what to install and what
to leave out. Three good options are

Weeding Your Hard Drive: Manually Deleting Files
161
 If you don’t have a printer, don’t install any
printer drivers.
 If you do have a printer, see whether the man-
ufacturer provides a driver for your specific
model by checking the support, software, or
drivers section of its Web site. That driver
might be only a few megabytes in size and
therefore much smaller than the one-size-fits-
all driver provided by Apple for that manufac-
turer’s printers.
 If neither applies to you, install only the 
drivers for your make of printer.

Language Translations: Language Translations
allow your Mac to display system controls (menus
and such) in languages other than English.
Although it’s great that Apple recognizes the
global, multilingual community, if all the people
using your computer speak the same language,
avoid Language Translations. These take up
nearly 400MB.

Fonts: In a similar vein, Panther can also install
fonts for you to use a dozen non–Indo-European
languages with your Mac. These fonts enable you
to read Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and other 
languages in your applications. Naturally, if you
don’t see that happening, you don’t need to
install these fonts.
You should also be prudent when installing applica-
tions. Most installers give you the option of cus-
tomizing the installation process (as Photoshop
does in Figure 19-1) so that unnecessary pieces don’t
clutter up your computer. As a general rule, hard
drive-hogging applications — for example, Adobe
Photoshop or Apple’s Final Cut Pro — give you more
flexibility to customize installation.
Many installers, including Panther, allow you
to dictate what gets installed. If you won’t use
something, don’t install it. If you later realize
that you need something you didn’t install,
you can always add it by running the installer
again.
• Figure 19-1: Many installers let you customize the
installation itself.
Weeding Your Hard Drive:
Manually Deleting Files
As a general rule, Mac OS X does not use uninstallers
for either the operating system or for individual
applications. Thus, after you’ve installed the junk . . .
er, files . . . on your computer and realize that you no
longer need them, you must delete them manually.
You might want to do some judicious weeding in
these four general areas: your Home folder, the
Applications folder, the System folder, and other 
volumes.
Use Ô+Delete to send a selected item (or
items) to the Trash.
Be certain to back up the contents of your
computer before going hog-wild deleting
items that you believe to be unnecessary. A
good backup makes restoring items a snap if
you inadvertently delete something important
in your housecleaning frenzy. See Technique
48 for everything you need to know about
backups.

Technique 19: Slimming Down Your Hard Drive
162
1.
Locate the application’s file or folder within the
Applications directory.
Simple applications are wrapped in a single icon,
which can be deleted (like Internet Explorer).
More involved applications have their own folder
(for example, Netscape Navigator).
2.
Move the file or folder to a temporary location.
Instead of deleting the files immediately, we 
recommend temporarily setting them aside as a
just-in-case measure. You can create a folder on
the Desktop for this purpose or move them onto
an external driver or CD.
3.
Open the Library folder of your Home 
directory.
If you really want to clean house, you should 
also get rid of the corresponding application
stuff that was placed within your directory. This
includes supporting materials and preferences.
4.
Check the Application Support folder for files
associated with the application and move any
applicable items to the temporary folder.
Only a few applications have files here, but if you
want to be thorough, it’s worth checking out.
5.
Repeat Step 4 for the Preferences directory.
Pretty much every application adds at least one
file to your Preferences folder. Although these
files are small, they’re still worth getting rid of.
6.
Wait a few days. Then, if you don’t see any
problems caused by moving these files, delete
the temporary folder.
If you installed an application, it should be safe
for you to remove it. Applications installed 
by Panther shouldn’t be messed with. This
includes items in the Applications folder such
as System Preferences and Internet Connect.
Pruning your Home directory
Your Home directory is where you’re most likely to
get rid of extraneous stuff. Fortunately for you, it’s
generally the safest place to make cuts as well. Here’s
what you can do:

Clean up the contents of your Desktop folder.

Delete anything that you no longer want in the
Documents folder.

Free up some space in the Movies, Music, and
Pictures folders.

Get rid of anything that you don’t want in the
Public folder unless it’s still needed by others
on your computer or network.

Remove files from the Sites directory. The Sites
directory is where you store Web pages. As any
Web developer knows, these directories become
easily cluttered with old versions of files. Remove
them to save some room here and there.
If the contents of the Movies, Music, or
Pictures folders are managed by iMovie,
iTunes, or iPhoto, you’ll be better off deleting
these files from within those applications
because they have associations with the 
physical files.
Thinning out no-longer-required applications
Applications can take up a huge amount of space on
your computer. If you’re actually using the applica-
tions, it’s no big deal. But after you’ve stopped play-
ing a certain game or found a better alternative to an
application, you might want to get rid of it. Because
you normally won’t find an uninstaller for an applica-
tion, here are the steps you’ll want to take:
Personally, we don’t install shareware or demos
of applications that we don’t reasonably expect
to buy. Doing so only wastes time and clutters
up your hard drive.

Cleaning out your System and Library folders
If you check out the size of your system files, stored
both in the Library and the System folders, you’ll see
that they take up a lot of space (in Figure 19-2, see
how two folders take up a gig). That being said, you
don’t want to go traipsing through there to remove
files. The reward for clearing up some room is slight,
while the risk that you take will be grave. As the worst
case, it’s possible that you would trash something
that renders your computer inoperable. For the most
part, you’re better off leaving these files as-is.
• Figure 19-2: The Library and System folders are huge but
off-limits!
However, here’s one thing that you can do with sys-
tem files: If you performed an Archive and Install
installation of Panther, the installer creates a Previous
Systems folder to store the old system files. If every-
thing’s running okay with the new operating system,
you can delete this entire folder.
Don’t remove anything (anything!) from the
System or the Library folders unless you really,
really know what you’re doing and have
backed up the entire computer.
Cleaning other volumes
Most computer users have already established 
multiple volumes for their computer. This is accom-
plished by either installing extra hard drives or par-
titioning larger hard drives into separate volumes. 
If you’ve done this, you’re probably using the other
volumes purely for storage purposes (because the
main volume is running the operating system and
should have your Home directory). Your other vol-
umes, therefore, are a good place to get rid of no-
longer-needed files.
Classic and OS 9
If you’re still running Classic or dual-booting into OS 9
(gasp!), you have another area where you can trim down
files. Some considerations include the following:

Drop OS 9 applications for which there are good OS
X alternatives. There’s no reason to keep two applica-
tions that do the same thing.

If you’re using Classic, there are many system exten-
sions you won’t be using. For example, if you won’t
be using QuickTime or a printer within Classic, you
can drop many megabytes of deadwood. Getting 
rid of these will save space and make Classic launch
faster.

Keep all your files within your OS X Home directory.
You can still access them from OS 9.

Best of all, get rid of OS 9 and Classic as soon as
possible, and then delete all those files!
Diet Tools: Third-Party
Applications
If you’d rather spend your weekend cleaning the
attic and not your hard drive, you can invest in one
of many third-party applications that facilitate the
process. (The process of cleaning up your hard
drive, that is. You’re on your own when it comes to
cleaning up the attic.) In truth, these applications

Panther runs some utilities between 3 a.m.
and 5 a.m. to delete system files that are no
longer necessary. If you don’t leave your com-
puter on overnight, use a tool like MacJanitor
to clean up unnecessary system files. 
Hands-Off: What Not to Trash
Now that you’ve mastered how to get rid of files, we
should go over what you don’t want to do. You might
be the type who’ll gladly spend a day tinkering just
to clear up a little space, but here are some rules
that you should never break:

Do not delete or rename the Applications or
Utilities folders.

Do not delete or rename your Home folder.

Do not delete or rename the Desktop or Library
folders in your Home directory.

Do not touch the System or Library folders.
make more of a quantitative than a qualitative deci-
sion. Whereas you might know that you no longer
need a particular document or no longer like a par-
ticular song (an MP3 file), these tools earmark files
whose size and lack of use might merit removal.

OmniDiskSweeper, by the good people at the
Omni Group (www.omnigroup.com, $15), offers a
good bang for very little buck. It basically repli-
cates the process of going through the Finder
and removing large files but gives you a nicer
interface. It also warns you about deleting 
potentially critical files.

Cocktail (www.macosxcocktail.com, $10) offers
many system utilities to your operating system,
including the ability to clean up unnecessary
files such as system logs.

MacJanitor (personalpages.tds.net/~brian_
hill/macjanitor.html, free) provides the 
routine maintenance tasks that your computer
would naturally do if you left it on 24 hours 
per day. Because many people don’t do this,
MacJanitor does the cleaning up for you. You 
can also run it if you just want to manually 
clear up some space.

Managing
Applications
I
n this Technique, we don’t cover anything specific about a particular
application, but rather we discuss general techniques that apply to
almost every application.
We tell you everything you ought to know about installing, moving, and
uninstalling applications. Although you might not do these things fre-
quently, understanding what each step does and how it affects your com-
puter goes a long way toward helping you master Panther. We also show
you a brilliant strategy to save you untold hours the next time that you
begin working with a new computer or a new hard drive.
Installing Applications
Okay, you’ve probably installed applications on your own already. In fact,
you probably did a fine job of it, too. But did you really comprehend all
the possibilities available, and did you really prepare yourself for future
installations? There’s more to installing applications than just double-
clicking an installer and following the prompts.
Before you install any commercial application, make sure you’ve got
your serial number for that application handy.
Consider these two important factors when installing an application:

Where should you install the files?

How can you customize the installation?
By default, an installer normally tries to place the new installs in the
Applications directory (as shown in Figure 20-1), and you should let it!
That’s the purpose of the Applications folder, after all. We discuss the
merits of organizing the Applications directory in the next section.

installed. Such applications often include megabytes
worth of sample files, templates, and tutorials,
which you may or may not ever need.
• Figure 20-2: Microsoft Office comes with scads of extras.
A few special pieces of software have a secondary
level of customization. Drivers, preference panels,
and contextual menu items can normally be installed
on a user or system-wide level. This includes stuff
like TinkerTool (as in Figure 20-3) and Big Cat from
Ranchero software.
• Figure 20-3: TinkerTool specifically asks you in what
scope the utility should be installed.
• Figure 20-1: You should let installers place applications in
the default location.
Older versions of Mac OS X also created an Applica-
tions folder within each user’s Home directory. Even
if you have this, you should probably not use it. Apple
has moved away from the idea (which is obvious by
the fact that this feature has disappeared in Panther)
and recommends that you use the Applications folder
in the root of your computer (/Applications in formal
terms) instead.
You don’t necessarily need to install an appli-
cation in order to use it. You can run some
applications from a CD-ROM.
The customization process is critical because it
affects both what features are available and how
much disk space the application takes up. As a rule,
the larger the application, the more room there is for
customization. For example, Microsoft Office (see
Figure 20-2) and many Adobe products are highly
customizable, and their installation can take up to
several hundred megabytes if all options are

Tracking Installed Applications
169
If you choose to install these things for yourself,
they’ll be added to the Library folder within your
Home directory. The benefit of this is that they’ll
be backed up and easily moved because they travel
with the rest of your stuff. Of course, other users
(when they log in as themselves) won’t be able to
take advantage of the new tools. This could be a
good or a bad thing, depending on how you feel
about the other people sharing your computer.
Nontraditional Applications
Many applications (such as drivers and UNIX apps and
tools) do not follow the normal Mac OS X installation
process. Drivers — special software that adds capabilities to
your computer — may run in the background or be
installed as a System Preferences panel. Many UNIX appli-
cations and tools do not come with a GUI (graphical user
interface). Therefore, they won’t have an icon in the
Applications folder or launch from the Finder. In these
cases, you really should let the installers place everything
where they want to and then leave well enough alone.
Nontraditional applications like these break easily, so
attempting to use settings other than the defaults is a bad
idea.
X11 (www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11), which
provides a GUI for UNIX software, uses its own installation
procedures. The easiest way to install software is to use
the FinkCommander (http://finkcommander.source
forge.net) utility. It provides a list of available applications
and quickly installs them for you. Installed software is
placed in a secret location (either a folder called sw or a hid-
den directory) and is accessible through X11. Again, don’t
toy with these settings unless you like trouble or really
know what you’re doing.
Tracking Installed Applications
Installing applications on your computer is more
complicated than just running an installer. Although
following through those steps gets you the results
you want (namely, the application on your computer),
that’s about all it does. We’ve hinted at this in other
techniques, and now we’ll be more explicit: Prudent
Mac users maintain a collection of the software
they’ve installed, and we’re not talking about a
drawer full of discs! Following these steps saves you,
without exaggeration, hours should you buy a new
computer, get a new hard drive, or have to reinstall
everything after some sort of disaster.
Panther records what files where installed
using packages in the /Library/Receipts
directory.
Here’s what we recommend that you do:
1.
Set aside the CD-ROMs for commercial applica-
tions in a common place.
Saving the gigantic two-disc Microsoft Office
installers on your hard drive is a waste of
space, so instead, just try not to lose these
discs.
2.
Store copies of all the software you’ve installed
in a new directory.
You should save copies of shareware items that
you’ve downloaded from the Internet as well as
freeware stuff like the Camino Web browser on
your computer. Doing so not only reminds you of
what you’ve installed but also saves you the has-
sle of re-downloading the file later.
If you have a slow Internet connection, save
copies of the files that you download. This
saves you the time of finding the items online
again and the drag of waiting for them to be
downloaded. 
3.
Organize the software directory so that it paral-
lels the structure of your Applications directory.
Create separate subdirectories to reflect the
drivers, games, utilities, and UNIX software that
you’ve installed.
4.
Use TextEdit to create a master text file that
lists every application that you installed.
Beyond storing and listing the files themselves,
maintaining a text list of the applications that
you use is a good idea because it’ll remind you of
what applications you use and give you a central

Technique 20: Managing Applications
170
• Figure 20-4: Use a CD to store and help track all the
software that you use on your computer.
10.
Store the CD or DVD, along with the printed
text file, in a safe, memorable location.
Rather than keeping all of your well-organized
files and data on your hard drive — where it
both takes up space and has the potential to be
lost — store it elsewhere for safekeeping.
11.
When using a new disk drive, a reformatted
drive, or a new Mac, use your software disk
and the backup of your Home directory (see
Technique 48) to recreate your previous
environment.
A well-thought-out CD or DVD with all (or
most) of your software and the corresponding
serial numbers can help you out tremendously
the next time you are looking at a brand-new
hard drive.
repository for every serial number. Making this
list in TextEdit means that any Mac will be able
to read it (whereas you couldn’t read a Microsoft
Word document until you’ve installed Word).
5.
Add the serial numbers — with the correspon-
ding software version number — to the text file.
Tracking serial numbers for the many different
applications that you use is really difficult. If you
store them all in one text file, the next time you
have to install an application, you can just refer
to your master list rather than hunt through vari-
ously shaped cards and manuals. Be certain to
also note the version number of the software
because serial numbers normally correspond to
a specific version of the application.
6.
Add to your master text file the URLs of the
Web sites from where you downloaded files.
If you want to search the Web for the latest ver-
sion of something you use, place the URL (and
maybe even the current version number) for
downloaded software in your text file. Then, the
next time you go to install these things, a quick
check suffices to let you know whether a newer
version is available for download.
7.
Store this text file within the software directory
that you created.
8.
Print out a copy of the text file and put the cur-
rent date on it.
If you get a new computer or reformat your hard
drive, you might not immediately have a printer
working. While you can still use the digital copy
of the file, having a hard copy available makes
entering in serial numbers during installations
easier (rather than switching back and forth
between the installer and TextEdit). By adding a
date to this file, you can rest assured that you are
using the most current version of the document.
9.
If you can, burn the software directory to CD
or DVD (see Figure 20-4).
Alternatively, move the software directory to an
external source (such as a Zip drive or external
hard drive).

Moving Installed Applications
171
Working with Packages
The Apple Installer application installs packages, which are
a special file format. Although the process works smoothly,
and you normally don’t need to think much about it, the
Mac power user might appreciate a couple of additional
tricks.
After the Installer works its magic (installs a package),
you can get a detailed list of what files were installed by
using the lsbom -f command in the Terminal. Apply it to
the appropriate .bom (Bill of Materials) file inside the pack-
age receipt directory in /Library/Receipts to get a
detailed list of the files that were installed by a particular
installation:
1.
Open the Terminal application.
2.
Move to the /Library/Receipts directory by
using the command cd /Library/Receipts.
3.
List the receipts by typing ls and pressing
Return.
4.
Move into a specific directory with the com-
mand cd ReceiptName/Contents (for example,
cd BSD.pkg/Contents).
5.
View the installed files with lsbom -f
Archive.bom.
You might also investigate a cool little tool called Pacifist
(www.charlessoft.com, $20), which allows you (if you
know what you’re doing) to selectively install single files out
of a big package. This can be a big timesaver if you know
what you’re looking for.
Moving Installed Applications
You might need to move an application from one vol-
ume to another someday for various reasons. These
include

You’ve backed up the hard drive, reformatted
it, and are trying to restore it to its previous
condition.

You’ve bought a new hard drive and want it
to be usable without formally installing every
application.

You have a new computer.
Here’s how:
1.
For starters, move the application’s folder (the
top images in Figure 20-5) or the application
itself (the bottom images in Figure 20-5) to the
destination volume.
• Figure 20-5: Some applications have their own folder, but
others are represented by an icon.
2.
Check the Preferences folder within the Library
directory of your Home folder for associated
files.
Most applications store at least one Preferences
file in your Home directory. If you fail to move a
Preferences file, the application will most likely
build you a new one, but you’ll lose all the appli-
cation preferences that you’ve set, of course.

Technique 20: Managing Applications
172
6.
Move the files found in Step 5 to the correspon-
ding directory in the new location.
Moving the Apple applications (those that
come with the operating system and those
that the operating system relies upon) is not a
good idea. You might not create problems by
doing so, but why take the risk?
Moving applications is not really an exact science,
but it is feasible. (In fact, it’s much easier for Mac
users than it is for those poor Windows people.) As
a worst-case scenario, if an application acts funny
after being moved, you should probably just trash it
and install a fresh copy from the original installation
media.
Organizing the Applications folder
Like the files in your Home directory, you have some
leeway as to how you organize the Applications
folder. Apple gives you just a Utilities subfolder. If
you leave it this way, however, your Applications
folder can quickly become unwieldy. You are wel-
come to add folders to this directory (for example,
a Games folder), but you should do so before you
begin installing applications.
Your safest option for organizing the Applications
directory is to leave it as is. Instead of fuddling
around in there, make judicious use of aliases,
Finder windows, the Dock, and Favorites to access
your applications with ease.
OS 9, Classic, and You
If you came to Panther from using OS 9 or otherwise had
installed OS 9 along the way, you can get rid of plenty of
applications. For starters, trash every OS 9 application for
which there is already a good Mac OS X alternative. (See
the section “Uninstalling Applications,” later in this Technique,
for more on how to delete an application that you no
longer want cluttering up your hard drive.) You have no
reason to keep these old, outdated pieces of software
around.
3.
Check the Application Support folder with the
Library directory of your Home folder for cor-
responding files.
Many applications add files to your Application
Support folder (see Figure 20-6). You’ll also need
to transfer these.
• Figure 20-6: A user’s Application Support folder, with
tools required by some software.
Applications that you installed via an installer
almost always place files in several locations,
including Application Support. Applications
that you installed simply by dragging a folder
or icon into your hard drive most likely only
have a Preferences file.
4.
Move the files found in Steps 2 and 3 to the
appropriate folders in the new Home directory.
5.
Search the rest of the hard drive for other
related files.
See the next section, “Uninstalling Applications,”
for information on how to effectively search your
hard drive. You might find other Application
Support files within the /Library and /System/
Library directories.

Uninstalling Applications
173
You can uninstall OS 9 applications by trashing the applica-
tion’s icon or folder. But, unlike OS X files, OS 9 applica-
tions store extra files in the /System/Preferences folder
and/or the /System/Extensions directory. While these
files are small, they can and should also be deleted.
If you decide to keep OS 9 and some of its applications,
be certain to keep them separate from your OS X soft-
ware! By default, your OS 9 applications should be in
the Applications (Mac OS 9) folder, not the Mac OS X
Applications folder. Keeping these separate insures that you
don’t inadvertently launch the wrong version of an applica-
tion or go into Classic when you didn’t mean to.
Uninstalling Applications
If you find yourself no longer using an application, or
you desperately need to clean up some disk space,
you can uninstall applications. Unlike Windows, the
Mac has no uninstaller application built into the
operating system. And, for that matter, few, if any,
Macintosh applications come with an uninstaller.
Therefore, to get rid of an app, you’ll have to do it
manually, like so:
1.
Select the application’s icon.
2.
Bring up the Get Info panel using Ô+I (as
shown in Figure 20-7).
3.
Make note of the application’s full name and
creation date.
4.
Using the Finder, delete the application’s folder
or icon.
5.
Open up the Finder’s Find tool by pressing Ô+F
or choosing Find from the File menu. 
6.
Search your entire hard drive for files that
 Contain the application’s name in its name
 Have the same creation date
 Contain the manufacturer’s name in its name
 Have a location that, in some way, corre-
sponds to the application itself
• Figure 20-7: An application’s Get Info panel reveals many
useful bits of data.
If an application came with a README file or
created an installer log, you can use this docu-
ment to help guide your manual uninstallation
process. README files often indicate what will
be installed where and installer logs specifi-
cally list what was installed where.
7.
Delete any files that meet any of the criteria in
Step 6.
The largest percentage of space is taken up by
the application itself. Getting rid of the extra-
neous files clears out only a minimal amount
of space, but you risk getting rid of something
you shouldn’t. Be extra careful when doing so
or skip Steps 5 through 7 entirely.

Technique 20: Managing Applications
174
8.
Empty the Trash and kiss that application (and
hopefully not too much more) goodbye.
Aladdin Systems, the maker of StuffIt (among
other software), offers the Spring Cleaning
application (www.aladdinsys.com, $50). It
records what was installed for particular appli-
cations, making thoroughly uninstalling an
app easier and safer.

Launching
Applications Fast
Y
ou might think that opening (or launching, starting, or however
you want to say it) an application is so simple that you couldn’t
possibly improve on it. But surprisingly, you can use many tech-
niques and tools to improve on this common procedure. Putting some
time and effort into mastering the easiest ways to open applications goes
a long way towards expediting how you use your computer.
The first timesaving technique is to have Panther automatically open an
application when you log into the computer. Then we go over the multi-
tude of ways you can launch applications (such as from the Finder or
Dock), some of which you probably already know. Finally, you read about
a couple of shareware tools designed to open applications in easier ways.
Auto-launching with the Accounts Panel
The Accounts panel, which is part of your System Preferences, does more
than just allow you to manage the computer’s users. Individual users can
also pop open the Accounts panel to adjust some of the computer’s behav-
ior for their account. The relevant subsection with respect to opening
applications is the StartUp Items panel. To access this, select System
Preferences from the Apple menu, and then click Accounts under the
System heading. Click your account in the left column and then click
Startup Items in the right column (see Figure 21-1).

be hidden when you log in. Essentially it will be as if
you opened the application and then selected Hide
application from the application menu. This is a good
option for behind-the-scenes utilities that you don’t
need to be aware of.
• Figure 21-2: This is the slow way to add applications to
Startup Items.
• Figure 21-3: Enable its check box to hide an application
while it’s opening.
• Figure 21-1: Use Startup Items to automatically launch
applications.
To make a program launch automatically when you
log in to your computer, add it to the Startup Items
list. You can add items to the Startup Items list in
two ways:

By clicking the plus button at the bottom of the
page, navigating to the application, and then click-
ing Add to access an Open dialog (Figure 21-2).

By dragging an application’s icon from its folder
onto the Startup Items panel.
The quickest way to add applications to the
Startup Items panel is to drag them there
from the Finder.
After you add an item to this listing, you can choose
to have it open in hidden mode by marking the check
box next to its name (as shown in Figure 21-3). Hiding
a Startup Item just means that the application will

To remove an application from the Startup Items
panel, you have only one method:
1.
Select the item in the list by clicking it.
2.
Click the minus button at the bottom of the
window to remove the item.
You might be wondering, “How do I decide what
applications to automatically start?” The answer to
this depends, obviously, on what kind of computer
you have and how you use it. Primarily, if you have a
laptop — meaning that you frequently run off battery
power and change your computing habits often —
you probably don’t want to overdo it with Startup
Items. But, in general, abide by these rules:

Add utilities and shareware that provide perpetu-
ally necessary services (for example, LaunchBar
or system clock replacements).

Add applications that you’ll always use first thing
on your computer (such as Mail or Eudora).

Include applications that you use every day (like
Safari or iTunes).

Add utilities that should be run on a daily basis
(maybe Virex or Backup).

Add applications that take a long time to load
(like Photoshop) if there’s a good chance you’ll
use it on a nearly daily basis.
Many applications, such as Virex, have options
within their Preferences panels (see Figure
21-4) that have a similar effect to adding the
application to the Accounts panel Startup
Items listing. You are best off using the Prefer-
ences panel to add these to your Startup Items
list (because, in this particular case, the item
being added is the VirexLogin utility, not Virex
itself).
• Figure 21-4: Virus utilities can be set to automatically scan
at startup.
Launching with the Finder
Even though you can launch applications in the
Finder, knowing all your options can go a long way
toward speeding up this very common task.
The fastest way to open an application is to
never shut it down. Because of the way Mac
OS X handles memory, you’ll notice very little
performance loss by keeping applications
open, and you’ll never have to wait for the
application to launch again. This applies both
to individual applications as well as the operat-
ing system as a whole.
The most common (but not necessarily the most
convenient) way of opening an application is to use
Finder windows. You can either navigate your way to
the Applications directory or set up your preferences

Technique 21: Launching Applications Fast
178
• Figure 21-6: Add icons for critical applications to your
Finder window’s toolbar.
You can also launch an application by opening
a file that uses that application as its default.
Furthermore, dragging the file onto the appli-
cation’s icon or using the contextual menu’s
Open With prompt achieves the same result.
Techniques for opening files are discussed in
great detail in Technique 23.
Here’s a common sequence for easily opening an
application by using only the keyboard:
1.
Navigate to the Finder by pressing Ô+Tab.
2.
Press Ô+Shift+A to bring up the Applications
directory.
3.
Type the first few letters of the application’s
name to highlight it.
4.
If necessary, press Tab to go to the next appli-
cation (if it wasn’t highlighted in Step 3).
5.
If you need to open the application’s folder,
press Ô+O (in icon view mode) or Ô+→ (in list
and column view modes).
6.
After you select the application, press Ô+O to
open it.
Launching with the Dock
Although Technique 11 covers the Dock in great
detail, it’s worth repeating some of the content here.
The Dock can serve many purposes (such as linking
files and folders or displaying the Trash), but the left
side of the Dock is strictly for your applications. This
area is where open applications reside (flagged by
an upward-pointing triangle, as shown in Figure
21-7), as well as any other application that can be
permanently linked there.
so that the Applications folder is automatically listed
in the Finder window’s left-side section (Figure 21-5).
Refer to Technique 10 for instructions on customiz-
ing the Finder windows and Sidebars. 
• Figure 21-5: Among the locations that can be linked
in the Finder window Sidebar is the
Applications directory.
After you’ve found your way to the application and
selected its icon, you can launch the application in
many ways. Here are your options, listed from easi-
est to most time-consuming:

Double-click the icon.

Press Ô+O.

Press Ô+↓.

Control+click the application and choose Open
from the contextual menu.

Choose Open from the Finder’s File menu.
If you add an application’s icon to the Finder
window’s toolbar (such as BBEdit and Safari in
Figure 21-6), you can launch the application
by clicking the icon, which will now appear in
every Finder window by default. You can place
applications in the toolbar by dragging their
icons from the Finder onto it (see Technique 10).

Launching with the Dock
179
• Figure 21-7: The Dock indicates open applications with a
black triangle.
You can dock an application in many ways,
each of which is covered in just a couple of
pages. Skip ahead to that section if you can’t
remember the methods.
Here are two things to consider with respect to
applications and your Dock:

What applications to dock there

How best to arrange the docked items
As a general rule, dock every application that you
use on a frequent basis. Considering all the ways you
have to access applications, making sure the right
applications are docked is less critical for most
users. What’s more important is the organization
scheme you choose. Larry prefers to organize his
Dock this way, as shown in Figure 21-8:
• Figure 21-8: Larry’s Dock (in case you’re curious).

Keep perpetually running, but infrequently
accessed, utilities on the far left.

Keep applications with similar uses grouped
together (like Web development tools or multi-
media software).

Place the applications that you use most often as
close to the middle of the Dock as possible.
Items in the center of the Dock seem to have
a more stable location. When the Dock
expands and contracts, these items move
around less on your screen.
Marc, for a different opinion, has the following sug-
gestions (see Figure 21-9):
• Figure 21-9: Marc’s Dock.

Dock a select few items that are always running,
such as System Preferences, CPU Monitor, and
LaunchBar.

Next dock the essential iApps from Apple: Safari,
iCal (whose Dock icon also reminds you of
today’s date when the application is open),
Mail, and Address Book.

Next add the productivity applications, depend-
ing on what kind of work you do with your
Macintosh. Because Marc is a software engineer,
the productivity applications that he uses most
often are the Terminal, BBEdit, Xcode, and so
forth. If you’re a graphic designer, you’d proba-
bly have things like Photoshop, Illustrator, or
InDesign here instead. If you’re working with the
bread-and-butter applications, it’s the place for
Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and so on.

Finally, place entertainment applications like
iPhoto, iTunes, iChat, and so on.
Marc’s main goal is to have stable positions for the
items that he needs to reach most often. After a
while, you get a feeling for where in the Dock a par-
ticular application is located, and you’ll be able to
find it instinctively with the mouse, just like menu
items in the menu bar.
Here’s what you need to know about working with
the Dock:

To dock an item, drag its icon to the Dock from
the Finder.
When you do so, the other Dock items make way
for their new roommate.

To remove any Dock item — particularly all
those that Apple installs there by default — drag
its icon off the Dock (while it’s not running).

Technique 21: Launching Applications Fast
180
• Figure 21-10: The Favorites folder functions as a
hierarchical menu in the Dock.
Recent Items
Finally, after you’ve recently closed an application,
you can always reopen it from the Recent Items sub-
menu under the Apple menu (see Figure 21-11). To
adjust how many items are listed here, use the
Appearance panel under System Preferences.
Opening Applications in the Terminal
The more techie Mac user might like to know that you can
launch applications from the Terminal application. Although
this isn’t a practical way to open an application as a rule, if
you’re already in the Terminal, it’s a nice feature to use.
Here’s how:

You can add any currently running application to
the Dock by dragging its icon from one location
to another.

The Finder icon will always be on the far-left side
of the Dock. It cannot be moved nor removed.
The same applies to the Trash on the far right.

Running applications that are not always part of
your Dock will be added to the right side of the
Dock.
If you remove an icon from the Dock while the
application is running, the item will be removed
from its permanent location in the Dock even
though it will look like it’s still there (because
it’s running).
Other Ways to Launch
Applications
Although the Finder and the Dock are the most fre-
quently used way of launching applications, they
certainly aren’t your only options. Favorites, aliases,
and Recent Items are all timesavers for this task.
Favorites and aliases
Another way to launch your applications is to create
aliases of them and place those aliases in convenient
locations. This is the principle behind Favorites, a
concept deprecated in Panther but still worth using
(check out Technique 15 for coverage of Favorites
and aliases).
If you add a slew of applications (perhaps organized
by purpose) to your Favorites, you can then dock
your Favorites folder and quickly launch these apps
(see Figure 21-10).

Launching with Shareware Tools
181
1.
Open the Terminal.
2.
Type cd /Applications and press Return to move
to the Applications folder.
3.
If necessary, move to a subfolder by typing cd
subfoldername and pressing Return.
4.
Type open, followed by a space.
5.
Type the first couple of letters of the applica-
tion’s name.
6.
Press Tab to have the Terminal complete the
application’s name.
7.
Press Return to launch the application.
You can shorten this whole process by typing open
/Applications/Appname as one command. You can also
use the Tab completion technique at any point. These steps
will launch the application outside the Terminal, as if you
had opened it in the Finder.
Some applications can be opened without even navigating
to the Applications folder with this command: open -a
ApplicationName. You should be able to use this trick no
matter what directory you’re in.
BBEdit fans will appreciate the ability to open text files in it
from the command line, just as you might use vi, pico, or
emacs. To use this technique
1.
Open the preferences panel in BBEdit.
2.
Click Tools in the left-hand column.
3.
Click the Install “bbedit” Tool button.
4.
Open a new Terminal window.
5.
Type bbedit /path/to/filename and press Return.
This opens the file in question in the BBEdit application.
• Figure 21-11: Recently used applications are listed in the
Recent Items menu.
Launching with Shareware Tools
Many third-party applications are in existence explic-
itly for the purpose of launching applications. Our
favorite is LaunchBar — which we’ll demonstrate
momentarily — but here are some other options:

menuCommence (http://mysite.verizon.
net/vze35vrv/projects.htm, free) creates a
menu bar icon that lists every application on
your computer in alphabetical order.

Yadal (http://orane.org.free.fr, free) pro-
vides an organized menu of applications from
your Dock, much like using the Favorites folder
this way.

XBar (http://macosx.syr.edu/spottedsoftware/
XBar.html, free) is like a mini-Dock whose sole
purpose is to launch applications.

Technique 21: Launching Applications Fast
182
• Figure 21-12: LaunchBar presents a list of potential
candidates.
You can manually configure LaunchBar’s keyboard
shortcuts by editing the AbbreviationHabits.plist
document found within the ~/Library/Application
Support/LaunchBar folder. To indicate the associa-
tions between keys and actions, it uses records like
this:
<key>AB</key>
<dict>
<key>/Applications/Address
Book.app</key>
<integer>2</integer>
</dict>
In this example, AB launches the Address Book. By
editing these values, you can change the settings for
the next time LaunchBar is started. The values you’ll
want to alter are the keys, which map an abbrevia-
tion to an application (or e-mail address or book-
mark). The integer marks the priority given to an
application, in case the same abbreviation has been
associated with multiple items (the higher the inte-
ger, the bigger priority).
Viewing the AbbreviationHabits.plist file
is also a good way to remind yourself of what
abbreviations you’ve already used.

DragThing (www.dragthing.com, $29) also dupli-
cates the Dock but on a very advanced level.

F10 Launch Studio (http://chronosnet.com,
$29) is strictly an application launching utility
but automatically finds your applications and
has a beautiful interface.
Using LaunchBar
LaunchBar (www.obdev.at/products/launchbar, $20
for personal use, free for limited use) is a utility
designed to always run on your computer. The first
time it runs, it logs every application on your hard
drive (along with your files, Safari bookmarks,
Address Book contacts, and more). To launch an
application, you simply
1.
Press Ô+spacebar to bring up LaunchBar.
2.
Type the keyboard shortcut for the application
in question.
For example:
 M for Mail
 ME for Microsoft Excel
 S for Safari
 BB for BBEdit
 PH for Photoshop
3.
Select the application that you want to launch
from the list if it’s not already highlighted (see
Figure 21-12).
4.
Press Return to launch the application.

22
Switching, Hiding,
and Quitting
Applications
U
nderstanding how to launch applications (see Technique 21) is
useful — but still something you’ll probably only do once a day
per application. What most Mac users spend a lot of their time
doing is switching among open applications, hiding them, and (when the
time is right) quitting them.
In this Technique, we take you through the best, fastest, and easiest ways
to work with your open applications. We begin with switching: how to
effectively toggle from one application to another. After that, we quickly
address hiding open applications (which overlaps a bit with switching) and
quitting them.
Switching among Open Applications
Because pretty much every Mac user has a half-dozen or so applications
open at all times, being able to quickly switch from one to another is a
critical skill to master. Several different methods for application switch-
ing are built into the operating system, and you can also make use of
third-party tools to expand the possibilities.
Switching apps with Panther
Perhaps the best way to switch from one open application to another is
to use the Ô+Tab keyboard technique. We cover this in other techniques,
but it bears repeating:
1.
Press and hold down the Ô key.
2.
While continuing to hold down the Ô key, press the Tab key once to
bring up the list of open applications (as shown in Figure 22-1).
• Figure 22-1: Pressing Ô+Tab presents you with a list of open applications.

4.
Release the Ô key to make that application
active.
5.
Again, you can abort the application switching
by pressing the Escape key at any time while
still holding down the Ô key.
Use the cursor in conjunction with Ô+Tab to
quickly access another application. If you have
a dozen or so applications open, this could be
the fastest method to use.
The other preferred method for switching among
open applications is to use Exposé. This tool — new
to Panther — is covered in detail in Technique 13,
but here’s what you really need to know:

Exposé shows all the windows (either docu-
ments or Finder windows) for every open and
unhidden application with just one keystroke
combination or hot corner. (The keystroke or hot
corner varies, depending on how you’ve set your
preferences.)

Exposé shows all the windows for the currently
active application with a different keystroke and
hot corner.

A third key combination or hot corner takes you
to the Finder.
Although Exposé focuses on windows and docu-
ments, it can easily be used to switch from one
application to another. Just do this:
1.
Trigger Exposé by using the key combination
or hot corner to bring up every non-hidden
document or window (see Figure 22-3).
2.
Move the cursor over each document image to
view its name (see Figure 22-4).
3.
After you’ve selected the document in the
application that you want to switch to, click the
document with your mouse button or press the
spacebar.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, press Tab
to sequentially highlight each open application
(see Figure 22-2).
In Figure 22-2, the Finder is highlighted.
• Figure 22-2: The currently highlighted icon is surrounded
by a white border and displays its name
beneath it. 
Using the Ô+Tab technique cycles through
the open applications in the order of most
recent usage. The application that you were
using prior to the current, active one will be
highlighted first . . . then the one before that
and so forth. If you just want to switch back
and forth between two applications, quickly
press and release Ô+Tab once.
4.
To go back one application, press Shift+Tab
(while continuing to hold down the Ô key).
5.
After you’ve highlighted the application that
you want to switch to, release the Ô key to
make it active.
6.
To abort the application switching, press the
Escape key at any time while still holding down
the Ô key.
The Finder also has a nice variation on the Ô+Tab
trick that uses the mouse.
1.
Press and hold the Ô key.
2.
While continuing to hold down the Ô key,
press the Tab key once to bring up the list of
open applications.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, move your
cursor over the application that you want to
switch to (it will be highlighted).

Hiding Applications

• Figure 22-4: When you hover the mouse over a
document, its name becomes visible.
By using the mouse, two other easy ways to switch
from the current application to another are available:

Click the second application’s icon in the Dock.

Click a visible window (for example, a document)
in the second application.
Switching apps with shareware
If you want validation that switching among open
applications is a critical concept, just look at the
number and variety of third-party applications
designed for this very purpose. A quick search on
VersionTracker will return many utilities, like
LiteSwitch X (www.proteron.com/liteswitchx/, $15).
This next group of applications aren’t necessarily
switchers: In fact, they’re actually advanced launch-
ing tools that allow you to assign keys to open par-
ticular applications. Because of this, though, they
can also be used to switch to another application:

LaunchBar (www.obdev.at/products/
launchbar, $20 for personal use, free for
limited use)

DragThing (www.dragthing.com, $29)

Keyboard Maestro (www.keyboardmaestro.com;
free for the Lite version, $20 for the full)

QuicKeys (www.cesoft.com, $100)
These programs and others are discussed in
more detail in Technique 21, particularly
LaunchBar.
Hiding Applications
Being able to hide an application is a more impor-
tant concept than you might initially think. Hiding or
minimizing an application that you’re temporarily
not using makes for a less cluttered Mac, which, in
turn, makes for a more productive user.
Hidden applications appear in the Ô+Tab
application listing but not in Exposé.
Here are several ways to hide active applications:

While the application is active, press Ô+H.

While the application is active, choose Hide
ApplicationName from the application’s menu
(see Figure 22-5).

Technique 22: Switching, Hiding, and Quitting Applications
186
• Figure 22-6: You can hide applications that aren’t even
active just by using the Dock.
If you’re switching to another application, you
can hide the application that you’re currently
in by holding down the Option key while
clicking the second application’s Dock icon or
document window. If you hold down both the
Ô and Option keys while clicking, every other
application will be hidden.

Press and hold down the Ô+Option keys while
clicking the Desktop or the Finder icon in the
Dock to go to the Finder and hide every other
application.
You can also hide an application using the Ô+Tab
switching technique:
1.
Hold down the Ô key and press Tab once to
activate the switcher.
2.
While still holding down the Ô key, press Tab
(or press Shift+Tab) until the target application
is highlighted.
Alternatively, you can highlight the target appli-
cation by putting the cursor over the icon.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, press H.
4.
Release the Ô and H keys simultaneously.
• Figure 22-5: Every application should have a Hide option.

While in any application, click and hold on
another application’s Dock icon (see the Mail
icon in Figure 22-6). Then choose Hide from the
contextual menu that appears.

While in any application, press Ô+Option+H to
hide every other application. You can also hide
every other application using the Hide Others
option in the application menu (refer to Figure
22-5). Hiding every application but the currently
active one really cleans up your screen and is
very helpful when your active application has a
lot going on (like many windows, palettes, and
documents).

Logging Out and Shutting Down
187
Quitting Applications
You might be thinking to yourself: Why do I need to
read about quitting applications? I know how to do
that. Although you probably know at least one way to
quit your applications, you might not know the easiest
or best way. Here’s a quick rundown of your options:

While the application is active, press Ô+Q.

While the application is active, choose Quit from
the application’s menu.

While in any application, click and hold the appli-
cation’s Dock icon (see Figure 22-7). Choose Quit
from the contextual menu that appears.
• Figure 22-7: Every application provides a Quit option in
the Dock’s contextual menu.
You can also quit an application using the Ô+Tab
switching technique:
1.
Hold down the Ô key and press Tab once to
activate the switcher.
2.
While still holding down the Ô key, press Tab
(or press Shift+Tab) until the target application
is highlighted.
Alternatively, you can highlight the target appli-
cation by putting the cursor over the icon.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, press Q.
4.
Release the Ô and Q keys simultaneously.
Force Quitting
If an application is stuck, quitting it the usual way simply
won’t work. Instead, you’ll need to use Force Quit. You can
force-quit an application in either of two ways:

Press Ô+Option+Escape to bring up the Force Quit
menu. 

Alternatively, hold Option+Control and then click the
Dock icon. Or, click and hold the Dock icon and then
press the Option key. Both of these methods bring up
the contextual menu, from which you can choose
Force Quit.
Fortunately, applications rarely freeze up, so you shouldn’t
need to use these techniques very often.
Logging Out and Shutting Down
The most drastic way to quit every application is to
log out, restart, or shut down your computer. If you
choose one of these options, Panther automatically
closes every open application, assuming you do not
have unsaved documents still open.

Pressing Ô+Shift+Q logs you out but asks you for
confirmation (see Figure 22-8).

Pressing Ô+Option+Shift+Q logs you out without
asking for confirmation.
If you log out with Fast User Switching, all
your applications remain open.
• Figure 22-8: The confirmation prompt can be avoided
by holding down the Option key when
logging out.

Opening Files
Faster
T
he Macintosh operating system allows for many ways to open your
files efficiently, and this number increases tenfold if you add third-
party tools such as LaunchBar to the mix. In this Technique, you
see a number of ways to achieve the same end result. Like most timesav-
ing techniques, many options are available; it’s really up to you to deter-
mine which works most efficiently for your computing habits.
Opening Files with the Finder
As you probably already know, you can open any file by double-clicking
it, in which case it automatically opens by using the default application
for that particular file type. If you’d rather open the file without your
hands leaving the keyboard, press Ô+O instead.
The slow way to open a file is to select it, go to the File menu, and
then select Open. If this is the method that you use, there’s room for
improvement, and you should definitely keep reading!
If you use an input device with programmable buttons (for example,
a trackball or a multibuttoned mouse), program one of the buttons
to behave as a double-click. Doing so saves a step (literally a click)
whenever you need to open a file. Check the software or manual that
came with your input device to see whether it’s programmed — and
if so, how.

Opening Files with Specific Applications
189
Entering a File?
Here’s one place where we think Windows users have an
advantage. To open a file in Windows, a user simply selects
the file and then presses Enter (the Mac Return key equiva-
lent for PC users). When Mac users press Return, they can
rename the file. This makes little sense because frankly, files
are opened much more often than renamed. But we’d be
surprised to see Apple make this change — and the con-
cessions to Microsoft — at this late date.
Opening Files with Specific
Applications
Double-clicking a file in the Finder works just fine for
opening files the majority of the times, particularly
when the file is set to open in the application of your
choosing. Frequently, however, the default applica-
tion is not the one that you want to use in a specific
instance. For example, you might normally open
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) files in Safari,
but maybe you want to edit a particular HTML file in
BBEdit. Likewise, images open in Preview by default,
but maybe you want to use Adobe Photoshop to
tweak a particular image. Here are some steps to
automatically open files with a specific application.
At the end of this Technique, we reveal how to set
the default application for a file or a file type. This is
helpful if you find yourself frequently needing to
change the application used to open a type of file.
Using the Window navigational bar
to open files
In Technique 10, we demonstrate the how’s and
why’s of tweaking the default window setup. One
recommended addition is to put the most commonly
used applications there (see Figure 23-1). When you
do, opening a file with that application is a simple
case of dragging and dropping the file onto the icon.
• Figure 23-1: By placing an application in the window’s
navigational area, you can quickly open a
file by dragging it onto the icon.
The applications that you store in the naviga-
tional area should be selected judiciously. They
should not be applications that are always
running or remain in the Dock because you
already have access to those. As a concrete
suggestion, we recommend leaving Preview in
the Dock but placing Photoshop in the naviga-
tional area.
A neat trick that results from Panther’s new
window structure is that the folders in the
Sidebar spring open if files are held over
them. Therefore, you can drag a file onto the
Applications icon, which in turn opens the
Applications directory. Then you can drop the
file directly onto the appropriate application.
Using the Dock to open files
Another easy method of opening a file with a partic-
ular application is simply to drag the file onto the
application’s icon in the Dock. However, for this
method to work, the application must either perma-
nently reside in the Dock or currently be open.
In Technique 11, we provide guidelines for
organizing an efficient Dock. 
Out of kindness (or maybe insolence), the
Dock tries to make room for the files that you
drag there, moving your application’s icon out
of the way in the process. To prevent this
behavior, hold down Ô while dragging your
files, and the Dock with remain motionless.

Technique 23: Opening Files Faster
190
• Figure 23-2: A contextual menu provides quick access to
a wealth of common tasks.
• Figure 23-3: The Open With submenu lists logical choices
for handling a file.
Using Favorites to open files
If you’ve already read Technique 15, you’ve probably
already set up your Favorites folder to contain your
most frequently used applications (and possibly files
and folders, too). If you place a link to your Favorites
in the window’s navigational area, you can pop that
open and find your favorite application, just like we
suggest you can by using the Applications folder.
The spring-loaded folder technique works with
folders in the Sidebar but not with those in the
Dock. So although you might keep the
Favorites folder docked, trying to drag a file
onto it doesn’t work. 
If you haven’t yet customized your Favorites
folder, run — don’t walk — to Technique 15 to
do so now.
Opening files with a contextual menu
This method of opening a file in a specific applica-
tion is perhaps the best. Control+click a file’s icon,
and you’ll be prompted by a contextual menu that
offers a list of common possible things that you
might want to do with said file, such as get info
about it and archive the file (see Figure 23-2).
One of these menu items, Open With, gives you imme-
diate access to other applications with which you
might want to open the file. The resulting submenu
(see Figure 23-3) lists the current default application
at the top along with the other potential candidates.
If the application that you’re looking for isn’t listed,
select Other (at the bottom) and navigate your way
to it.
If you have a programmable input device, we
recommend programming one of the buttons
as a Control+click, allowing you to access a
contextual menu with just the one hand.

Opening Files within an Application
191
Using LaunchBar
LaunchBar (www.obdev.at) is far and away one of our
favorite third-party applications for the Macintosh.
Its ease of use, impressive speed, and very reason-
able cost ($20 for personal use; free for limited use)
make it a must-have in our minds, particularly for
users looking to shave seconds off common tasks. In
Technique 21, we introduce LaunchBar for the pur-
poses of accessing applications; but by following
these steps, it can be similarly used to quickly open
files in the appropriate application:
1.
Press Ô+spacebar to activate LaunchBar.
2.
Enter the shortcut for the application that you
want to open a file with.
In this example, the letter B represents BBEdit
(see Figure 23-4).
• Figure 23-4: The first two steps in using LaunchBar bring
the required application to the launch pad.
3.
From the Finder, drag the desired file onto the
launch pad.
4.
From the drop-down menu, select Open with
<Application> (in this case Open with BBEdit;
see Figure 23-5).
• Figure 23-5: LaunchBar offers three choices of actions
after you drop a file onto it.
Set LaunchBar to automatically open a file
dropped onto it instead of presenting a list of
options.
Opening Files within
an Application
If you have an application open, you can expedite
opening files from within it. For starters, every appli-
cation uses the Ô+O shortcut to bring up the Open
dialog (see Figure 23-6).
• Figure 23-6: Microsoft Word default Open dialog.
The standard navigational keyboard shortcuts (such
as Ô+D for the Desktop) work within the Open dia-
log. Further, you can click the folders and files in the
navigational toolbar on the left for immediate access
to commonly used directories.
If using list view is more natural to you than
column view, click the list view icon in the dia-
log. Unlike Finder windows, Open dialogs
don’t offer an icon view option.

Technique 23: Opening Files Faster
192
• Figure 23-7: The Apple menu can track recently used
applications and files.
If your Recent Items menu is getting too clut-
tered (or you don’t want others to see what
you’ve been up to), select Clear Menu at the
bottom of the Recent Items submenu.
Recalling files from application menus
It might be a chicken-or-the-egg type of debate, but
either the Apple menu inspired similar behavior in
many applications or vice versa. Regardless, most of
Panther’s commonly used applications include their
own Recent Items menu. Examples include BBEdit,
Acrobat Reader, and Photoshop. As a rule, you find
the recent items listed under the File menu. Some
applications, like the Microsoft Office products,
retain this information at the bottom of the File
menu instead.
A few shareware applications allow you to set
the default folder for applications to use (such
as Default Folder X; www.stclairsoft.com/
DefaultFolderX/index.html, $35). Using
one of these saves you from navigating to the
appropriate folder when opening or saving a
file.
Many OS X applications include their own tools for
finding files more quickly. In Microsoft Word, you
can click the Find File button at the bottom of the
Open dialog (refer to Figure 23-6) to bring up a search
mechanism. BBEdit provides an Open File by Name
option (under File) that locates files for you.
Recalling Recent Items
After you access a file, it becomes much, much eas-
ier to bring it up again because Panther has (or can
have) a memory of your actions in the Recent Items
menu, found in the Finder and in many applications.
Recalling files from the Apple menu
The Apple menu has gone through many changes
over the years, and since OS X, has been more or
less off-limits to customization by the user. However,
one tweak-able feature that remains is the Recent
Items submenu (see Figure 23-7).
The number of items listed here can be set from the
Appearance System Preferences panel (see Figure
23-8). You can have your Mac show anywhere from
0–50 recent documents and 0–50 recent applications.
Notice that the Apple menu keeps each separate and
also lists them alphabetically (not by date or time).
If you don’t use many applications and have
your Dock, window navigational area, and
Favorites well organized, you probably won’t
have the need to recall recently used applica-
tions. If that’s the case for you, set this value
to 0 in the Appearance System Preferences
panel and save the valuable Recent Items real
estate solely for files.

Setting the Default Application for Files
193
• Figure 23-8: Set how many recent files and applications
(if any) are remembered from the
Appearance panel.
Setting the Default Application
for Files
In case you haven’t figured out by now, the default
application to be used when opening a file is indi-
cated by the file’s icon in the Finder. Each applica-
tion has its own, unique look for corresponding files.
As you can see at the beginning of this Technique,
double-clicking (or using the keyboard equivalent,
Ô+O) automatically opens the file in the assigned
application. But what if you want to change the
default application? In Panther, you can manage file
types using the ubiquitous Get Info panel, following
these steps:
1.
Select the file in the Finder.
2.
Click the file and press Ô+I (or choose File➪
Get Info) to bring up the Get Info panel (see
Figure 23-9).
• Figure 23-9: The Finder’s Get Info panel details — 
and allows you to administer — a file’s
properties.
Reach the Get Info panel by Control+clicking
the file and selecting Get Info from the con-
textual menu that appears.
3.
Click the arrow next to Open With to expand
that subpanel, if it’s not already visible.
4.
Select the default application to use from the
pull-down menu.
If the application is not already listed, select
Other at the bottom and navigate to the appro-
priate application.
5.
If desired, click the Change All button to set
this application to always open files of this par-
ticular type.

Technique 23: Opening Files Faster
194
If you have only a file or two that should
always be opened with a specific application
(for example, a really large PDF that you want
opened with Acrobat Reader instead of
Preview), don’t click Change All in the Get Info
panel.
A few applications — Adobe Acrobat Reader
and Microsoft Internet Explorer, just to name
two — can automatically associate certain file
types with themselves, if desired. Peruse
through the application’s Preferences for the
appropriate setting.

Saving and
Printing Files
T
his part of the book is all about your applications — not what
they specifically do, but those common elements that you’ll run
across in every application. This includes saving and printing your
documents.
Although you probably know what you’re doing when it comes to these
issues, in this Technique, you might find a better way to do those com-
mon tasks. We begin by discussing how to navigate and use Save dialogs
quickly. Then we go into printing your documents. Finally, we cover how
to turn any document into a PDF file, which is a widely accepted file for-
mat for sharing documents on Macs and PCs alike.
Saving Files
Regardless of what application you’re using, when you go to save an unti-
tled document, you’ll be presented with a Save dialog. (See one in Figure
24-1.) The Save dialog appears as a sheet, meaning that it drops down
from the top of the document window.

196
• Figure 24-3: Some applications allow you to specify a file
format other than the default.
Another nice feature of the Save dialog is that you can
use it in either list (as shown in Figure 24-4) or col-
umn mode. In fact, the Finder keyboard shortcuts —
Ô+2 for list view or Ô+3 for column view — work in
your Save dialogs!
Save your documents in the most logical
place. (See Technique 14 for organizing your
Home directory.) If you’re looking for a quick,
temporary storage location, use the Desktop.
Here are some tips for getting the most out of your
saves:

Use the Sidebar navigation area to quickly access
your favorite common areas.

Press Ô+D to go to the Desktop.
The keyboard shortcut for save is Ô+S. Some
applications have a shortcut of Ô+Shfit+S for
Save As.
Panther uses a different Save dialog format than pre-
vious versions of OS X, which is very similar to the
new Finder window format. The top section is for
the document’s name, and the down-arrow button
enables you to display or hide (see Figure 24-2) your
other options.
• Figure 24-2: Save dialogs can be this minimal, or you can
click the down arrow to see more options.
Some applications, like Microsoft Word (refer to
Figures 24-1 and 24-2), provide an Options button
linking to that application’s Save preferences panel
and a drop-down menu that allows you to save the
document in another file format (see Figure 24-3).
What is available in an application’s Save prefer-
ences panel (if it has one) can vary but normally it
will let you select a default file format and how often
to perform automatic backups.
The left side of the fully expanded Save dialog dis-
plays volumes at the top and your favorite places at
the bottom. This is the same setup that you’ll find in
your Finder windows.
Because the Save dialog uses the same format
as your Finder windows, customizations made
to the Finder windows are reflected in your
Save dialogs. (See Technique 10 for customiza-
tion tips.) Placing some of your favorite direc-
tories in the Finder’s Sidebar will improve your
ease of using both Finder windows and Open
or Save dialogs.

The  Default Folder X shareware program
(www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/
index.html, $35) brings many useful features
to the Save dialogs. For example, with it you
can save documents to open Finder windows
or delete and rename existing folders and files
without exiting your application.

Press Ô+Shift+H to go to your Home directory.

Use the Tab key to move forward from one area
of the Save dialog to another.

Press Shift+Tab to move backward from one area
to another.
The Tab and Shift+Tab keyboard shortcuts
move you from the document title window to
the Sidebar to the main window area. The cur-
rently active area is indicated by a colored box.

The pull-down menu at the top lists the hierar-
chy for the current folder.

The pull-down menu at the top also lists the most
recently used folders (check it out in Figure 24-5).
• Figure 24-5: Use the pull-down menu to access parent or
recently used folders.



Most of the keyboard shortcuts that function in a
Finder window also work inside Save dialogs,
including
 Ô+[ (opening brace) to move back (in list
view)
 Ô+↑to move up one folder (in list view)
 Ô+↓to move into a selected folder (in list
view)
 Ô+←to move back one folder (in column
view)
 Ô+→to move into a selected folder (in col-
umn view)

The Save As dialogs work exactly the same as the
Save dialogs.
Save your work frequently! Although your
Mac will rarely crash, there’s no need to risk
it. Also get in the habit of saving your work
before switching applications, printing, leaving
your computer, and so forth.

Technique 24: Saving and Printing Files
198
Proxy Window Icons
The proxy icon is a great thing, and not just in Finder win-
dows. Because the window title bar can be used both for
moving the window as well as for initiating a drag of the
proxy icon, Apple had to find a way to distinguish between
the two actions. Because window title bar proxy icons were
added quite late in the development cycle, and every Mac
user was used to moving windows by grabbing and mov-
ing them quickly, Apple added the requirement that the
user has to hold the mouse still for about half a second after
clicking the mouse button over the icon. This indicates to
the system that the user wants to drag the proxy icon and
not move the window.
The great thing is that the proxy icon functionality of allow-
ing you to move the folder works in almost every applica-
tion. Each document has a proxy icon next to the docu-
ment’s name at the top of the window. This icon can also
be dragged to move the file to a new location, attach it to
an e-mail, and more!
Overwriting existing files
As you might notice, existing files in Save and Save
As dialogs appear in gray, indicating that you cannot
use that filename without overwriting another docu-
ment. In the past, to force a used name upon the
document that you were saving, you had to type it
manually. Now, selecting a grayed-out file automati-
cally enters that filename as the saved document’s
name.
Be careful when you use an existing filename
in Save dialogs. Doing so wipes out the previ-
ous document, with no recourse for recovery.
Printing
After you’ve got your printer set up, you can use
some timesaving techniques regardless of the

If you don’t like trying to navigate all over your com-
puter system to save a file or if you’re frequently
saving multiple files to the same area (like if you are,
um, writing a book), here’s a cool trick:
1.
Bring up the Save or Save As dialog for the
application that you’re working in.
2.
Go to the Finder.
3.
Open the folder where you want to store the
document in a Finder window.
This trick makes the most sense (time-wise) if
you already have the destination folder open
in a Finder window.
4.
Click and hold the folder proxy icon in the
Finder window (see the sidebar “Proxy
Window Icons”).
The proxy icon is the representation of that
folder at the top of the Finder window, next to
the folder’s name.
5.
Drag the folder icon onto the Save dialog.
The dialog now shows that folder as the destina-
tion for the file being saved.
If you like this technique, you can really speed it up
by using a drag and drop in conjunction with Exposé
(see Technique 13) or the Finder’s Ô+Tab trick (see
Technique 9) to quickly go back and forth between
the Finder and the primary application.
You can drag folders and files from the Finder.
The Save dialog moves to the new location,
and the name of the file that you dragged is
entered into the filename text field, saving you
some typing if you want to overwrite an exist-
ing file.

Printing
199
The following examples use Larry’s printer, but
the thrust of these tips should still apply to
whatever printer you’re using.
Customizing print settings
Many print drivers come with the ability to create
and save your print settings. This is very useful if
you frequently need to print documents in certain
ways. For example, you might adjust

The number of copies to print

What pages to print

The quality of the printing

Whether to use two-sided printing (if possible)
Larry has a few different settings created already.
One is for printing a lower-quality draft of something
double-sided. This is great for spitting out large doc-
uments that don’t require the best quality. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, Larry uses a setting
for printing photos in color and on glossy paper.
For most printers, arranging this is a matter of fol-
lowing these steps:
1.
Select Print in any application.
The keyboard equivalent of Print is Ô+P.
2.
In the Print dialog that appears, adjust all the
settings as desired. (See your choices in Fig-
ure 24-6.)
3.
Select Save As from the Presets menu.
4.
In the Save Preset dialog that appears, choose a
distinctive and descriptive name for these set-
tings, like One Page Draft (see Figure 24-7) or
Color Photo.
• Figure 24-6: Go through your printer’s options and adjust
each accordingly.
• Figure 24-7: Give your printer settings a descriptive
name.
The next time you want to print something with
these preset settings, you can select them in the
Print dialog from the Presets drop-down menu.
Previewing your documents
Using the Preview option turns a document into a
PDF (Portable Document Format) and sends it to
the Preview application. From there, you can scroll
through the multiple pages, print it, save the file as

Technique 24: Saving and Printing Files

5.
In the Save dialog that appears, give your
printer a descriptive name and save it to your
Desktop.
6.
If you want, move the printer alias from the
Desktop to your Dock so it’s more readily avail-
able.
After you create a desktop printer (even if you Dock
it), just drag any document from the Finder onto the
Desktop Printer icon to print it.
Creating PDFs
One of the coolest features of OS X is that it uses the
Portable Document Format as a standard technology.
The benefits of this are

Easy viewing of PDFs via Preview, which is 
the OS X default media viewing application

Easy creation of PDFs without the need for
expensive software
With little fanfare, a cool feature called PDF Workflow
was added to the Mac OS X operating system. With
PDF Workflow, you can broaden your PDF options.
Instead of saving a document as a PDF, you could

Save it in a specific folder without prompting

Attach the PDF to an e-mail

Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Reader
After you turn on PDF Workflow, the Save as PDF but-
ton will turn into a drop-down menu of options (see
Figure 24-8). To enable PDF Workflow, follow these
steps:
1.
Open up your Home directory in a Finder
window.
2.
Navigate to the Library folder.
a PDF, or convert it to another format. This function-
ality works in any OS X application that can print. To
learn more, see “Creating PDFs” later in this chapter.
Using the operating system’s Preview tool is
often a better choice than the default preview
feature built into an application (if it even has
one).
Desktop printing
In short, desktop printing is the ability to print docu-
ments (or start the print process) using the Finder
instead of an application. It works by creating an
alias to your printer. When you drag a file onto this
alias, Panther will

Print the file if its format is readable by Preview
(images and PDFs)

Launch the file’s default application and then
print the file if its format isn’t readable by
Preview (Microsoft Office documents, as an
example)
Using desktop printing can save you a lot of time if
you frequently need to print documents that you
might not be currently viewing or editing — in other
words, if you print documents separately from work-
ing with them.
To create a desktop printer, follow these steps:
1.
Launch the Printer Setup Utility, found in the
Applications➪Utilities folder.
2.
Add your printer to the list of available print-
ers, if it’s not already listed.
Click the Add button and follow the prompts to
add a printer already connected to your Mac. See
Technique 39 for adding a networked printer.
3.
Select your printer by clicking on its name in
the list of available printers.
4.
Choose Create Desktop Printer from the
Printers menu.

Creating PDFs
201
3.
Create a new folder called PDF Services.
The PDF Services directory is Panther’s link to
PDF Workflow functionality. It will be used to add
all the different features you want to the PDF
Workflow menu.
PDFU, from If Then Software (www.ifthensoft.
com, free), automates the PDF Services direc-
tory creation and adds several useful starter
services for you.
• Figure 24-8: The Save As PDF button can work as a pull-
down menu instead.
After you’ve created this folder, here’s what you can
do with it:

Add aliases to other folders there, giving you a
very quick way to save a PDF file to that folder.

Add aliases to applications there.
For example, if you drop an alias to the Mail
application into the PDF Services directory,
selecting Mail from the pop-up menu creates a
PDF that is then immediately attached to a new,
blank message in Mail. You simply have to add a
recipient and subject to the message, and then
you can fire off the PDF.

Advanced users can add both AppleScripts and
UNIX scripts to the folder, which can be run —
using the created PDF — when selected.
For example, you could create an AppleScript
that moves the PDF onto a network server or
performs some type of post-processing.

Cut, Copy, Paste
Y
ou might be thinking to yourself, “Why is a whole Technique
devoted to cutting, copying, and pasting? I already know how to
do that just fine.” True, but the topic is so important that you
really ought to make sure you know every possible option and method
available.
In this Technique, we give you everything that you absolutely must know
about editing a document: cutting, copying, and pasting (with a little
selecting thrown in). This begins with the basic and not-so-basic short-
cuts. After that, we discuss the Clipboard itself: what it is, how it works,
and how this affects you. At the same time, we introduce a couple of new
tools that expand on the functionality of the Clipboard. Finally, we show
you a few other related tricks and get into Panther’s Find Clipboard.
Copying and Pasting with the Keyboard
and Mouse
Editing is so common in everything that you do on computers these days
that if you haven’t already learned or mastered the editing shortcuts,
you’re selling yourself short. The options in the Edit menu are fairly com-
mon whether you’re talking about the Finder (see Figure 25-1) or BBEdit
(see Figure 25-2).

siderations are

Delete

Paste

Undo

Redo
Many of the editing tools rely upon the Clipboard,
which is a place for temporary storage on your
computer. A single selection can be stored in the
Clipboard. (To be clear: The Clipboard can store mul-
tiple files or lots of text, but only if they are selected
at the same time.) Also, the Clipboard’s contents are
erased when you restart, shut down, or log out (if
you don’t use Fast User Switching).
Both Copy and Cut place a copy of the selected item
on the Clipboard, but the latter also removes the
selected item from its original location. (Think of Cut
like a Copy followed by a Delete.) Delete removes
the selected item (although not files and such in the
Finder, which must be deleted by using the Option
and Delete keys together), whereas Paste puts the
Clipboard’s contents in the current location. Undo,
well, undoes the last action, and Redo redoes the
last thing that you undid.
If you cut something (for example, text in a
document), you can always put it back by
using Paste. If you delete it, however, it might
be gone forever (depending upon the applica-
tion in use). Conversely, cutting something
takes up more memory because the cut item
must be stored, if only temporarily. Unless
you’ve selected something really large, this is
rarely an issue.
Everywhere you go in your Mac, you’ll find these
keyboard shortcuts:

Select All: Ô+A

Copy: Ô+C

Cut: Ô+X

Paste: Ô+V

Undo: Ô+Z

Hold down the Option key while you drag to
create a copy of the selection in a new location
(copy and paste).

Move the item to a new volume (in the Finder) or
document (in an application) to create a copy in
the new location.

Hold down the Ô key to move the item to a new
volume without copying it (in the Finder).

Hold down the Control key before you release
the mouse button to be given options when mov-
ing the selection from one document to another
within an application. After selecting some text,
say in a Word document, begin dragging it to
another location. After you arrive at your desti-
nation, press the Control key and release the
mouse button to see a menu of options (see
Figure 25-4).
• Figure 25-4: Contextual menus work within the Finder
and other applications while dragging stuff
around.
All these tricks work with text and other con-
tent in documents.
You can also select items (in the Finder or in an
application) by using these techniques:
You really, really, really must memorize these if you
haven’t already. These keyboard shortcuts are also
duplicated in Edit menus (as mentioned) and in con-
textual menus (as shown in Figure 25-3), if you prefer
sticking with the mouse.
• Figure 25-3: The Edit options are frequently available
within contextual menus.
Most, but not all, applications use the
Ô+Shift+Z shortcut for Redo. Others use
Ô+Y.
You can also use your mouse for some neat editing
tricks. After you select an item, click it and begin
dragging, and then

Drag the item anywhere else to perform a cut
and paste.

Drag the item to the Trash to delete it.

Press Ô+click to add an item to the current
selection (like another file in a Finder window).

You can also press Ô+click to deselect a selected
item (for example, to deselect one item from a
range of already selected items).
Understanding the Clipboard
The Clipboard has been a part of the Macintosh
operating system for a good long time and is a sim-
ple and essential tool. The Clipboard is an area of
memory that stores the most recently copied or cut
stuff. Here are some basic rules of how it works:

The Clipboard can only contain one selected
item at a time. The Clipboard has no history. It
can remember a group of files or a paragraph of
text or whatever, but it can only ever store one
level of copying or cutting.

The Clipboard’s contents are remembered
across the entire operating system and every
application. Even if you quit or open an applica-
tion, the Clipboard’s contents will remain.

The Clipboard’s contents are changed only
when you cut or copy something else. The
Clipboard is not emptied by any other option,
including pasting, deleting, and so forth.

The Clipboard’s contents are dropped when you
log out, shut down, or restart your computer.
You can always view the current contents
of the Clipboard by choosing Show Clipboard
from the Finder’s Edit menu.  See an example
in Figure 25-5.
• Figure 25-5: If you forget what’s on the Clipboard, view
its contents in the Finder.
The main limitation of the Clipboard is its single-
storage nature. In the next section, you find out
about a couple of tools that make up for this.
Copy and Paste Tips and Tricks
To wrap up this Technique, we want to discuss a few
editing tips and tricks that you ought to be familiar
with. This includes both shareware tools and general
techniques than any Panther user can try.
Clipboard shareware options
The Clipboard is nice, but limited. You don’t need
to be a power user to be hindered by its lack of his-
tory and single-use nature. For those of you wanting
just a little bit more, here are some more potent
alternatives.

CopyPaste-X (www.scriptsoftware.com/
copypaste, $20) provides you with a Clipboard
that can automatically store ten items and also
includes a Clipboard Editor to alter the stored
contents.

XShelf (http://homepage.mac.com/khsu/
XShelf/XShelf.html, free) is more like Mac OS
9’s Scrapbook but can be used in lieu of the
Clipboard. Instead of using Cut, Copy, and Paste,
you drop selected items onto the application
(shelve them for later). When it’s time to use the
stored text, image, or what-have-you, drag it off
of the shelf and into it’s new location.

Technique 25: Cut, Copy, Paste
206
Often, people copy a word from a document and
then open up the Find panel and paste the word
there. This replaces any other text in the Clipboard,
which might still be needed. With the Find Clipboard,
you can do the same thing much quicker and with-
out ever opening up the Find panel. Here’s how:
1.
In an application like Safari, Mail, or TextEdit,
select some text.
2.
Press Ô+E.
Ô+E is the keyboard shortcut for Use Selection
for Find.
3.
Open the Find panel for that or any other
application.
If the current application supports this feature,
this text will automatically be in the Find dialog,
and you can simply press Return to begin the
search.
4.
Or, instead of using the Find prompt at all,
use Ô+G to search for the selected text
automatically.
Strange as it might seem, with the Find Clipboard
and the Ô+E shortcut, you can actually use Find
Again to find text even if you haven’t run the
search previously. This is another timesaving
benefit of the Find Clipboard!
Ô+G is the keyboard shortcut for Find Again.
As you’ll see, having two separate Clipboards speeds
up the workflow considerably. The Clipboard text
being accessible system-wide means that you can
search for a string in one application and then
switch to another one and continue the search
there. For example, you can select some text in a
Mail message, press Ô+E, and then switch to Safari.
Press Ô+G to search the current Safari window for
the exact same text without ever opening a Find
panel.

iPasteboard (http://ipasteboard.
brunoblondeau.com, $15), like CopyPaste-X,
is closer to the old Scrapbook utility from OS 9
and earlier. It provides multiple Clipboards
whose contents are retained even after restarts.

ClipboardSharing (www.lagercrantz.ath.cx/
software/clipboardsharing, free) lets you
share a Clipboard’s contents from one Macintosh
to another over a network.
Copying items within the Finder
You can use Copy and Paste to copy an item in the
Finder to another location without cluttering up the
Desktop with windows. Here’s the skinny:
1.
Open a new Finder window.
2.
Select the item or items that you want to
duplicate.
3.
Press Ô+C to copy your selection.
4.
Navigate within the same window to the desti-
nation folder.
5.
Press Ô+V to paste the copied items there.
If you duplicate an item within a folder, the
Finder automatically adds the word copy to its
name. This is because two items within the
same directory cannot have the same name. If
you duplicate an item multiple times, the word
copy, followed by sequential numbers, is added
to the duplicates’ names.
Using the Find Clipboard
One of the interesting new editions in Panther is the
Find Clipboard, which is an independent Clipboard
that stores text for which the user has been search-
ing. The great thing is that it is also system-wide and
works in every Apple application plus a few others
(you’ll need to experiment to be certain) while still
leaving your Clipboard contents unchanged.

Managing Fonts
E
ither because of a lack of need or because of a lack of good, inexpen-
sive tools, font management has long been a terrain where every-
day Mac users did not tread. While graphic designers used high-
priced applications to manage their fonts, the rest of us were left out in
the cold. Now, thanks to the Font Book application, any Mac user can add
wacky fonts to their Word documents or, more importantly, make their
applications load faster by enabling and disabling fonts as needed.
In this Technique, we cover pretty much everything you’ll need to know
about fonts and your computer, including installing, viewing, and manag-
ing your fonts. Along the way, we show you our own special tricks for
working with fonts in the easiest way possible.
Fonts Support in Panther
To get the most out of fonts on your system, you should fully understand
how Panther deals with fonts, particularly because this has changed sig-
nificantly in OS X.
Panther supports several types of fonts:

Cross-platform fonts
 TrueType: .ttf
 TrueType font collections: .ttc
 OpenType: .otf
These types of fonts were originally made by Microsoft. They are very
common and provide good results on the monitor and in lower quality
(DPI: dots per inch) printings.

PostScript fonts
PostScript fonts, created by Adobe (and also called Type 1 fonts), look
great at even high quality (professional level) printings.

Technique 26: Managing Fonts

• Figure 26-1: Add fonts to your system by placing them
within your personal Fonts folder.
Fonts used by your Classic system are stored
in the /System Folder/Fonts directory where
your OS 9 installation resides. The great thing
about this is that OS X automatically finds and
supports fonts that are installed in OS 9.
Any fonts that you install are recognized the next
time an application is opened. (For the Finder, this
means that the font is recognized after you restart
your computer, log in and log out, or manually quit
and restart the Finder.)
If you install fonts into your Home directory
(specifically ~/Library/Fonts), they’ll be easy
to back up and move from one system to the
next. On the downside, other users on your
Mac will not be able to use them.
To uninstall any font, just delete its file from the
Fonts folder in which it resides. Of course, you can
also install and delete fonts by using the Font Book
application, as you’ll soon see in the section titled
“Font Book” later in this Technique.
If you delete a font, any document that uses
that font will be forced to find a substitute.
You may not like the results, particularly when
it comes to graphics. For this reason alone, we
recommend you use Font Book for manag-
ing your fonts, which is covered later in this
chapter.

Data fork suitcase fonts: .dfont
Similar to OpenType fonts, data fork fonts are
new to Mac OS X. Theoretically, these fonts have
the best qualities of both Microsoft’s TrueType
and Adobe’s PostScript fonts.

Mac TrueType fonts
Mac OS 9 and earlier used various TrueType and
bitmapped (think “crude” and “jagged”) fonts.
That’s a pretty broad range of options, meaning that
you have an enviable list of options. Fonts from
Windows computers work on your Mac, as do your
old OS 9 fonts that you might still use in some
documents.
Installing Fonts
Although your Mac comes with a few dozen fonts
out of the box, you can — and probably should —
add more. You can find fonts by purchasing them
(either online or in a good software store) or by
downloading free ones from the Web. Some of the
better online font resources include

Font Freak: www.fontfreak.com

Adobe: www.adobe.com/type/main.jhtml

MyFonts.com: www.myfonts.com

Fonts.com: www.fonts.com
To install a font, all you need to do is drop the font
file into the appropriate location. Fonts can be
installed in any of the following places:

~/Library/Fonts (where ~ refers to your Home
directory; see Figure 26-1)

/Library/Fonts

/System/Library/Fonts

Viewing Fonts
209
Viewing Fonts
After you install your fonts, you have several options
for viewing them. Although every individual applica-
tion will (or should) show you a list of available fonts,
Panther’s tools go a step further by showing you what
the fonts look like and providing more powerful lev-
els of tinkering. The operating system offers three
tools for looking at your fonts: Character Palette, the
Font panel, and Font Book.
Character Palette
Character Palette was new in Jaguar and replaced
the old Key Caps utility. It is like Font Book but has
the added advantage of being accessible via the
menu bar at the top of the display. To set up your
preferences so that you can activate Character
Palette from the menu, just follow these steps:
1.
Bring up System Preferences and select the
International panel.
2.
Click the Input Menu tab and then select the
check box next to Character Palette, as shown
in Figure 26-2.
• Figure 26-2: The Input Menu panel controls palettes,
keyboards, and input methods.
3.
Select the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar check
box at the bottom of the window.
Following these steps creates an icon in the menu
bar. Clicking it brings up the Character Palette (as
shown in Figure 26-3). Character Palette is a use-
ful tool for accessing particular characters. For exam-
ple, use Character Palette if you want to insert a
symbol (such as a star, asterisk, and so on) into a
Word document or add a character with an umlaut
or tilde in an e-mail. Character Palette provides
a much faster interface for hunting down these pecu-
liar items.
• Figure 26-3: Panther’s Character Palette.

Technique 26: Managing Fonts
210
Character Palette can also be accessed by
choosing Edit➪Special Characters from the
Finder.
Font panel
The Font panel is a solid tool for viewing, selecting,
and tweaking fonts. It’s available in all Cocoa (native
to Mac OS X) applications, like Stickies, TextEdit,
Mail, and Safari.
Applications that support the Font panel, like
Mail, Stickies, and TextEdit, often use the Ô+T
keyboard shortcut for accessing the Font panel.
The Font panel’s options change based upon
how big the Font panel window is. Adjust the
window’s size to see more information.
The primary purpose of the Font panel is to allow
you to select and customize the font used in an
application. The basic view (as shown in Figure 26-4)
shows the different font collections, families, and
sizes available. Set the font face and size to use by
clicking on a Collection, then a Family, and then a
Typeface (navigate the Font panel like you would a
Finder window in column view mode). Enter a value
or use the slider to adjust the size. 
If you’re looking for a particular font but you’re not
sure which collection or family it belongs to, use the
Search button at the bottom of the window to find it.
• Figure 26-4: The Font panel exists in all Cocoa Panther
applications.
To find a particular character, just follow these steps:
1.
Within Character Palette, use the View drop-
down list at the top of the panel to select the
appropriate view.
You’ll most likely want to use Roman, unless
you have a need to access Japanese, Korean, or
Chinese characters. The Unicode View shows
many other symbols and characters such as
mathematical symbols, signs of the zodiac, and
Cyrillic letters.
2.
Either keep the By Category tab highlighted or
click the Favorites tab to immediately access
predefined favorite characters.
Use the Add to Favorites button at the bottom
of the Character Palette window to add a fre-
quently used character to your list of favorites.
Then you’ll be able to quickly insert these into
documents.
3.
If you’re browsing by category, use the menu at
the left to select a category.
4.
In the panel on the right, find the character that
you’re looking for and click it to highlight it.
5.
If desired, click the arrow next to Character
Info to learn more about the highlighted char-
acter and to see related characters.
For example, if you are looking for a special
accented character, you would choose Roman
for the View and Accented Latin as the Category,
which brings up the list of possible characters.
The top right column shows primary options and
the Character Info shows variations for each
option (uppercase, lowercase) and similar
characters.
6.
If desired, click the arrow next to Font
Variation to see the character in other fonts.
7.
To use Character Palette to insert a special
character within the current document, just
double-click the character that you want to
insert.

Viewing Fonts
211
The slider on the far right side of the Font
panel adjusts the font size. Move the slider
up to increase the font size; move it down
to decrease the font size.
The Font panel’s greatest asset is the Actions button
at the bottom left (the thing that looks like a cog or
a gear with a downward-pointing arrow next to it),
which creates a menu of useful options (see these in
Figure 26-5). The effect of the options change depend-
ing upon whether you’ve already selected a font, but
your choices include
• Figure 26-5: Click the Actions button in the Font panel
for more font options.

Add to Favorites: If you add a font to your
Favorites (Font Favorites, not the other Favorites
that your system uses), you can easily access it
in any application. Any Favorite font you’ve estab-
lished will be listed when you select Favorites
from the Collections column in the Font panel.
The wonderful thing is that the Favorites doesn’t
just recall the font itself, but also its size and any
special effects applied. So if you like a certain
style for an e-mail or a heading in a text docu-
ment, it can be quickly retrieved time and again.
Make good use of the Font Favorites tool to
save yourself time when accessing frequently
used fonts and styles.

Show/Hide Preview: This Action option toggles
a Preview window that shows the font name in
its font to demonstrate its appearance. Use the
Preview option while you’re tweaking a font’s
settings.

Show/Hide Effects: This setting reveals and
hides the toolbar of font effects, which lets you
customize your fonts. Using the different font
effect tools, you can adjust these font attributes:
 Underline (none, single, double, or color)
 Strikethrough (none, single, double, or color)
 Font color
 Font background color
 Shadow (opacity, blur, offset, and angle)
Unfortunately, the effects are not reflected in the
Preview section of the Font panel, so you’ll need
to select the text in the document (to which you
want to apply the effects) to see how the differ-
ent adjustments look. 
Thanks to the Font panel and the Effects sec-
tion in particular, you can now perform fancy
text manipulations in TextEdit. Fliers and signs
that used to require sophisticated applications
like Adobe Pagemaker can now be made in
the free (and simple to use) TextEdit. 

Color: This brings up the Color Palette, a sepa-
rate window of color choices. The Color Palette
is used all over the operating system and has
several subpanels, each of which lets you find a

ceding section.

Technique 26: Managing Fonts
212
To preview any font, follow these steps:
1.
Start by clicking the appropriate collection in
the left column.
2.
Select the font family in the middle column.
3.
If desired, click the arrow next to the font’s
name to expand the font listing.
4.
If desired, select a specific subfont from the
family.
5.
Adjust the view size in the third column by
moving the slider or using the Size pull-down
menu.
If you want, you can have Font Book preview a font
by using specific text. After you select your font,
choose Preview➪Custom or press Ô+3. In the third
column (which has now highlighted the alphanu-
meric preview of the font), type the text that you
want to use as the sample (see Figure 26-7).
• Figure 26-7: You can use Font Book to preview specific
text in a font.
Font Book has a Search box in its upper-right
corner, which allows you to quickly find a font
by name or family.
The Show Font Info option (under the Preview
menu or accessed by pressing Ô+I) displays
a technical description of the font being
previewed.

Typography: Panther includes many new
options for precise typographical control, but
the availability of advanced typographical
options varies from font to font. Commonly you
can tweak a font’s ligatures (how two characters
joined together are spaced) and glyphs (special
characters). Some fonts also have tweaks for
managing em (or wide) dashes, hyphens, case,
and spacing.

Edit Sizes: The Edit Sizes menu allows you to set
the default sizes available for your fonts.

Manage Fonts: This last option brings up Font
Book.
Font Book
The Font Book utility can be used to view and man-
age your fonts. Font Book consists of a window that
lists the groupings or categories of fonts in the left
column, the specific fonts for that grouping in the
middle column, and a preview of the font in the right
column (although the preview can be disabled).
If you double-click any font in the Finder, it
opens in Font Book, where you can view and
manage it (see Figure 26-6). You can also
access Font Book from within your Applications
folder or from the Font panel.
• Figure 26-6: Viewing a font in Font Book.

Managing Fonts
213
Managing Fonts
You can always install and uninstall fonts simply by
manually removing them from a Fonts folder and
then replacing them when needed. Although this is
effective, it’s unnecessarily slow and cumbersome.
Instead, use Font Book to manage your fonts. With
Font Book, you can

More quickly install fonts

View every font on your Mac at once (a time-
saver because fonts may be found in many
locations)

Disable fonts without having to delete them
(which makes applications load faster)

Create font groupings so that particular applica-
tions (like Adobe Photoshop) have access to
fonts not required by other applications

Uninstall fonts without searching all over your
hard drive for the actual files
Use Font Book’s Preferences (accessed by
pressing Ô+,) to adjust how the application
behaves. You can set it to install fonts for you
or for everyone on your Mac and adjust how
disabling a font collection works. If you’re wor-
ried about Font Book messing up a nicely
organized system of fonts, enable the Always
Copy Font Files When Installing option. This
will keep Font Book from moving the original
font.
To create a collection
1.
Click the plus sign at the bottom of the
Collection column.
In the Collection column, a new listing appears
with a name like “New-0” already highlighted
for you.
2.
Type a name for the collection (see Fig-
ure 26-8).
• Figure 26-8: Give your collection a meaningful name.
3.
In the Collection column, click All Fonts to
view every font.
4.
Drag each font you want to add from the Font
column onto your new collection.
Use the Disable/Enable buttons to deactivate
or activate fonts and collections as needed.
Deactivating fonts and collections make your
applications load faster (because it doesn’t
have to access all those fonts) and makes it
easier to select a font to use (because you’ll be
searching through a smaller list). 
Although Font Book is sufficient for the typical Mac
user, those who work a lot with different sets of fonts
(such as graphic artists) might find third-party tools
to be a better alternative. The best candidate is
Suitcase (www.extensis.com/suitcase/, $100), which
has been with Mac users for a long time. It can inter-
act with some applications like Adobe InDesign or
Illustrator directly, meaning that fonts are opened
automatically as soon as a document needs them.
An alternative, Font Reserve, has just been pur-
chased by Extensis (the makers of Suitcase), so its
status is unclear at the time of this writing.

Getting to Know
Services
S
ervices have been around since the introduction of OS X, but sur-
prisingly few Mac users know about them or use them with any reg-
ularity. Services are like the geeky younger brothers of contextual
menus: not as impressive at first, but pretty cool after you get to know
them. The minutes you spend reading this chapter will greatly improve
your productivity, as Services cut to the chase in performing many com-
mon tasks.
In this Technique, we give you the all-in-one treatment for Services. We
begin with a quick introduction to the concept: what they are, how you
use them, and where they work. Then we present a more advanced cov-
erage of the topic, going over our best tips and techniques. Finally, we
point you toward some resources for adding to your currently available
Services.
What Are Services?
Services are little tools, usually chosen from a menu or keyboard short-
cut, that are essentially a part of the operating system, which makes
them available in many of your applications. Services work by providing
the functionality of one application as an option in a second application.
Some common examples of what Services can do are

Open a file

Send selected content in an e-mail

Create a new Stickie note from selected text

Have your computer speak selected text

Open a URL in your Web browser

Search in Google for selected text

• Figure 27-2: Services available in Safari.
To tell whether an application supports
Services, select some text in a document or
window and then peruse through the Services
menu. If all the options are in gray (folders will
not be in gray although their contents will be),
the answer is no (see Figure 27-3). If any of the
options are selectable, you’re good to go!
• Figure 27-3: The current version of Microsoft Office does
not support Services.
Services are normally applied to the current
selection. Most often, this is text, but it could
also be a selected file or folder in the Finder.
You’ll also find that what services are available
(unavailable Services appear in gray text)
depends upon the application you are using
and the content you have selected.
An application’s Services are listed as menu choices
in its application menu, whether the Finder (as in
Figure 27-1) or Safari (like Figure 27-2). Because of
their unique nature, Services function only in certain
applications — specifically Cocoa applications and
some Carbon applications (see the sidebar, “Cocoa
and Carbon Applications”).
• Figure 27-1: Services available in the Finder.
At the time of writing, all these applications (and
many more besides) support Services:

Finder

Mail

Safari

iTunes

BBEdit

Your Mac comes with a good dozen of Services right
out of the box, and you can add more with share-
ware as well (see the upcoming section, “Adding On
Services”).
Cocoa and Carbon Applications
Two Mac OS X terms that you might hear with some
frequency are Cocoa and Carbon. These came about in
part to ease the transition from OS 9 to OS X. Carbon
applications are normally OS 9 tools that have been modi-
fied to work in OS X: for example, BBEdit. Cocoa applica-
tions are written specifically for OS X and take advantage of
its technology (Safari, iTunes, and others). Although both of
these application types run in OS X — and you don’t really
need to know whether an application is Cocoa- or Carbon-
based — remember that all Cocoa applications support
Services, whereas only some Carbon applications do.
Grasping the Best Services
Techniques
The world of Services is still expanding, but good,
useful Services are already available. Here is a quick
tour of our favorites. Remember that Services are
provided by one application to other applications
that support Services. In each of these cases, we
focus on what functionality an application provides:

BBEdit: BBEdit offers a service that opens a
selected file in that application. For example,
select any file in the Finder and then choose
Open File from the BBEdit Services menu (see
Figure 27-4). It automatically opens that file —
even if it isn’t a standard BBEdit file type — in
the popular text editor. Alternatively, BBEdit’s
Open Selection Service creates a new document
using selected text. You can use this to take
HTML code or text from a Web page and start a
new BBEdit file with it.
The BBEdit Open Selection Service has the
added functionality of placing the path name
of a selected file in a new BBEdit document.
• Figure 27-4: The BBEdit Services menu has two useful
tools.

Grab: The Grab utility is useful for taking screen
shots and it can run independent of any other
application (see Technique 45). Grab also pro-
vides a highly specific, and frankly odd, Service.
The Grab Service can also be used to perform
screen captures — but because Services can’t
create files, you can only use the Grab Service to
place a screenshot within another document.
Figure 27-5 shows a screenshot of a Finder win-
dow placed inside of a TextEdit document. 

Mail’s Send Selection and Send File: Two Mail
Services let you send selected text or files as
part of an e-mail. For example:
1. Select a file in the Finder.
2. Choose Finder➪Services➪Mail➪Send File.
3. This brings up the Mail application, with a
new e-mail already created and the file
attached.
or
1. Select some text in any application that sup-
ports Services.
2. Choose Application Menu➪Services➪Mail➪
Send Selection.
3. This brings up the Mail application, with a
new e-mail already created and the selected
text in the body.

• Figure 27-6: The Make New Sticky Note Service takes a
selected image and makes a new Stickie
with it.

TextEdit’s New Window Containing Selection:
This Service, similar to Make New Sticky Note,
launches TextEdit and creates a new document
using the selected text.

Open URL: The Open URL Service opens the
selected URL in a new browser window in your
default Web browser, saving you these steps:
1. Copying the URL to the Clipboard.
2. Navigating your way over to the Web browser.
3. Opening a new browser window.
4. Highlighting the browser’s address/
location bar.
5. Pasting the URL.
6. Pressing Return to load the page.
The most important tip regarding Services is that,
as with contextual menus, you should get in the
habit of actively checking what options are available.
New Services can be added without your knowing it
(when applications are installed), or you might just
forget how useful a tool they really are. Services pro-
vide huge timesaving potential for any Mac user. The
next time that you have a few minutes to kill, play
with the Services menu!
• Figure 27-5: No, you’re not seeing double: Grab places
a screenshot of a document within a
document.

Mail’s Send To: A third Mail Service automati-
cally creates a new e-mail message addressed to
the selected text, which would presumably be an
e-mail address.

Make New Sticky Note: The Make New Sticky
Note Service creates a new Stickie note from
selected content (be it text or an image; see
Figure 27-6).
You can also trigger the Make New Sticky
Note Service with the Ô+Shift+Y keyboard
shortcut.

Search with Google: This Service searches
Google (in your default Web browser), using
selected text as the search terms.

Services and Their Keyboard
Shortcomings
Services have one drawback: An application’s keyboard
shortcuts have precedence over those used by the Services
menu. This means that unlike the rest of the Mac OS X
user interface, these shortcuts are really unstable.
For example, the Search with Google Service, activated by
the Ô+Shift+G keyboard shortcut, might work in one appli-
cation but not another: That second application might
already use Ô+Shift+G for something else. Frankly, we
think that Apple’s Services should take precedence, but no
one at Apple is returning our calls on the issue.
Just be aware of this issue when you use Services . . . and
understand that’s the cause if a shortcut fails to act pre-
dictably in certain applications.
Adding On Services
As you might imagine, you can obtain a few share-
ware applications that add to and improve upon
the default set of Services. Unlike the Services
discussed in the previous section of this chapter
(which are added when applications are installed),
these Services add functionality independent of any
application. For example:

DEVONtechnologies offers several free Service
tools (www.devon-technologies.com/freeware.
php). These include
 AntiWordService, which allows you to open up
Microsoft Word documents in any Cocoa text
editor
 BlueService, which enables you to send text to
a Bluetooth device (assuming your computer
is Bluetooth-enabled and the device is nearby)
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that works
over a limited range. It’s discussed in good
detail in Technique 54.
 CalcService, which performs calculations
 EasyFind, which is a search tool
 HotService, which allows you to use Devon’s
Services through a keyboard shortcut
 WordService, for doing common conversions
of text (like changing the case or switching
between straight and curly quotation marks)

The SearchGoogle Service (http://gu.st/
proj/SearchGoogle.service/, free) automati-
cally searches Google (using your default Web
browser) for the selected text. Despite its name,
the Service can also perform searches at Amazon.
com and the iTunes Music Store.

CleverKeys (www.cleverkeys.com, free) looks
up definitions and synonyms online and links to
Amazon.com for shopping purposes. It installs
as both a Service and a contextual menu, so it
works even in Carbon applications that don’t
support Services.

ICeCoffEE (http://web.sabi.net/nriley/
software/, free) adds a number of Services
but also makes all of your Services available as
contextual menus (in applications that support
Services). 
Most of these tools come with their own installers,
but those that don’t can be installed by dropping
them in the /Library/Services directory. Most
Services require you to log out and log back in
for them to take effect.

Cranking Up Your
Internet Activities

Surfing with Safari
W
hether you’re surfing the Web for personal or business use, hav-
ing the right tools and knowing how to get the most out of them
goes a long way toward improving your experience. Safari is
Apple’s default Web browser and should be the preferred tool of choice
for your browsing needs. Not only does it come free with Panther, but it’s
also a pretty good browser in its own right.
In this Technique, you’ll find out most everything you need to know
about using Safari quickly and easily. (Everything, that is, except search-
ing with Google and managing bookmarks, each of which merit their own
Techniques.) Although Web surfing is largely a mouse-driven activity, we
begin with some useful keyboard shortcuts that you ought to know. Then
we cover the different Safari preferences settings and why and how you
should set them. After that, you read about the AutoFill tool, which saves
you countless time spent filling out Web forms. Finally, we mention the
customization tools available for tweaking the default appearance and
behavior of Safari. 
Navigation Shortcuts
Although you can surf the Net without using an input device (your
mouse, trackball, or whatever), realistically, the Web is still a primarily
mouse-driven world. Despite that, here is a smattering of navigation-
related keyboard shortcuts that you might find useful:

Ô+N: Creates a new browser window.

Ô+T: Opens a new tab in the current window.
Safari supports tabbed browsing, which is the ability to open multiple
Web pages within a single browser window. We discuss this in detail
in “Working with tabbed browsing.”

Ô+[ (opening brace): Goes back one page.

Ô+] (closing brace): Goes forward one page (to a page you have previ-
ously visited).

Technique 28: Surfing with Safari
222
Many people don’t know this, but for most
Web sites, you can skip the www at the begin-
ning of the URL without consequence. You
can almost always skip the http:// part. In fact,
many common Web sites can be accessed by
using a bare minimum of typing: apple,
microsoft, espn, adobe, and so forth. (Whether
this works for you depends on your browsing
history, but it’s worth trying.)
Standard Shortcuts
Along with the Safari navigation shortcuts, all the
common Panther keyboard commands work in Safari
as well:

Ô+O: Opens a file (if you want to open a saved
Web page from your hard drive)

Ô+W: Closes the open window

Ô+S: Saves a document

Ô+P: Prints the open document

Ô+C: Copies selected text to the Clipboard

Ô+X: Cuts selected text (which is much less
useful in Safari than in other applications)

Ô+V: Pastes Clipboard contents where the 
cursor is

Ô+A: Selects everything

Ô+Z: Undoes the last action

Ô+Shift+Z: Redoes the last undone action

Ô+E: Adds a selection to the Find Clipboard
Read more about the Find Clipboard in
Technique 25.

Ô+F: Brings up the Find dialog (see Figure 28-2)
Back and forth navigation is represented by
two sets of keyboard shortcuts. The standard
Mac shortcuts that use brackets ([ and ]) work
like they do in the Finder. The standard short-
cuts for other browsers (using the left and
right arrow keys) also function.

Ô+L: The Ô+L shortcut — Open Location —
highlights the address bar (or location window)
and places the cursor there. If no browser win-
dow is open, this command opens a new browser
window and places the cursor in the address bar
(see Figure 28-1).
• Figure 28-1: Use Ô+L to access the address bar.

Ô+. (period): Stops a page from loading.

Ô+R: Reloads the page.

Ô+Shift+H: Goes to your home page (as set in
Safari’s preferences).

Ô+` (accent grave) or ~ (tilde): Rotates among
the open windows.

Ô+Shift+→and Ô+Shift+←: Rotates among tabs
within a window.

Tab key: Normally moves from element to ele-
ment within a Web page.

Ô+, (comma): Brings up the Appearance prefer-
ences panel (see Figure 28-3)
• Figure 28-3: Safari’s preferences panel.
Other Shortcuts
Finally, you should know about a few other
miscellaneous-purpose keyboard shortcuts that
will come in handy.

Ô+= (equal sign): Increases text size
The Increase Text Size keyboard shortcut is
technically pressing the Ô and + keys at the
same time. But because pressing the Shift key
to make the plus sign would be inconvenient,
you can get away with Ô+=.

Ô+– (minus sign): Decreases text size

Ô+K: Sets Safari to block pop-up ads

Ô+: (colon; you could also think of this as
Ô+Shift+;): Brings up the Spelling dialog 
(see Figure 28-4)
• Figure 28-4: Apple’s spelling tool works in Safari.

Ô+; (semicolon): Checks your spelling, separate
from the Spelling dialog
Turn on the Check Spelling as You Type
option (under Edit➪Spelling) to look smarter
when you fill out forms. Once enabled, text
you enter in forms will be spell checked, just
as your typing in a text editor is.
Mice and Safari
Presumably you already know the basics of using the
mouse (or other input device) with Safari. Consider a cou-
ple of additions, however, to improve on your experience.
For starters, a mouse with a scroll wheel enables you to sim-
ply rotate the wheel to move up and down within a Web
page. This saves you the time and hassle of switching back
and forth between your mouse and the keyboard. Your mice
will even scroll sideways within a page if you hold down the
Shift key while using the scroll wheel. Some mouse soft-
ware (like Kensington’s MouseWorks) will let you set the
scroll wheel to act as a button click if you press down on it.
Second, if you have a programmable mouse, you can set
one of the buttons to act as a Control+click, enacting the

Setting Preferences
Adjusting Safari’s sparse but potent preferences goes
a long way toward improving your Web-browsing
experience. Most of the options are easy to compre-
hend, so we stick to discussing those that most
directly improves how quickly and easily you can
use the application. Specifically, we focus on those
features that you can adjust within the General,
Tabs, and Security sections of the Preferences panel.
To address the Safari preferences, press Ô+, (comma)
or select Preferences from the Safari menu.
Setting General preferences
The General panel (as shown in Figure 28-5) greatly
affects your entire Internet surfing experience. The
best timesaving techniques here are
• Figure 28-5: Safari’s General preferences panel.

Set your default Web browser. Although Mac
users often use many different browsers at once
(particularly graphic designers and Web develop-
ers), you should identify a primary browser. The
contextual menus. What you see in the contextual menu
will differ based upon what you Control+click on. If you just
click on a Web page without selecting any text, you can
view the HTML source, save the page, or print it.
If you select some text and press Control+click, you can
copy that text or use it as a Google search term.
If you Control+click an image or a link, you’re given differ-
ent options, such as opening the link in a new window or
downloading the image to your computer.
You can use the mouse in even more innovative ways 
if you use Cocoa Gestures (www.bitart.com/Cocoa
Gestures.html, free). This shareware application lets you
associate commands with mouse movements made while
holding down the primary mouse button. For example, you
can set Cocoa Gestures so that if you hold down the mouse
button and move the mouse to the left, Safari goes back to
the previous page. Gestures are an odd concept to wrap
your head around, but you’ll love them once you start using
them. They let you perform common tasks without switch-
ing over to the keyboard or moving your cursor up to the
proper buttons.

Setting Preferences
225
benefit to this is that every URL you click in an 
e-mail, iChat session, or document will be auto-
matically opened in your preferred Web browser.
Strangely enough, this setting is now in the Safari
browser rather than in an Internet preferences
panel (so, yes, you would use Safari to say that
you want Netscape to be your default Web
Browser).

Set new windows to open with an empty page.
Accessing your home page or bookmarks imme-
diately is convenient, but how frequently will you
really be doing that? Instead, save yourself the
loading time by choosing Empty Page from the
New Windows Open With pull-down menu. Every
time you press Ô+N (new browser window), a
blank window will be opened, ready for you to
type the address. On those occasions when you
want to go to your Home page or Bookmarks, just
press Ô+Shift+H or Ô+Option+B, respectively.

Set your home page. Your home page can be
anything — not necessarily a traditional, cus-
tomizable site like Yahoo!, Apple.Netscape.com,
or the one provided by your ISP. For example, in
the past, Larry set Google as his home page, but
now he’s just as likely to use www.espn.com
(which must be checked several times per day).
Your home page — like your Home directory
in the Finder — can be quickly viewed by
pressing the Ô+Shift+H keyboard shortcut.
(Both shortcuts only work within each specific
application.)

Set where Safari saves downloaded files. When
your browser downloads a file, you want that to
happen with as little interruption as possible. To
that end, use the Save Downloaded Files To drop-
down list to have Safari automatically download
files to the Desktop where you can easily find
them. In the Remove Download List Items drop-
down list, choose Upon Successful Download to
have downloaded items automatically removed
after a download is successfully completed. Also
clear the Open “Safe” Files After Downloading
check box. If you do this, you can easily see and
access your downloaded files by Ô+Option+
clicking the Desktop (which hides all other
applications in the process).

Set Safari to open links from applications in a
new window. You’ll want to select the In a New
Window radio button because otherwise every
URL that you click in any application wipes out
the contents of the current browser window. (If
you were to click several links within an e-mail,
as an example, each would continually replace
its predecessor.) To look through them all, you
would need to do some savvy navigation within
the same browser window. Avoid the hassle and
just have Safari create a new window for each
new link. They’re easy enough to cycle through
(Ô+`) or close (Ô+W) anyway.
To adjust the appearance of the browser win-
dow, you can always show/hide the address
bar, status bar, and bookmark bar by using
the options under the View menu or by using
the keyboard shortcuts (Ô + | to toggle the
address bar off and on, Ô + / for the status
bar, and Ô+B for the bookmark bar).
Working with tabbed browsing
Tabbed browsing is a relative newcomer to the
world of Web browsers, and it’s a most welcome
addition. It first came about in lesser-known
browsers such as Mozilla and OmniWeb, and has
just recently made its way to Safari. For those of you
unfamiliar with the concept, tabbed browsing allows
you to have multiple documents (Web pages) nicely
organized and displayed within a single document
window. Each page has its own tab that you can then
click to access quickly and easily. This helps keep
things organized during regular use and allows you
to access bookmarks in novel ways.
To set up tabbed browsing:
1.
Click the Tabs icon in Safari’s preferences 
(see Figure 28-6).

Technique 28: Surfing with Safari
226
To use tabbed browsing:

Hold down the Ô key while clicking a link to view
it in a tab (see Figure 28-7).
• Figure 28-7: A browser window with multiple tabs.

Hold down the Ô and Shift keys while clicking 
a link to view it in a new tab immediately. (In
other words, open the new tab in front of the
existing tab.)

The Ô+Shift+→shortcut rotates one tab to the
right.

Pressing Ô+Shift+←rotates one tab to the left.

Hold down the Option key while clicking a link to
view it in a new window (as opposed to a tab).
If tabbed browsing is enabled, holding down
the Option key when you click on a link opens
that link in a new window, as opposed to a tab.
If tabbed browsing is not enabled, holding
down the Option key when you click on a link
downloads the link to your computer.

Use Option+Shift+click to open a link in a new
window in front of the active window.
The keyboard shortcuts for tabs come down to
this: Ô means a new tab, and Shift means that
the new tab should be selected (opened in
front). Option, on the other hand, makes a
new window, so pressing Option+Shift makes
a new window in front of the others.
• Figure 28-6: Enable tabbed browsing from the Tabs
panel.
2.
Mark the Enable Tabbed Browsing check box.
3.
Make sure that the Select New Tabs As They
Are Created check box is not checked.
One of the biggest benefits of tabbed browsing is
that you can click links without disrupting the
flow of reading through a page, so selecting this
option defeats that purpose. If you want to
immediately view a tabbed link, hold down
Ô+Shift while clicking a link. Otherwise, leave
this check box clear so that each tab appears in
the background.
4.
Make sure that the Always Show Tab Bar check
box is also not checked.
The tab bar automatically appears and disap-
pears as needed, so you don’t need to have it
always hanging around. (In fact, that just uses up
unnecessary screen space.)
If you find all of these shortcuts hard to
remember, just be certain to keep the status
bar visible. It will show you what each action
will do before you take it. For example, if you
hold down the Ô key while hovering over a
link, the status bar reads Go to whatever-
URL-the-link-is in a new tab behind
the current one. Ô+click on the link and
Safari will do just that.

Setting Preferences
227
Here’s a cool little tidbit: If you enter any text
in the address bar or Google search bar and
press Ô+Return, the result opens in a new
tab. Pressing Ô+Shift+Return opens it in a
new tab at the front.
If a browser window has multiple tabs

Pressing Ô+W closes the current tab.

Clicking the little X icon next to the tab’s title
closes that tab. (This goes for any tab and not
just the active one.)

Clicking the window’s red button in the upper-
left corner closes the entire window and every
tab in it.

Control+click a tab’s title to see a contextual
menu (see Figure 28-8). With this menu you can
close that tab or all the others, or reload that tab
or every other.
• Figure 28-8: Contextual menus work on tabs in Safari.
Blocking pop-up windows
Pop-up windows, the Web’s version of spam, have to
be one of the most annoying things around. (Except
for maybe Carrot Top’s long distance commercials,
that is.) Fortunately, you don’t have to see pop-ups if
you don’t want to. We highly recommend that you do
one of the following:

While in Safari, press Ô+K to turn on pop-up win-
dow blocking (pressing it again will turn pop-up
window blocking back off, if you miss the extra
windows).

In the Security panel of Safari’s Preferences, mark
the Block Pop-Up Windows check box.
The nice thing about this feature of Safari is that
pop-up windows that you request (for example, by
clicking a link) still appear, but those requested by
the page itself (read: advertisements for travel deals,
super-fast weight loss, and phenomenal hair
regrowth) never do.
Setting Safari to block pop-up windows saves
you a lifetime of effort spent closing annoying
little windows. You’re still on your own with
the Carrot Top commercials, though!
Cache as Catch Can
Web browsers use two concepts behind the scenes to
improve the speed of  surfing the Web. The first, history,
records places you’ve visited. You can access them again by
using the History menu or by letting the application auto-
matically complete the URL when you begin typing it. A
cache is the browser’s way of saving text, images, videos,
and other content to your hard disk. The benefit of caching
is that the next time the page is loaded, some of the con-
tent can be recalled from the disk, rather than having to re-
download it.
Most browsers allow you to put a limit on how big the
cache of Web pages saved by your browser can grow,
which keeps your cache from getting too big. Odd as it
might seem, Safari doesn’t let you adjust the amount of
disk space used by its cache. (In fact, Safari provides few of
the standard options in terms of refreshing the browser,
managing your history, and so forth.) Instead, you can sim-
ply empty the cache when you feel like it. To do so, either
choose Empty Cache from the Safari menu or use the
Ô+Option+E shortcut. Either of these makes Safari rebuild
each page it encounters from the source, without relying
upon any cached materials. This is particularly useful if you
are creating Web pages and want to insure that Safari is
reflecting the most recent changes.
With respect to your history, although you can’t set a
default number of days or pages to track, you can clear it all
by using the Clear History option at the bottom of the
History menu.

Technique 28: Surfing with Safari
228

Usernames and passwords: There are two types
of username/password combinations Safari can
help with. First, and most common, are those
associated with login forms, like when you log
into Amazon.com or NewYorkTimes.com. The
second type are those used to limit access to
Web pages or sections of a Web page. These use
a separate pop-up window (although it’s not the
same kind of browser pop-up window used by
advertisers), not a standard Web-based form. In
either case, Safari will — if you let it — remember
the proper username and password for each indi-
vidual Web site.
The passwords stored by Safari are safe
because they cannot be retrieved without a
person knowing your system’s master pass-
word. Safari uses the keychain (see Technique
52) to store these passwords, where they are
only visible after revalidating using the
account’s login password.

Other forms: This catch-all records (again, if you
want it to) those things you entered in, er, other
forms. These values might be for a preferences
page of a Web site or an address entered into
MapQuest.
After you enable AutoFill, it will automatically fill in
values when you encounter personal information
forms (assuming that the Web site has form inputs
named logically so that AutoFill recognizes them as
such). If the AutoFill doesn’t immediately engage,
use the Ô+Shift+A shortcut to activate it.
For usernames and passwords, and for other forms,
Safari automatically fills these out at a Web site
using the values you entered in the previous visit.
The AutoFill tool marks in yellow those form
inputs that it fills out. Also, if you have multiple
options for an input (for example, you might
have several e-mail addresses), begin typing
the first few letters of the one that you want
and then select it from the option menu that
appears.
While we’re at it, we might as well mention the cookies
stored in Safari. These are controlled in the Security tab.
There you can adjust how Safari handles cookies, or view
stored cookies by clicking on Show Cookies. In the result-
ing window, you can delete any cookies by selecting them
from the list and clicking Remove (or by clicking Remove
All to really sweep away the cookie crumbs).
Saving Time with AutoFill Forms
Surfing the Internet, to a large degree, comes down
to filling out forms. Passwords, search boxes, order
pages, and other forms require you to constantly
enter the same information again and again. To save
yourself the tedium and much time in the bargain,
familiarize yourself with Safari’s AutoFill Forms 
feature.
Select the check boxes of the AutoFill panel of the
Preferences dialog (as shown in Figure 28-9) to
enable three types of AutoFill:
• Figure 28-9: The AutoFill preferences panel.

Your personal information: This option allows
Safari to fill in your name, company name, e-mail
address, phone number, and mailing address,
using the information you’ve established in your
Address Book record. Checking this AutoFill
option is the most important in terms of saving
time and involves the least amount of security
risks. 
Safari’s AutoFill tool is another reason to use
your Address Book: That’s where Safari gets its
information from, after all. Furthermore, if you
move, you only need to change your address
record in the Address Book, and Safari’s
AutoFill values are automatically updated.

Marking Pages with SnapBack
229
Managing Usernames and
Passwords
When you first encounter a site that requires a user-
name and password, create a username and pass-
word and then click Submit. Safari then asks you
whether you would like to save this password as an
AutoFill entry, giving you three options (check them
out in Figure 28-10):
• Figure 28-10: Let Safari manage your usernames and
passwords.

Never for this Website

Not Now

Yes
For almost every instance, choosing to have Safari
remember the values is the smart move, saving you
the time of re-entering that information upon your
next visit. If the site in question is of a particularly
sensitive nature (such as your online banking), you
might want to ask Safari not to remember the values
and never prompt you again. If you aren’t certain
what to do, opt for door number three (Not Now),
and you’ll be prompted again the next time that you
enter that username and password.
To have Safari forget some remembered values
1.
Click the Edit button next to User Names 
and Passwords of the AutoFill panel (refer to
Figure 28-9).
2.
In the resulting panel, select the site whose val-
ues should be forgotten (see Figure 28-11).
• Figure 28-11: Forget submitted username and password
combinations using this window.
3.
Click the Remove button.
Do not click Remove All in this window unless
you really want to spend the time retyping
every username and password everywhere
you go.
4.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
5.
Click Done when you’re finished.
Marking Pages with SnapBack
A really, really, really great feature in Safari is
SnapBack, which is kind of like a temporary book-
mark. You’ll find two different SnapBacks in Safari:
one for the main page of a Web site, and another for
your Google searches. With SnapBack, you can des-
ignate a place as a SnapBack page and then return to
that page immediately without being forced to navi-
gate back through all the intermediary pages.
An alternative to both the SnapBack and the
History features is to use the browser window’s
title bar. Ô+click on the title and you’ll see a
menu of previously visited pages (Figure 28-12),
like the path hierarchy of a Finder window.

Technique 28: Surfing with Safari
230
• Figure 28-12: See, and quickly go back to, places you’ve
been in a Web site by Ô+clicking on the
browser window title.
Safari automatically manages the two SnapBack
pages:

When you go to any site, Safari marks it for
SnapBack. After you browse from there, the
orange SnapBack arrow appears. Clicking it
returns you to the original page. This also works
for bookmarks you load.
Here’s an example of how you might use this
feature:
1. Open Amazon.com in Safari.
2. Click the Books tab.
The original URL is now marked for SnapBack.
3. Navigate through the Browse Subjects pages
to access the books on, say, Mac OS X.
4. Mark the resulting page for SnapBack by
choosing Mark Page for SnapBack under the
History menu.
5. View all the books you want and add them to
your cart as desired.
We highly recommend picking up a few copies
of Mac OS X Panther Timesaving Techniques
For Dummies (Wiley, 2004).
6. Return to the original Mac OS X books page
(what you set in Step 4) by clicking the orange
SnapBack arrow.

Every Google search page is marked for Snap-
Back. The Google Search box appears next to the
address bar (you can show and hide it using the
View menu) and has its own SnapBack, entirely
independent from the location/address SnapBack.
Here’s an example of how you might manually use
this technique:
1.
Click in the Google Search box to place your
cursor there.
2.
Enter your search terms and press Return.
For example, you can search for “Larry Ullman”
or “Marc Liyanage.”
3.
Click on any link returned by Google to visit
that page.
4.
If you need to return to the Google search
results page, click on the SnapBack icon found
in the Google Search box.
The keyboard shortcuts for working with 
SnapBack are

Safari’s Debug Menu
The really techie user out there will appreciate this little
trick. You can enact Safari’s Debug menu from the
Terminal. The Debug menu lets you pretend that you are
using a different browser (good for accessing persnickety
Web sites), debug JavaScript, import bookmarks from other
browsers, and more.
Here’s one way to turn on the Debug menu:
1.
Open the Terminal application.
2.
Navigate to your Preferences folder with the
command cd ~/Library/Preferences.
3.
Type defaults write com.apple.Safari
IncludeDebugMenu 1 and then press Return.
4.
Quit and then relaunch the Safari application.
The Debug menu now appears as an option, letting you do
such things as have Safari pose as other Web browsers when
visiting sites. Alternatively, you can use the Safari Enhancer
(discussed in “Customizing Safari”) to do this and more.

Customizing Safari
231
Customizing Safari
The techniques in this section won’t necessarily
save you a lot of time, but you can employ them to
customize Safari to your way of thinking, which is
still worthwhile. Here are a few of our favorites:

Use your own style sheet: If you’re comfortable
with cascading style sheets (CSSes), create your
own style sheet and set Safari to always use it.
How much or how little you dictate in the style
sheet is up to you. In-depth coverage of CSSes is
outside the scope of this book, but if you would
like to read up on the subject, check out Cascading
Style Sheets For Dummies, by Damon Dean (Wiley).

Investigate a handful of utilities online for
changing the theme and appearance of Safari,
such as
 Lioness (http://w1.864.telia.com/
~u86428755/superqult_software/lioness.
html, free)
 Safari Aquafier and Safari Font 
(www.scifience.net, free)
 SafarIcon (http://homepage.mac.com/
reinholdpenner, free)
 SafariNoBrush (http://www.macupdate.com/
info.php/id/10525, free)

Use Safari Enhancer (www.lordofthecows.com,
free) or Safari Helper (http://zoffware.com,
free) to change Safari’s appearance and some
of its behavior.

Use PithHelmet (www.culater.net/osd/Pith
Helmet/PithHelmet.html, free) to have Safari
block out advertising images in Web pages. It
can also stop sounds from playing and cut out
Flash and Shockwave animations.
Don’t forget that your contextual menus and
services offer Search with Google and Open
URL shortcuts, thanks to Safari. With these,
you can quickly start common Safari tasks
from within other applications. See Techniques
12 (on contextual menus) and 27 (on Services)
for more.

Technique
Surfing with Other
Browsers
I
f Microsoft has taught the world anything, it’s that using only one
browser — and the browser that comes with the operating system in
particular — might not be the best move. Although Safari, Apple’s
default browser, is a great product, you should consider using another
Web browser, if only as a secondary option. Web developers must have
multiple Web browsers in order to test how a Web site will look and
behave for different users. We would suggest that the average Mac user
have a couple of Web browsers for two reasons. First, you can take
advantage of different features that don’t exist or aren’t consistent across
all browsers. Second, some Web pages look and work better in one
browser than they do in another.
A handful of other browsers work on Panther, and we discuss most of
those here. You’re not going to get too much of an introduction to any
one browser (they all do the same thing, after all), but you will see the
most useful features and techniques of each. Our focus will be on Internet
Explorer (IE) and the Netscape/Mozilla/Camino line, with a little attention
given to three commercial products: OmniWeb, Opera, and iCab.
Pretty much every browser you use asks you whether you want to set
it as your default browser. You’re not permanently beholden to that
decision, though, because you can always change this setting through
Safari’s preferences panel (see Technique 28).
Internet Explorer
Internet Explorer — as you likely know — is the 800-pound gorilla of the
Web browser market. Many Mac users began relying upon it during the
years of Apple’s close contractual ties with Microsoft (also know as the
Dark Ages). Despite the fact that we’re of the anti-IE camp (see the “A Rant
against Internet Explorer” sidebar, later in this Technique), we acknowl-
edge that a number of readers still use it. For those readers, we’d like to
give you some information to help you get the most out of the application.

 Checking out the com-
mercial browsers avail-
able on the Mac

Internet Explorer
233
In our opinion, you have two main reasons to use IE:

You’re a Web developer and want to test a site on
one of the more common browsers.

You’re accessing a site that requires you to 
use IE.
To add to our cause of getting you to not use
Internet Explorer, note that it lacks three very
useful features that Safari boasts: tabbed brows-
ing, pop-up ad blocking, and the ability to Snap-
Back to a page or search results. Also, Microsoft
no longer plans to develop IE for the Mac.
Keyboard shortcuts
You don’t need to read much of this book to know
that we’re pretty keen on using keyboard shortcuts
whenever possible. Without overwhelming you with
all the options, here are some of the most important
ones for IE:

Ô+[ (opening brace): Moves you back one page

Ô+] (closing brace): Goes forward one page 
(a page you’ve already visited)

Ô+. (period): Stops the loading of the current
page

Ô+R: Refreshes the current page

Ô+D: Adds the current page to your list of
Favorites (otherwise known as bookmarks)

Ô+1: Brings up the main IE window

Ô+2: Shows your Favorites (see Figure 29-1)

Ô+3: Displays your browsing history

Ô+4: Reveals the Download Manager

Ô+~ (tilde): Cycles through all the open windows
• Figure 29-1: Internet Explorer’s Favorites window.
Favorites
Internet Explorer uses the concept of Favorites (the
equivalent of a bookmark), which allows you to mark
a page and quickly return to it later. Technique 30
discusses bookmarks in greater detail (across all
browsers), but here are a few things that you ought
to know if you use IE as your primary browser:

Pressing Ô+D adds the current page to your list
of Favorites.
Unlike many other browsers, when you add a
page to your IE Favorites, all the action hap-
pens behind the scenes. (That is, you’re not
given a prompt.)

Press Ô+2 to view all your Favorites.
When you’re in the Favorites window

234
• Figure 29-3: The Explorer bar appears on the left side of
the browser window.
Use the Ô+T keyboard shortcut to show/hide
the Explorer bar.
To view any of the tools, click its tab. In the Explorer
bar, you can view the following:

Favorites: Use the IE Explorer bar to easily view,
create, delete, and organize your Favorites
(bookmarks).

History: View a log of the pages you have seen
so that you can quickly revisit a site.

Search: Theoretically you can perform searches
in the Explorer bar, but it’s a buggy feature with
an inclination towards using Microsoft’s search
engines.

Scrapbook: The Scrapbook lets you store images
and static versions of Web pages. To add an
image, drag it from the Web page into the
Scrapbook. To add a Web page, click the Add
button in the Explorer bar window. Click any
item in your Scrapbook to view it again.

Internet Explorer puts several of its most useful fea-
tures in a Sidebar of the browser window called the
Explorer bar (see it in Figure 29-3).

Netscape, Mozilla, and Camino
235

Page Holder: The Page Holder lets you place a
Web page in the Explorer bar, and all its links
open in the main window. This is a good substi-
tute for the tabbed browsing feature that
Explorer lacks (and Safari has).
Other features
Unlike Safari, IE has many preferences that can be
adjusted. Press Ô+; (semicolon) to access the Prefer-
ences panel, as shown in Figure 29-4. Click a menu
item in the left pane to bring up different settings on
the right side of this dialog. A lot of the preferences
are cosmetic — and some are security- or feature-
related — but here are those most useful to the Mac
user interested in productivity.
• Figure 29-4: The Internet Explorer Preferences panel.

Use the Forms AutoFill panel to set your per-
sonal information (such as name, address, and
e-mail address) to be automatically entered in
Web forms.

Under the Advanced section, adjust the History
and Cache policies. A large history lets you
quickly access Web pages without retyping entire
URLs. Visited URLs are automatically completed
as you begin typing them. The Cache dictates
how much of the Web site needs to be down-
loaded with each new viewing. This is particu-
larly useful if you visit the same sites frequently
and are on a slow Internet connection.
Furthermore, here are a couple of other tools worth
looking into:

Under the Tools menu, check out the Track
Auctions feature, which will help your eBay and
similar endeavors. This tool notifies you of the
time remaining, current bid, and so forth of auc-
tions that you’re tracking. Explanations on using
it can be found by clicking Help after you bring
up the Auction Manager window.

The Related Links option is like a mini search
engine that uses the current page as the search
term.

Subscriptions track the content of your favorite
sites, automatically updating them in your Web
browser and notifying you of the update, per
your instructions.
A Rant against Internet Explorer
We would be remiss to discuss Internet Explorer without
giving a quick rant on how it’s been responsible for the
downfall of the Internet. Okay, that’s an overstatement, but
IE has made being a Web developer far more difficult.
Whereas most of the other browsers that we discuss in this
chapter were developed for any platform supporting exist-
ing Web standards, IE chose to go its own way instead. The
consequence is that Web developers had to make Web
sites compatible for two types of users: those with standards-
compliant browsers and those with IE.
Our point: Despite its popularity and decent feature set,
throw your copy of Internet Explorer out the door as an act
of social conscience or civil disobedience. More than enough
good alternatives are available, particularly for use with
Panther. And because Microsoft is phasing out its produc-
tion of IE for the Mac, it’s only going to become more
dated as time passes.
Netscape, Mozilla, and Camino
Netscape is actually one of the grandfathers of the
World Wide Web. Its predecessor, Mosaic, was one of
the very first Web browsers. Netscape sadly ended
up taking a back seat to the IE behemoth and was
then purchased by America Online (AOL). It’s still a
good and reliable browser, though.

Technique 29: Surfing with Other Browsers
236
Camino (which used to be called Chimera) is Mozilla’s
baby brother. It skips the e-mail and developer tools,
leaving only a speedy little browser. This browser is
easy to use and renders Web pages beautifully.
Firebird is a new product and differs from Camino
mainly in that it’s available on all platforms, whereas
Camino is Mac-only.
Commercial Web Browsers
Believe it or not, despite the number of free Web
browsers available, a few commercial (read: not
free) browsers are out there. Each of these has a fea-
ture set that should make it worth paying for, and
they offer a free trial that you can use while you
decide.

OmniWeb (www.omnigroup.com/applications/
omniweb/, $30): OmniWeb is a beautiful Web
browser with many very nice features, such as
 Pop-up blocking
 Ad blocking (blocks ads which appear within
a Web page, like banner ads)
 Ability to search through your browsing 
history
 Built-in Google search
 Voice recognition (you can control the
browser by speaking)
OmniWeb is a great browser for Web develop-
ers because of its many tools. You can control
cookies on a sophisticated level, view HTML
source code in an easy-to-read layout, and edit
HTML in the browser.

Opera (www.opera.com, $40): Opera claims to be
the fastest browser on Earth, partially because of
its small size. It also has
 E-mail tools
 A high degree of Web-standard compliance
Netscape’s main benefit could be the familiarity that
most users have with its interface and features.
(Netscape 4 was very popular on Mac OS 8 and 9.)
But the application does have more to offer than just
comfort, including

Pop-up ad blocking

Tabbed browsing

Ability to perform searches from the address bar

A fully integrated e-mail client

Integration with the AOL Instant Messenger
Mozilla, Firebird, and Camino are all byproducts of
the same source code. The makers (www.mozilla.
org) took the Netscape source code and expanded
upon it. The three have a few differences, but the
most significant is that Mozilla includes e-mail func-
tionality and Web development tools, whereas
Firebird and Camino are standalone Web browsers.
Three of the strengths of these browsers are
their tabbed browsing, the ability to block
pop-up ads, and their leading position in dis-
playing Web content correctly. Plus, Mozilla
and Netscape can handle your e-mail, if you’d
prefer to keep your e-mail and Web browsing
within the same application.
Mozilla has Netscape-like feel to it and therefore isn’t
much of a leap for most users. Further, Mozilla offers

Technique
Managing
Bookmarks Better
S
urfing the Internet would be a much more tedious process if it
weren’t for the advent of bookmarks. Bookmarks (or Favorites, as
they are also called) are a collection of URLs that you can organize
the way you like for easy access. We haven’t discussed bookmarks much
in previous Techniques because they really merit their own discussion,
particularly if you use multiple browsers.
The focus in this chapter is the Safari Web browser, which we recom-
mend you use as your default. We first talk about bookmark management
within Safari, and then we go into sharing bookmarks across multiple
browsers (which is a good thing whether you actively use multiple
browsers or just switched to a different one). Finally, we wrap up with
some tips and techniques for bookmark management that you might
want to employ.
Managing Bookmarks in Safari
Because we assume that you’re using Safari as your primary Web
browser, we cover bookmarks in that application most specifically.
Safari’s bookmarks tools have taken the best qualities from every other
browser and wrapped them into one package. With Safari, you have three
bookmark locations:

The Bookmarks Bar (see Figure 30-1): This is an area intended for
your most frequently used bookmarks because they can appear in
your browser window at all times, making them the easiest to access.
The Bookmarks Bar can display individual URLs (like Apple and
Amazon in Figure 30-1), folders of sites (News and Localhost), and it
also provides a link to the Bookmarks window (the open book icon on
the far left).

The Bookmarks window (see Figure 30-3): The
Bookmarks windows is the least accessible (it
just requires an extra click to access it) but helps
to manage all of your bookmarks. The Bookmarks
window is where you’ll store the majority of
your bookmarks, and it’s also where you can
add, edit, or delete bookmarks that appear in
the Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks menu.

• Figure 30-3: Use the Bookmarks window to manage and

A fourth, related tool is the History menu. This
menu doesn’t contain bookmarks per se but is
rather a history of pages that you’ve visited.
Those URLs you’ve been to appear under the
History menu and within the Bookmarks win-
dow (the third item under Collections in the
left column of Figure 30-3). The History menu
displays the most recent few pages visited, fol-
lowed by other pages grouped by the date on
which you were there.
To add bookmarks, access the Bookmarks window
or Bookmarks Bar, or to create new folders for
organizing your bookmarks (in the Bookmarks win-
dow), you can use the Bookmarks menu (refer to
Figure 30-2) or the following keyboard shortcuts:

An important part of managing your bookmarks
is to place them in the right folder in the first
place. If you’ve adequately organized your book-
marks, you should already have a folder available
to store them in.
You can immediately add a site to your
Bookmarks menu or Bookmarks Bar by choos-
ing the appropriate location from the Add
Bookmark prompt’s pull-down menu (refer to
Figure 30-4). More immediately, you can add
a site to your Bookmarks Bar by dragging the
site’s icon (found just to the left of the URL in
the address bar) onto the Bookmarks Bar.
Using the Bookmarks window
The Bookmarks window is a special browser page
that you can use to view and manage your bookmarks.
The left column (Collections; refer to Figure 30-3)
shows the different groupings of bookmarks that you
have. These include Bookmarks Bar, Bookmarks
Menu, History, the folders that came with Safari, and
the folders that you create. When you select an item
in the Collections column, its contents are listed in
the right side of the window.
Here are some tips and techniques for working with
this window:

Create a new folder by pressing Ô+Shift+N or
clicking the + button at the bottom of the window.
Depending upon which plus sign you click, you
can create a new primary folder (by clicking at
the bottom of the Collections column) or a new
secondary folder (by clicking at the bottom of
the Bookmark column). If you click the +
underneath the Bookmark column, a new
folder will be created within the currently
selected Collection.

Alphabetize your folders by dragging and drop-
ping them to reorder them.

Don’t mess with the folders named Imported 
IE Favorites or Imported Netscape/Mozilla
Favorites! (See the bottom of the Collections
Safari comes with many bookmarks and fold-
ers already grouped into News, Mac, Kids,
Sports, and more. This is important because
creating a folder for each category of Web
page that you want to bookmark helps you
find your bookmarks faster. Some good fold-
ers you might want to add would be Work,
Mac OS X Software, Local Interest, and any
other types of pages that you visit frequently.
Bookmarking a page
To bookmark a page, follow these steps:
1.
Load the page in your Web browser.
2.
Press Ô+D.
This brings up the Add Bookmark prompt, as
shown in Figure 30-4.
• Figure 30-4: Use the Add Bookmark prompt to mark a
page.
3.
If desired, enter a new title for this bookmark.
The default bookmark name comes from the title
of the page as it appears in the browser win-
dow’s title bar. For some pages, this is quite long
or not very descriptive, so you might want to
devise a new name that makes sense to you.
4.
Use the drop-down list to select the location for
the bookmark.

area in Figure 30-3.) Leaving these folders intact
allows you to access bookmarks that you’ve set
in those browsers.

Nest related folders inside each other to main-
tain order without cluttering up the main set of
collections. For example, you might want to cre-
ate a Software folder inside of the Mac folder or
add a Movies folder to Entertainment.

Rename a folder by pressing Return after you’ve
selected it.

If you want to copy a bookmark from one loca-
tion to another (from one folder to another or
from the Bookmarks window to the Bookmarks
Bar), hold down the Option key as you move it.
Using the Bookmarks menu
The Bookmarks menu is a useful tool, but you
should be careful not to place too many bookmarks
there because it can quickly become cluttered
and less useful. The two ways to add sites to the
Bookmarks menu are

Selecting Bookmarks Menu from the pull-down
menu in the Add Bookmark prompt (refer to
Figure 30-4).

Using the Bookmarks window (drag existing
bookmarks into the Bookmarks Menu listing in
the Collections section).
To delete a bookmark from the menu, just do this:
1.
Open the Bookmarks window.
2.
Click Bookmarks Menu in the Collections 
column.
3.
Select the bookmark to be deleted in the right
column.
4.
Press Delete.
While in the Bookmarks window, you can add
folders to the Bookmarks menu in order to cre-
ate an organized, hierarchical menu of favorite
sites. Doing so lets you put more bookmarks in
the menu without too much clutter.
Working with the Bookmarks Bar
The Bookmarks Bar is a special section of the book-
marks world that can appear as part of the browser
window. The Bookmarks Bar has a limited amount of
visual real estate, so you must be judicious in select-
ing Web pages to put there, but you have plenty of
configuration options.
You’re not really limited to a certain number
of bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar, but if the
titles of all the bookmarks run longer than the
width of the browser window, some bookmarks
won’t be shown. Instead, double arrows will
appear at the far right side of the bar and
you’ll need to click them to access the other
bookmarks. This behavior is exactly the same
as it is with Finder window toolbars if the win-
dow is not wide enough to show every tool.
To manage the Bookmarks Bar
1.
Open the Bookmarks window by pressing
Ô+Option+B.
2.
Click Bookmarks Bar at the top of the
Collections column.
3.
In the right pane, delete any bookmark or
folder that you don’t want to appear on the
Bookmarks Bar by pressing Delete.
4.
Add any bookmark by dragging it from another
location into the Bookmarks Bar listing.
5.
If you like, create a new folder by pressing
Ô+Shift+N.
6.
Arrange the bookmarks by clicking and drag-
ging them to suit your preferences.
You can also add pages to the bookmark bar
by dragging the URL directly onto the bar in
the browser window. You can remove items by
dragging them off, and you can rearrange the
order by clicking and dragging the bookmark
names.
One of the best features of the Bookmarks Bar is the
ability to group bookmarks into folders. For example,
Safari already comes with the News folder on its

Technique 30: Managing Bookmarks Better
242
Use bookmark folders to create groups of
related bookmarks. Use the AutoTab feature
to make a collection of related bookmarks to
be opened together (see Figure 30-6).
• Figure 30-6: AutoTab folders open all at once in a
multitabbed browser window.
Setting bookmark preferences in Safari
You can control Safari’s bookmarks somewhat 
by using the Bookmarks preferences panel (see
Figure 30-7), accessed by choosing Safari➪
Preferences and clicking Bookmarks. With it, you 
can decide whether to add Address Book or
Rendezvous bookmarks to any of three places: 
the Bookmarks Bar, the Bookmarks Menu, or the
Collections panel of the Bookmarks window.
• Figure 30-7: Add Address Book and Rendezvous
bookmarks automatically using the
Bookmarks preferences dialog.
If you mark the Include Address Book check box
next to the Bookmarks Bar heading, for example,
Bookmarks Bar, containing CNN, The New York
Times, BBC News, and more. Folders on the
Bookmarks Bar are marked with a downward point-
ing triangle, which displays a pop-up menu of the
bookmarks in that folder when you click it, as shown
in Figure 30-5.
• Figure 30-5: Bookmarks Bar folders are presented as
pop-up menus.
Here’s how to add a folder to your Bookmarks Bar:
1.
Open the Bookmarks window by pressing
Ô+Option+B.
2.
Click Bookmarks Bar at the top of the
Collections column.
3.
Create a new folder by pressing the Ô+Shift+N
keyboard shortcut or by clicking the + sign at
the bottom of the Bookmark column.
4.
Give the new folder a name.
5.
Drag all the bookmarks that you want to add to
the folder.
If you hold down the Option key while drag-
ging a bookmark into a folder, a copy of the
bookmark will be placed there, and the orignal
will remain.
6.
If desired, click the AutoTab box, which will
appear between the Bookmark and Address
columns.
The AutoTab feature means that instead of providing
a drop-down list of bookmarks in the folder, clicking
the folder name in the Bookmarks Bar would auto-
matically open every bookmark at once, using multi-
ple tabs.

Sharing Bookmarks across Browsers
243
Safari loads all the URLs stored in the Address Book
as a folder in your bookmark bar. Each URL is acces-
sible through the person’s name with whom it’s
associated.
You can also tell Safari to include the Bookmarks
Bar in the Bookmarks menu. This is worth-
while only if you don’t already display the
Bookmarks Bar.
Accessing Safari Bookmarks
After you organize and create all your bookmarks,
you want to be able to access them with ease. Here’s
all the information you need to know:

Click a bookmark in the Bookmarks Bar to open it.

Click a folder in the Bookmarks Bar to view the
list of bookmarks in it (and then select from the
options, refer to Figure 30-5).

Ô+click a bookmark in the Bookmarks Bar to
open it in a new tab.

Ô+click a Bookmarks Bar folder to open its con-
tents at once in separate tabs.

Use the Bookmarks menu to access bookmarks
stored there.

Click the open book icon on the far left of the
bookmark bar to access the Bookmarks window.

Choose the Open in Tabs option at the bottom of
the Bookmarks menu (refer to Figure 30-2) to
open every menu bookmark at once (within a
single browser window but in separate tabs).
One of the coolest features of Safari is that it auto-
matically numbers your Bookmarks Bar bookmarks
in order from left to right so they’re accessible via a
keyboard shortcut. For example, in Larry’s Bookmarks
Bar (as shown in Figure 30-8), the Apple bookmark is
launched by pressing Ô+1, My Excite is launched by
pressing Ô+2, and so forth. Folders are skipped in
the numbering sequence so that (again referring to
Figure 30-8) PHP is associated with Ô+6.
• Figure 30-8: The Ô shortcuts for the Bookmarks Bar start
with 1 and are numbered from left to right.
This trick works for all the bookmarks not in folders
and even works if no browser window is open!
Sharing Bookmarks across
Browsers
The biggest downfall to using multiple Web browsers
or switching to a different browser is trying to re-
establish all your bookmarks. Fortunately, some 
of the Web browsers have acknowledged this and
can automatically import bookmarks from other
applications.

Safari automatically imports Internet Explorer
and Netscape/Mozilla bookmarks. (They appear
as folders in the Collections panel of the
Bookmarks window.)

Camino, Mozilla, and Netscape automatically list
Internet Explorer bookmarks.

Opera can import bookmarks from other applica-
tions in certain formats.
If you have only a few bookmarks to move around,
your best bet is to drag and drop them from one
application to the other. Or, you can investigate one
of the many bookmark management applications
available (most of them are not free) if you’re in a
serious bookmark quandary. For example, if you are
moving from another browser to Safari or want to
import someone else’s Safari bookmarks into your
Safari, Safari Enhancer (www.lordofthecows.com,
free) adds an Import Bookmarks option in a Debug
menu that the utility can add to Safari.
In Technique 41, we go over iSync, which is an
Apple tool. One of its features is the ability to
synchronize your Safari bookmarks with your
.Mac account, letting you access all your book-
marks online when you’re away from your
computer. It lets you synchronize Safari book-
marks across multiple computers.

• Figure 30-9: URLs saved on your computer have a
special icon.
After you do this

Open that file to open the Web site in your Web
browser.

Add the file to your Startup Items to automati-
cally load the URL when you log into your com-
puter. (See Technique 2 for more on Startup
Items.)

Add the file to your Favorites (see Technique 15)
or a docked folder (see Technique 11) to keep it
out of the way, yet easily accessible.
One of our favorite shareware applications,
LaunchBar (www.obdev.at/products/launchbar;
free for limited use, $20 for personal use), can be
used to open many things, including your favor-
ite Web pages. As we demonstrate in detail in
Technique 21, LaunchBar lets you perform tasks
by typing a key combination. For starters, you can
use LaunchBar to open or switch to applications,
but LaunchBar will also read through and index
all your bookmarks, making them only a couple
of keys away. To try this, follow the example in
Technique 21 but use a logical keyboard combina-
tion for one of your bookmarks (like CT for Chicago
Tribune).
Transferring Your Bookmarks to 
a New Mac
Different applications can access the bookmarks managed
by other applications because bookmarks are stored as text
files on your computer. Specifically:

Safari uses an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file
stored in ~/Library/Safari/Boomarks.plist.

Camino uses an XML file stored within your
Application Support folder.

Mozilla uses a HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
file stored with the ~/Library/Mozilla directory.

Internet Explorer uses an HTML file stored within the
~/Library/Preferences/Explorer directory.
This system has two benefits for you, the end user. First,
you can easily transfer all your bookmarks from one com-
puter to another just by copying over the appropriate file.
Second, you can manually tweak your bookmarks by edit-
ing these files in any text editor.
Bookmark Tips and Tricks
Finally, we’d like to mention a couple of other cool
bookmark tips.
First, you can make a bookmark as a file on your
computer by dragging the URL from your browser’s
address bar onto the Desktop (or anywhere else).
This will create a special webloc file type, which is
like an alias to that Web site (see an example in
Figure 30-9).

Speedy Searches
with Google
T
he World Wide Web wouldn’t be half as useful as it is if it weren’t
for the search engines that make its content findable. Throughout
the history of the Internet, several search engines have been popu-
lar, but the current reigning champ is Google.
Most search engines help you find what you need, but there’s a lot to be
said for Google in particular. Knowing how to use it and all its options
goes a long way towards improving the speed and accuracy with which
you find stuff. We start this Technique by going through some more
advanced Google navigation tips. Then you discover how Safari and
Google work together nicely. Lastly, this Technique mentions a handful
of different tips that, although not universally useful, are quite handy to
know.
Doing Basic Google Searches
Google is one of those wonderful tools that can be used on a basic or
advanced level. In other words, any Joe Bag-o’-Doughnuts can use it for
everyday purposes, whereas rocket scientists can really tweak the heck
out of it. Basic searches involve typing a few words (or just one) in the
Search box and then clicking the Google Search button. Beyond this,
here are some rules to follow that you might (or might not) be con-
sciously aware of:

The more words you use, the more specific the search will be. 
Too-general searches tend to return an unwieldy number of results.
Google, by default, only returns results that include all the search
words.

Be as specific with your keywords as possible. It’s far, far more likely
that Google will return too many results than too few, so you should be
as specific as you can when you have a good sense of what you’re
looking for.

Technique 31: Speedy Searches with Google
246
• Figure 31-1: The plus sign makes otherwise omitted
words required.

Use a minus sign (–) to rule out a keyword. For
example, if you want to search for apples — the
fruit, and not the computers — you could use
apple –computer –mac as your search terms.
Remember: Do not include a space between the
search term(s) and the minus sign(s).

Place phrases within quotation marks (see
Figure 31-2). Using phrases is a much more exact
way to execute a search. For example, searching
for Larry Ullman turns up about 40,000 search
results, whereas searching for “Larry Ullman”
returns only 6,000.
• Figure 31-2: Quotation marks change search words to
phrases.
If you’re bored one day, search for yourself on
Google. This is called Ego Surfing. Or, if you
want a real challenge, try Googlewhacking —
finding two words which, when searched in
Google, return only one record.
As you might have noticed, Google suggests
alternate search terms if you’ve possibly 
misspelled a word or words.

Order your keywords by importance. The order
of your keywords affects the results of the
search. Enter the most important terms first.
If a particular result is very close to what you
were looking for, click the Similar Pages text at
the end of that record to perform a search on
Google for similar sites.

Skip common words. Google automatically
ignores very common words, such as conjunc-
tions (and), verbs (are, is), or interrogatives
(who, what, why), so you might as well save
Google the trouble and not use them in the first
place.
Google is a case-insensitive search by default.
This means that word, WORD, Word, and
WoRd are all treated the same.
Doing Advanced Google
Searches
After you master the basics, here are some fancier
tools that you should use:

Use OR to make a less restrictive search. Google
normally requires that every keyword be in a
search result, but you can overrule this behavior
by typing OR between each word. Note: OR
should be in uppercase letters, and you’ll want
to add a space after it.

Use a plus sign (+) before a word to indicate
that the word is required (see Figure 31-1).
Although Google will always search for every
word, it skips common terms and numbers. By
using the plus sign before a word (without a
preceding space), you can insist upon its use.

Doing Specialized Google Searches
247

To further limit your searches without relying
upon keywords, check out Google’s directory
feature. The Google directory, which is accessed
via a tab above the search box, breaks the Web
down into a series of categories. To limit search
results, search within a category.

Use the site: restrictions to search a particular
site. The site: keyword restricts a search to a spe-
cific Web address or domain type. For example:
 You can use Google to search Apple’s Web site
by including site:www.apple.com.
 You can limit your searches to schools with
site:edu.
 Search only a particular country realm with
site:ch (ch stands for Switzerland).
To find the domain name abbreviation for a
country (or find what country an abbreviation
represents), head to www.iana.org/cctld/
cctld-whois.htm. There you can find out
that .tv is Tuvalu and the Vatican is .va.
 Check out U.S. government pages with site:gov.
Finally, Google provides an advanced search page
that can be accessed by clicking the Advanced
Search link. This page has a number of other
options, the two best of which are

In the Date drop-down list, restrict the returned
records to a certain date range.

In the Occurrences drop-down list, specify
where in a page the search should run:
 Selecting In The Title dictates that the key-
words must be found in the page’s title.
 Selecting In The Text dictates that the key-
words must be found within the page’s text
(ignoring links and titles).
Doing Specialized Google
Searches
Google’s default search takes place within the Web,
meaning that it looks through Web pages. You can
also have Google search for or through the following:

Images: http://images.google.com

Newsgroup postings: http://groups.
google.com

Mail-order catalogs: http://catalogs.
google.com

News articles: http://news.google.com

Specific technical topics (like BSD, Apple, and
Microsoft): www.google.com/options/special
searches.html

University Web pages: www.google.com/
options/universities.html
Google also has the ability to search for specific file
types. You can request a specific type of file by
adding the filetype:type designation to your search
parameters, where type is the file extension. You can
omit a specific type with –filetype:type.
The types of files that Google can search for are

Google Tips and Tricks
Google is much more than just a search engine. The
fine folks at Google have been continually adding
new widgets and features over the years, expanding
its capabilities. Here are some of our favorites.
Google, the dictionary
You can use Google to look up a word for you.
1.
Open Google in your Web browser.
2.
Type define word or define phrase, replacing
word or phrase with the actual word or phrase
that you want defined.
3.
Click the Google Search button.
If you’re using Safari, you can just type define
word or phrase in the Google Search bar and
then press Return.
4.
You’ll find the definition listed first in the
search results, by the heading Web Definition
(see Figure 31-5).
• Figure 31-5: Google’s definition trick retrieves the
meanings of words for you.
If you use define :word (note the colon),
Google will instead take you to a page of
definitions, without any other search results.
5.
If desired, click the More Definitions link to
see, um, more definitions.
Alternatively, if you do an ordinary search for
a single word and Google can find a definition
for it, this word is underlined in the blue bar
at the top of the Google window (check out
Figure 31-6). Click that word to view its 
definition.
• Figure 31-6: Google automatically finds definitions for
your search terms, if it can.
Google, the mathematician
Did you know that Google can do your math home-
work for you? Okay, maybe not, but it can perform
basic calculations. See Table 31-1 for the operators
and terms that you’ll want to use. (Most of them are
common sense.)

• Figure 31-7: Google will perform calculations for you.
Google’s calculator is very flexible (and maybe
even a little strange). You can enter long num-
bers with or without the commas (indicating
thousands) and returned results use spaces
instead of commas.

Technique
Searching the
Internet with
Other Tools
I
n the previous Technique, we discuss the Google search engine in
detail, covering the best ways to hunt for things online via your Web
browser. But Google isn’t the only answer when it comes to looking
around for stuff. In fact, in some cases, it’s not even the best answer.
In this Technique, you’ll find out about some different applications that
can scour the Internet for you. The two biggies are Sherlock (from Apple)
and Watson (from Karelia Software; www.karelia.com). Each of these is
discussed in some length. We conclude with a couple of search tools that
are useful yet function on a much more specific plane than Sherlock or
Watson.
Searching Swiftly with Sherlock
Sherlock is Apple’s application for finding stuff, and it comes free with
Panther. Sherlock used to be a combination of a Web search tool and a
computer Find tool but is now focused strictly on Internet-based
searches. The version in Panther is a slight variation on the greatly
improved version that debuted with Jaguar.
Some of the benefits of using Sherlock include

Working well with the operating system as a whole
Sherlock uses different channels, each representing a type of search that
you can run. For example, you can look up stocks, movie listings (the
times when movies are playing in theaters near you), eBay auctions, and

word definitions. Through the Sherlock interface
(see Figure 32-1), you can access channels by click-
ing their icons on the toolbar, selecting them from
the Channel menu, or by organizing and using
Collections, which is a concept very similar to
Safari’s bookmark collections.
• Figure 32-1: The basic Sherlock window.
How you use each channel differs — each has its
own interface — but the basic concept is this:
1.
Open Sherlock by double-clicking its icon in
the Applications directory.
2.
Select a channel (for example, Internet).
Select a channel by using the toolbar, the
Channel menu, or the main Channels window
(accessed by clicking Channels in the toolbar).
3.
In the search box, enter your search term or
terms.
Your search terms will depend upon the channel.
It might be a stock’s symbol, a flight number, or a
word. Almost every channel uses some kind of
text box, although some (like Movies and Flights)
rely upon pull-down menus instead.
4.
Press Return or use the pull-down menus 
(if available) to further adjust the search.
A few of the channels also use pull-down menus
(for example, the departure and arrival cities in
Flights). Use these as warranted.
5.
If the search results display in columns, click
them to sort the results.
Some of the channels, like the Internet (see 
Figure 32-2), return a table of results. In these
cases, you can click the column headings to sort
the results, like you would in any Finder window.
• Figure 32-2: The Internet channel’s search results.
Sherlock has a pathetic level of preferences.
The only customizing that you can do in
Sherlock really comes down to tweaking the
toolbar to your tastes. Choose Customize
Toolbar from the View menu and then cus-
tomize it like you would a toolbar in a Finder
window.
You can immediately access the different channels
by using Sherlock’s Dock icon (see Figure 32-3). If
Sherlock is running, it’s much, much faster to access
individual channels by using the Dock icon’s contex-
tual menu.

• Figure 32-4: The Movies channel shows movies, theaters,
and times near you.
4.
Choose an appropriate location for the shortcut
(see Figure 32-5).
You might want to save the shortcut to the
Desktop or your Favorites folder.
• Figure 32-5: Save the shortcut in a logical location where
it’s easy to access.
Click the down arrow next to the Save As
box in order to view the more advanced 
save options. Click the up arrow (refer to
Figure 32-5) to hide the more advanced
options.
• Figure 32-3: Control+click the Sherlock Dock icon to
access the specific channels.
You can create multiple searches by opening multi-
ple Sherlock windows (press Ô+N).
Sherlock employs a feature called Shortcuts that
allow you immediate access to particular channels.
Here’s how you might use it:
1.
Bring up a favorite channel, like Movies 
(as shown in Figure 32-4).
2.
Choose Select Channel➪Make a Shortcut or
press Ô+L.
3.
In the resulting Save As dialog, give the chan-
nel a name.

5.
Click the Make button.
6.
When you want to access that channel, open
the shortcut by using any standard method:
Double-click it, press Ô+O, or whatever.
The shortcut launches Sherlock and selects the
channel if the application isn’t open. If Sherlock
is already running, the shortcut opens the chan-
nel in a new Sherlock window.
Searching with Watson
Watson was Sherlock before Sherlock was Sherlock
(which is our nice way of saying that most of the
best features of Sherlock were, um, inspired by
Watson). Still, Sherlock is at best a watered-down
version of a far superior product. Watson has long
been a favorite of Mac users who find its low cost
($29) to be money well spent. Watson is a product of
Karelia Software (www.karelia.com/watson/).
Despite the cost, the arguments in favor of Watson
over Sherlock are

It has more features.

It’s faster.

It makes developing and accessing additional
tools easier.

It searches Google. (Sherlock does not.)

It gives you the good feeling of knowing that
you’re supporting the people who came up with
the idea in the first place.
The general principle of Watson is that it searches
the Web for specific items or in specific locations
(channels in Sherlock terms). A non-exhaustive list
includes

Recipes

Prices for products

Weather

Movies

TV listings

Currency exchange rates

Stock quotes

ZIP codes
Like Sherlock, how you use each search differs in
Watson — each has its own interface — but the
basic concept is this:
1.
Open Watson by double-clicking its icon in the
Applications directory (after you’ve installed it).
2.
Select a search (for example, Amazon.com).
You can select a search by using the toolbar, the
View menu, or by clicking the Show All button in
the toolbar and then clicking the desired search.
3.
In the search box, enter your search term or
terms.
Your search terms will depend upon the type of
search being executed. The terms might be a
stock’s symbol, a dollar amount (for the currency
exchange), or a tracking number (like for UPS
and FedEx packages). Almost every channel uses
some kind of text box and many also rely upon
pull-down menus.
4.
Press Return or use the pull-down menus 
(if available) to further adjust the search.
Most of Watson’s searches also use pull-down
menus (for example, a search parameter in
Amazon.com). Use these as warranted. You might
also find columns of options to help narrow your
search (see Figure 32-6).

Technique 32: Searching the Internet with Other Tools


On the same tab, enable the When Launching,
Automatically Select the Most Recently Used
Tool check box.
Watson has to launch in some state, so it might
as well be as you left it. For example, if you last
used Watson’s Amazon.com channel, the next
time you open Watson, you’ll see that channel
again. This saves you the time of reselecting a
popular search channel.

Customize the toolbar so that it includes the
features you use, in the order of most common
usage. Just choose Customize Toolbar from the
Window menu to bring up a customization
palette (see Figure 32-8).
• Figure 32-8: Customize Watson’s toolbar with the
channels that you need.

Take the time to read the introductory text for
each tool (see an example in Figure 32-9).

access any search, giving you a guideline to
using it.

tion will help your cause.

In the Preferences page, choose the
Appearance tab and enable the Open 
Web Pages in Background check box 
(see Figure 32-7).
This opens search results in your Web browser
behind the scenes, letting you continue to use
Watson until you’re finished.

scores and news browsers.
Watson has a free two-week demo version available,
which we highly recommend. You’ll be stunned by
how nice this tool is and how easily it works.
Other Search Tools
If you don’t require all the features and overhead of
Sherlock or Watson, a more single-purpose applica-
tion might be better suited to you. These are our
favorites.

Mastering Mail
A
long with surfing the Internet, the ability to send and receive e-mail
might be the most common reason people use computers today.
Sadly, until the Mac operating system turned over the OS X leaf,
there was no such thing as an Apple-made e-mail application. Today’s
Panther user can rest assurred that Apple’s solution — Mail — is not only
available and free, but it’s pretty darn good, too.
We’ve tried to distill the overabundance of information available on Mail
into the most critical bundle, with respect to timesaving techniques.
You’re not going to get much in the way of introductions or basics here
except as they apply to using this application more efficiently. This
Technique begins with some keyboard shortcuts and then goes into the
relevant preferences for our purposes. This is followed by tips on organ-
izing your mailboxes and performing searches within them. Finally, we
tack on some information about signatures (the kind you put at the bot-
tom of an e-mail message, not your John Hancock), and a few other useful
Mail-related tidbits that didn’t fit in elsewhere.
Keyboard Shortcuts
E-mail is overwhelmingly a keyboard-based technology. (Although you
could probably compose an entire e-mail by using just your mouse and
the Character Palette, don’t plan on getting anything else done that day.)
If you memorize the right keyboard shortcuts and figure out how to navi-
gate around the application, you can get away with barely using your
mouse, if at all. Mail has a lot of keyboard shortcuts, most of which are
convoluted, so we’re sticking to the most useful here.
If you can’t recall what the keyboard shortcut is, just peruse through
the menus to remind yourself.

Customizing Mail’s Appearance
and Behavior
We trust that you can probably make your way
through Mail’s preferences panel without too much
handholding. But because you might not yet appreci-
ate the ramifications of some of the options, we’ll
give you a heads-up on a few of them.

Customizing Mail’s Appearance and Behavior
261
The Junk Mail and Rules panels — and their
usage — are discussed in Technique 34.
General preferences
The General panel (as shown in Figure 33-2) is fairly
simple, but here are a couple of things worth 
mentioning:
• Figure 33-2: Mail’s General preferences panel.

Strange as it might seem, you can use the Mail
application to set your default e-mail client to be
something other than Mail. You probably don’t
want to do this, though.

Use the Check for New Mail drop-down list to con-
trol how often Mail checks for new messages.
If you have a persistent (always-on) Internet
connection, have Mail automatically fetch your
new messages, saving you the step. If you use
a dialup connection, disable this and do it
manually when you’re online.
Composing
The Composing panel (see Figure 33-3) sets your
preferences for how Mail should behave when you
write e-mail. Because you’ll be writing messages fre-
quently, it’s a good idea to pay attention to these
options.
• Figure 33-3: Mail’s Composing preferences affect how
you write and reply to e-mail.
In this panel, you can make Mail do the following:

Check spelling as you type: This won’t really
save you time, but it will make you look more
professional, and that’s got to be worth something.
If Mail catches a spelling error, the error is
underlined in red. Control+click the underlined
word to bring up a contextual menu of options
for fixing the boo-boo (see Figure 33-4).

Automatically complete addresses: As you type,
Mail will look up addresses for you by using your
Address Book and/or a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) server, if you have one.
With this method, you only need to type a few
letters and then select the appropriate address.
For more on LDAP servers, read through
Technique 16.

Include selected text (if any) when replying:
Assuming that you have marked the Quote the
Text of the Original Message check box, you can
set up Mail to quote original text in your reply in
one of two ways:

oodles of options.

(see Figure 33-6).
• Figure 33-6: Quickly access the Customize Toolbar
window from a contextual menu.

your reply.
 Selecting a section of text and replying to 
the message quotes just that section in your
reply.
• Figure 33-4: Don’t forget about contextual menus in
Mail! They’re very useful.
Customizing the Mail toolbar
Just like the Finder window toolbars, you can (and
should) customize Mail’s toolbar so that it sports
the features you use most often. To bring up the
customize window (see Figure 33-5), do one of the
following:

Customizing Mail’s Appearance and Behavior
263
The default set gives you an idea of what you want
to accomplish. Basically, by dragging and dropping
icons onto the toolbar, you can

Add items that you use but might not remember
the keyboard shortcut for.

Organize items into similarly themed groups.

Use separators and spaces to divide groups.

Place a search bar on the right.

Use the Show drop-down list to indicate whether
the toolbar should contain the icons, text, or
both.

Control the size of text and icons from the Use
Small Size check box.
Use the Mail toolbar for a while to see what
tools you never use and which ones you keep
going to the menus for, and then adjust your
toolbar accordingly. Of course, you can tweak
the toolbar’s settings at any time.
Using both icons and text in the toolbar pro-
vides you with two visual clues as to what a
button is. The small size setting lets you put
more items in the toolbar.
While we’re discussing the toolbar, we should
remind you of these universal toolbar shortcuts:

Click the oval-shaped white button in the upper-
right corner of the Mail application to show and
hide the toolbar.

Ô+click the oval-shaped white button in the
upper-right corner of the Mail application to
rotate among various versions and sizes of the
toolbar (icons only, text only, plus different sizes
of each).
Customizing the messages window
Another area of the Mail application that you ought
to customize is the message window itself, which is
the area where your messages are listed. From the
View menu (as shown in Figure 33-7), you can dictate
what columns are listed and also adjust the sorting
column.
• Figure 33-7: The View menu lets you customize the
message window layout.
Like with standard Finder windows, you can also
adjust how the columns are sorted by clicking the
column headers. Further, you can rearrange the
columns by clicking and dragging them.
Finally, be certain to use the Organize by Thread
option (available under the View menu or by clicking
the Threads button on the toolbar), particularly if
you use message groups and news lists. If you have
this turned on, Mail automatically sorts incoming
messages by thread (think of a thread as a more for-
mal subject declaration), using the e-mail headers
(see Figure 33-8). Even the heated political discus-
sions you have with your uncle will be kept organ-
ized, as repeated messages on the same topic are
grouped together.

Technique 33: Mastering Mail
264
• Figure 33-8: Threading sorts your messages in an easier-
to-follow manner.
Maintain a neater Inbox by using the
Organize by Thread option (under the View
menu). Multiple e-mails on the same topic will
be listed as one item. Clicking the item shows
all the e-mails that are part of that thread. 
Understanding and Using Mail Headers
An e-mail actually begins with a hidden series of lines called
mail headers, which are used for many purposes, including

Identifying the sender

Identifying the recipient

Indicating the subject line

Marking the time and date when the e-mail was sent

Flagging the message as it’s handled by mail servers
Panther’s Mail — and any other e-mail client — turns most
of these headers into a more user-friendly display, like that
you see in the messages window or in the Preview panel for
a single message. But, you can still get a more techie view-
point of a message, if you’d like.
To show all the headers for a message, use the Ô+Shift+H
shortcut or choose Long Headers from the Message sub-
menu of the View menu. For example, instead of seeing
this:
you would get this:

Organizing Your Mailboxes
265
able to find anything again, you better put it in the
right place. By default, Mail has several mailboxes:

In: Stores incoming messages waiting to be read.

Out: Stores outgoing messages waiting to be
sent.

Drafts: Stores messages that you’re composing.
If you save a message before sending it, a copy is
placed in the Drafts box. This message remains
there until it is sent.

Trash: Holds messages that you’ve deleted. Use
Ô+K to empty the Trash, or you can set the Mail
application to do this automatically.
To set how the Mail application handles the
Trash, open the Preferences panel and then
click Accounts. Select an account from the left
column and then click Special Mailboxes in
the right column. At the bottom of the result-
ing page, you dictate how Mail handles
deleted messages for that one account.

Junk: Holds e-mail marked as junk. (See
Technique 34 for more on how to use Mail to
snuff out spam.)

On My Mac: Where you should store messages
that you want to save. Think of this as the equiv-
alent of your Home directory.

Mac: Shows only if you have a .Mac account. You
really don’t need to concern yourself with this
one too much.
Most of these boxes are subdivided for your multiple
accounts (see Figure 33-9). If you want to view all the
messages for all the accounts at once, click the main
box icon. If you want to view only all the new or sent
or trashed messages for a particular account, click
the appropriate subfolder.
Similarly, you can have Mail display a message as the raw
source, invoked by using the Raw Source option under the
Message submenu of the View menu or with the
Ô+Option+U keyboard shortcut. The raw source of this
same e-mail looks like this:
The raw source view helps you look at messages written in
HTML that aren’t displaying properly. You can also weed
out spam by checking out either the raw source or the long
headers. In this example, the message has an @aol.com
return address, although it was never sent through an AOL
mail server (which means that the address was faked).
Organizing Your Mailboxes
Organizing your mailboxes is as important to effi-
ciently handling your e-mail as organizing your Home
directory is to handling your stuff. If you want to be

All your mailboxes appear in the Mail drawer, which
is a panel that resides on either the left or right side
of the main viewer window. But there’s more to the
Mail drawer than just a collection of mailboxes. Here
are some tips for working with the Mail drawer:

Click the Actions icon at the bottom of the win-
dow (it looks like a cog; see the bottom-left of
Figure 33-10) to access common tools.
• Figure 33-10: The Actions menu lets you create new
folders, delete e-mail, and more.

From the Actions menu that appears, choose the
Use Small Mailbox Icons option so that the mail-
box takes up less room.

The Mail drawer automatically appears on the
side of the application with the most room on
the screen.
• Figure 33-9: Click the arrow to access a box’s subfolders.
Before you get too heavily invested into Mail, add
new folders to the On My Mac box so that you can
store and organize the messages you keep. For
example, Larry uses mailboxes for

Books: Has subfolders for each book

Clients: Has subfolders for each client and sub-
folders within those for multiple projects

Personal: Has subfolders for receipts, registra-
tion e-mails, and so forth

Other Work Related: Has subfolders for things
that are work related but don’t fall under the
Books or Clients categories
Creating and maintaining a good organization
scheme with your mailboxes makes finding
messages — particularly using searches —
much, much faster.

Performing Searches
267

Use Ô+Shift+M to show and hide the Mail
drawer.

You can manually back up any single mailbox or
folder by dragging its icon from the Mail drawer
into the Finder.
Performing Searches
Inevitably, you’re going to need to hunt down that
message your boss sent you two weeks ago (in
which he changed the project) or the one from your
mother (in which she reminded you of her birthday).
Fortunately for you, Mail has a sweet little search
engine built into the application. Here’s the easiest
way to use it:
1.
Do not begin by typing anything in the Search
window box!
As soon as you enter text into the Search box,
Mail begins searching. This only slows down
the process. Set all your search parameters
first and then enter your search terms.
2.
Use the Mail drawer to select a specific mailbox
or subfolder to search.
If you’re looking for an e-mail that you sent,
begin with the Sent mailbox. If the message was
sent from a particular address, select that sub-
folder instead. If you expect that you would have
stored the e-mail in the Jobagadonuts folder
under Clients, select that. When you do this, all
the messages in that box or folder appear in the
messages window. You can also Ô+click to select
multiple mailboxes. 
3.
Click the magnifying glass icon and select an
area of your e-mail to search (see Figure 33-11).
• Figure 33-11: The Search box pull-down menu lets you
choose the scope of the search.
Your search term can be applied to
 The entire message
 The From address
 The To address
 The Subject name
You should try to be as specific as possible and
select the proper option here first.
The search pull-down menu has two halves:
The top half applies the search to the currently
selected mailbox, and the bottom half applies
it to every mailbox. First run the search on the
selected mailbox. If that doesn’t turn up the
message that you seek, change the pull-down
menu to apply to every mailbox. You can also
Ô+click to select multiple mailboxes, in which
case the top half of options apply to selected
mailboxes.

If you still didn’t find the right message, change
the scope of the search or the search terms and
try again.
Creating and Using Signatures
Signatures, in e-mail terms, are those footers that
appear at the bottom of people’s e-mail addresses
(Figure 33-12). They are used to add contact informa-
tion, links to Web sites, or disclaimers (in company
e-mails). Here’s how you can create and use signa-
tures in Mail:
• Figure 33-12: A basic e-mail signature.
1.
Open Mail’s preferences panel.
2.
Click the Signatures icon (see Figure 33-13).

The Best Mail Tips and Tricks
269
 Begin your signature with two dashes and a
space (- - ) on the first line, which helps mail
readers understand that your signature is
beginning.
 Signatures should be plain text.
 Restrict yourself to four to seven lines.
 Avoid long lines (more than 80 characters).
 Resist the urge to create elaborate graphics
using spaces and keys.
7.
Click OK when you’re finished.
You return to the Signatures preferences panel.
8.
In the Signatures panel, use the Automatically
Insert Signature pull-down menu to decide
which, if any, signature should automatically
be used (see Figure 33-15).
• Figure 33-15: Mail automatically adds signatures to new
messages if you want.

Alternatively, mark the Show Signature Menu
on Compose Window check box.
If you do, you’ll be given a pull-down menu of
signatures to add to an e-mail when writing one
(see Figure 33-16).
• Figure 33-16: You can add signatures to messages from
this pull-down menu.
The Best Mail Tips and Tricks
We conclude this chapter with a quick discussion
and demonstration of some of the best Mail-related
tips and tricks.
Using the Dock icon
The Mail’s Dock icon is your friend. Not only will it
indicate how many new messages you have, but you
can also use it to perform, or at least start, common
tasks. After you Control+click the Mail icon to bring
up its contextual menu (see Figure 33-17), you can

Sending attachments
You have a choice of many ways to add attachments
to an e-mail:

Press Ô+Option+A to bring up the Open dialog
(while composing an e-mail).

Choose Attach File from the File menu.

Click the Attach button in the message toolbar.
If your message doesn’t have an Attach 
button, customize the message toolbar 
(see “Customizing Mail’s Appearance and
Behavior,” earlier in this chapter).

Drag and drop a file from the Finder or other
application onto the message.

Drag and drop a file from the Finder onto the
Mail’s Dock icon, which creates a new message
with the file already attached to it.
For a cool technique on dragging and drop-
ping by using Exposé, check out Technique 13.
When sending attachments, you ought to seriously
consider compressing anything that you send. This
both cuts down on the size of the file and makes it
easier for the receiver to distinguish between the
message and the attachment. (Some attachments
will be displayed inline in the message itself rather
than as an icon that the recipient has to click to
open.) The easiest way to compress any file or folder
is to select it in the Finder and choose Create
Archive from the File menu.
• Figure 33-17: The contextual menu for the Mail icon in
the Dock is a wonderful timesaver.

Retrieve new messages.

Create a new e-mail. (You’ll be taken to the Mail
application, where a new message has been 
created for you.)

Choose what document to view (for example, the
Viewer window or an open e-mail).
The number of new messages in your Inbox
also appears as part of the Mail icon in the
application switcher palette.

Stopping Spam 
in Its Tracks
S
pam is nothing short of a pox on the world of the Internet and
e-mail. Unwanted and unsolicited e-mail is slowing down networks,
costing businesses billions of dollars, and cluttering up mailboxes.
Okay, maybe it is or isn’t all of that, but it is a pain and a fact of e-mail
life. Despite the overwhelming permeance of this plague, you can take
steps to fight this time-waster. In this Technique, we put forth two
approaches to spam: handling it after you receive it in your mail applica-
tion, and how to avoid getting it in the first place.
The first two sections of this Technique focus on Apple’s Mail program
specifically. The concluding section discusses software, techniques, and
steps that you can take to take a bite out of the amount of spam that you
receive. These ideas will be useful regardless of what application you use
for e-mail.
Fighting Spam with the Junk Mail Button
One of Mail’s strongest suits is its ability to identify and filter out spam.
We cannot think of a single reason why you wouldn’t want to use this fea-
ture. It’s a breeze to get going and, over time, teaches itself how to be
more accurate at guessing which messages are spam.
1.
Open the Mail preferences panel.
You can do this by choosing Preferences under the Mail menu or by
pressing Ô+, (comma).
2.
Click the Junk Mail icon (see Figure 34-1).
3.
Make sure that the Enable Junk Mail Filtering check box is marked.
This check box should be enabled in new installations of Panther, and
you’ll want to keep it that way.
Junk Mail filtering is enabled by default in Panther. That’s a good
thing, and you shouldn’t mess with it.

• Figure 34-2: The Junk mailbox is expressly for
temporarily storing spam.
6.
Mark the check box next to Sender of Message
Is in My Previous Recipients to exempt these
messages from filtering.
Spam is often sent using different permutations
on an e-mail address; therefore, you aren’t likely
to get spam from the same address twice.
Enabling this option helps to avoid false posi-
tives (incorrectly identifying mail as spam).
7.
Mark the check box next to Trust Junk Mail
Headers Set by Your Internet Service Provider.
Many ISPs use their own software to filter spam.
Some providers automatically block those from
ever reaching you. Others send the messages
anyway but mark them as spam. In those cases,
you want Mail to trust the preliminary spam des-
ignation. In the worst case, you’ll just need to
fish non-spam messages out of the Junk mailbox
later.
• Figure 34-1: Use the Junk Mail panel to adjust spam
settings.
4.
Make sure that the Leave It in My Inbox option
is selected.
You’ll want to use the training mode for about a
month or so (depending upon how much e-mail
and junk you receive).
After about a month of usage, open the Junk
Mail preferences and select the Move It to the
Junk Mailbox (Automatic) radio button under
When Junk Mail Arrives. By having the Junk
Mail filter move it to the Junk mailbox (as
shown in Figure 34-2), you won’t have to look
at it anymore, but you still have an opportu-
nity to review the message later.
5.
Mark the check box next to Sender of Message
Is in My Address Book to exempt these senders’
messages from filtering.
Presumably people in your Address Book will not
be sending you spam, so these messages shouldn’t
be filtered. They might end up unintentionally
sending you viruses (particularly if your friends
run Windows), but those can be dealt with by
using the Rules feature, which we discuss in the
upcoming section, “Creating and Using Rules.”

Creating and Using Rules
273
8.
Close the Junk Mail preferences panel.
9.
If spam still slips through the cracks, select the
message and click the Junk icon (see Figure 34-3)
on the toolbar to let Mail know that the mes-
sage is spam.
Although Mail’s spam filter does a really good
job, sometimes it needs a little help.
• Figure 34-3: Use the Junk icon to manually mark a
message as spam.
Use the Junk icon to help Mail learn what you
think qualifies as spam. During the training
mode, this button will be your greatest ally. If
you just delete spam, Mail will never improve
upon its filtering skills. As you continue to indi-
cate what you think is spam, Mail becomes
more and more efficient at catching it first.
If you don’t have a Junk button in your tool-
bar, customize the toolbar by using the steps
that we outline in Technique 33. 
Read the section “Bouncing spam” to see what to do
with all your spam now stored in the Junk mailbox.
What, Exactly, Is Spam?
In case you were curious, spam is unsolicited junk e-mail
sent to huge numbers of people at once. The content of
these messages normally revolves around

Get-rich-quick schemes

Physical enhancement products

Sexually explicit content

Trendy products or ideas
Businesses might send out spam-like messages as well, but
these don’t qualify as spam if they fit both of these criteria:

Users are given the option of opting out of receiving
the messages.

The messages advertise actual products or services.
Generally, such messages also tend to come from a com-
pany with which you’ve had previous interactions.
If an e-mail is spam, you need to fight it by using the meth-
ods that we outline in this chapter. If it’s an advertisement
from a business that seems trustworthy, simply following
their opt-out instructions should stop the messages from
coming.
Creating and Using Rules
The Junk Mail filter does an admirable job identify-
ing spam, but it’s not perfect. Fortunately, it’s not the
only tool that you have in your arsenal. Mail also
includes the Rules feature. To use it, you establish
certain criteria (for example, if the subject contains
certain words) and then decide what Mail should do
when messages meet criteria (such as move the
e-mail to a specific folder or highlight it in a particu-
lar color). Using Rules is like having a really great
personal assistant go through your inbox before you
start looking at the messages. Here are just a few
uses of Rules:

Color-code e-mail based upon what e-mail
address it’s coming from

Have a particular sound play when you get an
e-mail from a specific person

Automatically mark some e-mail as read

Color-code e-mail based upon its subject

Move specific messages into a folder
Don’t be confused: Rules are not specifically
tied to handling or filtering spam. You can,
and most likely will, use Rules to manage
legitimate e-mail. We’re discussing Rules here
because the feature is very similar to the Junk
Mail filter (which is actually a complex type of
Rule).

Technique 34: Stopping Spam in Its Tracks
274
• Figure 34-5: Add as many criteria as you want to a Rule.
7.
For the second criterion, set the parameters to
check whether the subject contains Your
Application.
The SoBig virus sent out e-mails titled That
Movie, Your Application, Thank You, and so
forth. For this Rule, Larry set up multiple criteria
so that if the subject of an e-mail contains any of
these phrases, it’s picked up by his Rule.
8.
Add more criteria, if desired.
9.
Under Perform the Following Actions, select
Move Message from the first drop-down list and
Trash from the second to move the message to
the Trash (see Figure 34-6).
• Figure 34-6: The last step when creating a Rule is to
indicate what to do when the criteria are met.
10.
Click OK to create the Rule.
Another example is to create a Rule to handle partic-
ular types of spam. For example, when the latest
Windows virus hits, Larry might get a couple hun-
dred of e-mails (because his address is on comput-
ers around the world). When he sees a wave of
messages entitled Wicked Screensaver or Your
Application, within a matter of minutes, he can set
Mail to start trashing these. Here’s how:
1.
Bring up the Mail preferences panel.
2.
Click the Rules icon (see Figure 34-4).
• Figure 34-4: Use the Rules panel to create and manage
Rules.
3.
In the Rules dialog that appears, click the Add
Rule button.
4.
In the dialog that appears, type the Rule’s name
in the Description text box.
Give your Rule a descriptive name, indicating
what it does or what it applies to (an e-mail
address, a particular virus, a certain subject).
5.
For the first criterion, select Any from the first
drop-down list box, Subject from the second,
and Contains from the third. Type that movie
in the text box, as shown in Figure 34-5.
Rules are case-insensitive by default.
6.
Click the plus sign after the first criterion to
add another criterion.

Stopping Spam before It Gets to You
275
Stopping Spam before 
It Gets to You
The bulk of this Technique revolves around dealing
with spam after it hits your mailbox (acknowledging
that “spam happens”). But a more critical — and
difficult — task is cutting down on the amount of
spam that you receive. The quickest way to stop
spam is to not have an e-mail address, but that’s a
drastic step that most people aren’t willing to take
these days. Here is some more practical advice:

Don’t use an AOL, Yahoo!, MSN, or Hotmail
e-mail account. The big providers of e-mail serv-
ice (commercial or free) are major targets for
spammers. These users are frequently hit not
because their address got put on a list but sim-
ply because spammers use every combination of
names and popular domains — for example,
@aol.com — that their spam software can come
up with.

Watch what you sign up for online. Most regis-
tration forms require your e-mail address and
then assume you want to receive e-mail from
that business. Although this isn’t spam, techni-
cally, it’s often e-mail that you don’t want. Look
for opt-out boxes during registrations.

Never respond to the spam that you receive.
This just lets spammers know that they’ve hit on
an active e-mail address.
Absolutely, positively do not follow the Click
Here to Unsubscribe or Reply to Unsubscribe
suggestions included in spam. These steps
only confirm for the spammer that they had a
valid e-mail address. The likely result? You’ll
get even more spam!

Try to keep your e-mail address off the Internet.
A large majority of spammed addresses come
from spiders that scour the Internet looking for
someone@address.com text. These are normally
found on contact pages of Web sites or in public
message boards.

Use separate e-mail addresses. A smart move is
to have one e-mail address for your friends and
family, which is used (hmmm) only for your
friends and family. Create a second e-mail address
for work or school. Then, create a separate e-mail
address that is only used for riskier behavior
(like posting messages online). When this address
becomes overrun with spam, delete it and create
a new one.
One of Mail’s best features is its ability to eas-
ily manage multiple e-mail accounts. Using
temporary e-mail accounts in the war against
spam is far less of an inconvenience than you
might think it is.

Pay attention to the law. The United States gov-
ernment and many states are working hard to cut
down on spam. The FTC also tracks spam, and
some states are starting to sue spammers. Pay
attention to what laws have been passed and
what recommendations these government agen-
cies have.
Bouncing spam
Recent studies have suggested that far and away the
most effective method of stopping spam is to indi-
cate that e-mail address wasn’t valid. You can do this
by bouncing the e-mail back to the sender. When you
bounce a message, it indicates to the sender (or the
sender’s computer) that the e-mail address doesn’t
exist. With any luck, this might get you off the
offender’s list. Here’s how Larry handles this:
1.
Click the Junk mailbox to view its contents.
Over the course of the day, Larry’s Junk mailbox
gets filled up with the messages that either Mail
thought was junk or that he manually marked as
junk.
2.
Press Ô+A to select every message.
3.
Looking at the Subject names and From
addresses, Ô+click any messages that might not
be spam (see Figure 34-7) to deselect them.

Technique 34: Stopping Spam in Its Tracks
276
7.
Review the remaining messages (which you
marked as not junk in Step 3) and click the Not
Junk button (see Figure 34-9) to tell Mail that a
message wasn’t spam.
• Figure 34-9: If Mail wrongly marks a messsage as junk,
you’ll see a Not Junk button to undo that
flag.
The Not Junk button is just as important as
the Junk button in teaching Mail how to iden-
tify bad e-mail.
There’s a good chance that a percentage of the
bounced messages will be returned to you with a
Mail Undeliverable (or similar) message. This just
indicates that the original sender’s e-mail address
was bogus, and you can delete the undelivered mes-
sage. Or, you can make a Rule to automatically send
undelivered mail to the Trash.
Other spam tools
You can use many other applications to combat
spam. Here are five popular choices:

SpamSieve (www.c-command.com/spamsieve/
index.shtml, $20) is a very solid piece of soft-
ware that adds junk mail filtering capability to
other e-mail applications (like Mail, Eudora,
Mailsmith, and Entourage).
• Figure 34-7: Select all the Junk messages and then
deselect those that might not be spam.
You or the Junk filter might have erred in mark-
ing a message. In those cases, you don’t want to
bounce the message.
4.
Double-check to make sure that all the high-
lighted messages are spam.
5.
Click the Bounce icon on the toolbar or press
Ô+Shift+B.
6.
Click OK at the prompt (see Figure 34-8).
• Figure 34-8: Mail confirms that you want to bounce these
messages.
After you bounce an e-mail, it’s moved from the
Junk mailbox into the Trash. When you empty
the Trash, bounced e-mails are also be deleted.

Stopping Spam before It Gets to You
277

Spamfire Pro (www.matterform.com, $40) 
filters all your mail before it gets to your e-mail
application.

SpamCop (www.spamcop.net) provides you with
spam-filtered e-mail for $30 per year and has
tools to set up spam filtering software for entire
companies.

Mailblocks (www.mailblocks.com, $10) routes all
of your existing e-mail addresses through a new
Mailblocks address, filtering out the spam in the
process. It works with most major e-mail applica-
tions, including Mail, and is ridiculously cheap.

SpamSlam (www.ilesa.com, $25) is slightly differ-
ent from other applications in that it uses two of
the best spam-stopping techniques: namely, fil-
tering spam based upon content (which is what
Mail does) and requesting confirmation of
e-mails from senders not in your Address Book.

Innovative iChat
i
Chat is Apple’s answer to America Online’s Instant Messenger (AIM)
application. The application works by using your .Mac account or an
AIM account, if you have one. You can use it to communicate with
other iChat users or AIM denizens.
In this Technique, we assume that you understand the fundamentals of
using iChat, so we focus instead on some of the little extras that make
using the application more productive. We begin with the keyboard and
mouse shortcuts that you should be using, and then we go through some
of the customizing techniques that you might not be aware of. Finally, we
go through a few specific tips for common tasks and then mention some
of the iChat alternatives.
Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts
To be honest, there aren’t a lot of shortcuts to be used within iChat. The
principle is very basic: Type some text, and press Return. But still, you
ought to be aware of the following shortcuts:

Option+Return: Creates a carriage return
By default, pressing the Return key sends the typed text within an
Instant Message (IM) window. Therefore, to insert a return into a
message (so that text goes onto the next line), use Option+Return.

Ô+L: Logs you out

Ô+N: Creates a new, private chat room

Ô+K: Creates a hyperlink

Ô+1: Brings up your Buddy List window (see Figure 35-1)

Ô+2: Brings up the Rendezvous window

Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts
279
• Figure 35-1: Larry’s Buddy List (while logged into his
.Mac account) shows that his buddy Larry
(using an AIM account) is logged in.
Rendezvous is Apple’s technology that
instantly recognizes other computers, hard-
ware, and users on your network. iChat’s
Rendezvous window shows other AIM and
.Mac users who are currently online and on
the same network as you.

Ô+I: Gets the info of a user selected in the
Buddy List
The Get Info panel for a particular user
serves two purposes. First, it displays some 
of that person’s Address Book information
(see Figure 35-2). Second, you can use it to
associate specific actions with this user (see
Figure 35-3). For example, you can configure
a user’s Info setting so that a specific sound 
is played when that person comes online or
sends you a message.

With the mouse — iChat is admittedly not a mouse-
driven application — the most important pointers
are these three:

Click a person’s name in your Buddy List to
select her.

Double-click a person’s name in the Buddy List
to send him an instant message (IM).

application without making it active.
iChat’s Menu Bar tool (enabled in iChat’s
General preferences) lets you set your status
and see who’s online without opening iChat.
You can instant-message a buddy by selecting
his name from the menu bar list, at which
point iChat will open for you. iChat will also
launch itself if someone sends you an IM.

Add a new icon to represent you during chat ses-
sions by dragging it onto your icon in the Buddy
List window.

Click your icon in the Buddy List window to be
given a choice of different icons that you’ve used
(as shown in Figure 35-5).

Have iChat use sounds to let you know when cer-
tain people come online or send you messages.

Have iChat check your spelling while you type
(hint: to make you look smarter than you are!).

Customize your status to make it more specific
and useful.

Customizing iChat
Rather than go through all the preferences settings —
which you can do very well on your own — we’re
going to concentrate on some of the most important
and interesting customizing options. All these fall
under the useful or cool categories with respect to
iChat.

Use Rendezvous to help iChat automatically rec-
ognize people on your local network (see
detailed instructions in Technique 38).

(choose iChat➪Preferences➪General) to control
iChat without opening the application (see
Figure 35-4).

Customizing iChat
281
• Figure 35-5: Choose your icon from the list of icons
you’ve used in the past.
iChat comes with the default status options of
Available and Away, but you shouldn’t have to
restrict yourself to those. Follow these steps to
create a custom status:
1.
Click the status text below your name.
2.
In the pop-up menu that appears (see Figure
35-6), select Custom from either the Available
or Away sections.
3.
In the resulting text box, enter your new status
label.
4.
Press Return to make this status active (see
Figure 35-7).
Larry has created a Taking a Nap status for this
example.
• Figure 35-6: Use the status pull-down menu to indicate
your availability.
• Figure 35-7: Larry’s new status takes effect immediately.
Alternatively, you can use the Edit Status
Menu option (refer to Figure 35-6) to create
and manage multiple status options at once
(see Figure 35-8). Select a message and click
the minus sign below it to delete it. Click the
appropriate plus sign to add a message.
Double-click a message to edit it. Press Return
(or click OK) when you are finished.

282
3.
Browse for the file that you want to attach.
4.
Drag the file from the Finder onto the IM win-
dow in iChat.
Drag the image into the text box area (where
you type) — not the main window itself.
If the file is already open (like a Word docu-
ment in Microsoft Word), you can attach the
file by dragging its proxy icon (the icon of the
file which appears in the title bar next to the
file’s name) onto the IM window. You can also
use the Exposé or the Ô+Tab drag-and-drop
techniques, discussed in Techniques 13 and 8,
respectively.
5.
Add some text (if desired) and press Return to
send the file.
Depending upon what client the other user has,
you will normally have to wait a bit while iChat
requests approval from the receiver. Then the
file appears in the main window of the Instant
Message, along with its name (see Figure 35-9
for the sender’s IM window).
• Figure 35-9: The file appears with its icon in your iChat.
Here’s some other stuff that you should know about
sending files in iChat:

You can send files to people running iChat 
or AIM.

The File feature, in conjunction with Rendezvous,
makes for a great way to send files to other peo-
ple on your network (for example, co-workers).
• Figure 35-8: The Edit Status menu is a fast way to add or
remove multiple statuses.
Logging iChat Sessions
If you want to remember an idea that someone gave you, a
URL that someone mentioned, or are just looking for proof
of something someone once said, you can save your
Instant Message session. To do so, while in an IM session,
choose Save from the File menu or press Ô+S. You’ll be
given a prompt so that you can save the file on your com-
puter. (By default, the filename will be Instant Message
with Username.)
Because of the unique format of an iChat sesssion, you
can’t just open it in any old text editor. To view the iChat
logs, you need to open them in iChat. (This will happen
automatically if you double-click the saved file.) Or, you can
use Logorrhea (http://spiny.com/logorrhea, free), an
application that can parse iChat logs and that provides
some other nice tools for searching through them.
Transferring Files with iChat
Did you know that you can use iChat as a quick and
easy way to transfer files? You can, and it’s remark-
ably simple:
1.
Begin an Instant Message with a user.
2.
Switch to the Finder.
Press Ô+Tab, click the Finder Dock icon, or click
the Desktop itself to switch from iChat to the
Finder.

Using the Videoconference
283

If you send images in iChat, they’ll appear in the
IM window, as shown in Figure 35-10. If you resize
the IM window, the image will also be resized.
• Figure 35-10: Images can be included inline (in the
message) during an Instant Message.
Using the Videoconference
The latest version of iChat is technically called iChat
AV because of its audio/visual capabilities. With it,
you can videoconference or audioconference with
other iChat users. (It’s like Buck Rodgers come to
life!) Besides being really, really cool, this means
that you can have free, long distance phone calls —
while playing solitaire — or, if you’re writing a book,
videoconference with your coauthor in Switzerland,
hypothetically.
To use iChat AV’s videoconferencing feature, you’ll
need

A FireWire video camera (like Apple’s iSight)

At least a 600 MHz G3 processor or better

A high-speed Internet connection
If you don’t meet the above requirements and
really want to give videoconferencing a whirl,
check out iChatUSBCam (www.ecamm.com/
mac/ichatusbcam, $10). It makes iChat work
with many USB cameras (which are much
cheaper than FireWire ones) and lowers the
processor requirements.
If you only want to use the audio aspect, the require-
ments are more lax:

A USB or built-in microphone

A 56 Kbps dialup connection or better
iChat AV makes it very easy to set up an audioconfer-
ence or videoconference. To use it, do the following:
1.
Connect a supported camera, if you have one.
Apple created the iSight ($149) specifically for
this task, but any FireWire camera should work.
2.
Open iChat.
3.
Under iChat’s Audio menu, make sure that
Camera Enabled and Microphone Enabled are
marked (see Figure 35-11).
• Figure 35-11: Turn on AV features at the bottom of the
Audio menu.


You can resize the video image or make it full-
screen, but this slows down the performance of
your computer.
If you connect a video camera to your com-
puter for videoconferencing, it can also be
used to take a snapshot of you. This snapshot
can be used as your representative icon in the
operating system and certain applications. See
Technique 16 to read how this is done in the
Address Book.
4.
Select someone to conference with from your
Buddy or Rendezvous List.
Other iChat users have one of two icons (which
appears next to their iChat icon in the Buddy or
Rendezvous List) indicating their capability for
audio or video chatting:
 A green telephone indicates that they’re
ready for audio.
 A green camera indicates that they’re ready
for video.
iChat indicates audio and video capability in
the Buddy List via camera and telephone icons.
A grayed-out camera icon indicates the user is
currently videoconferencing with someone else.
5.
Begin an audio- or videoconference by clicking
the green symbol next to the person’s name.
The user gets an invitation to join you for a con-
ference, which he can either accept or decline.
While the call is being set up, you will see your
own image so that you can adjust the camera
framing.
If you have a camera and/or microphone but
your partner does not, you can still start a one-
way video- or audioconference. The person on
the other end of the conference will see and/
or hear you, and you will both be able to use
the regular text Chat feature. To use this, select
the other person in the Buddy List, and choose
Invite to One-Way Video/Audio Chat, either
from the contextual menu of the Buddy List
entry or from the Buddies menu.
Here are some things to keep in mind when using the
AV features:

In the Video preferences panel (see Figure 35-12),
lower the Bandwidth Limit for video to 500 Kbps
to improve the audio quality.

Creating URLs
As you probably know, iChat automatically turns any
typed or pasted URL into an active Web link. When it
does so, it displays the URL text as the link name by
default (see Figure 35-13). But you can create URLs
with a specific name if you want.
• Figure 35-13: URLs are automatically linked in Instant
Messages.
In order for iChat to automatically process
URLs, they must include the initial http://,
https://, ftp://, and so forth. Just using
www.sitename.com will not work.
1.
In the iChat Instant Message window, type
some text that you want to be the name of the
link.
2.
Select the text.
3.
Press Ô+K.
4.
In the resulting prompt, type the URL for the
link (see Figure 35-14).
5.
Press Return or click OK.
Dragging a site’s proxy icon (the icon which
appears next to the URL in the location bar)
from the Safari browser into iChat creates a
link for that Web site using its name.
• Figure 35-14: Use the Ô+K shortcut to make a named
link.
Chatting with Multiple People
at Once
As the final step in trying to convince you that iChat
is a solid business application (as well as a way to
catch up with your Aunt Karen), we show you how
to chat with a whole group of people at once. Think
of it as a meeting for telecommuters.
1.
Select the first chat participant from your
Buddy List.
2.
Choose Invite to Chat from the Buddies menu.
The first person will be given the option of join-
ing the chat; if he or she agrees, a chat window
appears.
3.
Drag other members of your Buddy List into
the Participants drawer.
Drag and drop other buddies into the chat win-
dow’s Participants section in order to add them
to the chat.
Now everybody can chat at once, each seeing what
the other is saying!

Adium (www.adiumx.com) is a bare-bones alter-
native to AOL’s Instant Messenger. It only sup-
ports AIM but does so without banner ads and
the other shiny baubles in the AIM application.

Fire (http://fire.sourceforge.net) is our per-
sonal favorite and a great second IM client to
use. It supports AIM (but not .Mac), ICQ, MSN,
Yahoo! Messenger, and even IRC (Internet Relay
Chat).

Proteus (www.indigofield.com, donation
requested) is like Fire in that it supports AIM,
ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger, and IRC. Proteus is
very customizable, works well with the Address
Book, and has a lovely interface.

Yahoo! Messenger
(http://messenger.yahoo.com) only supports
the Yahoo! format but allows videoconferencing
with other Yahoo! Messenger users. You can even
videoconference across platforms (Mac to
Windows).
You can also begin a chat or Instant Message
from other Apple applications, specifically Mail
and Address Book. Each of these can be set to
indicate when a person is available in iChat. If
they are available, each application has an
option for instant-messaging them or inviting
them to chat.
Other Instant Messenger Tools
Just because iChat is free and ties in nicely to the
rest of the operating system doesn’t mean you have
to use it. Or, for that matter, that doesn’t mean it has
to be your only IM client. The main reasons to use a
different IM application are to have one with fewer fea-
tures (if iChat is too much for you) or to use one that
manages multiple IM accounts at once. Here are a
few other options, each free and with its own benefits:

America Online’s Instant Messenger (www.aim.
com) has been fully replaced by iChat but is still
available. It only works with AIM accounts but
has lots of bells and whistles like stock and news
tickers.

Part VI
Optimizing Your
Network


36
Getting Your Mac
Online
P
retty much every computer is connected to a network of some kind
or another, whether this network is a home setup, at the office, or
just logging onto the Internet with your modem.
In this Technique, we discuss some of the tricks to get your Mac online.
We cover everything that you need to know to quickly create new loca-
tions, and then we go through modem settings. Finally, we cover some
tips and tricks for people who frequently switch locations (in other
words, move their Mac).
Defining a Location
To connect your Mac to any network, including the Internet, you need 
to define a location. Locations allow you to define your network settings
based upon where your computer is physically located and then save all
those settings. If you have only one computer that never travels (a desk-
top machine), you need to define and use only one location. If you have a
laptop that travels at all, you want to create multiple locations. You might
have locations for

Your home cable or DSL modem

A dialup connection at home

The network at your office

When you visit your aunt and uncle in another state

Traveling out of town for work
When you move your computer — and therefore change networks —
add a new network instead of altering your existing network settings.
(That is, unless you’ve moved permanently or no longer need the
original settings for some reason.)

After you do this, you can make changes to the
Network settings.
3.
Select New Location from the Location pull-
down menu (see Figure 36-2).
• Figure 36-2: Adding a new location.
You can duplicate, rename, or delete networks
by selecting Edit Locations from the Locations
menu. This will bring up a prompt for manag-
ing your locations.
4.
Enter a descriptive name for this location in the
prompt that appears (as shown in Figure 36-3)
and then click OK.
This is Larry’s location for when he visits
Bethany Beach, Delaware. Because this is the
only Bethany he knows, it’s a descriptive enough
name. You might also use At the Office or Home
Broadband.
5.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show drop-down box.
If you opted for any Internet service at all when you
first used Panther (or if you upgraded to Panther),
you’ll already have a location named Automatic. If
you’ll be using your computer in a new location 
(for example, if you take your laptop into work), 
you have to add another. To add a location, follow
these steps:
Every user of a networked Mac can use every
location created by any user.
1.
Open System Preferences and click the
Network icon.
The Network icon is displayed both under
Internet & Network and at the top of the window
(see Figure 36-1).
• Figure 36-1: Click Network to manage your locations.
2.
Make sure that the Network panel is unlocked.
If the padlock icon in the lower-left corner of the
Network panel appears locked, you’ll need to
unlock it. Just click it, enter your administrative
password at the prompt, and then press Return.

Defining a Location
291
• Figure 36-3: Give this location a name that lets you know
where and when to use it.
6.
Deselect any ports that this connection will not
need (see Figure 36-4).
• Figure 36-4: Configure the network ports after adding a
new location.
Networks can be created by using many different
ways of connecting to your computer, including
 Your modem
 A built-in Ethernet connection
 An AirPort or AirPort Extreme card
 A Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA) card
(wireless or not)
 An Infrared Data Association (IrDA; infrared)
connection
 A FireWire port
 A USB port
The Network panel automatically enables every
port for a new location, but you have no need to
keep them all on because most locations won’t
use multiple ports. Disable each port that won’t
be used, following these steps:
1. Select the port in the window.
2. Clear the check box to disable the port 
without deleting it.
3. Alternatively, click the Delete button and then
click Delete at the prompt.
Disabling a port and deleting it has the 
same effect. However, some ports cannot be
deleted — like your internal modem and built-
in Ethernet — but others can (like a second
modem or a FireWire port).
7.
Select Network Status from the Show menu.
Before you go any further, you should check
whether your network is already fully functioning.
If it is, go to Step 9. What you’ll see (after selecting
Network Status) is the name of the port being
used (like Built-in Ethernet) and a red, yellow, or
green bubble, along with some text. If you see 
a green bubble and the message that you are
already connected to the Internet, you’re good to
go. If you see a yellow or red bubble, this means
that the port is active but that an Internet con-
nection hasn’t been made. You’ll then need to
configure the port (see Step 8) or dial up to the
Internet via your modem (again, go to Step 8).
8.
If your network isn’t immediately recognized,
select the appropriate port from the Show
menu.

3.
In the PPP tab (see Figure 36-5), enter the
dialup settings that your ISP provided you.
Enter your password so that every user can use
this connection.
• Figure 36-5: The PPP tab is where you enter your ISP
information.
4.
Click the PPP Options button to configure your
dialup settings and then click OK to return to
the Network preferences dialog.
In the resulting prompt (see Figure 36-6), keep
yourself online by setting it to prompt every so
many minutes (30 at the most) to maintain the
connection and deselect the Disconnect If Idle
For xx Minutes option. If you frequently have
trouble dialing in, you’ll want to set Redial to 4 or
5, with a 5- or 10-second interval between redials.
The first four options in the PPP Options panel
have a big effect on when you go online and
whether you stay online. Dialup connections
are notoriously bad about kicking off users.
Fine-tune these settings to minimize those
occurrences. For example, if you get discon-
nected after 15 minutes or so, set the prompt to
every 10 minutes to maintain the connection.
If your active port didn’t immediately get you 
an Internet connection, you’ll need to configure
it (or configure a modem connection and then
make the phone call). Configure your port by
using the appropriate following steps.
 See “Using a Modem” later in this section for 
a description of configuring a modem.
 See Technique 37 for a description of configur-
ing AirPort or another wireless connection.
 If you have an Ethernet connection, use the
information provided by your ISP or recom-
mended by your router’s manual (if you’re
using a router) to configure your Ethernet
port.
9.
Click the Apply Now button to use this network
immediately.
10.
Click the padlock icon to ensure that the 
network settings aren’t changed.
If you ever have trouble with the Network
panel, click the Assist Me button at the bottom
of the window or click the question mark icon
(bottom right) to bring up Mac help. 
Using a Modem
If you’re still dialing up to get your Internet access,
configuring your modem properly helps to improve
the experience. To configure the modem, select
Internal Modem from the Show menu in the Network
panel. Obviously, if you don’t have an internal
modem, you need to select the appropriate choice
from the Show menu. The most important consider-
ations are the following:
1.
Choose System Preferences➪Network.
2.
Select your location from the Location pull-
down menu and your modem (probably
Internal Modem) from the Show menu.

Don’t worry about the TCP/IP and the Proxies
tabs — you probably don’t want to mess with
them.
6.
Use the Modem tab to make your life easier
(see Figure 36-7):
 Turn off the sound if you get tired of hearing
the end-of-the-world-like dialing-up noise.
 Under Connection, decide whether you want
to be interrupted by incoming calls.
 Show the modem status in the menu bar (see
Figure 36-8) to control your connection with-
out using the Network panel.

You can also set multiple dialup settings (dif-
ferent phone numbers and passwords) in the
Internet Connect application, which you can
also access from the Modem menu bar tool.

294
Switching locations on the fly
If you have multiple locations set up, you can easily
switch from one to the other without going through
the Network panel. The key is to use the Location
menu (see Figure 36-9), found under the Apple menu.
To switch locations, just select from the list of
options there.
• Figure 36-9: Quickly switch networks from the 
Apple menu.
The Location menu is also a quick shortcut to
get to your Network preferences panel.
Another alternative is to use Location X (http://
homepage.mac.com/locationmanager, $20). This 
utility adds a menu to the menu bar at the top of
your screen. Furthermore, Location X lets you

according to your demand for them.

Set individual passwords for each location.

Change e-mail settings, default Web page, time
zone, and printer configuration.

Use AppleScripts and shell scripts.

Add to its feature set by using plug-ins.
What’s a Protocol Anyway?
Networks make use of protocols. In layman’s terms, these
are guidelines for computers to speak to each other. Panther
supports just about every protocol you can name, including

AppleTalk: AppleTalk has been around for years and 
used to be how a Mac talked to other Macs and
peripherals. People well versed in the protocol still 
use it although its popularity is dwindling.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol): TCP/IP is the primary protocol for comput-
ers connecting to the Internet.

PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): PPP is used by
modems to connect to the Internet.

PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet):
This protocol uses an Ethernet connection but simu-
lates a dialup PPP session.

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the
default protocol for Web pages, which makes sense
because you access sites by using http://. There’s
also HTTPS, which is a secure Web connection.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is a very common
way to transfer files over the Internet (for example, to
upload pages to a Web site). FTP is normally accessed
by using an FTP application like Fetch or Transmit.
There’s also a secure version of this, called SFTP,
which is replacing FTP for many users.

SMB (Server Message Block): SMB is the most
common way to share files with Windows users.
There’s also Rendezvous, which is a special technology cre-
ated by Apple to let computers automatically identify other
computers and peripherals. It isn’t a protocol in itself,
although it uses these other protocols to function. This is
discussed in Technique 39.
Networking Tips and Tricks
Setting up a network connection isn’t the hardest
thing in the world. After you create one, a lot of 
networking tips and tricks are at your disposal. 
We highlight the best of them here.

Networking Tips and Tricks
295
Ordering connections
If you have several connections active in a single
location — for example, an AirPort and an Ethernet
connection — they both can be active at the same
time. The important thing is that you can order these
to give preference to the most reliable connection. If
you have multiple ways of connecting to the Internet,
you can order the connections so that the strongest
option is used first, if it’s available.
1.
Open the Network panel in System Preferences.
2.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show menu.
3.
Click and drag any port to reorder them.
If you have several networks active and acces-
sible to your computer, order your ports to
use the best network.
Dialing with a calling card
If you’re in a hotel or somewhere else where you
might incur huge charges by dialing into an ISP, have
hope. You can use your calling card to dial up. Most
calling cards have a sequence of steps wherein you
1.
Dial the calling card number (1-800-888-8888).
2.
Wait for the prompt and enter your member
number (2222222).
3.
Wait for the prompt and enter the phone num-
ber to call (555-555-5555).
If you place all these numbers together, your modem
will dial them all at once, missing the prompts. What
you want to do instead is use commas to indicate
two-second pauses. For example, you might change
the modem telephone number to be
18008888888,,,2222222,,,5555555555. Use this as the
Telephone Number value in the PPP tab (when you
show the modem configuration in the Network
panel). You’ll probably want to use this in a new
location, for when you travel.
Using FireWire over IP
Finally, did you know that you can network a com-
puter with a FireWire cable? We thought not. We’re
not talking about sharing an external hard drive but
rather getting actual network access through the
FireWire port. This feature is quite useful for trans-
ferring data between two Macs, if you

Don’t have an Ethernet cable

Do have a FireWire cable

Don’t want to reboot one of the machines to use
FireWire target mode (see Technique 51)
To use this:
1.
Plug a FireWire cable into both computers.
2.
Open the Network panel.
3.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show menu.
4.
Click the New button.
5.
Give the connection a descriptive name.
6.
Select Built-in FireWire from the pull-down
menu.
7.
Click OK.
8.
Click Apply Now.
9.
Follow the steps in Technique 39 for sharing an
Internet connection or files.
After you network two Macs with a FireWire
cable, you can follow the steps in Technique 39
to share a Mac’s Internet connection. Then the
second computer can either access the Internet
through the first computer or access files stored
on the first computer.

The Wonderful
World of Wireless
Networking
W
ireless networks have increased in popularity in recent years
partly because the technology has improved and the prices
have come down. Simultaneously, the sales of Apple’s laptops
have increased, and many users use laptops as their primary computer
instead of a conventional, wired desktop machine. The joys of a wireless
connection can be seen in homes, college campuses, airports, and coffee
shops. The wireless world is no longer restricted to only those with
money to burn or a degree in Information Technology.
If you have the right hardware, creating and using a wireless network is
amazingly simple. But you can still gain more knowledge to facilitate your
wireless networking habits. In this Technique, we first discuss what you
want in a base station and network card. Then we go over the basic steps
of creating an AirPort network. After that, we go over encryption, which
is an essential security concept. Finally, we show you some tips for
speeding up your wireless network.
What to Look for in a Wireless Network
Wireless networking depends upon two things. First, you have an access
point (a base station or router) that connects to the Internet (via a modem
or over broadband) and passes along this connection to the computers.
Second, each computer then needs a wireless network card to receive
the information transmitted by the base station. In simplified terms, the
access point (AP) is like a radio station sending out signals, and the net-
work card is like an antenna, catching those signals out of the air.
In this section, we use the terms router and base station synony-
mously. Technically, a router is used to connect networks, like con-
necting a number of computers in a home or office to the Internet. A
base station is a transmitter/receiver, used to handle wireless signals.
Each of these often serves other purposes, like assigning IP addresses
to computers, creating a firewall (see Technique 40), and connecting
peripherals like printers. Manufacturers blur the lines in these defini-
tions as well. For example, Larry’s AP is called a router by D-Link
(who makes it), but Marc’s AP is an Apples AirPort Base Station. Both
provide wired and wireless connectivity to both Macs and PCs alike.

What to Look for in a Wireless Network
297
You don’t have to use Apple’s AirPort Base Station
or AirPort Card in order to have a wireless network.
In fact, you can pretty much get most base stations
to work with most network cards. When choosing a
base station, look for the following features:
Your computer needs both a network card
(like AirPort or AirPort Extreme) and the soft-
ware for that card to work on your operating
system in order to function. The AirPort soft-
ware comes with Panther. The hardware is
built-in for some higher-end models, and
optional for others (labeled AirPort ready by
Apple, meaning that the AirPort card must be
purchased separately). If you want to use a
non-Apple network card, make sure that the
manufacturer also provides Panther-compatible
software.

Built-in firewall: Most routers have some sort of
firewall or a Network Address Translation (NAT)
system to protect your computer. See Technique
40 for more information.

Ability to also use a modem instead of an
Ethernet Internet connection: Most access
points connect to the Internet via a broadband
connection. More expensive routers also provide
modems to use a dialup connection as a backup
system. Alternatively, you can use a modem as a
primary Internet connection, if one is built into
your access point.

Support for a printer: The latest AirPort Base
Station includes a USB port to plug in a printer,
letting you network this device. (More expensive
printers come with Ethernet connections so that
they may be plugged into any router.) Sure, your
base station is wired to the printer, but your
desktop model or laptop is freed.
If you can plug a printer into your access point,
you can make your Mac even more wireless.
And Rendezvous makes it easy for your Mac
to find and use networked hardware (see
Technique 38).

Ethernet ports to support wired computers:
Most access points are capable of networking
computers wirelessly or by using a standard
Ethernet cable. Having a couple of Ethernet ports
is useful if you have computers without wireless
cards or if a visitor wants to hop on your network
via a computer that doesn’t have a wireless card.

A long range: There’s a big difference between a
base station’s advertised range and its true range.
This number is also affected by the materials
used in the building where the network is (con-
crete and steel are killer), the distance the net-
work covers, and how many/what kind of dense
objects the connection must go through. You’ll
want a true range that’s the size of your building
but not so large that it’ll be easily picked up by
neighbors. Most base stations can broadcast up
to around 100 feet, which is fine for apartments
and smaller houses. People in bigger or multi-
storied buildings might require multiple base 
stations to cover the entire area.

Support for encryption: Encryption is critical 
to maintaining a secure wireless network. See
“Understanding Encryption” later in this
Technique for more.
We recommend buying a network card and
base station from the same manufacturer to
ensure that you’ll be able to use encryption on
your network. Encryption schemes are often
incompatible between different manufacturers’
hardware.

Ability to extend the antenna: Some base sta-
tions can have their range expanded by adding
to or otherwise extending the antenna.

Support for the 802.11g wireless protocol: The
current wireless protocol is 802.11b (Wi-Fi), but
802.11g is fast on its heels. This newer protocol
supports faster transfer speeds (54 Mbps) but
has the annoyance factor of disruption from
cordless phones and microwave ovens. On the
bright side, most 802.11g-capable equipment
retroactively supports 802.11b as well. Apple’s
new AirPort Extreme uses 802.11g and 802.11b,
whereas basic AirPort is 802.11b.

Technique 37: The Wonderful World of Wireless Networking
298
setting up an AirPort network isn’t a Herculean task.
In fact, even accessing a non-Apple base station with
an Apple AirPort Card is pretty easy, thanks to the
AirPort Setup Assistant. Here, then, is how you cre-
ate your wireless network using this utility:
To create an entirely non-AirPort network
(where Apple makes neither the base station
nor the wireless card), you’ll need to go through
similar steps but use the software provided by
your hardware’s manufacturer instead. You
should have good instructions in the manuals
that come with the base station and network
card.
1.
Install the AirPort card on your Mac.
If you’re installing the AirPort card yourself,
follow the manual’s instructions exactly. Be
absolutely certain that the computer is off and
cooled — and that you discharge any static
electricity before touching your computer’s
innards.
2.
Turn on your Macintosh (if it isn’t already) and
make sure that you already have a working
Internet connection.
The base station will eventually use the same
Internet connection information as your Mac
(because it will replace your Mac in terms of 
connecting to the Internet). Before proceeding,
make sure that your Mac can already access 
the Internet. If you’ve never connected to the
Internet with your computer, your ISP will pro-
vide this information for you.
3.
Install and turn on your base station.
Follow the manual’s instructions that come with
your base station. This might involve installing
the antenna and then plugging in the power cord.
(Yes, it will most likely be that simple.) If you use
a modem to connect to the Internet, you’ll need
to connect the base station’s modem port to a
phone jack. If you use a broadband connection,
you’ll need to run an Ethernet cable from the
base station to the cable or DSL modem.
The big deal with the 802.11g protocol is the
faster transfer speed. Before you spend the
extra money on this better technology, you
should realize that these improvements only
affect transfers among computers within your
network. The 802.11b standard already provides
faster speeds than your Internet connection, so
upgrading will not increase how fast you can
download files or surf the Web.

Made by Apple: Although you can use many 
different kinds of hardware with your Mac, you’ll
have the least amount of work to do and the
highest degree of compatibility if you purchase
Apple AirPort products. Further, most Macs are
made to take an AirPort or AirPort Extreme Card
without using up a PC Card slot (a common
expansion area on desktop computers) or USB
port.
Wireless Network Alternatives
Sadly, not that many manufacturers have created Mac OS
X-compatible network cards. (In other words, they haven’t
developed the software or drivers for your Mac.) But if you
would like to save yourself some money and give yourself
more flexibility as to what network card you use, here are
two manufacturers that put out drivers for OS X:

WirelessDriver (http://wirelessdriver.
sourceforge.net, free): WirelessDriver works on 
a couple of dozen cards (see the list at the Web site),
but you won’t get much in the way of support and
it’s not the most feature-rich driver to be found. Still,
it is free.

IOXperts (www.ioexperts.com, $20): For a rea-
sonable cost, IOXperts offers its own 802.11b driver.
It also works with a number of different cards from
various manufacturers but has better support and
development behind it. Visit this site for documenta-
tion, support, and a trial version of the driver.
Creating an AirPort Network
Because Apple believes that you don’t need to be a
rocket scientist to use its computers or equipment,

Understanding Encryption
299
Place your base station in a central location 
(as much as possible) to provide the maximum

ment. Try to keep it clear of walls (and out of
closets) and away from electronic equipment
that puts out or interferes with radio-like waves.
This includes stereo speakers, microwaves, and
cordless phones.

Run the AirPort Setup Assistant on your Mac by
double-clicking its icon in the Utilities folder.
5.
On the introduction page (see Figure 37-1),
select what you want to do and then click
Continue.
The AirPort Setup Assistant will let you join an
existing network (AirPort or otherwise, despite
what it might suggest) or set up a new one. If
you’re adding a new AirPort-enabled Mac to a
wireless network, go for door number 1. To
establish a new AirPort network, take option B.
• Figure 37-1: Use the AirPort Setup Assistant to connect
to an existing network or set up a new one.
6.
If you opted to set up an AirPort network in
Step 5, follow through the remaining prompts,
letting the AirPort assistant do the work.
There will be a number of steps here, depending
upon what decisions you make. The assistant
will give you detailed instructions along the way.
If you are ever unsure about an option, use the
default choice recommended (or selected) by
the assistant.
7.
If you opt to join an existing network in Step 5,
the AirPort Setup Assistant will find it for you.
If a password is required to join the network,
enter the Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP) key
(see “Understanding Encryption”).
If you have trouble connecting to an existing
network after running through the AirPort
Setup Assistant, select Other from the AirPort
menu bar tool to be prompted (see Figure
37-2) for the network’s name, password, and
password type (like WEP 40/128-bit hex).
• Figure 37-2: Use this prompt to manually add a wireless
network.

Understanding Encryption
One of the problems with the growth of wireless net-
works is the increased security risk that they pose.
You have to remember that when you use a wireless
connection, all the data being transmitted is floating
around the airwaves, ready to be intercepted. With
that in mind, we present our list of things that you
should know about security on wireless networks:

Use WEP. Although most wireless networks use
Wired Equivalent Protocol) to encrypt and
decrypt transmitted data, WEP is not perfectly
secure.

Technique 37: The Wonderful World of Wireless Networking
300
creates hotspots — public areas where users can hop
onto live connections. Some hotspots are intention-
ally freely available and legal to use; others require
an hourly usage charge; and still others can be also
used for free (thanks to someone’s lax in security),
but doing so is technically illegal.
Another good reason to use and require WEP
encryption on your wireless networks is that it
prevents neighbors from piggybacking your
connection. Without the proper key, other
computers cannot use your access point.
The easiest way to find available networks is to
adjust your Network settings accordingly:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click Network, under Internet & Network.
3.
Select your network card from the Show menu.
4.
Click the TCP/IP tab.
5.
In the resulting window (see Figure 37-3), select
Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 drop-
down list.
• Figure 37-3: Use DHCP to let your computer find
network connections.
Hackers have cracked through WEP-protected
networks. This means that someone can
potentially listen in on the data transmission
occurring between your computer and the
base station. The end result is that someone
can steal your passwords, bank account infor-
mation (if you do online banking), and more!
This security concern is the main disadvantage
of using wireless networks over wired ones.
Granted, for most home networks, it would
take a long time for a hacker to crack your
WEP (because of the smaller amount of traf-
fic), but just don’t fool yourself into thinking
that WEP encryption is 100 percent safe.

Use at least 128-bit encryption. WEP supports
many levels of encryption, including 64-bit, 128-
bit, and 256-bit. The more bits, the harder the
encryption is to crack. Apple’s AirPort Extreme
supports up to 128-bit encryption.

Use a really, really good WEP key. Your WEP
key is like a password to the network. It can be
either hexadecimal (restricted to the numbers
0–9 and the letters A–F) or ASCII (plain text). Come
up with the most random key you possibly can.

Use encrypted network protocols whenever
possible. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connec-
tions to Web sites, MD5 authentication to e-mail
servers, and Secure FTP (SFTP) connections for
transferring files are far more secure options
than the unencrypted alternatives.
The Virtues of VPNs
For the highest level of security on a wireless network, use
an IPSec-based virtual private network (VPN). Setting that
up usually requires knowledgeable network engineers, but
Panther does have support for the concept now. If you
need a little assistance creating an IPSec-based VPN, use a
tool like VPN Tracker from equinux (www.equinux.com).
Finding Networks
Away from home or the office, you’re not going to
have much of a wireless experience if you can’t find
a network. The availability of wireless networks 

Finding Networks
301
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a
very common protocol, is the preferred method
for most routers, wireless networks, and broad-
band connections. It allows your Mac to receive
its connection information from the connection
provider rather than establishing set parameters.
6.
Click the AirPort tab (if you’re using an AirPort
Card).
7.
In the resulting window (see Figure 37-4), select
Automatic from the By Default, Join drop-down
list.
Using this option will let your computer automat-
ically log onto the strongest network.
• Figure 37-4: Let your computer choose the strongest
network by not specifying one to join
automatically.
8.
If you want, select the Show AirPort Status in
Menu Bar check box.
This option makes seeing and switching among
the available networks easier by using a menu
bar tool (as shown in Figure 37-5).
9.
Click the Apply Now button to enact the new
settings.
• Figure 37-5: The AirPort menu bar tool shows available
networks and lets you quickly switch 
among them.
You can use many other tools to facilitate the
process of finding networks. For starters

MacStumbler (www.macstumbler.com, free):
MacStumbler is a free (woo-hoo!) utility that
finds wireless access points. Unfortunately, it
only works with Apple’s AirPort Card.

WiFi Finder (www.kensington.com, $30): The
WiFi Finder is a little device that finds wireless
networks. It requires no other software and
works independently of your Macintosh.

WiFinder (www.wifinder.com): WiFinder is an
online resource for finding publicly available
wireless networks based upon geographic loca-
tion. You can perform searches there, and it even
lists both free and pay access points.
Good places to find wireless networks include

Coffee shops

Bookstores and libraries

Airport concourses

Hotel lobbies

Technique 37: The Wonderful World of Wireless Networking
302
In many urban environments, people will
mark with chalk those areas where you can
pick up wireless networks. This is warchalking.
Wardriving is the process of driving around
looking for open networks. Just remember that
an available network is not the same as a net-
work that you can legally use. And, note that if
you can access a network, other computers on
a network — and a network administrator — can
see, and potentially access, your computer, too.

Sharing the Wealth
with Rendezvous
R
endezvous is Apple’s protocol for instantly recognizing other com-
puters and devices on the same network. If you’ve never had to try
your hand at networking, you won’t be able to appreciate how
wonderfully useful this technology is. In this Technique, we give you the
skinny on what Rendezvous is, what you can do to configure it on your
Mac, and how it works with some popular software and hardware.
Why You Should Use Rendezvous
Rendezvous, simply put, is the most valuable timesaving tool that you
can use if you need to network computers and devices. Furthermore,
Rendezvous brings some nice added features to many of the applications
that you use on a daily basis. If you have a single computer that’s not
connected to any network all, you’re not going to benefit from using
Rendezvous. But for the rest of you, here’s what Rendezvous lets you do:

Find computers by name — not Internet Protocol (IP) address

Locate people in iChat

Listen to other music collections in iTunes

Use a printer not connected to your computer
In the non-Apple world, the Rendezvous concept is referred to as
Zeroconf, for zero configuration. For more information on the tech-
nology as a whole, see www.zeroconf.org.
Setting Up Rendezvous
You don’t have to do anything to begin working with Rendezvous, but
you might want to make your computer more identifiable to others on
the network by giving it a Rendezvous name. Here’s how:

Certain characters aren’t allowed in a
Rendezvous name, including spaces and all
punctuation. In other words, you have to stick
to the alphabet, numerals, and the hyphen.
Fortunately, this prompt doesn’t let you enter
characters that it doesn’t like.
• Figure 38-2: Use the prompt to create a new
Rendezvous name.
Try to name your computer something mean-
ingful to other computer users. They’re the
ones who’ll see it in their Rendezvous-enabled
applications, after all.
4.
Click OK.
5.
Close System Preferences.
If Rendezvous doesn’t recognize a computer,
it names that computer Macintosh.local.
Using Rendezvous with
Software
Rendezvous works with many applications, adding
cool new features to already fantastic tools. Most of
these applications come from Apple, naturally, but
an increasing amount of third-party software sup-
ports Rendezvous. Here’s a highlight of what each
application brings to the table:

Safari: Safari can find local Web addresses by
using Rendezvous. To enable this, mark one of
the three Include Rendezvous options of the
1.
Open System Preferences and click the Sharing
icon (under Internet & Network).
In the Sharing panel that appears (as shown in
Figure 38-1), your computer name appears in the
Computer Name text box. Your Rendezvous
name will be your computer name plus the suffix
.local.
• Figure 38-1: The Sharing panel controls how your
computer is identified.
If your computer name contains characters
that are invalid in Rendezvous (such as a space),
Panther converts them to valid characters. For
example, G4 iBook becomes G4-iBook.local
in Rendezvous. Likewise, It’s a name! becomes
its-a-name.local.
2.
To change your Rendezvous name, click the
Edit button.
3.
At the prompt (see Figure 38-2), enter a new
Rendezvous name in the Local Hostname box.

Bookmarks preferences panel (as shown in
Figure 38-3). Then you’ll see bookmarks for sites
that Rendezvous finds added to your Bookmarks
Bar, Bookmarks menu, or collections (in the
Bookmarks window). (See Technique 28 for more
on Safari.)
• Figure 38-3: Larry has added Rendezvous bookmarks 
to his collections so they’ll appear in the
Bookmarks window.

iChat: iChat finds people on your network who
are available for instant messaging, chatting, and
video- or audioconferencing. Rendezvous auto-
matically adds available people and removes
them when they go offline. For more on how to
do this, see the upcoming section, “Using
Rendezvous with iChat.”
If you use wireless networking in a public area,
are in a large network, or dial up to a network
by using a modem, you could easily become
overwhelmed with the number of people that
Rendezvous finds. In such a case, use iChat’s
Accounts preferences panel to disable
Rendezvous.

SubEthaEdit (www.codingmonkeys.com/
subethaedit, free): SubEthaEdit (apparently it’s
former name, Hydra, was just too easy to spell)
is a free text editor that allows multiple people 
to work together on the same document at the
same time without worrying about messing 
up each other’s work. It can be used over the
Internet or on a network, using Rendezvous. 
It’s a very innovative — and award-winning —
application that’s well worth considering.

Transmit (www.panic.com/transmit, $25): This
popular File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client lists
local FTP servers using Rendezvous. Because it
also supports Secure File Transfer Protocol
(SFTP), Transmit is a good way to transfer files
to networked users who’ve enabled Remote
Login.

BBEdit (www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/
index.shtml, $179): The best of all possible text
editors now supports Rendezvous for finding
FTP and SFTP servers on your network. In this
regard, it’s much like Transmit except that it’s a
text editor, too.

Games: Many games coming out now use
Rendezvous to find other players. Aspyr (www.
aspyr.com) was one of the first developers to
start using this feature.

World Book 2003: This encyclopedia 
application — which ships for free with Panther
on new computer purchases — lets students
share their work.

iTunes: iTunes might just take the cake for cool
Rendezvous features. It just has one Rendezvous
feature, but it’s a good one: Rendezvous on
iTunes lets you listen to other people’s music.
For more on how to do this, see the upcoming
section, “Using Rendezvous with iTunes.”
Using Rendezvous with iChat
To automatically add available people and remove
them from iChat when they go offline, follow these
steps:
1.
Select the Use Rendezvous Messaging radio 
button when you start iChat AV for the first
time (see Figure 38-4).

Technique 38: Sharing the Wealth with Rendezvous
306
• Figure 38-6: Rendezvous in iChat managed to find
Larry’s other self!
3.
Chat, instant-message, or send a file to a found
Rendezvous person as you normally would.
When you use Rendezvous, you now have two
lists (windows) of people you can chat and IM
with: your Buddy List and the Rendezvous 
window. You can work with both windows — and
the people listed in them — exactly the same.
Double-click a person’s name to send him an
Instant Message, Control+click a name to see a
contextual menu, and so forth.
Marc has found that using Rendezvous with
iChat during business meetings is surprisingly
useful and productive. After you have every-
one recognized in your iChat, you can easily
transfer files back and forth through the
Instant Message window.
Using Rendezvous with iTunes
To set up Rendezvous and iTunes so that you can lis-
ten to other people’s music, follow these steps:
1.
On the computer that’s sharing the music, open
iTunes.
2.
Open the iTunes Preferences panel and click
the Sharing icon.
• Figure 38-4: When you first use iChat, you are given the
option to enable Rendezvous.
Alternatively, select the Enable Local
Rendezvous Messaging check box in the
Accounts preferences panel (see Figure 38-5).
• Figure 38-5: You can always turn Rendezvous on and off
in iChat through the preferences panel.
2.
Open the Rendezvous window by using the
Window menu or the Ô+2 keyboard shortcut.
When you launch iChat or turn on Rendezvous 
in iChat, Rendezvous automatically finds other
users on your network who are online. These
people are displayed in the Rendezvous window
(see Figure 38-6), which behaves almost exactly
like your Buddy List.

3.
In the resulting Sharing panel (see Figure 38-7),
enable the Look for Shared Music check box.
This setting actually lets you see other people’s
music — and while you’re sharing yours, you
might as well look for theirs, too.
• Figure 38-7: Enable sharing in iTunes to let others see
(and hear) your good taste in tunes.
4.
Enable the Share My Music check box.
5.
Decide whether you want to share your entire
library or just selected playlists.
6.
In the Shared Name box, give your music a
meaningful name.
The shared name is for the benefit of other
people on your network — not yours. You can
leave them guessing with Hip DJ 72 or be
plain and descriptive with Larry’s Music.
7.
Decide whether you want to require a 
password.
By setting a password, you can let your friends
listen in but keep your mean co-workers or
annoying sibling out. The choice is up to you. 
If you set a password, users see your collection
listed but cannot see any specifics until they
enter the correct password (see Figure 38-8).
• Figure 38-8: You can password-protect your playlists if
you want to share your music selectively.
8.
Click OK to save the sharing settings.
You’ll see a nice message reminding you that
sharing music is for personal use only. In other
words, this feature is not meant to be used as a
radio station or as a way to steal music.
9.
Now other users who’ve enabled Look for
Shared Music will see your music collection
and playlists in their collections window 
(see Figure 38-9).
Click the down-arrow next to the collection name
to view the playlists.
• Figure 38-9: Other people’s music collections appear 
in blue.

308
Using Rendezvous with
Hardware
Rendezvous can be used with hardware as well as
software. In these cases, instead of finding people 
in iChat or music in iTunes, Rendezvous helps you
access networked devices. For example, with
Rendezvous, you can easily use a printer not even
connected to your Mac or find shared volumes on
other computers. As of the time of this writing,
Rendezvous can locate

Other Macs (running OS 10.2 or later)

Printers
You can use Rendezvous to find a printer on
your network or to find a printer connected to
another computer on your network. Brother,
Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, and
Xerox all create printers that support
Rendezvous.

Storage devices (like Redundant Array of
Inexpensive Disks, or RAID)

TiVo units

Digital cameras

Scanners
For specific information on using Rendezvous to find
other computers and printers, see Technique 40.
Look at the Status heading in the iTunes
Sharing preferences panel to see how many
users are currently connected to your iTunes
(see Figure 38-10). You must keep your iTunes
up and your computer awake for 
people to be able to continue listening in.
• Figure 38-10: Only one person is currently accessing
Larry’s music.

our Mac can interact with other computers on your network in
many ways. For the beginner, this normally means accessing some
other computer to view a Web page or retrieve files. But by making
judicious use of Panther’s Sharing features, you can easily and securely
share your wealth with others as well.
The focus of this Technique is the many types of sharing that your Mac
can do. We begin by addressing the security risks involved with these
features. Then we move on to Web sharing: hosting Web sites on your
Mac. Then we go into file sharing — a great way to move documents
around. After that, you’ll see how easily you can share your printer or
Internet access with other users.
If you find yourself frequently turning the different sharing tools on
and off, consider SharingMenu, (www.mani.de/en/, free). This share-
ware (in every sense of the word) creates a menu bar item that gives
you quick access to the various shares.
Safe Sharing
You should understand that sharing your computer brings some security
risks. By letting others access your computer, you run the risk of them
doing bad things to said computer. This could range from stealing infor-
mation to crashing the system. This isn’t to say that this will happen . . .
only that it could. Here is a nonscientific hierarchy of the most-secure to
least-secure sharing options; enable these (except Internet access) on
the Services tab of the Sharing dialog of System Preferences:

Personal Web Sharing lets you run static HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) pages out of your Sites
directory, but it doesn’t have to stop there. With this
tool — after the proper configuration — you can also
run the following Web development tools:

PHP scripts

JavaServer Pages

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts

WebObjects pages

WebDAV
For more information on any of these Web
development tools, search Google or check
out O’Reilly’s MacDevCenter (www.
macdevcenter.com). Marc has created an
installer for adding PHP to your Mac (check
out the Mac OS X software section of
www.entropy.ch), and Larry has written many
books about PHP (using a Mac as his test
computer).
To turn on and use Web sharing, follow these steps:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Sharing icon under Internet &
Network.
3.
Enable the Personal Web Sharing check box
(see Figure 39-1).
After you turn on Personal Web Sharing,
Panther will show you a few test hyperlinks in
the Sharing panel. Click any of these to open
your site in your default Web browser.
4.
Place the files for your site within your Sites
folder (in your Home directory).
5.
Open Safari on your computer.
6.
Go to http://localhost/~username (see 
Figure 39-2).
You can feel pretty safe enabling Web, printer,
or Internet access sharing. None of these
require usernames or passwords nor allow
access to your Mac’s operating system or the
file structure at large.

The most prudent decision that you can make
is to turn on only those sharing services that
you need — and when you need them. Turn
off services when they’re no longer necessary.
Most importantly, never give out the user-
name and password of a Mac’s administrator.
If others must be able to log on to your com-
puter, set up a dummy, nonadministrative user
for this purpose (use the Accounts panel under
System Preferences for this purpose).
Sharing a Web Page
Web sharing is Apple’s fancy description of hosting
Web sites. Little did you know that your Mac has a
very sophisticated Web-hosting tool built into it.
With this feature, you can develop Web sites on your
Mac — or, if your ISP allows it, host sites that are
available to anyone in the world.
Personal Web Sharing lets you access Web
pages running on your own computer and
also lets other computers on your network or
the Internet access them. If you develop Web
sites, you can now fully build them on your
computer and then upload them to a live
server after they’re finished.

What’s in a Name (Or URL)?
311
• Figure 39-1: Web sharing is now running.
• Figure 39-2: This is the default Web page placed in a
user’s Sites directory.
If you attempt to go to http://localhost
in your Web browser and it reports that the
address cannot be found, Personal Web
Sharing is not turned on.
What’s in a Name (Or URL)?
After you enable Web sharing, you have many ways
to access your Web site. From your own computer,
you can point your browser to one of these two 
locations:

http://localhost/~username

http://127.0.0.1/~username
The word localhost and the IP address
127.0.0.1 are two different ways to refer to
your own machine (and they always refer to
just your own computer). If your computer is
on a network (online, that is), it will have a 
second IP address that is unique to your 
computer — 127.0.0.1 is how every com-
puter refers to itself. This second address can
also be used to find your machine in the Web
browser.

http://your.ip.address/~username (for 
example, http://192.168.0.100/~username)
From another computer, your Web site can be
accessed through
http://your.ip.address/~username
Advanced Apache Management
Personal Web Sharing is really just the Apache Web server —
the most popular (and arguably the best) Web server appli-
cation available. From the Terminal application, you can
control Apache with

sudo apachectl start to turn on Personal Web
Sharing

sudo apachectl stop to turn off Personal Web
Sharing

sudo apachectl graceful to restart Personal Web
Sharing

3.
Mark the Personal File Sharing check box 
(as shown in Figure 39-3).
• Figure 39-3: Personal File Sharing is now running.
After you turn on Personal File Sharing, text
appears at the bottom of the Sharing window
(above the padlock icon) that tells you how to
access your computer.
4.
Place files to be shared within your Public
folder (in your Home directory).
5.
On another Mac, choose Network from the
Finder’s Go menu or press Ô+Shift+K.
6.
In the resulting window (see Figure 39-4), 
double-click the icon for the computer you
want to access.
• Figure 39-4: In the Network window, open the computer
you want to access.
Your Personal Web Sharing (Apache) relies upon the /etc/
httpd/httpd.conf file to control its behavior. You can
modify this file if you know what you’re doing. (You should
probably back it up first, just in case.) For example, if only
one user on your machine will use Personal Web Sharing
and you’d rather use http://localhost or http://
127.0.0.1 instead of http://localhost/~username
or http://127.0.0.1/~username to access those pages,
you can change these settings. You can also edit the
httpd.conf file to turn on and off features you might
want, like support for PHP or WebDAV.
Fun with File Sharing
If you want to share your stuff with other computer
users or make it easier for them to share their stuff
with you, you’ll want to use file sharing. The two
main tools for file sharing are

Personal File Sharing: Personal File Sharing is
an easy way to let other Mac users access the
Public user folders on your Mac.

Windows Sharing: You’ll need to use Windows
Sharing to let a Windows user access your files
or use a Mac printer. From Windows, the user
can go to //your.ip.address/username and
then log in with your username and password.
For this reason, you might want to create a 
new account without administrative privileges.
(Choose System Preferences➪Accounts to 
create the new user, making sure that the Allow
user to administer this computer option is not
enabled.)

When you disable Personal File Sharing, you’re
given an option of how quickly to disconnect it
and what message to send to connected users.
These messages appear in the Finders of con-
nected Mac users.
Print Sharing
Between Rendezvous (Technique 38) and Printer
Sharing, sharing one printer on a network is surpris-
ingly easy. Here’s how:
1.
Make sure that the printer is turned on and
connected to the primary computer.
2.
On the primary computer, open the Sharing
panel and select the check box next to Printer
Sharing.
3.
On the secondary computer, open the Printer
Setup Utility (in the Utilities folder).

• Figure 39-9: Check your active network ports before
sharing a connection.
7.
In the Share Your Connection From drop-down
list, select the port where you get your Internet
connection.
For example, this might be your AirPort or other
wireless card, your modem, or your built-in
Ethernet port.
8.
In the To Computers Using list, mark the check
box next to the port through which the second
computer will connect (see Figure 39-10).
For example, this might be your built-in Ethernet
port.

Click Start.
10.
In the warning prompt that appears, click Start
(see Figure 39-11).
The next time you go to print a document, the
networked printer will appear as the default
printer (as long as it’s turned on and connected
and the primary computer is on). You can send
your document to this networked printer as if it
were connected to your Mac.
Sharing Your Internet Connection
A pretty cool feature built into Panther is the ability
to share an Internet connection. This means that one
Mac can be online (through a dialup modem, cable
modem, DSL, or other type of Internet connection),
and another computer can access the Internet
through the first computer’s connection.
If you have multiple computers but use a
modem dialup connection or don’t have 
a router to allow multiple computers on a
broadband network, use Internet Sharing.
Here’s how to set up and enable Internet Sharing:
1.
Open System Preferences and click the
Network icon.
2.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show menu (see Figure 39-9).
3.
Make sure that at least two ports are active.
You’ll need one port to provide this computer
with Internet access and another port through
which to connect to the second computer.
4.
Click the Apply Now button to activate the 
settings.
5.
Select Sharing from the View menu.
6.
Click the Internet tab.

Technique
Network Security
I
f your Mac is on a network, you need to be mindful of security.
Whether your computer is on a company’s intranet or just uses a
modem to dial up to the Internet, if your computer ever talks to
another computer, you have to be a little careful. Mac OS X is fairly
secure in its default state (much more so than, say, um, Windows), but
that doesn’t mean you can’t still learn a trick or two.
In this Technique, we suggest three steps to take. First, we show you
what to do to secure your Mac. Second, we recommend that you run 
a firewall. Finally, we recommend some tools you can use to check for
potential security violations. By following a few simple rules, you can 
use your computer without worrying about unwanted intruders.
Keeping Your Mac Secure
Network security is first and foremost a matter of turning off those features
you aren’t using. The Sharing System Preferences panel (see Figure 40-1)
enables you to turn different features on and off by selecting or deselect-
ing the check boxes on the Services tab. Each of these features adds
functionality — but at the cost of decreased security. The most secure
rules for sharing your computer are
• Figure 40-1: Turn off all
Sharing options
when they’re 
not being used.

Using a Firewall
317

Leave all Sharing options turned off at all
times, if you can.

If you must use a type of sharing, enable it only
as long as it’s necessary.

Try to use the most secure type of sharing for
what you need to accomplish.
Note the hierarchy in terms of security. For
example, using the FTP Access options is less
secure than Remote Login, but both can be used
for the same purposes. (In Technique 39, we dis-
cuss Sharing in more detail.)

Use a firewall to protect your computer (see the
following section).
Using a Firewall
A firewall is a special type of security device that
creates a barrier between your computer and others.
It’s normally created by using a combination of hard-
ware and software. A firewall allows your computer
to do everything it needs to do but prevents other
computers, Trojan horses (software that lurks in the
shadows and does malicious things without your
knowledge), and the like from getting into your com-
puter or your data.
Software firewalls
Earlier versions of Mac OS X had a built-in firewall
but didn’t provide a good graphical user interface 
to it. Most users resorted to using third-party appli-
cations such as BrickHouse (www.securemac.com) to
easily manage their firewall. Fortunately for all of us,
Panther includes a firewall configuration tool, also
found in the Sharing panel.
To protect your computer from outside intru-
sions, turn on the built-in firewall. The firewall
is exclusionary, meaning that it will deny
access through every port. (A port is a gate-
way into a computer.) If you need to turn on
some Sharing features, you can then explicitly
open those ports.
To enable a firewall, follow these steps:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click Sharing, under Internet & Network.
3.
In the Sharing panel, click the Firewall tab.
If you want something a little more user-
friendly than the built-in firewall, check out
Firewalk X 2 (http://pliris-soft.com, $35)
or ContentBarrier (www.intego.com, $60).
Both are easy-to-use products, but they essen-
tially provide the same functionality as the
built-in firewall at a higher price.
4.
On the Firewall tab, click the Start button 
(see Figure 40-2).
• Figure 40-2: Use the Firewall tab of the Sharing panel to
enable and control your firewall.
A firewall does not affect any outgoing traffic
(things you do) except for your FTP applica-
tion. If you have your firewall enabled, you
might have difficulty accessing remote servers
via FTP unless you select the Use Passive FTP
Mode (PASV) check box on the Proxies tab of
the Network dialog (see Figure 40-3).

• Figure 40-4: At the bottom of the window are the
options to let iChat and iTunes find your
computer.
• Figure 40-5: Hover your mouse over a listing to receive
helpful advice.
• Figure 40-3: Enable PASV to use FTP when your Mac is
behind a firewall.
5.
If you use any of the Sharing services, make
sure the appropriate check box for that service
is selected in the Firewall tab of the Sharing
panel.
6.
If you want others to be able to recognize you
by using Rendezvous with iChat, select the
iChat Rendezvous check box (see Figure 40-4).
For Rendezvous to work, it needs the freedom to
scan certain ports. If you have a firewall enabled,
other iChat users won’t be able to see you unless
you grant that access.
7.
If you want others to be able to listen to your
iTunes collection, select the iTunes Music
Sharing check box.
Again, iTunes Music Sharing won’t work for other
users unless the proper port is open.
If you need a little assistance understanding
how any item works, move your mouse over
the item’s description. A yellow box appears,
displaying more information (see Figure 40-5).

Checking for Security Problems
319
Hardware firewalls
Another common way to put your computer behind
a firewall is to use some sort of router on your net-
work. AirPort Base Stations and non-Apple routers
create Network Address Translation (NAT) firewalls
for your network. Essentially, the router itself is rec-
ognized as the machine being online: It’s part of the
wide area network (WAN). All the computers con-
nected to the router are hidden from the WAN and
are part of the local area network (LAN). If you have
more than one computer at home, school, or the
office, spending $100 on the right router might be
your easiest option.
Some routers will let you bypass the firewall
for a particular computer through specific
ports (see Figure 40-6). This is useful if you
play games online, do video conferencing, and
the like.
• Figure 40-6: The D-Link router has a control panel for
tweaking the firewall.
Blocking Access to Specific Web Sites
If you’d like to keep people on your computer from access-
ing specific Web sites, you can do so by modifying the
/etc/hosts file. Here’s how:
1.
Open the Terminal.
2.
Type sudo pico /etc/hosts.
This step opens the hosts file in the pico editor.
Adding information to this file adjusts how your com-
puter accesses Web sites.
3.
Enter the administrator’s password.
4.
At the end of the file in your text editor, add
127.0.0.1 url.com.
Replace url.com with the actual URL you want to
ban. You can add as many items as you want here by
using this syntax, with each going on its own line.
5.
Press Control+X to exit.
6.
Press Y at the prompt to save the changes.
7.
Press Return at the final prompt.
8.
Restart your Mac.
The next time any user attempts to go to the named URL
in any browser, he will be redirected back to his own com-
puter. This will result in either a default, meaningless Web
page being displayed or a Server Not Found error message.
This is a great way for parents to keep kids out of particular
sites, for corporations to do the same, or to play practical
jokes.
Checking for Security Problems
For the really paranoid (er, security conscious), you
can use a number of applications to monitor network
activity on your Macintosh. The intention of such
software is to notify you of behind-the-scenes activ-
ity, thereby alerting you if something unexplained is

Technique 40: Network Security
320
Here are some popular tools for the job:

MacScan (http://macscan.securemac.com, 
currently free in beta form)
MacScan looks for the various types of malicious
software that lingers on your computer and tries
to make connections to the outside world. If it
finds any, you’ll be notified and given the option
to remove the offending application.

Little Snitch (www.obdev.at/products/
littlesnitch, $25)
Little Snitch alerts you when any application
attempts to use a network connection. You can
then allow the connection to occur, deny it, or
tell Little Snitch what to do when this happens.

Nmap (www.insecure.org/nmap, free)
Nmap scans your computer for potential security
holes, including open ports (gateways into your
computer). It can work on an entire network or
just a single computer.
going on. These tools won’t catch people trying 
to break into your computer but will see whether
something on your computer is trying to access the
Internet without your knowledge. This could happen
with Trojan horses and some applications (see the
sidebar, “Applications and Your Network”).
Applications and Your Network
Some applications will make use of a network connection
without your knowing it. For example, an application might
harmlessly check for software updates or check other com-
puters on your network to ensure that multiple copies of
the same software (that is, the same single-use serial num-
ber) are not being used repeatedly. It’s up to you to inter-
pret or abide by your licenses, but if you want to stop this
behavior, run these commands in the Terminal:
sudo ipfw add 0 deny tcp from any to any
3464
sudo ipfw add 0 deny tcp from any to any
2222
You’ll need to enter the administrator’s password once, but
both ports will be blocked.

An iDisk is a pretty handy thing if you have 
a fast Internet connection. If you don’t, you
might not find the iDisk to be that grand, par-
ticularly if you need to dial up every time you
need to access the thing.
To use your iDisk, you’re going to need to mount it
on your computer first. As always, you have many
ways of doing this:

Press Ô+Shift+I in the Finder.

Choose Go➪iDisk➪My iDisk in the Finder 
(see Figure 41-2).
• Figure 41-2: The Finder’s Go menu gives you access to
your iDisk as well as other people’s.

Use Finder’s preferences to add iDisk to the list
of items that appear in the Finder windows (see
Figure 41-3).
If you list the iDisk in the Sidebar of the Finder
windows, you can also directly save files there
within applications from the Save dialog.
Naturally, you can also then open files from
your iDisk within an application by using the
Open dialog. See Technique 10 for customiz-
ing the Finder window Sidebar.
• Figure 41-3: Make your iDisk a constant presence by
adding it to the Finder window Sidebar.
Your iDisk mounts as an icon on your Desktop. After
you open this icon, you can work with the iDisk like
any other folder in the Finder (as shown in Figure
41-4). You’ll find that your iDisk is organized like
your Home directory, with a couple of exceptions:
• Figure 41-4: The root level of Larry’s iDisk.

3.
In the .Mac dialog that appears, click the iDisk
tab (see Figure 41-5).
The iDisk preferences panel is used to tweak
your iDisk settings. It takes a few seconds to load
each time you click it while it attempts to syn-
chronize with your iDisk.
• Figure 41-5: Adjust your iDisk settings in the .Mac panel.
4.
Make sure that the Read Only radio button is
selected under Your Public Folder.
You can give people the option of both down-
loading (the Read Only radio button) and upload-
ing (the Read & Write radio button) files to your
Public folder. There’s really no need to let users
write to your iDisk unless you have to do some
serious file sharing and don’t want to use one of
the many other file sharing tools available (see
Technique 39).
5.
Select the Use a Password to Protect Your
Public Folder check box.
By marking this check box, you require users to
enter a password to access this folder. You’ll be
given a prompt (as shown in Figure 41-6) to enter
the password.

Your Documents, Music, Pictures, Movies, 
and Library folders are all private and are 
not directly available to other users.
If you store items in the Documents directory,
only users who have username and password
access to your iDisk can see them. This is a
good place to store files that you might need
to retrieve while traveling.

Your Sites folder is where your Web pages go.
The URL http://homepage.mac.com/
your_username points directly to your Sites
folder. This URL is case-insensitive, so http://
homepage.mac.com/YOUR_USERNAME and
http://homepage.mac.com/Your_Username
also work.

The Public folder is for sharing files with 
others.
(See the section titled “Making your iDisk secure,”
later in this chapter.)

The Backup folder is where the Backup applica-
tion stores files.
You can download files from the Backup folder
by using the mounted iDisk, but only the Backup
application can modify this folder’s contents (by
adding or deleting items).

The Software folder is where Apple places Mac
software that you might like.
Updates to Apple applications appear in the
Apple subfolder, whereas the Members Only 
subfolder contains bonus applications given 
out to .Mac members. You can find out about
newly available software by visiting (in Safari)
www.apple.com/software/ and www.mac.com
(the .Mac home page).
Making your iDisk secure
The Public folder of your iDisk is automatically
accessible to the world at large, so you want to be
careful with it. Follow these steps to secure the
folder:

• Figure 41-6: Enter a password here twice to set it for your
Public folder.
You can easily change your iDisk Public folder
password by clicking the Set Password button
in the iDisk panel.
6.
Close System Preferences.
You cannot turn off the sharing capability of
the Public iDisk folder. The best you can do is
password-protect it and remember not to
place sensitive information there!
Using a Local Copy of Your iDisk
While you’re in the iDisk panel, you can decide whether
you want Panther to maintain a local copy of your iDisk.
This means that your computer will keep a backup of your
iDisk on your Mac. Larry personally finds this to be a little
annoying and completely unnecessary for these reasons:

In all likelihood, your iDisk is a backup of stuff already
on your computer.

If you have this set to automatically update, a good
amount of time will be spent by your Mac syncing
your iDisk with the local copy. This is really annoying.

If you have to manually update the copy, you need to
remember to do this.
Feel free to use this feature if you must, but Larry turned it
off almost immediately and hasn’t missed it since. That
being said, if you’re on a slow Internet connection and use
the iDisk for storage, you can drop things in your local copy
of the iDisk and then update the online version the next
time you connect.
Using another .Mac member’s iDisk
Just like you can let other people access your 
iDisk, you can easily access theirs with Panther. 
The iDisk submenu (under the Finder’s Go menu,
refer to Figure 41-2) gives you these options:

Other User’s Public Folder: To mount another
user’s Public folder, you need only his .Mac user-
name. Mind you, you can download files from a
person’s Public folder, but you cannot add files
to it, delete files from it, or otherwise change the
Public folder’s contents. If the folder is password
protected, you’ll be prompted to enter that pass-
word before you can read (download) any files.
You can also mount a user’s Public folder by
using the Finder’s Connect to Server tool
(under the Go menu or press Ô+K). Use
http://idisk.mac.com/username as the
address. If you use this method, you can 
bookmark an iDisk by adding it to your list of
favorite servers (see Figure 41-7). To do so, just
enter the connection address in the box and
click the plus sign. Access a Favorite Server by
selecting it from the list and clicking Connect.
To quickly go back to any recently accessed
server, click the clock icon (beside the plus) to
view a pull-down menu of your server history.
• Figure 41-7: Bookmark Public iDisk folders by using
Connect to Server.

Other User’s iDisk: To mount someone else’s
iDisk, you’ll need his .Mac username and pass-
word. If you have this, you can control that disk
as if it were your own.

Protecting Your Web Site
If you want to put your site online but want to restrict access
to it, you can password-protect it. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
Go to www.Mac.com in your Web browser.
2.
Log in with your username and password.
3.
Click HomePage.
4.
Do one of the following:
 If you have multiple sites, select the site to protect
from the list and then click Edit.
 If you only have the one site, click Protect (on the
right side of the page).
5.
In the resulting page, select the On check box.
6.

Click Apply Changes.
The next time that users visit your site, they’ll be presented
with a prompt to enter this password.
Using iSync with .Mac
The iSync application (which is available for free
from www.apple.com/isync) was created by Apple 
to simplify the synchronization of certain types of
data between two sources. For example, you can 
use it to update contacts between your Mac and a
cellular phone. Or, you can synchronize your Safari
Bookmarks, Address Book data, and iCal data
(Calendars and To Do lists) with your .Mac account.
Synchronization provides three really keen benefits:

A backup of your valuable data

The ability to use these items on multiple 
computers

Online access to your contacts (in Webmail) and
bookmarks
Working with Your .Mac 
Web Page
Along with the .Mac account comes your very own
http://homepage.mac.com/your_username_here Web
page. These days, anyone who’s anyone has a Web
page (as does everyone else), so it’s about time you
make your online presence felt. Just log on to the
.Mac site (www.mac.com) and use the HomePage tools
to create your pages. HomePage lets you pick a
theme from one of many prefab templates and then
add your own text, pictures, movies, or whatever to
create your own page. If you know a little Web design,
however, you can skip the HomePage hassle and
manipulate your site with ease.
Your .Mac member name will be part of your
Web site address, so watch what you choose.
That is, unless you’re okay with telling your
boss to check out http://homepage.mac.com/
JobHater53.
1.
Create the Web page on your computer.
If you create a Web page within your Sites
folder, you can see how it looks in your
browser by going to http://localhost/

2.
Mount your iDisk by pressing Ô+Shift+I in the
Finder.
3.
Open the Sites folder on the iDisk.
4.
Copy all your site files to the iDisk.
5.
Use your Web browser to visit http://
homepage.mac.com/your_username.
Images stored in your Pictures directory can
be used in a Web page by setting the image
source to http://homepage.mac.com/
your_username/.Pictures/imagename.

Using iSync with .Mac
327
After you synchronize your data from one Mac 
(computer A) to your .Mac account, you can then
update the data on a second Mac (computer B) by
using the same .Mac account. This is great if you’ve
just acquired a new computer or you regularly use
two different Macs. Furthermore, by synchronizing
through .Mac, changes made to your data on one
computer (say, a person’s e-mail address in Address
Book) can be updated on the second computer with-
out the risk of losing other important information
(like all the other Address Book data). For this to
work, you only need to log in to the same .Mac
account on both computers (using the .Mac section
of System Preferences).
Using iSync and .Mac together means that
you can guarantee that you always have the
most up-to-date version of your Address Book,
Safari bookmarks, and iCal data on the com-
puter that you’re using.
To use iSync across two computers, follow these
steps:
1.
Use the .Mac System Preferences panel to set
your .Mac username and password, if you
haven’t already.
2.
Open the iSync application, found in the
Applications folder (download it from Apple 
if you don’t already have a copy).
3.
Click the .Mac symbol (see Figure 41-8).
• Figure 41-8: iSync lists the available destinations at the
top of its window.
4.
In the dialog that appears, select the Turn on
.Mac Synchronization check box.
5.
Enable all the check boxes under This
Computer.
Here is where you select what information you
want to be synchronized, choosing from Safari
Bookmarks, Address Book Contacts, and iCal
Calendars and To Do items. If you don’t use any
of these, you don’t need to synchronize it.
6.
Click the Sync Now icon.
The first time you run the application, it will take
a little time.
7.
Access the second Mac (computer B).
It doesn’t matter whether the second Mac is on
the same network as the first Mac. It doesn’t even
matter what username you use to log on to the
second Mac. (The synchronized data is associ-
ated with a specific .Mac account, not the com-
puter’s username.)
8.
Open iSync on the second computer.
9.
Click the .Mac symbol.
10.
From the For First Sync menu, choose Merge
Data on Computer and .Mac.
You’re pretty safe using iSync unless you
choose either of the Erase Data On options.
These could have dire, unintended conse-
quences. The Merge Data on Computer and
.Mac option combines all existing data and is
therefore the safest. If it runs across a conflict
(two different records for an individual in the
Address Book, for example), it asks you what
to do.
11.

iTunes: Rockin’ in
the (Partially)
Free World
O
f the many free applications that Apple has included with its 
operating system, iTunes could just be the shining star. The first
of the iLife products, iTunes has become so popular that even
Windows users now have it. (Who would’ve thunk it?) All iTunes does is
manage and play music, but that’s a pretty useful thing. If you’ve never
used iTunes before, this Technique will show you the fastest ways to use
the application. If you’re a seasoned iTunes veteran, you’re still bound to
discover many new, efficient techniques.
This Technique begins with the coverage of iTunes set-up routine — for
first-time users. Then we discuss the most critical preferences settings
and how to adjust the iTunes window itself. Afterwards, you’ll see how to
manage your music collection. Finally, we cover how to spend every last
dime at the iTunes Music Store.
Also see Technique 46, which specifically discusses burning CDs from
iTunes, as well as Technique 38, which covers using iTunes with
Rendezvous.
Setting Up iTunes
The first time you use iTunes, you’ll be taken through the Setup
Assistant. Here’s what you’ll see the first time you use iTunes:
1.
Feast your eyes upon the iTunes Software License Agreement.
You’re pretty much going to have to agree to this if you want to use the
software. You can click the Decline button, but then the application
will just quit . . . which kinda defeats your purpose.
You’ll see the iTunes agreement the first time you use iTunes and
again after certain updates. You have the option of agreeing to it and
using iTunes or declining it and not using the software. All in all, it
doesn’t really matter what the agreement says then, does it? Let’s
hope there’s nothing important in there. . . .

• Figure 42-2: Set your Internet audio settings now and
forget about them.
4.
Decide whether you want iTunes to search for
MP3 and AAC music files that you already have
(see Figure 42-3).
If you have music files on your computer, go
ahead and select the Yes radio button. If you
know that you don’t, select the No radio button.
If you don’t have any audio files on your com-
puter when you first run iTunes, don’t bother
having iTunes search for them. It’ll only be a
waste of time.
• Figure 42-3: Send iTunes off on a useful search or a wild
goose chase.
2.
Welcome to iTunes (see Figure 42-1)!
This is just a welcome page. You can cancel this
process and go directly into the application, but
then you’ll need to manually tweak every setting
using iTunes preferences. Take the smart road
and click Next to advance.
• Figure 42-1: The iTunes welcome page begins the Setup
Assistant.
3.
Select your Internet Audio settings (see the
choices in Figure 42-2) and then click Next:
 Do you want to use iTunes to handle Internet
audio? Don’t have iTunes modify your Internet
settings if your Web browser already handles
audio content as you’d like it to.
 Should iTunes connect to the Internet automati-
cally when it needs to (for example, to retrieve
the track listings for a CD)? If you have an
always-on connection (like cable modem, DSL,
and such), select the Yes radio button. If you
have a dialup connection, select the No radio
button.
A cool feature of iTunes is the ability to look
up CD and song names online. However, you
don’t necessarily need to be connected to the
Internet to use this. If you import a CD, you
can look up the songs later. The next time
you’re online, select the entire imported CD
and then choose Get CD Track Names from
the Advanced menu.

Tweaking Your Preferences
333
5.
Decide whether to go to the iTunes Music Store
(see Figure 42-4).
• Figure 42-4: The final step in the Setup Assistant.
Finally, iTunes will obligingly take you right to
the iTunes Music Store to start filling up that
hard drive (and emptying your wallet at the
same time). We leave this choice up to you. If
you do go visit, don’t forget to read “Blowing
Your Paycheck at the iTunes Music Store,” later 
in this chapter.
Tweaking Your Preferences
After you get iTunes up and running, you should
immediately customize your preferences to make it
work exactly as you’d like it to. If you used the Setup
Assistant, many settings will already be determined.
Our best advice for tweaking iTunes follows. We’ll
take you step by step through the preferences pan-
els, omitting only the cosmetic issues:
1.
Open the iTunes preferences by pressing Ô+,
(comma) or choosing Preferences from the
iTunes menu.
2.
In the On CD Insert drop-down list box of the
General panel (as shown in Figure 42-5), 
choose from four options of what iTunes 
should do when inserting a CD:
 Show the songs on the CD
 Begin playing the CD
 Import the songs from the CD (copy them to
your music collection)
 Import the songs from the CD and then eject
the disc
In all likelihood, you’ll most often want to leave
this on the Show Songs setting. That being said,
if you’re about to rip your entire music collection
onto your computer, set iTunes to import the
songs and eject the CD to facilitate the process.
You can also set the Finder to automatically
open audio CDs in iTunes.
• Figure 42-5: The General panel lets you decide what to
do when CDs are inserted and how to work
with the Internet.

• Figure 42-7: The Importing panel is very important if you
import a lot of music.
5.
Click the Sharing icon (see Figure 42-8) and
decide whether you’re a borrower, a lender, 
or both.
• Figure 42-8: Share your music with others on your
network.
3.
Click the Effects icon and select the Sound
Check check box (see Figure 42-6).
This setting ensures that iTunes automatically
adjusts the song volume so that it maintains a
consistent level. Opting for this saves you the
hassle of constantly adjusting the volume.
• Figure 42-6: Use the Effects panel to provide a consistent
listening experience.
4.
Click the Importing icon (see Figure 42-7) and
set your import configurations.
These values are critical if you import a lot of
music from CDs. The Import Using drop-down
list affects how large the files will be and where
you can play them. The Setting drop-down list
also affects how large the files will be and how
good they’ll sound. For more on these settings,
see the sidebar “A Word on Music Formats,” else-
where in this chapter. Finally, the Create File
Names with Track Number check box dictates
whether CD track numbers are used in filenames.
We discuss the iTunes Burning panel in
Technique 46, where we cover burning CDs 
in general.

Tweaking Your Preferences
335
The Sharing panel has two main settings:
 Look for Shared Music controls whether
iTunes should look for other music collections
on your network. If your iTunes finds other
people’s music collections, they appear as a
blue-colored playlist in the left-hand column.
You can then access any of those songs — and
potentially the playlists — that user created.
You cannot change the information of a song
on another user’s computer, alter a rating,
increase the play count, or copy songs to your
computer. If a particular song was purchased
through the iTunes Music Store, you need that
user’s access information to play it.
 Share My Music determines whether you let
others listen to your iTunes. If you decide to
share your music — and you really ought to,
to be nice — you can decide whether to share
every song (the entire library) or specific
playlists (and therefore, specific songs). While
you’re at it, give your share a descriptive
name and password-protect it if you want to
make sure that only friends tune in. After you
turn on this feature and click OK, you’ll be
given the Sharing Music Is for Personal Use
Only prompt (as shown in Figure 42-9) where
you should select the Do Not Show This
Message Again check box.
• Figure 42-9: Yes, yes. Stealing music is bad. We get it!
As long as other people have sharing turned
on and their iTunes up, you can listen to their
songs. Similarly, sharing your songs will have
little, if any, performance effect on your com-
puter and will not interfere with your listening
to iTunes as you want to.
Technique 38 shows you — using detailed
instructions — how to share your music with
other users on your network.
6.
Skip the Store panel for now.
This pertains to the iTunes Music Store, which
we discuss later in the chapter.
7.
Click the Advanced icon (see Figure 42-10).
Here, you can
• Figure 42-10: Use the Advanced panel to dictate whether
iTunes manages your music files.
 Use the Change button to tinker with the
Music folder location.
If you move your music files from one drive 
to another or want to use iTunes on a different
music collection, change the Music folder loca-
tion in the Advanced preferences panel.
 Set the Streaming Buffer Size to Large. 
(You really should.)
 Select the Keep iTunes Music Folder
Organized check box. (Trust the app.)


AIFF: AIFF is an uncompressed standard format for
sound files on the Macintosh. It provides great qual-
ity but at a high price in terms of disk space. A CD is
in AIFF format normally, taking up around 700MB
(as opposed to 70MB in MP3 format).

MP3: MP3 is the format that started the whole digi-
tal music boom. It turned music into files one-tenth
of their normal size without significantly sacrificing
sound quality.

WAV: WAV is the Microsoft version of AIFF. Yuck!
Besides the format used, iTunes lets you adjust some of the
specific settings, by choosing Custom from the Setting pull-
down menu. After you do this, you’ll find three pull-down
menus for configuration. First, the Stereo Bit Rate affects
both your file size and the sound quality. The higher the bit
rate, the higher the quality and the bigger the file. The 128
Kbps is the default setting, but you might want to up this
some, particularly if you’re likely to burn audio CDs from
your iTunes collection, in which case there will be poten-
tially noticeable quality loss. Larry normally opts for a set-
ting of 192 Kbps, which is a nice compromise between
quality and file size.
Next, you’ll want to leave both the Sample Rate and
Channels settings on Auto. There’s no need to mess with
these.
Making the iTunes Window
Look the Way You Want
Before doing your thing with iTunes, you ought to
customize the iTunes window. Start with which ver-
sion of the window you’d like to see:

The full-screen version (as shown in Figure 42-11)

The optimal version: To view the full iTunes
screen optimally (so that it takes up as much
space as needed or as it can), Option+click the
green button in the upper-left corner of the 
window.

The minimized version (see Figure 42-12): Switch
to this format by clicking the green button. Click
on the green button again to go back to the full-
screen version.
There are two schools of thought when it
comes to letting iTunes manage your music
files. If you don’t want to think about this
process at all, let iTunes do the work and don’t
go meddling in the Music folder yourself. On
the other hand, if you like a more hands-on
approach, turn off the Keep iTunes Music
Folder Organized option and you’ll never have
your files rearranged just because you made
some edits to a file in the iTunes application
(like changing a song or album name).
 Select the Copy Files to iTunes Music Folder
When Adding to Library check box. (Again, let
iTunes do the work.)
You can override the iTunes setting that copies
music to your folder when added to your
library by holding down the Option button
when you drag a song into iTunes. That way,
you can listen to a track with iTunes without
making it part of your permanent collection.
8.
After you tweak all your settings, click OK.
9.
Enjoy iTunes!
A Word on Music Formats
When you import music into iTunes and onto your com-
puter, you have to make a few decisions first. These deci-
sions affect the size that each file takes up on your computer
and the sound quality that it provides. It’s important to real-
ize that there’s an inverse relationship between the two: the
higher the quality, the larger the file size. All the important
sound settings can be made using the two pull-down
menus found in the Importing preferences panel.
iTunes supports four audio formats:

AAC: AAC is the default setting for iTunes. It pro-
vides a better quality than MP3 at a smaller file size.
The only drawback to AAC is that not all computers
or players can recognize the format. If you play your
music as MP3s in a CD player or don’t use an iPod
as your portable device, avoid this format until it’s
better supported.

Making the iTunes Window Look the Way You Want
337
• Figure 42-11: Both the full-screen and optimal versions of
iTunes looks more or less like this.
• Figure 42-12: Use the minimized version of iTunes to
display the bare necessities.
Within the minimized version, you can still see
the song name and time. Click the song name
to rotate among song, artist, and album. Click
the time to rotate among song length, how much
of the song has been played, and how much is
remaining. Click the small circle on the left to
switch between the display and the equalizer. If
multiple tasks are going on (like importing a CD
or copying music to an iPod), clicking this circle
cycles through that information as well.

The really small version (see Figure 42-13): If
you’re in the minimized version, you can make it
smaller by resizing the window, using the lower
right-hand corner.
• Figure 42-13: If you want to control iTunes and nothing
more, use this window version.
Within the full-screen version, you can do a lot to
customize the window.
1.
Bring up the View Options menu (as shown in
Figure 42-14) by choosing Ô+J or choosing
View Options from the Edit menu.
• Figure 42-14: Customize the iTunes window like you
would any window in the Finder.
2.
Select check boxes for every column you want
to view.
3.
Clear those check boxes for every column that
you don’t need (or don’t need regularly).
Yes, we’re talking about Beats Per Minute.
The only column that you cannot remove or
even move is the Song Name. Notice that it’s
not listed in the View Options menu (refer to
Figure 42-14).
4.
Click OK.
5.
In the iTunes window, click and drag the col-
umn names to rearrange them.
6.
Control+click any column heading to bring up
its contextual menu (see Figure 42-15).

Technique 42: iTunes: Rockin’ in the (Partially) Free World
338
If you keep your music organized, you’ll find
that editing songs becomes really quick thanks
to iTunes’ AutoFill feature. From your existing
library of artists, albums, and genres, iTunes
will guess what you’re typing in these fields
and fill it in for you.
Searching for tracks
iTunes supports two methods for finding specific
songs: browsing and searching. Our three best tips
for finding a song or artist are

Click the Browse button (it looks like an eye, in
the upper-right corner) or press Ô+B to open
and close the browsing panels (see Figure 42-16).
• Figure 42-16: The Browse button appears at the top of
the iTunes window.
Use the Browse tool to browse by genre, artist,
or album.

Choose a category from the Search pull-down
menu to narrow your search before you enter
your keywords (see Figure 42-17).
The Search box in iTunes immediately begins
searching as soon as you begin typing. This is
both handy and a pain. If you know you’re search-
ing specifically for an artist or a song, select this
option first, and then enter your keywords.
• Figure 42-15: Use contextual menus in iTunes to work
with the window settings.
7.
Choose Auto Size All Columns to adjust the 
column widths automatically.
Notice that you can also add and remove
columns via the contextual menu (if you don’t
feel like using the View Options prompt).
Managing Your Music
After you import or purchase a slew of music, you’ll
need to be able to manage and navigate through it with
ease. In this section, we cover the best techniques,
without any of the beginner step-by-step stuff you’ve
probably already figured out.
Editing song information
You can edit information for individual songs in
many ways:

Select a song and press Ô+I to bring up the Get
Info panel.

Click within any one field to change just that
field.

Select multiple songs and press Ô+I to edit
information for several songs at once.
With this method, you’ll only want to tweak
broad factors, like the artist name, the year of
release, the album name, and the genre.

Managing Your Music
339

Select a playlist in the left-hand column to
browse or search within it.
By default, the Search and Browse tools look
through an entire collection, but you can limit
both of these by selecting a playlist and then
searching or browsing (see Figure 42-18).
• Figure 42-17: Fine-tune a search by clicking the
magnifying glass icon.
• Figure 42-18: Browse through parts of your library by
first selecting a playlist.
Creating playlists
You can save yourself a lot of time, or just kill some
time, by playing around with playlists. Here are some
of the cool things that we’ve come to appreciate:

Press Ô+Delete to remove a song or playlist
without getting the confirmation dialog.
(Deleting a song from a playlist does not
remove it from your collection; to do that,
remove a song from the Library list.)

Create a new playlist by
 Selecting a bunch of songs and then
Shift+clicking the Add button.
 Selecting a bunch of songs and dragging them
into a blank area in the Source column.
 Selecting a bunch of songs and pressing
Shift+Ô+N.

Option+click the Add button to create a Smart
Playlist.
Smart Playlists are relative newcomers to the
world of iTunes. Standard playlists have set
songs in them (selected by dragging the song
from the Library into the playlist). Smart
Playlists let you set parameters (such as artist
name, year the song was released, your ranking
of the song, genre, and more). iTunes will then
create a playlist that matches your criteria. You
can further limit your Smart Playlist to a certain
length, like eight hours of total music (say, if
you’re taking an eight-hour car trip).
Adding album covers
If you like eye candy with your iTunes (and we’re not
talking about the Visualizer toy here), you’ll love the
artwork feature added in iTunes 4. It brings you one
step closer to having the CD but without the fragile
jewel case (or the liner notes). The songs that you
purchase at the iTunes Music Store come with the
artwork already. For the other 2,000 songs you have
in your collection, you’ll need to manually add
album covers. Or, if you actually have, you know,
better things to do, try these:

Fetch Art for iTunes (http://staff.washington.
edu/yoel/fetchart, free).
This script automatically scans through
Amazon.com for the songs you select and

If you use the iTMS shopping cart, the Music
Store playlist becomes an expandable folder
that shows both your purchased music and
your shopping cart. You can add items to the
shopping cart over multiple sessions and buy
them all when that paycheck comes in.

If you’re on a slow network connection (read:
modem), select the Load Complete Preview
Before Playing check box to improve your 
preview quality.
• Figure 42-19: Adjust the iTunes Music Store settings in

www.dogheadbone.com/projects.php, free).
If Fetch Art for iTunes doesn’t come through,
download and use this AppleScript to search
Google’s images pages for the album cover. 
From there, you can download and install it.
Blowing Your Paycheck at 
the iTunes Music Store
The iTunes Music Store looks like it just might be the
most popular (legal) music downloading software
around. It was an immediate hit with Mac users, and
now our lesser Windows brethren can finally under-
stand exactly the kind of things that we’ve been
crowing about for years: 50 percent innovation, 50
percent really, really cool.
To use the iTunes Music Store (let’s just call it the
iTMS for short), you need either an Apple ID or a
.Mac account. First, click the Music Store option in
the Source column. Then click the Sign In button
next to Account (on the far right of the screen) and
you’ll be taken through these steps that follow. If you
have a .Mac account, Apple most likely already has
your credit card, saving you a step (for better or for
worse).
Within the preferences panel, click the Store icon to
adjust a few of its preferences (see Figure 42-19).
This is what you need to know:

If you don’t want to be tempted, clear the Show
iTunes Music Store check box.

If you’re of the instant gratification type, opt
for one-click shopping.

If you prefer larger debits on your credit card,
go with the Shopping Cart.

I
f you have a digital camera and you’re not using iPhoto already, you’re
really missing out. iPhoto is a simple, yet effective, application for
managing your digital photographs. In this Technique, we shy away
from the basics (such as importing and viewing images), instead focusing
on the best and quickest ways to do specific things within the applica-
tion. Then we address your digital library: what to do with all those
images you’ve imported over the years. Finally, we demonstrate a couple
of techniques for posting your images as an online, viewable catalog.
iPhoto is a great application and seems to be more than sufficient 
for nearly every user. If it’s not to your liking, many people use iView
Media ($30) or iView MediaPro ($160). They’re both available from
www.iview-multimedia.com, where you can also download the free
iView Catalog Reader for managing your library.
Best iPhoto Practices
The basics of using iPhoto are easy to master, but you can do a number
of little things to use the application more productively. We go through
these in somewhat random order.
Preferences
Some of the settings in the iPhoto’s preferences panel will affect your 
productivity, such as

• Figure 43-1: iPhoto’s Preferences panel.
Whatever you decide to do with the double-
click setting, click the Select button to choose
your external editor, such as Photoshop
Elements. Just Control+click an image to bring
up a contextual menu that offers you the
option of editing the image in your external
editor (see Figure 43-2).

Rotate: Different cameras display rotated images
in different directions (clockwise versus counter-
clockwise). Change your rotate button to match
your camera so you can easily adjust how the
image is displayed.
If your Rotate setting works correctly for you
most of the time but you need to rotate an
image the other way on occasion, hold down
the Option button while clicking Rotate within
the main iPhoto window.

Mail: One of the nice features in iPhoto is the
ease in which you can e-mail a picture to some-
one. In order for this feature to work, however,
iPhoto must know what mail application you use.
Establish that here, select an image in the main
iPhoto window, and then click Email to be
prompted (see Figure 43-3) for how the photo
should be formatted when you send it.
• Figure 43-2: iPhoto’s contextual menu offers quick access
to frequently used features.

image’s size and information in iPhoto first.
Creating a new Photo Album quickly
The iPhoto application uses Photo Albums to help
you organize your digital images. Even though all
your images are primarily stored in the Photo
Library — the first item listed in the left-hand 
column — subsets can be grouped into albums,

Technique 43: Working with iPhoto

Editing images with ease
After you import your images, you might want to
tweak them some. This can be accomplished by
using iPhoto’s basic tools or with an external appli-
cation such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Elements,
or the open source The GIMP. We don’t have space
in this book to discuss basic editing techniques, but
here are our best editing-related tips:

Set your preferences for a default action 
when you double-click (refer to Figure 43-1);
otherwise, use the contextual menu (refer to
Figure 43-2).
If you want to use iPhoto for your editing, make
this explicit in your preferences (by selecting
Opens in Edit View under Double-Click). If you’d
rather use another application, set the double-
click to launch that (by using the Select button
after selecting Opens in Other). In either case,
when you want to edit an image using other than
the default tool, Control+click to see your options.

If you use a separate iPhoto window for editing,
customize its toolbar.
The separate iPhoto windows have a toolbar 
at the top, like most other Panther windows. 
The window can be customized by using the
Customize Toolbar option under the Window
menu. This brings up a palette of tools (see
Figure 43-5) that you can add to the window’s
toolbar. Drag items from the palette to the tool-
bar to create a custom toolbar.
• Figure 43-5: Customize the window toolbar to display
the tools you use most.
organized based upon theme, location, and so forth.
(Think of Photo Albums as the equivalent of the
iTunes playlist.) You can create a new Photo Album
by choosing New Album from the File menu and then
dragging all your images into this new folder, but
this method is faster:
1.
Open iPhoto.
2.
Select Photo Library in the left column to view
all your images.
3.
Ô+click images to select the images for the
Photo Album.
4.
Drag these images into the blank area in the
left-hand column, below the Trash.
You’ll see a green plus circle appear, along with
the number of images being moved in a red circle.
5.
The new album (Album-1) will appear with the
photos in it (see Figure 43-4).
• Figure 43-4: The new Photo Album is automatically
created by iPhoto.
6.
Double-click the new album’s name to change it.
7.
Delete the default name, type a new one, and
you’re done!
You can also create a new album by dragging
a folder of images from the Finder into the
iPhoto Library list column. The album is cre-
ated with the same name as the folder, and all
the images are imported automatically.

After you edit a photo, you can undo the effects
by selecting Revert to Original from the contex-
tual menu that appears when you Control+click
an image.
This feature works even after you’ve quit and
returned to iPhoto because iPhoto doesn’t let
you make alterations to the original photo.
Instead, it creates a copy of the image and makes
changes to it.
Working with Your Digital
Library
If you take a lot of digital photographs, your hard
drive will quickly fill up with images. This isn’t ideal
for your computer and, more annoyingly, will bog
down iPhoto every time you use it. From the experi-
ence of importing and managing several thousand
photos (no, we are not making that up), here is our
best timesaving advice for importing, managing, and
storing your digital photographs.
Importing images
One of the ways in which iPhoto has grown is its
streamlined importing capability. You can now hook
up your camera to your Mac (depending upon the
camera and the Mac) and import your images
directly into iPhoto.

Let iPhoto erase the camera contents after each
transfer.
As Marc has painfully discovered, if you use your
camera’s media card for photos and movies (which
many cameras are now capable of), you can easily
forget the movies and accidentally delete them by
manually reformatting the media. By letting iPhoto
take care of deletions, your photos will be deleted,
but everything else will remain untouched. Just
mark the Erase Camera Contents after Transfer
check box before clicking the Import button
(under the Import tab).

Use a media reader adapter instead of a direct
connection to your camera.
For very little money — $10–$20 — you can pur-
chase a media adapter so that you can access
your virtual “rolls of film” without using your
camera. In all likelihood, such a connection
would be much, much faster than the likely USB
cable that your camera uses, particularly if you
pick up a FireWire model. After you mount a
media card, you can import the images by drag-
ging them from the Finder into iPhoto.

If you want to import movies recorded on your
camera, use Apple’s Image Capture application.
Image Capture is a multifunction tool that doesn’t
get much press. It can be used to do everything
from sharing cameras and scanners to importing
contents from a media card.

Have iPhoto store your photographs in your
Pictures directory.
That’s what it’s there for, after all. Plus, your
images will be backed up with the rest of your
Home directory.
You can import an image from a disk (instead
of a camera) by dragging the folder containing
the images into the photo viewing area of
iPhoto. The application will use the folder’s
name as the film roll name. If your folder is
nested with subfolders, each subfolder
becomes its own film roll.
Managing your images more efficiently
After downloading a batch of images, you usually
want to rotate the ones in portrait orientation first.
We recommend this timesaving procedure:
1.
Make sure that you can view most of the images
and you can see the orientation clearly.
Use the Zoom slider to present the images at an
appropriate size.
2.
Select all the images that need to be rotated
clockwise.
You can select multiple images by Ô+clicking.

Technique 43: Working with iPhoto
346

You won’t slow down iPhoto like choosing larger
images does.

You get smaller file sizes, which makes placing
images on the Web or e-mailing them easier.
The only reason why you won’t want to use less than the
maximum number of pixels is if you plan on printing the
images in sizes larger than 5 x 7 inches. Images with small
file sizes result in poor image quality in a print that size.
Our advice is to use an image size around 2–3 megapixels
but at the highest image quality. This gives you a high-
enough resolution for editing and lets you use an image as
your Desktop without stretching — but still gives you a very
printable picture.
Storing your images to save space and time
You don’t want to keep all your photographs in
iPhoto at all times for three reasons:

Digital images take up an incredible amount of
disk space.

iPhoto’s performance suffers.

Finding images is much harder.
If your Photo Library is nearing 650MB, burn your
archived images to a CD to save space:
1.
Select the Photo Library in the left-hand 
column.
2.
Click the Information button (which bears an i )
at the bottom of the column.
If you select the entire Photo Library, the infor-
mation panel will show you how large it is on
your hard drive.
3.
Click Burn (under the Organize tab) to archive
the library to a disc.
4.
Insert a blank CD-R (you’ll be prompted 
for one).
5.
Click the now-flashing Burn button.
3.
Click the Rotate button.
Remember to use the iPhoto Preferences to set
the default rotation direction.
4.
Select all the images that need to be rotated
counterclockwise.
5.
Hold down Option while clicking Rotate.
After an image is in iPhoto, you can

Drag it into Photoshop or another application for
editing.

Click the Desktop button (under the Organize
tab) to set the selected image as your Desktop
(see Figure 43-6).
• Figure 43-6: Use the Organize tools to quickly do
common things with an image. 

Send it to a buddy by dragging it into an iChat
Instant Message window.
Deleting an image in iPhoto doesn’t actually
delete the image from your hard drive. You
must empty iPhoto’s Trash to formally remove
the photograph (which also deletes the image
from your computer).
How Many Megapixels Are Enough?
Today’s digital cameras take images starting at 2 mega-
pixels and easily going up to 5 or 6 megapixels, even for
consumer-level cameras. But how many megapixels do you
really need to use? All digital cameras let you adjust the size
(in number of pixels) and quality (based upon format and
compression) of the pictures that they take. Choosing a
lower image size has many benefits:

You can fit more images on whatever media your
camera uses.

You use far less disk space.

6.
Click Burn in the Burn Disc prompt.
7.
After the CD has been made, close iPhoto.
8.
Switch to the Finder.
9.
Find the Photo Library folder.
Presumably this is in your ~/Pictures directory.
10.
Delete the entire Photo Library folder.
11.
Insert the CD at any point in time to review the
stored images.
If you need help managing your libraries, check out

iPhoto Buddy (http://nofences.net/
iphotoBuddy, free): iPhoto Buddy makes manag-
ing multiple iPhoto libraries easier. You can work
with subsections of your digital collection, even
if they’re located on different media (your hard
drive, CDs, and so forth).

iPhoto Library Manager (http://homepage.
mac.com/bwebster/iphotolibrarymanager.html,
free): This application works much the same as
iPhoto Buddy but is AppleScript-able.
Creating an Online Photo Album
Putting your photos online is really easy if you have
the right software. If you have a .Mac account, you
can put your photos online by following these steps:
1.
Select a Photo Album in the left-hand window.
2.
Click HomePage.
3.
Edit the page title, picture frame style, and 
so forth from the Publish HomePage dialog
(see Figure 43-7).
4.
Click the Publish button.
You can only publish up to 48 images at once
by using these steps. If you have more images
than that in a Photo Album, break them up
into multiple albums.
iPhoto uploads all the images.
The beauty of this system is that iPhoto automat-
ically resizes the images to be more Web-friendly
and creates a page of thumbnails.
5.
When iPhoto is finished, it gives you the URL
for your new site (see Figure 43-8).
• Figure 43-7: Quickly customize how you want your Web
site to look. 
• Figure 43-8: You are prompted after iPhoto finishes
uploading your new site.
You can also use the .Mac Slides Publisher tool
to turn your online pictures into a screen saver
for other Mac OS X users.

Technique 43: Working with iPhoto
348

Use Image Capture. The Image Capture applica-
tion can also build Web pages for you. After you
connect a camera, open Image Capture. Then
choose Build Web Page from the pop-up menu.
The Web pages themselves will be created and
stored in your ~/Pictures folder. 

Use a commercial tool like Image Rodeo (www.
imagerodeo.com, $30). Image Rodeo, although
not free, ties in nicely with iPhoto and provides
some more sophisticated features than the other
tools listed. Specifically, it has many available
templates and lets you define your own.
If you don’t have a .Mac account, you still have
options. Both of these tools will generate the Web
pages for you, but you need to have your own Web
site in order to make them public (or be able to host
Web sites on your computer, see Technique 39). After
one of these applications creates the pages, just upload
them to their final destination. (Your ISP — which
will most likely provide a limited amount of free Web
space — or Web hosting company will provide you
with the requisite details.)

Staying on
Schedule with iCal
I
Cal is Apple’s nice little scheduling application that, along with the
Address Book, pretty much means that you never need to buy any
Personal Information Management (PIM) software again. Not only does
iCal have all the features that you would ever use, but it also uses a stan-
dard format that makes it compatible with alternative software. This is a
great asset if you share calendars with other users who might (or might
not) also be using a Mac.
In this Technique, you find out the fundamental keyboard shortcuts and
some best-usage techniques. Then you see how to easily subscribe to
someone else’s calendar and publish your own calendars online. After
that, pick up some cool tips and tricks for using iCal. Finally, you see
some of the alternatives that you can use if iCal doesn’t suit you. But
first, make sure that you know how to create and use a basic Calendar.
Creating Calendars and Events
Everything in iCal relies upon one basic thing: a Calendar, which is more
than just a collection of hours, days, weeks, and months. A Calendar is a
collection of data — including all those elements, plus events (scheduled
occurrences) and To-Do list items — grouped into subjects.
iCal comes with two Calendars from the start: Home and Work, meant 
to record your personal and work happenings, respectively. You can 
subscribe to other calendars (see “Subscribing and Publishing”), like U.S.
holidays, the schedule of Chicago Bulls games, listings of movie releases,
and more. Or, you can add your own Calendars.
Here are the benefits of this multi-calendar structure:

Search and browse Calendars by subject (work versus home versus
school).

Share specific Calendars with others. (Share a work Calendar but not
your personal one.)

Color-code your life to make managing your schedule easier.

• Figure 44-2: The Info panel, showing the details for a
calendar.
More important than knowing how to create a
Calendar is how to add an event. Follow these steps:
1.
Select a Calendar by clicking its name in the
Calendars window.
Choose which Calendar the event goes in
before it can be added. If an appropriate
Calendar doesn’t yet exist, use preceding 
steps to add one.
2.
Double-click under the event’s date (or start
date) to add the event.
The easiest way to add an event is to double-click
the day of the event. Be sure to click underneath
the day’s number rather than the number itself
(which will display that day’s events, rather than
add a new event).
3.
Click the i in the lower-right corner of the iCal
window to bring up the Info panel (if it isn’t
already visible).
To create a Calendar, just do this:
1.
Choose New Calendar from the File menu.
A new Calendar will appear in the Calendars list
in the upper-left column of the iCal window (see
Figure 44-1).
• Figure 44-1: Create a new Calendar here.
2.
Type the new Calendar’s name.
After you create a new Calendar, it’s named
Untitled by default but is already highlighted.
Just begin typing to rename the Calendar.
3.
Press Return to finish the renaming.
4.
To hide any Calendar, clear the check box next
to its name.
The check box next to a Calendar’s name indi-
cates whether that Calendar (and its events
and To-Do items) is visible. By toggling these
check boxes, you can more easily see only the
information you want.
5.
To change a Calendar’s properties, click the i
in the lower-right corner of the iCal window to
bring up the Info panel (see Figure 44-2).
Within the Info panel, you can
 Rename a Calendar (click its name).
 Change its color (click the arrows next to the
color).
 Add a description.

iCal’s Main Keyboard Shortcuts

4.
Enter the event’s information by clicking the
fields in the Info panel and typing the proper
values (see Figure 44-3).
• Figure 44-3: The Info panel, showing the details for a
specific event.
Adding and editing events from the Info panel is
very easy. Just click a field (like the event name
or date), type in the new values, and press
Return. Click the All-Day box to schedule the
event for the entire day or for several days.
iCal’s Main Keyboard Shortcuts
iCal, like most applications, has oodles of keyboard
shortcuts available. Rather than provide an un-
learnable list of them all, here are the most useful 
for performing common tasks:

Ô+N: Creates a new event (Calendar entry)

Ô+K: Creates a new To-Do item

Ô+R: Refreshes the selected Calendar

Ô+Shift+R: Refreshes every Calendar

Ô+T: Moves to today

Ô+Shift+T: Gives you the Go to Date prompt 
(as shown in Figure 44-4)

Ô+1: Switches to the Day view

Ô+2: Switches to the Week view

Ô+3: Switches to the Month view
• Figure 44-4: Use this prompt to jump to another date.


or month)

Ô+←: Moves you back a unit (day, week, or
month)

Ô+Option+T: Hides and shows your To-Do list

Tab: Cycles you through the events
• Figure 44-5: The Info panel shows an event in detail.

• Figure 44-7: A contextual menu for a Calendar.
You have a Search box at the bottom of the
iCal window!

Select a Calendar and then enter part of an
event’s name to quickly find that event.

Double-click your way to a shortcut.
Double-clicking creates a new Calendar, a new
event, or a new To-Do item, depending upon
what blank area you double-click. For example,
double-clicking in the Calendars window creates
a new Calendar; double-clicking a date creates a
new event; double-clicking in the To-Do list cre-
ates a new task.
Subscribing and Publishing
The primary role of iCal is to handle your own
scheduling, but you can also subscribe to other 
people’s calendars and publish your own so that
others can see it.
Best iCal Practices
Using iCal is easy, but using it well is a whole differ-
ent matter. Here are some of our best suggestions for
getting the most out of this application.

Keep many different organized calendars.
iCal comes with two Calendars for starters: Work
and Home. Get in the habit of creating new
Calendars for special projects, particular events,
or when the Calendar will be shared with others.
It’s so easy to color-code your calendars and
turn them on and off that there’s no reason
not to use several different ones.

Use iSync and a .Mac account to back up and
synchronize your Calendars across multiple
computers (see Technique 41).

Use iSync to synchronize your Calendars with
an iPod or a PDA.

Discover what contextual menus will do for you
(see Figure 44-6 and Figure 44-7).
As with any application, most of the common
tools are easily accessible by using a contextual
menu. Just Control+click an item — like a To-Do
list task in Figure 44-6 or a Calendar in the
Calendars window in Figure 44-7 — to see what
shortcuts are available.
• Figure 44-6: A contextual menu for a To-Do item.

Subscribing and Publishing
353
Where to find subscriptions
You can subscribe to different calendars for all kinds
of reasons. Maybe you want a calendar that lists all the
San Antonio Spurs games or all the major Hollywood
movie premieres. You can find such calendars and
many others like them through these sources:

Apple: www.apple.com/ical/library

dotmac.info: www.dotmac.info/index.html/
category/6/
When you find a calendar that you want to subscribe
to, just click the Subscribe link provided on the Web
site. This brings up iCal, and you’ll be prompted to
subscribe to that calendar (see Figure 44-8).
• Figure 44-8: Subscribe to online calendars.
The calendars to which you subscribe don’t have to
be corporate and impersonal. For example, you can
subscribe to a friend’s calendar to see where and
when her band will be playing. After someone pub-
lishes a calendar to .Mac or another service, he can
provide you with a URL. To subscribe to it, choose
Calendar➪Subscribe and enter that URL in the
prompt that appears (refer to Figure 44-8).
The subscription prompt has three options:

Refresh

Remove Alarms

Remove To-Do Items
The last two are normally recommended because
they get rid of Calendar items that won’t mean much
to you. The refresh tells iCal to automatically com-
pare your subscribed version of the calendar every
so often (15 minutes, every hour, every day, or every
week), updating your copy as necessary. You can
also manually update a subscribed calendar by
choosing Refresh from the Calendar menu.
Publishing your Calendar with .Mac
In order to share one of your Calendars (so that oth-
ers might subscribe to it), you must first publish it
online. For example, you could create a Calendar of
your travel schedule or your children’s band prac-
tices and then share this with family members via
the Internet. Whenever you make changes to your
Calendar, those who have subscribed to it can also
retrieve these changes.
To publish a Calendar by using your .Mac account,
follow these simple steps:
1.
In the left-hand column, select the Calendar
that you want to share.
2.
Choose Publish from the Calendar menu.
3.
In the Publish Name box of the dialog that
appears (as shown in Figure 44-9), give the 
calendar a title.
• Figure 44-9: Fill out this prompt to publish your Calendar.

Technique 44: Staying on Schedule with iCal
354
Publish your Calendar without .Mac
If you don’t have a .Mac account, you can publish
your Calendar with these other tools:

iCal Exchange: www.icalx.com

iCalShare: www.icalshare.com

Your Mac: If you have a permanent Internet con-
nection (broadband, not dialup), you can use the
WebDAV features of your Mac to publish iCals. A
good tutorial on doing so is at www.gregwestin.
com/webdav_for_ical.php.
iCal Tips and Tricks
iCal can do many things, but here are two features
and add-ons that are to our liking.
iCal and Mail
iCal works with your Address Book and the Mail
application in an unbelievably easy way. From the
Contracts stored in your Address Book, you can add
potential attendees to events and then have iCal and
Mail send them e-mails and handle their replies with
respect to attending. What a brilliantly simple way to
schedule meetings or family gatherings.
1.
Create an event in iCal.
2.
Make sure that the Information panel is visible.
3.
Press Ô+Option+A to open the People window
(see Figure 44-11).
4.
Drag names from the People window onto the
event in the Information panel.
The event displays the list of attendees as you
add them.
5.
Click Attendees and then choose Send
Invitations from the pop-up menu that 
appears (see Figure 44-12).
iCal opens your Mail application and sends the
message.
Your Calendar’s title must abide by standard
URL rules. This means that non-alphanumeric
characters such as punctuation and spaces 
are replaced by representations. For example,
the title Writing Schedule becomes
Writing325Schedule, which is not the desired
result. Instead, use Writing_Schedule, which is
acceptable.
4.
Decide whether to update the Calendar 
automatically.
This option is important for keeping subscribers
abreast of your most current Calendar.
5.
Decide what extra parts of the Calendar you
want to share:
 Subjects and notes
 Alarms
 To-Do items
6.
Make sure that On .Mac is selected in the
Publish Calendar pull-down menu.
7.
Click the Publish button.
When iCal is done, you’ll see a message indicat-
ing two URLs for the Calendar (see Figure 44-10).
The first is for those who use iCal; those who
don’t can use the second URL to view your
Calendar with a browser.
• Figure 44-10: Make note of the URLs for your Calendar.
8.
Give the URLs to family, friends, and 
co-workers.
You can also click the Send Mail button to start
spreading the news.

ent clicks the embedded link, she is given the option
of accepting the event and the option of e-mailing
you her response.
• Figure 44-13: iCal sends an e-mail inviting people to

AppleScript
iCal is, naturally, AppleScript-able. If you’re savvy
with the tool, you can write your own. If you’d rather
ride on the coattails of others (which is fine), check
out some of the AppleScript resources listed in
Technique 60.
Among the 250 AppleScripts that Doug Adams pro-
vides at his Web site (www.malcolmadams.com/itunes/
index.shtml, then look for iCal in the left column),
you’ll find a couple of particular note to iCal users.
For example:

iCal Calling iChat: This script automatically
changes your iChat status message (normally
Away or Available) so that it reflects your
Calendar’s schedule. For example, if you have 
a meeting with Marc from 1 until 3, this script
changes your iChat status during that time to
read Meeting with Marc. You’ll find both a free
version available and a $5 version that has more
features.

iCal Calling iTunes: This script uses iCal to
schedule iTunes playlists. You can have iCal start
and stop playing different lists that you create in

Technique 44: Staying on Schedule with iCal
356
If your office needs a good (and free) schedul-
ing system, you can use iCal on the Macs, and
Mozilla’s calendar on Windows and Linux.

PHP iCalendar (http://phpicalendar.
sourceforge.net/nuke, free): PHP iCalendar 
is a PHP-based calendar application. It also 
uses the iCal format but only allows you to 
view calendars . . . not edit them.

PandoCalendar (www.pandacorner.com/
PandaSystems/PandoCalendar.html, free): If you
want a bare-bones calendar, try PandoCalendar.
It has a basic interface, lets you schedule things,
and doesn’t overwhelm you with features.
iTunes. For example, you can have iCal automati-
cally start a playlist or radio station when you
log on in the morning and then stop iTunes when
you go to lunch. This script also comes in both a
free and a $10, more feature-rich, version.
Exploring Alternatives to iCal
If iCal isn’t to your liking (and we really couldn’t
image why that’d be the case), look into these alter-
natives that provide some of the iCal functionality.

Mozilla (www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar,
free): Mozilla, the makers of the excellent Mozilla,
Camino, and Firebird Web browsers, also makes
a calendar tool that works in the Mozilla Web
browser. It uses the same format for its calendars
as iCal, which means that you can use Calendars
you create in it with iCal or subscribe to Apple-
provided calendars with Mozilla.

Snapping
Screenshots Fast
W
hether you want to show some cool onscreen thing to a friend,
need to do some debugging work with tech support, or are writ-
ing a book, being able to quickly and easily take shots of your
screen is a valuable trick to know. You can always whip out your camera,
take a picture of the screen, have the film developed, and scan in the pho-
tograph, but we think that you’ll like the techniques outlined here better.
We start by going over the built-in system tools that Panther has to offer:
Screen Capture and Grab. After that, special attention is given to Snapz
Pro X, the granddaddy of screenshot applications. Finally, you see a cou-
ple of other options, should these not be to your liking.
Taking Screenshots with Screen Capture
Screen Capture is part of the operating system, which means that it is
available with every application that works with OS X. Screen Capture 
is triggered by several keyboard shortcuts:
Don’t be confused by the Image Capture program found in the
Applications directory. Despite its name, this application does not cap-
ture screenshot images. Its actual role is to import images from a digi-
tal camera. It can also be used to network and share a digital camera
or scanner.

To capture the entire screen, press Ô+Shift+3.

To capture part of a screen, press Ô+Shift+4.
The cursor will then turn into a cross-hairs icon. Click and drag over
an area (see Figure 45-1) to select it. When you release the mouse 
button, the image is taken, and you’ll hear a snapshot sound.

Technique 45: Snapping Screenshots Fast
358

Unlike digital cameras, which normally allow
you to adjust the size of the picture taken in
pixels, you cannot change the resolution of
shots in Screen Capture. You can adjust the size
of your screenshots only by adjusting the resolu-
tion of your monitor.

With the Ô+Shift+4 shortcut, you can toggle
back and forth between a section of the screen
and a window by continuing to press the 
spacebar.

With the Ô+Shift+4 shortcut, press Escape to
cancel the operation.

If you hold down the Control key while 
triggering the screenshot utility (using either
Ô+Shift+3 or Ô+Shift+4), the image is sent to
the Clipboard and is not saved as a file.
Hold down the Control key to send the cap-
tured image to the Clipboard. Then you can
paste this image into an e-mail, a document,
or an iChat session. 
If you’d rather place an image within the document
you’re working on instead of creating an image as a
file on your computer, here’s how:
1.
In your document, place the cursor where you
want the image to go.
2.
Toggle over to the application where you’ll
want to take the screenshot.
3.
Capture the image while holding down the
Control key.
Holding down the Control key copies the image
to the Clipboard. You can use Ô+Control+Shift+3
to capture the entire screen or Ô+Control+Shift+4
to capture a section of the screen or an entire
window.
4.
Toggle back to your document.
5.
Press Ô+V to paste the captured image from the
Clipboard into your document.
The keyboard shortcuts for image capturing
are listed under Keyboard Shortcuts of the
Keyboard & Mouse System Preferences panel.
You can capture a window or object by using this
last method; or, follow these steps to get a more 
precise screenshot:
1.
Press Ô+Shift+4.
Again, the cursor turns into the cross-hairs icon.
2.
Press the spacebar.
The cursor turns into a camera icon.
3.
Move the camera cursor over the window or
object that you want to capture.
When you move the cursor over an object, it
becomes highlighted.
4.
After you highlight the window that you want,
click the mouse anywhere on the window or
object to take the screenshot.
You can take screenshots of items in the back-
ground as long as you can see a piece of
them. For example, if you’re in Microsoft Word
and can see a corner of a Finder window, you
can get a screenshot of the whole Finder win-
dow by highlighting and taking a shot of just
the visible portion.
Here are a couple of things that you should know
when using this method:

Screen Capture saves the screenshots as PDFs.
No other format options are available. That being
said, you can use the Preview application’s
Export feature (under File) to covert a PDF to a
JPG, TIFF, PNG, and more.

The screenshots are automatically saved 
to your Desktop with such useful names as
Picture 1, Picture 2, and so forth.

You cannot capture the cursor.

Taking Screenshots with Grab
359
Taking Screenshots with Grab
The other option for taking screen shots is Grab.
Grab is located, appropriately enough, in the Utilities
folder. It has certain benefits over the built-in Screen
Capture tool. With it, you can

Capture the cursor.

Decide what cursor to view.
If you want a cursor in your screen shots,
select the cursor type from Grab’s Preferences
panel (see Figure 45-2).
• Figure 45-2: Use the Preferences panel to tell Grab what
cursor to capture, if any.

Capture images in TIFF format.
Whereas Screen Capture takes only PDFs, Grab
takes only TIFFs.

Use a more intuitive menu system rather than
keyboard shortcuts.
Grab comes with its own keyboard shortcuts, which
are also duplicated in the Capture menu (see Figure
45-3). These are

Ô+Shift+A: Captures a selection of the screen

Ô+Shift+W: Captures a window

Ô+Z: Captures the whole screen

Ô+Shift+Z: Brings up Timed Screen (see 
Figure 45-4)
• Figure 45-3: Use the Capture menu in lieu of or to
remind you of the keyboard shortcuts.
Timed Screen captures let you take images
while you’re in the process of doing something.
This is the easiest way to capture complex
actions, like dragging a document onto an
application’s icon.
• Figure 45-4: Grab can take delayed snapshots.
After Grab has done its magic, it loads the image as a
new document. This can then be saved as a file any-
where on your computer by pressing Ô+S or select-
ing Save from Grab’s File menu.
In the earlier “Taking Screenshots with Screen
Capture” section of this chapter, we discuss how to
capture images and paste them into a document. If
you’re using an application that supports Services
(like TextEdit), you can accomplish the same thing
by using the Grab tool as a Service.
1.
In your document, place the cursor where you
want the image to go.
2.
Decide what Service you’ll need to use.
 If you want to capture the whole screen (not
necessarily the current one), you need to use
the Screen Service.

Technique 45: Snapping Screenshots Fast
360
• Figure 45-7: Click and drag to grab a section of the
screen.
You can also click a window once to have it
automatically captured.
If you chose Timed Screen, you have ten seconds
to set up the screen as you want it.
5.
Toggle back to your document.
You’ll see the image already inserted into it.
Using Snapz Pro X
Snapz Pro X from Ambrosia Software (www.ambrosiasw.
com, $29) has long been the preferred screenshot util-
ity for Mac writers and developers. In part, this is
because there were no good alternatives (like Grab)
prior to OS X. If you need to do any serious amount
of image capturing, Snapz Pro X is definitely the way
to go. Here’s what it can do for you:

Take images in many formats (JPG, GIF, PNG,
TIFF, BMP, PICT, PDF, and Photoshop)

Resize images

Perform color conversions (say from color to
black and white)

Create borders for your images

Capture or create video
If you haven’t used Snapz Pro X before, here is all
you need to do to take a quick screen capture:
 If you want to capture a part of any screen
(not necessarily the current one), use
Selection.
 If you want to capture the entire screen but
need a few seconds to get yourself organized,
use Timed Screen.
3.
From the application menu, choose the 
appropriate service from Services➪Grab 
(see Figure 45-5).
The Screen Grab prompt appears.
• Figure 45-5: You can use Grab as a Service in applications
that support it.
4.
To capture the entire screen, toggle to which-
ever view you want to capture and then click
anywhere outside the prompt (see Figure 45-6).
• Figure 45-6: Follow the instructions to capture the entire
display.
To capture a part of the screen, toggle to
whichever screen you want to use and then click
and drag over the area that you want captured
(see Figure 45-7).

Using Snapz Pro X
361
1.
Open the application by double-clicking its
icon (assuming you’ve installed it).
Snapz Pro X will load and then run in the back-
ground, hidden from you until you press the
proper keyboard shortcut.
2.
Press Ô+Shift+3 to bring up the Snapz Pro X
interface.
3.
Click one of the buttons across the top to
choose your capture type.
Your options are
 Screen (the whole screen)
 Objects (documents, windows, and such)
 Selection (a selected area of the screen)
 Movie (video)
4.
If you select Objects in Step 3, click the object
that you want to capture.
5.
If you select Selection in Step 3, click and drag
to select an area to capture.
6.
If you have Snapz Pro X set to let you choose a
filename (under Capture Options in the main
panel), you’ll be prompted for the file’s name.
If you change your mind about taking a screen
capture, press Escape to exit Snapz Pro X (or
press Escape twice if you’re already at the file-
name prompt).
If you’re already using Snapz Pro X, there are plenty
of timesaving techniques that you can use:

In the Snapz Pro X Extras folder, you’ll find three
AppleScripts for automating the utility.

You can automatically resize your images as 
you take them, using the scale menu (see 
Figure 45-8).

Set the default filename for the image from the
Preferences tab and disable Choose File Name 
in the main tab.
• Figure 45-8: Resize your images with Snapz Pro X.
If you need to make a series of numbered
images like Steps 001.tiff, Steps 002.tiff, and so
on, let Snapz Pro X do the work for you. Set
the Prefix for the filenames under the File
Naming Settings section of the Preferences tab
(for example, Steps). Each screen capture will
be named starting with that prefix and num-
bered sequentially.

Use the File Creator drop-down menu to associ-
ate the taken image with a particular application
(see Figure 45-9).

Have Snapz Pro X automatically change the col-
oring of the image (see Figure 45-10).

Hold down the Control key to zoom in where 
the cursor is currently pointing (when using the
Objects or Selection options).

Technique 45: Snapping Screenshots Fast
362
• Figure 45-10: Use the Color Change menu to take, for
example, black and white images instead.

ScreenShot Plus (www.pidog.com/
screenshotplus, $5 recommended) uses Apple’s
screenshot tools but lets you resize the images
and use different formats like JPG, TIFF, and
Photoshop.

Constrictor (www.sticksoftware.com/software/
constrictor.html, $10) is small and very cus-
tomizable. It has a timer, lets you choose a back-
drop for your images, offers a range of image
types, and, like Snapz Pro X, lets you dictate
what application the screenshot should open in
by default.

FreeSnap (www.efritz.net/software.html,
free) supports different image formats, can resize
your snapshots, is AppleScript-compatible, and
is free, free, free!
• Figure 45-9: This image will open in Preview.

Change the modifier keys to have Snapz Pro X
launch by using a different key combination than
the default.

When capturing objects, use the Shift key to add
or subtract objects to the selection.
Snapz Pro X was in version 1 when this book
was written, although the beta of Snapz Pro X
2 was in development. Version 2 seems to
offer improved performance and more
advanced video and audio capturing.
More Screenshot Utilities
Although you’re pretty well covered in the screen-
shot area between Panther and Snapz Pro X, you can
explore some alternatives. The main reason to use
any of these is that they’re both cheaper than Snapz
Pro X and more feature-rich than Panther’s tools:

Working with CDs
and DVDs
I
n this Technique, we discuss every possible timesaving technique
there is related to CDs and DVDs. If you have a CD-write (CD-R), CD-
rewrite (CD-RW), DVD-write (DVD-R), or DVD-rewrite (DVD-RW) drive
in or attached to your Mac, you’ll be able to find some good tips here for
burning CDs, making labels, and getting organized. If you don’t (and there
are a few of you out there still), you should at least go through the first
section to tell Panther how to handle your discs.
Setting Your System Preferences
Setting System Preferences to automatically handle discs is an important
configuration step to take. Adjusting these settings once saves you a life-
time of making decisions later.
1.
In the Finder, open the Finder Preferences panel.
2.
Click the Sidebar icon (see Figure 46-1).

Technique 46: Working with CDs and DVDs
364
This setting guarantees that mounted discs also
appear on the Desktop.
6.
Open System Preferences and click CDs &
DVDs (under Hardware).
7.
Use the pull-down menus to tell Panther what
to do when different types of discs are inserted
(see the choices in Figure 46-4).
For most users, the default settings will work just
fine. How and what you change depends upon
how you use your computer. If you always burn
CDs from iTunes and never from another applica-
tion (like the Finder, Backup, or Disk Utility), you
can set blank CDs to trigger iTunes. The same
applies to blank DVDs: Open iDVD when they’re
inserted. If you don’t use the default Apple appli-
cation for a particular disc type (for example,
you don’t use iPhoto or DVD Player), choose
your preferred application in the CDs & DVDs
System Preferences panel.
• Figure 46-4: Save yourself a step by customizing these
settings.
Use the CDs & DVDs System Preferences
panel to indicate the default action for differ-
ent media. You can then overrule this action as
needed (like make a CD using the Finder and
not iTunes, or open a picture CD in iView
Media instead of iPhoto). When those times
come, let Panther open the default application
and then switch over to (or open) the applica-
tion you’d rather use.
3.
Select the Removable Media check box.
This setting makes your discs appear in the
Sidebar of Finder windows when they’re mounted
(as shown in Figure 46-2). It applies to disk images
as well as CDs and DVDs.
• Figure 46-2: You can easily access inserted discs via the
Finder window Sidebar.
4.
Click the General icon.
5.
Select the CDs, DVDs and iPods check box 
(see Figure 46-3).
• Figure 46-3: Show discs on the Desktop to make them
readily available.

Burning CDs
365
Scripting CDs
If you want to get really fancy, you can set Panther to run
specific AppleScripts when different types of discs are
inserted. All you need to do is choose Run Script from the
appropriate pull-down menu in the CDs & DVDs prefer-
ences panel (see the accompanying figure) and then select
the script on your hard drive, using the prompt that appears.
Sample ideas might include opening Backup when a blank
CD is inserted and automatically running a particular type
of backup. Alternatively, an AppleScript could run a com-
mand line utility and write the event log to your CD instead
of the hard drive.
You can create the scripts yourself or download them from
any of the common AppleScript resources online. The best
AppleScript sites include

Mac Scripter: www.macscripter.net

Apple: www.apple.com/applescript

Script Web: www.scriptweb.com
See Technique 60 for more.
Burning CDs
If you have a CD-R drive built into your Mac or
attached externally, you can easily rip audio, video,
or data CDs at your leisure. Considering the cheap
cost of blank CD media, this has become a nearly
ideal medium for today’s computer users. Making
CDs in Panther isn’t rocket science, but we’ll go
through a few tips and tricks that you can use in 
the different applications. Specifically, we target the
Finder, iTunes, iPhoto, and Disk Utility.
Panther’s built-in disc-burning applications are
sufficient for most users. If you want something
a little nicer and more customizable, Toast
from Roxio (www.roxio.com, $100) is the
reigning king.
Making CDs in the Finder
Unless you’ve told Panther to do otherwise (by your
setting in the CDs & DVDs panel), the Finder will ask
you what to do when a blank disc is inserted (see
Figure 46-5). At this point, you can choose a specific
application to open and give the disc a name. After
you do this, the disc will be mounted on the Desktop.
A faster way to create discs in the Finder is to do this:
• Figure 46-5: The Finder prompt when blank media is
inserted.
1.
Set the preferences to show discs in the Finder
window Sidebar (see earlier in this chapter;
refer to Figure 46-1).
2.
Insert a blank disc.
3.
Give the disc a name at the prompt.
4.
Open a Finder window.
The blank disc should appear in the Sidebar of
the Finder window (see Figure 46-6).

Technique 46: Working with CDs and DVDs
366

MP3: The MP3 format retains information about
a file. For example, it associates the artist name,
song, album, and so forth with the file. This infor-
mation is lost when you make a standard audio
CD. MP3 CDs also hold about ten times as many
songs as standard audio CDs.
In order to make an MP3 CD, which many
new compact disc players can play, the songs
must be in MP3 format. If you use the AAC
encoder when you import music, these might
not be playable on many other devices.

Data: A data disc is just that . . . and probably
something you don’t want to be doing with
iTunes. If you want to create data discs, just use
the Finder like you would with any other CD.
• Figure 46-7: Tell iTunes what kind of CD to make.
Making picture CDs in iPhoto
To burn a CD in iPhoto, all you need to do is select a
photo album in the left-hand column and then click
the Burn icon. It’s just that simple. Making CDs in
iPhoto retains all your album information along with
the images. If you’ll be using these CDs on your Mac
or sharing them with other Mac users, this is per-
fect. If what you want instead is just a disc of images,
use the Finder, Toast, or Disk Utility to burn a data
disc instead.
Figure 46-6: Blank CD-Rs appear in the Sidebar (called
Backup Images here).
5.
Use the content area of the window to find the
files that you want to write to the disc.
6.
Drag your files onto the blank disc icon in the
Sidebar.
7.
Click the Burn icon (looks like a fallout shelter
sign) in the Sidebar window to create the disc.
Mount disc images in the Finder Sidebar to
create discs using only a single window.
Making an audio CD in iTunes
The crucial considerations for making CDs in iTunes
are tweaked in the iTunes Burning preferences panel
(as shown in Figure 46-7). Use the radio buttons to
dictate what format your CD will be:

Audio: For an audio CD, select the Use Sound
Check check box to give the CD a more consis-
tent volume level. Set the Gap Between Songs to
2 Seconds. Under Effects, set Crossfade Playback
to 2 Seconds for a more professional feel.

Making Labels and Covers
367
iPhoto cannot copy photo libraries and albums
across multiple discs. You’ll have to either sub-
divide your collection and burn it separately or
use the Finder and lose all the photo data.
When an iPhoto CD is loaded onto another Mac, it
can be displayed in iPhoto, retaining all the informa-
tion from the original user. The new user can do any-
thing with the images he wants except for editing
them (unless the images are imported first). You can
eject a CD in iPhoto by dragging the disc icon onto
the iPhoto Trash icon, just as you would in the
Finder (see Figure 46-8).
• Figure 46-8: Drag a CD to the iPhoto Trash to eject it.
Also see Technique 43 on using iPhoto to
manage your digital library.
Making data CDs in Disk Utility
If you want something a little fancier than the Finder
for your data CD burning, fire up the Disk Utility
application (found in your Utilities folder). One of its
coolest features is the ability to make and then burn
a disk image based upon a folder.
1.
Open Disk Utility by double-clicking its icon in
the Applications➪Utilities folder.
2.
Choose Image from Folder from the Images➪
New menu.
3.
Select the folder to use.
4.
In the Convert Image dialog that appears (see
Figure 46-9), enter a name for this image and
save it on your Desktop.
Notice that you can adjust the properties of this
image by using the Image Format and Encryption
menus.
• Figure 46-9: The new disk image prompt.
5.
After the image has been created, select it in
the left-hand column.
6.
Click Burn to make a CD.
Some of the sample uses of this feature are

Make an exact copy of your Home directory
(assuming it’s less than 650MB).

Make multiple copies of the same directory.

Redistribute software, organized as you see fit.
Making Labels and Covers
After you’ve made your CD, you can get really fancy
and make a nice label and cover for it. These appli-
cations simplify the process.

disclabel (www.smileonmymac.com/disclabel,
$30): This application works tightly with iTunes,
iPhoto, and iDVD so that you can import track
listings and images directly from them. The
application is AppleScript-able and can be used
to make disc labels, jewel case inserts, and DVD
covers.

Technique 46: Working with CDs and DVDs
368
You’ll most likely want to track your rating, the
last time the song was played, and the genre.
3.
Rearrange the columns as needed.
4.
Choose Export Song List from the File menu.
This creates a tab-delimited text file containing
the information from iTunes. This, then, can be
imported into any other application to make
your disc label or jewel case insert.
5.
Open the created text file in TextEdit, BBEdit,
or Word.
6.
Edit the text as you want and then print it for
your CD insert.
Managing a Disc Collection
If you make a lot of discs, you’ll find a third-party
application to help you manage your collection use-
ful. By using one of these, you can locate a file, photo-
graph, or song without inserting and browsing dozens
of discs. Here are three of the available applications:

DiskCatalogMaker (http://hp.vector.co.jp/
authors/VA008942/library/diskcatalogmaker,
$18): DiskCatalogMaker uses a simple interface
to catalog discs. After you register discs with the
application, you use its search engine to quickly
find the file you’re looking for.

DiskTracker (www.disktracker.com/index.
shtml, $30): DiskTracker lets you browse or
search cataloged discs. It also has a built-in 
(but basic) label-printing tool.

CDFinder (www.cdfinder.de, $25): Use this to
build a detailed (and customizable) catalog of
the files that you’ve burned to CD, stored in Zip
disks, or have on your iPod. This catalog can 
be used to make labels or can be exported into
other applications.
If none of these is to your liking, check out
VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com), searching
for catalog, or more generically, disks.

CoverStar (www.autostylus.com, $20): If you find
yourself constantly cranking out CD and/or DVD
backups, audio CDs, photo CDs, and whatnot,
chances are you’ve got stacks of identical-looking
CD and DVD jewel cases — probably because
you haven’t had the time to create individual
covers for each disc. If that’s the case, this app
can help. CoverStar automatically generates art-
work from images, filters, data info, and graphics
to create jewel case booklets, tray cards, and
disc labels in six different styles so you don’t
have to sweat it out on your own. The app can
pull images from iPhoto and Safari, import
playlists from iTunes, screen out fonts that you
don’t want to use, calibrate your printer for opti-
mum results, and more. This shareware demo
won’t allow you to print or save files until you
register.

Discus (www.magicmouse.com/_discus.html,
$39): Discus creates labels and inserts and
comes with 1,000 different background images
and bits of clip art. It runs on both the Mac and
Windows and uses over 15 different languages.

UnCoverIt (www.iwascoding.com/uc/, $15):
UnCoverIt doesn’t create labels, but it does make
covers for CDs, Zip disks, and other common
media. It works nicely with iTunes and iPhoto to
create content listings.
Alternatively, a quick search on Google will turn up
CD label templates that work with common applica-
tions (such as Photoshop and Word) if you don’t
mind doing a little work yourself.
Finally, here’s a nice trick for creating a track list
from a playlist in iTunes:
1.
In the left-hand column of iTunes, select the
playlist you just burned.
2.
Use the contextual menu or the Show View
Options tool to edit what columns are shown.
Obviously, you’ll want to include the title and
artist name at the very least. Depending upon
how detailed you want the track listing to be, you
can also include the album name and track length.

Getting More 
Than Music out 
of Your iPod
I
f you already own an iPod, we don’t have to tell you how great it is for
listening to music while you’re on the road. What you might not know
is that your iPod can do a lot more than play music. In this Technique,
we tell you about some of those other useful and timesaving capabilities.
First, we look at some of the things that you can do with the tools included
in Panther. Next, we show you useful tricks with third-party programs
and shareware tools. Many of these use the features of the iPod in new
and creative ways.
All of these uses will, of course, require free space on your iPod (anywhere
from a few kilobytes to a gigabyte or more, depending upon what you’re
trying to do), so if you have it filled to capacity with music already, you’ll
have to make some room first. If you run into this problem, read the final
section to see how to clean out some space.
Using the iPod for Data 
Storage and Transfer
The iPod is a very good place to store important files. By doing so, you
create backups and can take your stuff with you when you travel. Because
the iPod connects to the Mac via a FireWire connection, you can transfer
even very large files efficiently.
Here are some things you can do with the iPod:

Transfer media files between computers (like large video files from a
DV camera).

Retain disk image (.dmg) files of big software installers for installation
of the same software on several identical machines (useful if you work
in a computer lab).

Keep sensitive information on the iPod instead of the computer’s hard
drive so you can always take it with you (see “Secure, Encrypted
Storage on the iPod”).

you simply disconnect the iPod, and nobody can
get physical access to your sensitive information.

The data is encrypted and password-protected
by using the state-of-the-art, 128-bit Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) encryption built
into Apple’s disk images.
Mac OS X already includes everything that you need
to create a disk image:
1.
Make sure that your iPod is connected to 
your Mac.
2.
Open Disk Utility.
Disk Utility is stored in the Utilities folder, 
naturally.
3.
In the Disk Utility main window, choose New
Image from the toolbar.
4.
In the resulting prompt, enter a name for your
encrypted disk image in the Save As box, as
shown in Figure 47-1.
• Figure 47-1: Settings for the new, encrypted disk image.
5.
Still in the Save As dialog, choose your iPod
from the Where pull-down menu or from the
list of volumes in the left column (if the more
expanded prompt is shown).

Store backups of the most important data. (See
“Backing Up Your Data to an iPod,” later in this
Technique.)

If you’re a system administrator responsible for
many Macs, store a bootable OS on the iPod to
diagnose and repair broken OS X installations.
The organization of your data on the iPod is really
simple:

Use iTunes to manage your music on the iPod.

Use the Finder to store nonmusic files and folders
that you want to carry around or just store there.
(The iPod, when mounted, appears like any other
volume on the Desktop or Finder window, with
an iPod icon.)
The place on the iPod where the music is
stored is hidden from the Finder. Similarly,
your nonmusic files are not visible in iTunes.
Therefore, the iPod provides a perfect and
clean separation between the two kinds of
data.
Because the music directories are hidden in
the Finder, you usually cannot mess up any-
thing. However, if you’re using the Terminal or
disk- or file-management utilities, you can see
these hidden music directories. You should
never erase or otherwise modify your music
files outside of iTunes.
Secure, Encrypted Storage 
on the iPod
If you have sensitive data that you want to keep in a
really safe place, this is for you! Create an encrypted
virtual volume in the form of a disk image on the
iPod. This is secure for two reasons:

The data doesn’t stay on your computer’s hard
drive. When you’re done working with your data,

Backing Up Your Data to an iPod
371
6.
Pick a reasonable size for your disk image from
the Size pull-down menu — the smaller the 
better — and enable AES encryption by choos-
ing it from the Encryption pull-down menu.
7.
Make sure that the Format drop-down list box
is set to Read/Write Disk Image.
8.
Click Create.
9.
At the prompt that appears, enter a new 
password.
Pick a password that’s hard to guess.
If you lose this password, you’ll lose all your data
on the encrypted volume. You can’t recover a
lost password! Because your encrypted data is
most likely very important to you, you absolutely
must not lose this password. Also, remember
to make regular backups of this disk image.
As always, storing the password in the key-
chain is a big timesaver, so you should enable
it. However, if you are really paranoid about
the data on this disk image, clear the Keychain
option in this case and just type in the pass-
word every time. See Technique 52 for infor-
mation on passwords and the Keychain Access
application. 
10.
Disk Utility automatically mounts the new vol-
ume, and you can immediately begin storing
files there.
11.
When you’re finished transferring files, eject
the virtual volume by dragging it to the Trash
on the Dock.
From now on, you have to double-click the disk
image file on the iPod volume every time you want
to work with the data. The disk will mount, and you
can use it like any other removable medium to store
files and folders there (see Figure 47-2).
• Figure 47-2: The disk image file on the iPod and the
virtual volume where the confidential data 
is stored.
Backing Up Your 
Data to an iPod
You can back up your data to an iPod in several ways,
including simply dragging files and folders to the
iPod in the Finder. We also show you two backup
programs in this section.
Regardless of the method that you use, keep in mind
that the iPod differs from the typical backup medium
in a few ways:

Its hard drive is geared toward light use during
music playback. Don’t perform full backups to it
every day. Writing and reading massive amounts
of data very often could shorten the iPod’s life
span.

The iPod’s capacity is probably a lot smaller
than your computer’s hard drive. Be selective
and back up only important files, like your docu-
ments. Leave out things like applications or 
drivers, which you can always reinstall from
installation CDs.

Using .Mac and Backup
If you’re a .Mac member (currently $99 per year, see
Technique 41 for more information), you can use
Apple’s Backup utility. Starting with version 2.0, it
can back up to an external FireWire drive, which is
exactly what an iPod is.
If you haven’t already installed Backup on your com-
puter, you should do so now. You can download the
software after you log in to the .Mac member Web
site at www.mac.com.
For more detailed instructions on using
Backup (without an iPod), see Technique 48.
To set up Backup for the first time, do the following:
1.
Launch Backup by double-clicking the Backup
icon in the Finder (presumably in the
Applications or Utilities folder), which looks
like a small umbrella.
2.
Choose Back Up to Drive from the pop-up menu
in the upper-left corner of the Backup window.
3.
Decide what to back up by selecting the check
box for each item that you want to back up.
Backup shows you a list of items in your Home
directory (see Figure 47-3). For a full backup,
choose everything. However, we suggest leaving
out as much as you can. For example, you don’t
need to back up the iTunes collection because it
takes a lot of space (and thus backup time) and
because you can always reimport the music from
CDs. Further, there’s a good chance you already
have a backup of your music collection on the
iPod, anyway!
4.
Use the + button to add other items to the list,
especially items that aren’t stored in your
Home directory.
5.
Click the Set button to choose the backup 
location.
6.
Click the Create button in the dialog that 
pops up.
7.
In the Save dialog that appears, select your
iPod in the list of available volumes on the left.

Backing Up Your Data to an iPod
373
9.
Click Create to make the new backup location
and return to the main Backup window.
10.
Perform the backup by clicking the Backup
Now button.
You can set up automated, scheduled backups
by using the Schedule button at the bottom of
the window (the one that looks like a calendar).
You have to make sure that your Mac is turned
on, your iPod is connected to your Mac, and
you are logged in at the scheduled time. You
could, for example, leave your machine run-
ning through the night and have it start the
backup at a fixed time. This way, your computer
does the hard work while you’re sleeping.
Using Carbon Copy Cloner
Apple’s Backup utility is tied to a .Mac membership,
even if you only back up to local drives and not to
the .Mac servers. However, if you don’t have a .Mac
account, you can choose from plenty of other tools
to perform backups. An inexpensive and reliable one
that we like is Carbon Copy Cloner by Bombich
Software (www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html; free
but donation requested).
Do this to back up your computer:
1.
Launch Carbon Copy Cloner (see Figure 47-5).
2.
In the main window, pick a source disk from
the drop-down list.
3.
Remove any unwanted items from the Items to
Be Copied list.
To remove an item, select it from the Items to Be
Copied list and click the Delete button (the red
circle with the slash through it).
4.
From the Target Disk drop-down list, select
your iPod.
• Figure 47-5: The main window of Carbon Copy Cloner.
5.
Click the Preferences button to edit your 
preferences.
Carbon Copy Cloner can create two kinds of
backups: identical, bootable copies; and disk
images. In the preferences dialog that appears
(see Figure 47-6), select the Create a Disk Image
on Target check box unless you really plan to
boot from the iPod later on. Booting from the
iPod can be handy in case of a problem with
your computer’s main startup disk. Click Save 
to close the preferences dialog.
6.
Click the little lock symbol and enter your pass-
word in the dialog that appears.
7.
Finally, click the Clone button to start the
backup process.
The backup usually takes a while, so plan on 
getting a bite to eat or taking a nap while it does
its thing.

5.
Make sure to remove as many of the optional
Mac OS X components as possible.
This includes printer drivers, language versions,
and so on. You really want a bare-bones system
to save space on the iPod.
6.
After the installation is complete, unplug the
iPod to make sure that your computer boots
from the main disk and then reboot your Mac.
7.
Open the Finder, connect the iPod, and install
any other disk repair utilities that you have.
To boot from the iPod when an emergency actually
happens, plug in your iPod and hold down the Option
key during a reboot. You should see a list of con-
nected, bootable devices. Click on the iPod icon and
click the right arrow to continue the boot process.
Synchronizing with iSync
Apple adds more PDA-like features to the iPod’s soft-
ware all the time. Currently, this means read-only
access to your iCal and Address Book data. (You
can’t edit this data through your iPod.) Somehow
these Contacts and Calendars need to be synchro-
nized from your computer to your iPod, and that’s
what the iSync program does.
To set up synchronization, do the following:
1.
Launch iSync.
2.
Choose Add Device from the Devices menu and
double-click your iPod’s icon in the Add Device
dialog that appears (see Figure 47-7).
3.
In the iSync dialog, click the Sync Now button
to perform the first synchronization.
For maximum efficiency, allow iSync to launch
and synchronize whenever you connect your
iPod by marking the Automatically Synchronize
When iPod Is Connected check box. This way,
the data on the iPod is always up-to-date with-
out you having to think about synchronizing
(see Figure 47-8). Click the iPod icon in iSync’s
main window to see these settings.
• Figure 47-6: Carbon Copy Cloner’s preferences window.
Emergency Rescue iPod
If your computer’s startup hard disk gets corrupted,
you need to boot from a secondary device in order
to repair and/or rescue the main disk. The iPod is an
ideal device for this purpose.
You can install a stripped-down Mac OS X package
onto the iPod, which includes Apple’s Disk Utility 
for hard drive first aid. Optionally, you can add third-
party hard disk repair products such as Norton
Utilities (www.syamantec.com), DiskWarrior (www.
alsoft.com), or Data Rescue X (www.prosofteng.net).
To create a bootable emergency Mac OS X installa-
tion on your iPod, follow these steps:
1.
Insert the first Mac OS X installation CD.
2.
Launch the installer and follow the onscreen
instructions.
A reboot might be required (see Technique 1 for
more information).
3.
In the Destination screen, select your iPod 
volume and click Continue.
By default, the reformat option is disabled,
which is probably what you want (so you don’t
erase any existing data or songs on your iPod).
4.
Click the Customize button as soon as it appears.

Keeping Notes on Your iPod

You can view your Contacts and Calendars
under Extras on your iPod.
Keeping Notes on Your iPod
The new iPods (with a dock connector) can store
text Notes in addition to Contacts and Calendars. 
To store Notes, simply drag short text files such as
grocery shopping lists, To-Do items, and so forth 
to the Notes folder on the iPod in the Finder (see
Figure 47-9).
• Figure 47-9: Storing small text Notes on the iPod.
Some specialized freeware and shareware tools are
available to make working with iPod Notes even
quicker. We picked out a few of them, as described
here.
Using Notes on older iPods
If you own an older iPod that doesn’t directly sup-
port Notes, various utilities are available to pack up
Notes as Contacts and store them in the Contacts
list. This trick works fine for most short Notes.
A good utility that does this is the free Text2iPod X.
Simply drop your Note text file onto the application’s
icon, and it will store it on the iPod, if it’s connected.
The program is available at http://homepage.mac.

Housekeeping on the iPod
After you use your iPod for a while for music play-
back and data storage, it might fill up. For many 
reasons, including being able to do some of the
other things that we mention in this chapter, you
might want to clean out the data on it quickly. You
have three choices to free up space on the device:

Erase music via iTunes.

Erase data on the iPod volume from the Finder.

Reformat the drive with the Disk Utility 
program, which erases everything (both music
and data).
The nice thing about the way the data is stored on
the iPod is that your music and your other data are
kept completely separate. If you erase files on the
iPod in the Finder, you won’t lose any of your music;
if you clean up music in iTunes, you won’t lose any
of your data.
If you want a completely fresh start, reformat the
iPod by using Disk Utility. Be sure to select the
indented iPod volume in the list at the left. Open the
Erase tab in the right half of the window and then
click the Erase button (see Figure 47-12).
The next time that you launch iTunes, it responds as
if a new iPod has been connected and asks you what
to do.
Do not reformat your iPod unless you’re pre-
pared to completely wipe out everything on it!
directly to the iPod. It even supports older iPods 
by storing the Note disguised as a Contact (see
Figure 47-10).

You can download the script for free at www.
omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/extras/.
Driving directions
PodQuest is an application that allows you to down-
load driving directions from the MapQuest service
to your iPod. It installs an icon in your menu bar.
From there, you can look up directions (see Figure
47-11) and download them directly to your iPod.

MapQuest to the iPod.

Useful Hardware You Might Consider

• Figure 47-12: Reformatting the iPod.
Useful Hardware You 
Might Consider
We cover a lot of software-related tips in this chap-
ter, but we also have a few extra tips about useful
hardware additions for your iPod.
The first is a recommendation for special sealing ear-
phones by Etymotic Research (www.etymotic.com).
They are more expensive than regular earphones
(ranging from $130–$330), but they sound so incredi-
bly good that we would spend the money again any-
time. The improvement over the regular earphones
that come with the iPod is truly remarkable. These
earphones are inserted into the ear canal, and they
seal tightly. This means that ambient sounds are fil-
tered out almost completely, and you can listen at
lower sound levels. The blocking of ambient sound
is especially useful for listening to music during long
flights. These things really demonstrate how good
the iPod sounds!
The second useful addition for older iPods is a 
special FireWire cable made by SiK, called HotWire
(www.sik.com). It’s a special, power-only cable that
you can use to charge your iPod’s battery by con-
necting it to your Mac’s FireWire port. Unlike with a
regular cable, the iPod won’t mount as a disk on the
computer, so you can continue to use it as a music
player while still charging it. On the newer iPods,
you can use a regular cable and immediately eject
the iPod’s disk right after it is mounted automati-
cally. This will have the same effect.

Better Backups
with rsync and
.Mac
I
f you care about any of the data on your computer, you better back it
up. It’s that simple. Although today’s computers are more reliable than
their predecessors, you absolutely must back up your stuff. Accidents
still happen, hard drives crash, laptops get dropped, and computers are
stolen. Without a backup, you’re in trouble if any of these things happen
to you.
We begin this Technique by going over the best backup policies to abide
by. Then we take you through an easy and free backup utility, rsync, which
works with your Mac’s command line. After that, we demonstrate Apple’s
Backup software, which is available to .Mac members only. Finally, we
mention several other third-party tools that might be to your liking if
rsync or Backup don’t fit your needs.
Maybe you’ve never lost data. Maybe you don’t even know anyone
who has. Still, you should back up your computer (either the entire
hard drive or just the most important files). It costs very little, doesn’t
take much time, and makes you look like a savvy, pre-emptive com-
puter user.
Smart Backups
Before we get into how to back up your computer, a brief discussion of the
best policies is warranted. When planning a backup strategy, be sure to

Back up your data frequently. Ideally, you should back up your Home
directory daily and your entire computer weekly or monthly.
When it comes to making backups, the question to ask yourself is,
“How much data can I afford to lose? One day’s worth? A week’s
worth?”

Make multiple backups. You don’t want to discover after your com-
puter crashes that your backup is also corrupted. Use multiple back-
ups and rotate them — use one backup set for a month, use a second
for a month, then go back to the first for a month, and so forth.

Technique 48: Better Backups with rsync and .Mac

The only drawbacks to this application are

You must use the Terminal.

You can’t back up to a CD or DVD.

It has no pretty graphical user interface to
admire.

It has problems backing up resource forks. (See
the sidebar, “rsync, Resource Forks, and Why
You Should Care about Them,” for what this
means and why it might be important.)

You can’t deduct the purchase price from your
taxes.
You can use rsync in many ways. The three most
important and common are

Backing up files locally (from one drive to
another on your computer)

Backing up files remotely (from your computer to
a remote computer)

Backing up files locally from a remote computer
One of the benefits of using rsync — in fact,
this is pretty much why it was created — is that
you can use it to back up files either to or
from a remote server (assuming that it’s also
running rsync). If you’re a Web developer,
this can be a very handy tool!
To use rsync, pull up the command line tool (the
Terminal application) and enter a command with
this basic syntax:
rsync -options sourcedirectory
targetdirectory
For example, a simple way to use the tool would be
to run this command:
rsync -a ~/Documents/WorkFiles/
/Users/Shared/MyWorkFiles
This would copy the entire contents (the a means
that an exact copy should be made) of the WorkFiles
directory (located within the Documents folder of

Back up to different media. You should also
rotate your backups among external hard drives,
CDs and DVDs, and so forth.

Make sure that one backup is in a different geo-
graphical location than your computer. If you
have a backup of your computer in your home
office and the house burns down, you’ve lost
everything.
Leave one of your multiple backups in a fire-
proof safe, at school, at the office . . . some-
where other than where your computer is.

Test your backup. If you have a spare computer
or drive, restore your backup. Otherwise, restore
part of your backup. Doing this before you have
to confirms that the backup worked and that
you’ll know what to do when the time comes.
rsync: Using the Command 
Line to Back Up
If you don’t mind a little command line work, you
can use the rsync utility to perform your backups.
The benefits of using rsync include

It’s free!

It’s very, very fast.

rsync copies only the changed files, thus saving
time and disk space.
Most backup utilities perform incremental
backups: That is, they copy only altered and
new files, and unchanged files aren’t copied
after the initial backup. rsync takes this one
step further by copying only the altered parts
of a file. For example, if you edit a text file, the
new changes are copied . . . not the entire file.

It doesn’t need to be run as an administrator.

It maintains file ownership and permissions.

Did we happen to mention that it’s free?

the current user’s Home directory) to a folder called
MyWorkFiles, located in the Shared users folder. By
copying these files over to the Shared users folder,
other Mac users can access them. Repeated uses of
this command will insure that the most recent ver-
sions of the files in Larry’s WorkFiles folder are
copied over to the public directory.
rsync syntax options
The most important options are (these can, and
often are, combined)

a: Creates an exact archive.

n: Runs a test backup to show you what rsync
will do without actually doing it.
If you’re a little nervous about using rsync,
run it with the -n option to see what files it
will copy without actually copying the files (see
Figure 48-1). The -a indicates that an exact
archive should be created, the -z says to use
compression, but the -n dictates that a trial
run should be taken first.
• Figure 48-1: Run a test backup to see what will happen.

v: Gives you a verbose response.

z: Uses compression to save space.

--exclude: If you would prefer not to back up
certain files, use the --exclude option. For exam-
ple, to exclude the contents of the Preferences
directory, use
rync -az --exclude=Preferences/
/Users/larry /Volumes/Backup

--progress: If you want to see a progress report,
use, --progress.

--quiet: If you don’t want a lot of feedback, use
--quiet. (This is essentially the opposite of the
verbose option.)

--stats: To see some statistics on the backed-up
data, use --stats (see Figure 48-2).
• Figure 48-2: Get more detailed reporting with --stats.
If you use a trailing slash with your source
directory name, you’ll back up that directory’s
contents but not the directory itself. In other
words, rsync -az ~/Documents/ /target
copies everything in Documents to the target
without making a Documents folder.
Backing up Home to an external hard drive
A good way to use rsync is to back up your Home
directory to an external hard drive. Follow these
steps to do just that:
1.
Mount an external drive.
You can use an external FireWire or USB drive, or
even a Zip disk if it’s large enough.
2.
Open the Terminal by double-clicking its icon
in the Utilities folder.
3.
At the prompt, type ls /Volumes/ to list the
drives (see Figure 48-3).

Technique 48: Better Backups with rsync and .Mac
384
• Figure 48-5: Running the actual backup.
In all likelihood, running this command won’t
reveal or cause any problems (it’s just a backup,
after all), but if you see a Permission Denied mes-
sage, or it seems like an extraordinary amount of
information is about to be copied, you might
want to rethink your rsync command.
To actually run the backup, drop the n option.
Your resulting command will now be in this form:
rsync -az --progress --stats ~/
/Volumes/<drive>/path/to/folder.
6.
Check the destination drive in the Finder to
make sure that the files were backed up.
Another cool thing about rsync is that you
can use a cron (a UNIX task-scheduling pro-
gram) to automatically call rsync at set times.
This way, you can back up your computer at
regular intervals (say, every night) without any
extra effort. See Technique 53 for more.
Before using rsync, make sure that your drive is
available. This command lists the currently con-
nected drives, along with their names.
• Figure 48-3: Larry’s computer has a main drive
(Macintosh HD) and an external drive
(40 GB Firewire) mounted.
4.
Type rsync -azn ~/ /Volumes/<drive>/path/to/
destination (see Figure 48-4).
• Figure 48-4: Test the backup.
You’ll want to use the a and z flags to archive
and compress the files. Also use n to preview
the operation. The directory being backed up is
Larry’s Home directory (~/), and it’s also being
backed up to (in this case) /Volumes/40\ GB\
Firewire/G4\ iBook\ Backup. Because the
Terminal has problems with spaces in filenames,
spaces must be escaped (preceded with a back-
slash) in all path names. (In the Finder, the drive
is called 40 GB Firewire, which is then shown
as 40\ GB Firewire in the Terminal.) See
Technique 55 for more on escaping and using
tab completion or the Finder to easily enter 
path names.
5.
If everything’s okay, run rsync by using rsync
-az —progress —stats ~/ /Volumes/<drive>/
path/to/folder (see Figure 48-5).

Backup for .Mac Users
385
rsync, Resource Forks, and Why You
Should Care about Them
One of the problems with using rsync is that it doesn’t rec-
ognize old-style resource forks, which might be lingering
on your computer. Resource forks are still used by a num-
ber of UNIX applications that have been brought into the
Mac OS X platform. This means that some of the backed
up files stored via rsync might not be usable when
restored to your Mac. For this reason, you should rely upon
rsync for your personal files and not the applications or
the operating system as a whole. You should also test
rsync by restoring some files to make sure it works.
As an alternative, you could look into the ditto command,
which does support resource forks. See the manual for
ditto (type man ditto in the Terminal) for more informa-
tion. Another command line option is asr (Apple Software
Restore). Its specific purpose is to copy disk images to make
clones of drives.
Backup for .Mac Users
If you have a .Mac account, you have a pretty good
backup tool already — appropriately called Backup —
which is free for all .Mac users. (Remember that a
.Mac membership costs $99 per year, but you get
some pretty nice other features as well.) In the latest
version of Backup, you can copy files to

Hard drives

Removable drives

CD-Rs and CD-RWs

DVD-Rs and DVD-RWs

iDisks

iPods
In fact, Backup can now perform backups over multi-
ple volumes or types of volumes. For instance, you
can back up your entire hard drive to a combination
of DVDs and CDs.
For more information on backing up files to your
iPod, see Technique 47.
If you have a .Mac account, you can also use
iSync to back up (or synchronize) your Address
Book data, iCal Calendars, and Safari book-
marks online.
The best way to demonstrate all the timesaving tech-
niques involved with Backup is to run through a quick
example, highlighting the key points along the way.
Getting started with Backup
1.
Open Backup.
Backup takes a second to open while it checks
the status of your iDisk. Your current iDisk usage
is shown at the top of the Backup window (see
Figure 48-6).
• Figure 48-6: Start here to use Apple’s Backup application.
2.
Select one of the three backup options from the
pull-down menu (as shown in Figure 48-7).
 iDisk: If you select your iDisk, you don’t need
to do anything more except connect to the
Internet — go to the section, “Deciding what
to back up,” later in this Technique.

Technique 48: Better Backups with rsync and .Mac
386
Deciding what to back up
After you’ve decided where to back up your data, the
next important decision — in fact, the most impor-
tant decision — is what to back up. The Backup util-
ity uses QuickPicks, which automatically identifies
common files and file types (see Figure 48-9). These
include

Safari bookmarks

Keychains

Address Book contacts

Stickies files

iCal Calendars

AppleWorks stuff

iPhoto and iTunes libraries

Microsoft Office documents

Mail
• Figure 48-9: Use QuickPicks to decide what to back up.
Trial .Mac members can only back up stuff to
their iDisk. These files are lost if you drop your
membership. Use Backup only if you plan on
keeping your account.
• Figure 48-7: Back up to your iDisk, an optical disc (CD or
DVD), or a drive.
 CD: If you choose CD, Backup displays how
many CDs are required at the bottom of the
window.
 Drive: If you choose Drive, follow these steps:
1. Click the Set button, next to the pull-down
menu.
2. Click the Create button at the prompt (see
Figure 48-8) to make a new backup loca-
tion. If you’ve already created a backup
location, click Open instead.
• Figure 48-8: This prompt appears if you choose to back
up to a drive.
3. Navigate to where you want to create the
backup or navigate to the existing backup
location and then press Return.

To back up any of these items, mark the check box
next to its name in the Back Up column. To see more
details, select the item and click the Info button
(which bears a lowercase i) or press Ô+I to bring up
the Info panel (as shown in Figure 48-10).
• Figure 48-10: Use the Info panel to preview a group of
files or fine-tune your selections.
To add items to be backed up, you can click the plus
button and navigate to the item, or drag the item
from the Finder and drop it into Backup.
The easiest and most thorough way to use
Backup is to drag your Home folder into the
application.
If you don’t like the list of options made available to
you, use the Edit menu (see Figure 48-11) to quickly
make changes to the list.
Finalizing the backup
The last step is to click the Backup Now button. You’ll
be prompted for a backup name if burning to a CD/
DVD (you might as well use the default). Then you’ll
see a progress bar while Backup continues.
After the backup has finished, click the calendar
icon at the bottom of the screen. A dialog in which
you can schedule regular backups appears (see
Figure 48-12). You can perform regular backups to
drives or your iDisk but not to a CD or DVD.
• Figure 48-11: Use the Edit menu to remove items or
select and clear all the items at once.
• Figure 48-12: After you use the application once, you can
schedule incremental backups.
The downside to using Backup is that if you
stop paying for .Mac, you can no longer use
this application. Therefore, any backed-up files
must be backed up by using a different sys-
tem before you cut your service, or else!

SilverKeeper (www.silverkeeper.com, free):
SilverKeeper is a free product put out by LaCie, a
maker of hard drives, optical drives, and other
products. It’s a simple application, but the price
is right and it can back up to pretty much any
type of drive (CDs, DVDs, external hard drives,
and so forth).

Carbon Copy Cloner (www.bombich.com/
software/ccc.html, donation): We mention
Carbon Copy Cloner many times in this book
and for good reason. It makes a complete backup
of your hard drive as a bootable drive. In other
words, you can back up your disk to a FireWire
drive or an iPod and then run a computer from
that device.
On a different note, both CMS (www.cmsproducts.com)
and Maxtor (www.maxtor.com) make FireWire hard
drives — ranging in price from $300 to $500 — that
back up your Mac at the touch of a single button.
Rather than having to invest in both an external hard
drive and backup software, you can meet both needs
with one of these products.
Other Backup Options
If none of the above options are to your liking
(perhaps they’re too expensive or too geeky),
here are some other backup utilities that you
might appreciate.

ity to search through catalogs of backed-up files,
and backing up computers over a network.

Déjà Vu (http://propagandaprod.com, $15):
Déjà Vu is a very simple backup utility with a
nice interface and the ability to run backups
unattended (read: you can back up your com-
puter while you’re sleeping). It runs as a System
Preferences panel and will even let you back up
to networked servers via common protocols.

ChronoSync (www.econtechnologies.com, $20):
ChronoSync is actually designed to be a synchro-
nization utility between two computers, like a
laptop and a desktop. But because of this func-
tionality, it can also be used for backups. If you
have multiple computers and no synchronization
capability, this is the tool for you.

Battling Viruses
M
ac users have always been somewhat fortunate because rela-
tively few viruses target the Mac operating system. Some people
have complained that there isn’t much software written for the
Mac, but the upside is that not many viruses are written for the Mac,
either. Still, one has to be careful.
In this Technique, we tell you what you need to know about viruses,
how you can avoid getting them, and what to do if your Mac becomes
infected. We focus on using McAfee’s Virex for this purpose, but we list
other options at the end of this Technique, too.
What You Should Know about Viruses
A virus is a special type of application that is able to make copies of itself.
Viruses can be either mere nuisances that do nothing but spread them-
selves around or malicious evildoers that try to destroy your data or cre-
ate security holes. Roughly speaking, the three kinds of viruses are

Worms: Worms are the A-list celebrities of viruses — they get all the
attention. Worms spread via e-mail applications (Outlook Express on
Windows is a particular favorite), removable media (such as CDs or
Zip disks), or network holes (open gateways into your machine; again,
Windows provides for plenty of these). Every time a new worm comes
out, you hear about it in the news as it spreads around the globe, shut-
ting down servers and causing billions of dollars in damage.

Trojan horses: A Trojan horse pretends to provide a service (like
remembering your Web passwords) but really does something else
in the background (like e-mailing your Web passwords to somebody
else). Trojan horses spread by people downloading and installing soft-
ware that they assume to be safe.

Macros: Macro viruses use advanced features of scriptable applications
as their medium for trouble. They are attached to documents and are
activated when that document is opened. The most common problem
involves Microsoft Word. Simple macro viruses wreak havoc with the

application in question; more troublesome
macros use your e-mail client to propagate
themselves.
Because of the problems with macro viruses,
many applications (like Microsoft Word, see
Figure 49-1) prompt you before enabling the
macros.
• Figure 49-1: Microsoft Word asks whether you want to
use the macros in the document being
opened.
Again, other operating systems have much more
trouble with viruses than Mac OS X does, but you
should still be careful. Continue reading to see what
you can do to limit your risk of infection and what
you can do should the worst happen.
Things You Can Do 
to Limit Viruses
What’s more important than knowing what to do
should your computer become infected is knowing
how not to get infected in the first place. These are
our best practices for protecting your Mac:

Use a firewall on your network. Many worms
spread through network holes. Firewalls —
special software that establishes a barrier
between a network and the Internet — prevent
traffic from going through these holes. Whether
you’re using a single computer on a dialup con-
nection or you’re one of a dozen computers on
a network, you can use a firewall. See Technique
40 for more information, including how to enable
firewalls on your Mac (see Figure 49-2).
• Figure 49-2: Panther’s built-in firewall configuration
panel.

Be careful whom you give your e-mail address
to. If few people have your e-mail address, you
have less of a chance that folks will send viruses
to you. It’s that simple.
Limiting the visibility of your e-mail address
minimizes the number of viruses and spam
that you are subject to. Try to keep your e-mail
address off public message boards and Web
pages. You can also follow the anti-spam sug-
gestions from Technique 34.

Don’t open attachments to e-mails. Receiving a
virus as an attachment to an e-mail is not a secu-
rity risk. It’s when you open this attachment —
that’s when the trouble starts. If you really want
to be safe, don’t open any attachments. If you
find this rule to be unreasonable and excessive
(and it is), scan attachments with antivirus soft-
ware and abide by the next rule.

Don’t open executable attachments in e-mails.
Many Trojan horse viruses work by posing as
one thing while being another. For example, sev-
eral popular viruses were spread as a file with
Technique 49: Battling Viruses

Things You Can Do to Limit Viruses

to stop it, but you can establish a Rule in your
Mail application to automatically delete these
annoyances (see Figure 49-3). Technique 34
shows you how to set up a Rule in detail.
• Figure 49-3: Define Rules to handle annoying Windows
worms.

Turn off all Sharing tools. This goes along with
using a firewall to shut down network holes. Your
Mac comes with every Service turned off as the
default; none are turned on unless you specifi-
cally do so. If you turned something on at one
time and don’t need it anymore, be certain to
turn it off. Services are controlled through the
Sharing System Preferences tab, which we dis-
cuss in Techniques 39 and 40.

Don’t assume that you can trust something just
because it comes from someone you know. The
most successful worms worked because they
used a person’s Address Book to send them-
selves out to the world. John Smith receives an
e-mail from his friend, Jane Doe, so he opens the
attachment, launches the virus, and inadver-
tently sends it to everyone in his e-mail client’s
Address Book. Even if someone sends you a file
purposefully, he might not know whether it has a
macro virus attached to it.

Scan every file you download, borrow, take
from CD, copy from a disk, and so forth, with a
virus tool. If you have a virus application — and
you should have one — use it to scan files that
are new to your computer. Even if they come
from a reputable source, like from a CD-ROM, it
can’t hurt.
the extensions .txt.vbs or .jpg.exe. People
recognized .txt and .jpg as benign, but the
.vbs (Visual Basic Script) and .exe (executable)
extensions were actually the ones that counted.
These are both specifically Windows examples,
but you get the point.
To be safe with e-mail attachments, always try
to open them with a specific application rather
than double-clicking them. See Technique 23
for particular methods for opening files.

Keep your antivirus software up-to-date.
Something like 500 new viruses are discovered
each month. If your antivirus software is out-of-
date, you might as well not even have it.
We discuss one popular antivirus application,
McAfee’s Virex, in the section “Using Virex,” later
in this Technique.
Many virus applications, like Virex, provide for
automatic updates each time they run. This is
a very good thing (but does require an
Internet connection).

Perform daily virus scans. If you have a virus
application, run it every time you log in as an
extra precaution. Most antivirus applications
give this as an option in their preferences.

Don’t network with Windows computers. A
Windows virus can’t infect your computer, but
that doesn’t keep it from trying and trying and
trying, which can be an annoyance. If you can,
avoid networking with Windows computers. If
you must, make sure that the Windows users do
everything they must do to protect their machine.

Be careful if you use Virtual PC. You can be
affected by Windows viruses if you run a version
of Windows on your Mac that uses Virtual PC. If
you do, be supremely careful with what you do in
the virtual environment.

Use Rules in Mail. When the next wave of
Windows worms hits, we’re usually pelted with
hundreds of messages. You can’t do anything


Let people know if they sent you a virus. Help
yourself by helping others. If someone sent you a
virus, she might not even know it.

Eat healthy, get regular exercise, and take your
vitamins. So this last step keeps you from getting
a virus, not your computer. It’s still sound advice.
Although it won’t prevent getting viruses,
keeping regular backups of your data makes
it easier to recover after a virus strikes.
Tips for Those Who Also Use Windows
Okay, this is a book on the Macintosh, but some of you
might also use Windows on a regular basis. We all have our
crosses to bear. If you have to use Windows, here are a few
quick tips on minimizing viruses on that operating system:

Don’t use Outlook Express.

Don’t use Internet Explorer.

Turn off every feature that you don’t use.

Have Windows display file extensions.

Use an antivirus application and keep it up-to-date.
One reason why Windows is less secure is that many
applications — like Outlook Express and Internet Explorer —
are tied into the operating system as a whole. Vulnerabilities
in those applications can be used to manipulate vulnerabil-
ities in Windows.
Using Virex
McAfee’s Virex (www.mcafee.com) is a popular anti-
virus application, partially because it comes free
with your .Mac account (although that does cost
$99 per year). Using it is simple, but using it effi-
ciently and effectively requires a little more thought.
Here are some suggestions if you already have the
application:
1.
Open Virex by double-clicking the Virex icon
found in either the Applications or Utilities
folders.
2.
Open the Preferences panel (see Figure 49-4).
3.
Within the Preferences panel, select the follow-
ing check boxes:
 Automatically Scan at Login
You want Virex to scan automatically so you
don’t need to think about it.
 Perform an Advanced Scan of Applications
and Macros for Previously Unknown Viruses
Although this option takes longer, it’s much
more thorough.
 Check for New Virus Definitions at Launch
What’s the point of using Virex if it isn’t up-to-
date? If you have a permanent Internet con-
nection, take advantage of this feature.
• Figure 49-4: The Virex Preferences panel.
4.
Click OK to exit the Preferences panel.
5.
In the main screen (see Figure 49-5), select
Home from the Scan drop-down list.
6.
Select the Clean Any Files Infected with a Virus
check box.

• Figure 49-5: The Virex main window.
7.
Exit the application.
8.
Once a week or so, launch Virex, select All
Local Volumes from the Scan drop-down list,
and then click the Scan & Clean button to
inspect your entire computer (see Figure 49-6).
If you use StuffIt Expander (www.aladdinsys.
com) to decompress files, you can set it to
automatically scan files when decompressing
them through the Expanding tab of the Virex
Preferences panel (see Figure 49-7).
• Figure 49-6: Use the pull-down menu to tell Virex
where to scan.
• Figure 49-7: Have StuffIt Expander scan files that you
download or get from other sources.
Other Antivirus Software
We highlight using Virex as a protection tool because
it’s the current application of choice for your beloved
authors. But there are other options, as always:

Norton AntiVirus (www.symantec.com/nav/
nav_mac/, $70): Norton’s AntiVirus is a solid
application and has been around for a long time.
In fact, Norton’s other applications have been
integral to maintaining Macs for years. Norton
AntiVirus (NAV for short) performs live updates
of its virus definitions to stay current and will
certainly do the trick.

Intego VirusBarrier X (www.intego.com/
virusbarrier/home.html, $60): VirusBarrier
performs automatic updates and can run at all
times to keep an eye out for potential problems.
VirusBarrier also works well with Intego’s other
security products like NetBarrier. You can also
buy packages containing multiple products.

Technique
Keeping Your
Software 
Up-to-Date
K
eeping your operating system and applications up-to-date is an
important aspect of maintaining your computer. In terms of per-
formance, security, and features, the time that you spend updating
software should be considered time well spent.
We begin this Technique discussing how you can update your operating
system (it’s pretty simple, if you didn’t know). Then we discuss some
best practices when it comes to updating other applications found on
your computer. Finally, we go through a few references that you can use
to stay informed when updates become available.
Using Software Update
Keeping your operating system up-to-date is an absolute must for these
two reasons:

It’s the only way for Apple to plug security holes. One of the down-
sides of Panther’s UNIX underpinnings is that your Mac is now vulnera-
ble to UNIX security issues as well. Although this is unfortunate, it
means that a whole world of knowledgeable programmers out there
are catching these problems when they occur. Having security holes in
your computer is a bad thing. Continuing to have security holes after
they’ve been made public is even worse.

It’s the only way for Apple to fix bugs. Nobody’s perfect, and Apple’s
no exception. The more complex a piece of software is, the more likely
it is to have bugs. Apple’s pretty good about fixing bugs, but you’ll
need to update your software in order for those fixes to take effect.
The Software Update utility (see Figure 50-1) is the tool to use to perform
all operating system updates. Just check the boxes next to the items you
want to install and then press Return to begin the process. (You’ll then
be prompted for the administrator’s password.) Software Update has the
added benefit of updating other Apple applications as warranted, like
iTunes and QuickTime. Although you can access this tool through

Using Software Update
395
System Preferences, choosing Software Update from
the Apple menu (see Figure 50-2) is much faster if
you want to quickly update your computer (you can
run an update at your prompting or schedule updates
to occur periodically). In fact, the Software Update
panel in System Preferences (see Figure 50-3) is actu-
ally the preferences page for the Software Update
utility.
• Figure 50-1: Apple’s Software Update application makes
it easy to maintain Panther.
• Figure 50-2: Use the Apple menu to quickly access
Software Update.
• Figure 50-3: Use System Preferences to adjust Software
Update settings.
Updating your software using these tools is fairly
straightforward, but here are some best practices
of which you ought to be aware:

Set Software Update to run weekly. You can no
longer specify a day and time for it to run, so
you’re best off choosing Weekly from the Check
for Updates pull-down menu. This menu is located
on the Update Software tab of the Software
Update preferences panel (refer to Figure 50-3).
At some random time — probably while you’re
doing something critically important — Software
Update will pop up and do its thing.
Because you have to enter your password to
run any updates, you can’t update your OS
at night or when you are away from your
computer.

If you don’t have a high-speed Internet connec-
tion, select the Download Important Updates in
the Background check box. With this option,
also in the Software Updates preferences panel
(refer to Figure 50-3), you can continue using
your computer while the files are downloading.
Then you’ll be notified that the installation is
ready to take place.

Have Software Update ignore the updates that
you don’t need. As an example, if you don’t have
an iPod, you won’t need to update your iPod

Technique 50: Keeping Your Software Up-to-Date
396
4. To reactivate an update that you’ve previ-
ously deleted, choose Reset Ignored Updates
from the Software Update menu.

If you have multiple Macs to update, opt for the
Install and Keep Package or Download Only
options. Using these methods, you can download
the new installations once and then run them on
multiple computers.
If you use the Install and Keep Package update
method, you’ll find the installed package in
the /Library/Packages folder after the instal-
lation is complete. Panther will open this direc-
tory in a new window for you.
Updating Other Applications
Application updaters work in two different ways:
Some modify the existing software, and others
replace the existing software. Using either of these
is straightforward enough (and they should come
with instructions), but make and keep a backup
copy of the software before performing the update
just in case problems occur.
Although we’ve never personally experienced
a problem, proactive users should back up
their files before updating any software. This
is especially true when it comes to installing
major updates to the operating system.
Although unlikely, an update gone awry
can potentially wreck your system.
Updates versus Upgrades
There are technically two kinds of software changes for
applications: updates and upgrades. Updates are normally
minor version changes (like from 7.0 to 7.0.1) that fix bugs
and security holes. These are the most important (for obvi-
ous reasons) and should be provided for free from the
application’s manufacturer. Upgrades are normally major
version changes (like from 6.0 to 7.0) that add features.
These will normally cost you money and are a much larger
download (or will come with their own CDs). In this
Technique, we primarily focus on updates.
software. The same applies to applications you
don’t use. You can effectively delete anything by
following these steps:
1. Run Software Update and select the item to be
ignored in the list of updates that appears.
2. Ô+click to select multiple items (as shown in
Figure 50-4).
3. Choose Ignore Update from the Update menu
or press Ô+Delete.
You’ll be prompted to confirm this action (see
Figure 50-5). Rest assured that you can also
reaccess deleted updates later (like after
you’ve purchased that iPod).
• Figure 50-4: Ô+click to select and ignore multiple
installers.
• Figure 50-5: Like emptying the Trash, ignoring updates
gives you a confirmation prompt.

Staying Informed about Updates
397
Although calling something an update as opposed to an
upgrade is largely a syntactical difference, some people
have taken issue with Apple for releasing what seems to be
an update (going from Mac OS X 10v.2 to 10v.3) and charg-
ing $129 for it. Considering the number of features added
to each new release, Apple could just as easily silence the
critics by calling the versions Mac OS XI, XII, and so forth.
Or by not charging quite so much. . . .
Some applications come with their own updaters
built into the software. Again, you’ll see two general
types of built-in updaters:

Automatic updaters: For example, QuickTime
has its own updater, called QuickTime Updater.
Cocktail (www.macosxcocktail.com; see Figure
50-6), a utility that performs various system
maintenance routines, checks for newer ver-
sions as well.
• Figure 50-6: One of the features of good applications, like
Cocktail, is the ability to check for updates.
Some advanced applications automatically
check for updates at set periods of time (every
two weeks, for example) or every time the
application starts.

Links to a supporting Web page: Other applica-
tions let you check for updates by taking you to
their Web sites. Although this isn’t as useful, it’s
still an easy way for you to keep your software
up-to-date.
To see if an application has some sort of updating
system built-in, check the application’s manual or
help files. Or, look in logical places: the Preferences
panel, under the application menu, or under the Help
menu. Finally, you can always check the manufac-
turer’s Web site to see if they have any updates
listed.
Staying Informed 
about Updates
Before you can update any software, you need to be
aware that an update is available. Although Apple’s
Software Update utility checks this for you (with
respect to Apple software), you need an easy way
to keep informed for everything else. Here are some
recommended resources to keep informed about
what updates are available:

VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com):
There is a whole cult around VersionTracker,
which is one of the premier application informa-
tion sites around. Some fanatics check it daily to
see what updates are available for their favorite
applications. It’s also a great way to see what’s
new for Mac OS X and to find alternatives to
tools you’re already using.
.Mac users have been thanked by Apple with
a free one-year subscription to VersionTracker.
Anyone can use VersionTracker for free, but
those with a membership can take advantage
of more useful tools (membership starts at $25
per year).

Technique 50: Keeping Your Software Up-to-Date
398

Apple Developer Connection e-mails (http://
developer.apple.com): You don’t have to be a
software engineer to be a member of the ADC.
This free membership provides you with a ton
of information. You can also sign up for the
ADC update e-mail, which lets you know when
new software or upgrades to existing appli-
cations come out. It’s not as exhaustive as
VersionTracker, but it is another useful resource.

Application e-mails: Many manufacturers have
mailing lists that you can sign up for that are not
(thankfully) spam. If you want to know when a
new version of StuffIt or BBEdit is available, sign
up at the appropriate Web site or when you reg-
ister the application.

MacUpdate (www.macupdate.com): MacUpdate
is similar to VersionTracker but is free. The site
e-mails you when particular applications are
updated and lets you create custom watch lists
to track your favorite software.

Apple mailing lists (http://lists.apple.com):
Apple maintains a number of mailing lists for var-
ious subjects. Almost all of them have a moder-
ate amount of traffic, so signing up shouldn’t
overwhelm your inbox. Most important with
respect to updates is the “security-announce”
list, which notifies you of security-related updates
available for the operating system. Sign up for
this, and you’ll be one of the first to know when
a new patch comes up.

51
Securing Files
S
ecurity comes in many forms: for example, the security issues
involved with Internet transactions, or the physical security of
making sure that someone can’t steal or physically tamper with
your computer. There’s also the issue of protecting your passwords (see
Technique 52). This Technique is all about securing individual files and
folders on your computer. If your computer never leaves the house, this
might not be a concern, but if you work in an office or travel with your
Mac, protecting sensitive documents is critical.
The primary tool for accomplishing this is FileVault. In this Technique,
we show you how to use that most efficiently. Then we show you some
other popular shareware options, just in case FileVault isn’t sufficient for
your needs. Finally, we let you in on the Secure Empty Trash feature
added to Panther, which lets you safely (and permanently) delete files.
Making the Most of FileVault
FileVault is a new technology to Panther. FileVault makes use of a 128-bit
version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt your stuff.
(Encryption is the process of translating data into an unreadable form,
requiring a password or similar key to make it legible again.) After you
enable FileVault, it encrypts and decrypts the contents of your Home
directory while you work, meaning that you’ll automatically have this
security without needing to constantly manage the process.
If you use FileVault, make sure that you store everything within your
Home directory. Anything kept outside of the ~/ structure will not be
protected!
FileVault is new to Panther, which means that it might not be 100
percent reliable. Keeping unencrypted copies of your stuff and storing
it in a secure location is prudent. For example, you could routinely
back up your Home directory to CDs or an external hard drive and
place those in a home safe or underneath your mattress. (Well, we’re
just kidding about the mattress, but you get the idea.)

FileVault cannot be turned on while other
users are logged into your computer. Make
sure that you’re the user only logged in before
proceeding.
• Figure 51-2: Enable FileVault here.
7.
Enter your master password at the prompt
(see Figure 51-3). (It doesn’t bode well for you
if you’ve already forgotten it.)
A dialog appears that warns you of the conse-
quences of forgetting your master password.
• Figure 51-3: Enter your password.
8.
Click the Turn on FileVault button (which
appears in a prompt) after you’ve read the
warning (see Figure 51-4).
To enable and use FileVault
1.
Open the System Preferences panel.
2.
Click Security, under Personal.
3.
Click Set Master Password.
The Master Password is used to control access
to every encrypted Home directory on the com-
puter. The files themselves are encrypted using
both it and the user’s login password.
4.
In the dialog that appears (see Figure 51-1),
enter the password twice and a hint whose
answer is hard-to-guess, if you want.
• Figure 51-1: Set a master password before enabling
FileVault.
If you lose or forget your master password and
your login password, you are up a creek with-
out a paddle, to put it politely. Whatever you
do, make sure this never happens, or you
might as well say goodbye to all your stuff.
That being said, don’t make your password
obvious — and don’t write it on a note taped
to your computer.

Click OK.

ure 51-2).

• Figure 51-4: The very stern warning reminds you to

9.
Log back in after FileVault is finished doing its
thing.
FileVault will log you out and then spend a few
minutes encrypting your Home directory. How
long this takes depends on the size of your Home
directory.
While you’re in the FileVault control panel (refer to
Figure 51-2), you might consider selecting the check
boxes for these other security features, too:

Require Password to Wake This Computer from
Sleep or Screen Saver

Disable Automatic Login

Require Password to Unlock Each Secure System
Preference

Log Out After x Minutes of Inactivity
Each of these features makes your computer more
secure but also slightly more tedious to work with. If
you’re the only one who uses your computer and it’s
in a safe place, leave these cleared. If you have sensi-
tive data on your computer, keep your Mac in an
environment where others can access it — or just
generally want the peace of mind — enable these
options.
Other Encryption Tools
If FileVault doesn’t exactly float your boat, you can
use a number of other applications to encrypt and
decrypt files. We cover some of the most popular in
this section.
One of the downsides of FileVault is that it will
slow down your computer when you’re work-
ing with files in your Home directory. If you’d
rather not risk that or if you require only cer-
tain things to be protected, use one of the
other pieces of software discussed in this sec-
tion of the chapter.
Disk Utility
Apple’s Disk Utility allows you to create encrypted
disk images, using the same encryption protocol
as FileVault. One benefit is that you can mount the
disk image only when you need it. Second, you can
encrypt only those files that need it: for example,
leaving the 8GB of music on your hard drive
untouched.
To use Disk Utility
1.
Open Disk Utility by double-clicking its icon in
the Utilities folder.
2.
Choose New➪Blank Image from the Images
menu.
3.
In the resulting dialog (see Figure 51-5), make
the following selections:
• Figure 51-5: The prompt for creating a disk image.

Technique 51: Securing Files
402
If you store the disk image password in your
keychain, you can open it without entering the
password. This means that anyone else with
access to your computer can as well. Make a
decision between security and convenience here.
6.
Copy files to the mounted disk image.
The disk image will automatically be mounted by
the operating system. You can now use it like any
other disk.
7.
Eject the disk when you’re finished with it.
8.
To reaccess the files, remount the disk image.
StuffIt
If you pay for the full version of Aladdin System’s
StuffIt (www.stuffit.com, $80), you can create
encrypted StuffIt and Zip archives. A password is
required to access those contents.
Mac GNU Privacy Guard
Mac GNU Privacy Guard (http://macgpg.sourceforge.
net, free) is a free implementation of the popular
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software. It provides a
framework for using PGP within other applications,
like Mail, Entourage, or Eudora. It requires a little bit
of configuration and work on your part, but the price
is right.

This is the commercial version of PGP software
(www.pgp.com, $50), which you can use to encrypt
your e-mail and create secure disk images. Although
it’s not free, it is easier to get started with than the
Mac GNU Privacy Guard.
SubRosaSoft and CodeTek Studios
Both SubRosaSoft (www.subrosasoft.com) and
CodeTek Studios (www.codetek.com) develop numer-
ous security-related products including larger scale
packages. For example, CodeTek’s SafeData Technol-
ogy Suite ($50) cleans out your Internet history,
encrypts and decrypts files, and securely trashes files.
 Give the image a name in the Save As box.
For added security, give your disk image a cre-
ative name that doesn’t indicate its purpose (in
other words, don’t use a give-away like Bank
Account Info). This will keep people from want-
ing to investigate the disk image. On the other
hand, if you’re likely to forget that the disk
image named Brautigan Thesis is actually your
bank information, use a more meaningful name
and trust that the encryption will safely protect
your data.
 Decide where to save the image, using the
Where drop-down list.
 Select an appropriate size from the Size drop-
down list.
The size of your disk image is a cap on how
much information it can store. It’s also how
much room the file will take on your hard
drive, so choose this value wisely.
 Select AES-128 in the Encryption drop-down list.
This is the key step in making a secure disk
image.
 Leave Read/Write Disk Image selected in the
Format drop-down list.
4.
Click the Create button.
5.
At the prompt (see Figure 51-6), enter a pass-
word twice and then click OK.

image and its files.

Using the Finder’s Secure Empty Trash
403
Sending Secure E-mail
If you need to send encrypted mail, Panther now includes
support for the professional Secure Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions (S/MIME) e-mail encryption standard. This
tool requires that both the sender and receiver get a per-
sonal S/MIME certificate, which can be had for free at
www.thawte.com.
Setting up this feature requires a few steps, but after it’s
set up, it works pretty well. If both users have a certificate,
the certificate will be transmitted along with the message.
This certificate can then be added to the Address Book
(technically, the certificate will be added to your keychain,
assuming that the user is in your Address Book) so that it’s
associated with the sender. Thereafter, when you send that
person an e-mail, you will see an additional option in the
mail composition window to send the e-mail securely (you’ll
see a small button with a lock icon, next to the Signature
pull-down menu).
Using the Finder’s Secure
Empty Trash
Also new to Panther is the Secure Empty Trash
option, found under the Finder menu (see Figure
51-7). Whereas the normal Empty Trash option
simply deletes the files in the trash bin, Secure
Empty Trash deletes those files by writing over
them, renaming them, and so forth, before actually
throwing them away. Think of it like crumpling a
piece of paper, putting it inside a bag, and then
throwing the bag away.
Unlike with the normal Empty Trash command,
you cannot recover a file from Secure Empty
Trash. For this reason, we advocate double-
checking the contents of the Trash before pro-
ceeding. (You can see what’s in the Trash by
clicking its icon in the Dock.)
• Figure 51-7: Secure Empty Trash provides a level of
security that the Department of Defense
would endorse (literally).
A Terminal Solution
The Secure Empty Trash Finder feature, like many utilities, is
duplicated as a command-line utility. From the Terminal,
you can securely delete files by using the srm command.
srm filename
srm foldername
The srm command takes several options, including

I: Prompts you for each item being deleted

r: Empties directories

s: Does a simple, secure deletion

m: Does a medium-level deletion

z: Zeroes the blocks on the hard drive (that means it
uses blank data to cover the hard drive where the
deleted file was)

v: Gives you a verbose response
So, a nice and secure command-line deletion can be accom-
plished by using
srm -mz filename

Technique 51: Securing Files
404
4.
Watch the Trash progress bar in action.
You’ll probably notice that Secure Empty Trash
takes much longer than the standard method.
This should make sense, considering the many
extra steps taking place behind the scenes.
Although this new feature is nice, keep in
mind that most potential snoops don’t know
how to recover data that has been deleted
through ordinary means, either. The Secure
Empty Trash option is great if you have truly
sensitive data to delete or if you fear that
someone who really knows what they are
doing might get hold of your computer. But
unless either of those applies to you, save
yourself some time by sticking to the standard
Empty Trash.
This feature is pretty easy to use. Just follow these
steps:
1.
Trash a file by moving it to the Trash or by
pressing Ô+Delete after selecting it.
2.
Choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder
menu.
3.
Click OK at the prompt.
If you’d rather not see the “Are you sure?”
warning, clear the Show Warning Before
Emptying the Trash option under the Finder’s
Advanced preferences panel (see Figure 51-8)
or hold down the Option key while selecting
Secure Empty Trash (or Empty Trash) from the
Finder menu.
• Figure 51-8: Clear the empty Trash warning if you trust
you know what you’re doing.

Proper Password
Policy
T
he security of your computer partially depends upon the pass-
words you use to log in, access Web sites, and encrypt files. The
first step is to choose a good, secure password. The second step
that you should take is to use Apple’s keychain technology to manage
your passwords for you. Finally, we discuss the important information
that you should know about changing and using your login password.
To improve both the convenience and security of using your computer,
the Mac OS X operating system uses keychains: virtual places to store
and retrieve sensitive information. The first time you use any “key” (a
password required by a file or encrypted disk image, your .Mac account
information, login values used by Web sites), you are given the option —
through a prompt or check box — of storing that information in the key-
chain. The passwords and such are kept in a secure format so that they
are not easily viewable. Your keychain (the collection of all of your keys)
is unlocked when you log into your Mac, and the different keys are then
automatically used as needed. (For example, when you go to a Web site
or attempt to open a password-protected file, the proper values will be
entered for you.) Although Panther handles all of this seamlessly, it also
comes with the Keychain Access utility, which gives you more specific
control over your keys and keychains.
Creating a Good Password
Good security begins with selecting good, secure passwords. You should
abide by certain rules when coming up with your passwords. Here is the
party line on passwords:
Do use

A combination of letters and numbers

A combination of upper- and lowercase letters

At least eight characters

A combination of symbols and punctuation, if allowed

impractical, particularly when you consider the
fact that if you forget your login password, you’ll
be in trouble. If you must, make a note of your
password, but don’t
 Post it on your monitor.
 Leave it in a desk drawer.
 Indicate what the password is for.
 Keep it in your wallet.
Working with Apple’s
Keychain Access
Mac OS X’s main tool for managing passwords is
Keychain Access (see Figure 52-1). This application
stores and retrieves your passwords, including
those used by
• Figure 52-1: The Keychain Access tool makes password
management easy.

Web sites

E-mail accounts

FileVault

iChat

.Mac accounts
Don’t use

Words that are in a dictionary

Names, words, or numbers that are meaningful
to you

Too-obvious passwords, such as names of your
pets, children, or spouse; or digits from your
phone number, address, birthday, or Social
Security number

The same password for multiple things
The most important consideration is that your
login password is unique. Moreover, keep
your login password distinct from the root
user’s password, if one has been set.
The problem with these rules is that they can make
remembering your passwords impossible. So what
are you to really do?

Use the Keychain Access to remember your
passwords. See “Working with Apple’s Keychain
Access” later in this Technique for more.

Use the first letters of the words in a phrase to
come up with a password.
Just like you used the mnemonic Roy G. Biv to
memorize the colors of the rainbow, you can take
a phrase and create an abbreviation to create a
memorable password. For example, the abbre-
viation for the phrase Larry Ullman and Marc
Liyanage wrote a book together creates the pass-
word LUaMLwabt. This makes for a pretty decent
password, and it’s not impossible to recall.

Take existing words and add numbers and
punctuation.
For example, you can take the word original and
turn it into 0r!gina_L. This password uses upper-
and lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation.

Go ahead and write down important passwords
but store them securely.
One of the golden rules is not writing down your
passwords. This sounds like a great idea but is

Encrypted disk images

Wireless networks

Servers
Check out Technique 51 for how you can use
the Security panel to require passwords to
access your computer after it’s been sleeping,
idle, and so forth.
Panther will use the keychain automatically, so
there’s little you need to do to enable it. However,
note these best policies here:

Use the keychain as much as possible. This is a
good, secure application, designed to make your
life easier. Take advantage of this!

Make a very secure login password. The key-
chain uses your login password as its master
password. If someone can get into your com-
puter and guess your master password, he can
then get access to all your other passwords.

Regularly back up the keychain database.
The keychains are stored in your ~/Library/
Keychains directory. They are automatically
backed up if you back up your entire Home direc-
tory, or you can manually move the files from
there to a CD or a USB thumbnail drive (a small,
portable hard drive).
The Backup application will automatically
present your keychain database as an option
to back up.

Use the keychain menu bar tool. If you do a lot
with keychains, choose Show Status in Menu
Bar from the View menu. This creates a menu
bar shortcut to keychain-related tasks (see
Figure 52-2).

Change the keychain settings for improved
security. Your keychain automatically unlocks
when you login and then remains unlocked. This
can be a security risk, particularly if others have
access to your computer when you step away. To
change this behavior, select Change Settings for
Keychain Keychain Name from the Edit menu.
Use the resulting prompt (see Figure 52-3) to
secure your keychain.
• Figure 52-2: Make the most of Keychain Access by using
the menu bar tool.
• Figure 52-3: Change a keychain’s settings for heightened
security.

When prompted, grant applications permission
to always allow access to the keychain. When
an application needs to access the keychain, you
see a prompt that lets you choose to deny this,
allow this once, or always allow this action. You
might as well always allow this so that you won’t
have to worry about it in the future.
You can also use your keychain to store sensitive
data, like your ATM PIN or credit card information,
by creating a Note. This is a more secure option than
placing such information in a plain text file or a Sticky
note. You might want to use this for recording social
security numbers, listing the serial numbers of your
computers and other valuable equipment, or for
securing sensitive work-related secrets. In short,
with the Keychain Access utility, you can encrypt
and protect any little tidbit you want.

3.
Check the Show note box that appears under the
item’s name (in the bottom half of the window).
4.
Enter your login password at the prompt.
To view a note, you’ll need to enter the Keychain
Access password at the prompt. This is the
same value as your login password, unless
you’ve changed the Keychain Access pass-
word separately.
5.
You’ll now see the note’s contents in the bot-
tom half of the window.
Using Open Firmware Password
To really protect your computer, make use of the Open
Firmware Password utility. If you enable this feature, people
cannot access your computer by booting from another vol-
ume. This also means that you’ll need to enter this pass-
word to boot from a CD-ROM or even zap your PRAM
(the process of resetting your computer’s special parameter
memory, which is sometimes required to fix erratic behav-
ior). The basic steps, which are detailed at http://docs.
info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106482, are
1.
Make sure that your computer supports Open
Firmware Password (see the Web page).
2.
Download the installer.
3.
Install the Open Firmware Password application.
4.
Open the application.
5.
Enable the Require Password to Change Open
Firmware Settings option.
6.
Enter the password twice.
7.
Click OK.
8.
Quit the application.
Changing Login Passwords
Routinely changing your login passwords is a smart
security policy. Some operating systems prompt you
to do this every so many months, although Mac OS X
does not. (It’s a nice security check, but it’s kind of
an inconvenience, too.)
Here’s how to create a secure Note:
1.
Open Keychain Access by double-clicking on its
icon in the Applications➪Utilities folder.
2.
If no keychain is visible, click Show Keychains
to display the keychain drawer and select your
keychain.
3.
Click Unlock and enter your password if the
keychain is locked.
4.
Click Note.
5.
In the resulting prompt (see Figure 52-4), type
your note’s name in the Name box.
• Figure 52-4: Use Keychain Access for important
information other than passwords.
6.
Type the text of your Note in the Note box.
7.
Click Add to add the Note.
You’ll be returned back to the Keychain Access
application itself. To later view the contents of any
note, just follow these steps:
1.
Open the Keychain Access application.
2.
Click on the note’s name in the list of keychain
items.
When you select an item in the main listing,
you’ll see its information in the bottom half of
the window. This will include the item’s name,
creation date, and modification date. You will
not, at this point, see any of the secure values
themselves (like a note’s contents or a password).

Changing Login Passwords
409
To change your login password
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click Accounts, under System.
3.
Select your account from the list in the left col-
umn (see Figure 52-5).
• Figure 52-5: Change your login password in the Accounts
System Preferences panel.
4.
Highlight the dots that currently appear in the
Password box and then press Delete.
5.
Enter your current password at the prompt (see
Figure 52-6).
• Figure 52-6: Before making any changes, you need to
authenticate yourself.
6.
Enter your new password in the Password box.
7.
Enter the password again in the Verify box.
8.
Click the lock to save the settings.
When you change your login password,
Panther will also change your Keychain Access
password. If these are not the same, your key-
chain will not be unlocked when you log in.
Resetting the Administrator’s Password
If you forget the administrator’s password, you still have
some hope: The Mac OS X Installation discs will let
you reset this value. Boot your computer from the first
installation CD. When the installer begins, choose Reset
Administrative Password from the Installer menu and follow
the prompts.

good utilities
Technique
Useful Utilities
A
big part of using your Mac effectively is choosing and using the
right tool for the job. In this book, we discuss a variety of software
options, but we don’t have room to mention all of our most recom-
mended applications. In this Technique, we will go over the benefits —
both timesaving and cosmetic — of using a couple of more utilities.
Special attention is first given to TinkerTool, one of the best free applica-
tions around. Then we mention CronniX, a graphical user interface to the
cron scheduling utility. Finally, we give brief notice to a smattering of
other software worthy of your consideration.
Working with TinkerTool
TinkerTool, which we mention in other Techniques of this book because
it’s so helpful, is available from www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html for
free. Some of the best features of TinkerTool are the abilities to

Show hidden files in the Finder

Set system fonts (see Figure 53-2)
• Figure 53-2: Use TinkerTool to set different system fonts.

Add features to Safari (see Figure 53-3)
As you can see from this list, some of these features
are merely cosmetic, whereas others are very practi-
cal. TinkerTool has been consistently developed over
the years, and many of its most popular features
have been incorporated into the operating system
already. Especially considering its cost — free! —
you have no reason not to make use of TinkerTool.
The popularity of TinkerTool has spurred its
creator to break it into two separate products:
TinkerTool and TinkerTool System. The former
(free) is expressly for personalizing a user’s
setting, whereas the latter (approximately $10)
can make system-wide alterations.
• Figure 53-3: TinkerTool can enable Safari’s debug menu,
which is very useful for Web developers.
Automating Tasks with cron
One of the cool technologies built into Unix is cron, a
command-line utility for scheduling actions. Seasoned
UNIX users will define a crontab: a list of what actions
your operating system should take when. The cron
daemon (a perpetually running process) calls the
commands set in the crontab when the time is right.
You can control all of this from the Terminal (see
the “Using cron in the Terminal” sidebar), but the
easiest way to control cron is to use CronniX (www.
koch-schmidt.de/cronnix/, free).
Some example uses of a cron are to




Schedule interactions with databases
The CronniX utility also lets you view the system
crontab file (see Figure 53-4) and provides an inter-
face for scheduling your own actions. If you have a
need for crons, you’d be crazy not to use CronniX.
• Figure 53-4: The operating system runs these commands
between 3 and 5 a.m.
As an example, your Mac relies upon privileges in
order to properly deny or allow access to files. These
privileges can become muddled, having undesirable
results. Fortunately, the permissions can be easily
fixed by running the Disk Utility’s Repair Disk
Permissions tool (under the First Aid tab). But how
are you to remember to do this? By letting CronniX
do it for you, of course! Follow these steps:
1.
Open CronniX by double-clicking its icon after
you’ve installed the application.
2.
Choose File➪Open System Crontab.
You can establish crons for any user, but this one
should run on an administrative level, so you’ll
need to open up the System Crontab.

Because the added task runs as the administra-
tor, you’ll need to authenticate yourself.
11.

Using cron in the Terminal
The cron utility uses the information stored in the
crontab file to know what commands to run when. You
can edit the crontab file in your default text editor by typ-
ing crontab -e in the Terminal. The syntax for a crontab
entry is confusing and critical. What you’ll see is
* * * * * command
The five asterisks represent, in order from left to right, min-
utes, hours, days, months, and days of the week (from 0
to 6, with 0 being Sunday). Using an asterisk for one of
those parameters means that value is not limited. You can
also set ranges with hyphens or list discrete elements sepa-
rated by commas. Here are some examples of cron entries
that you can add to your crontab file:
0 16 * * * calendar
This displays a calendar every day at 4 p.m.
0,15,30,45 8-17 * * 1-5 open
‘http://finance.yahoo.com’
This opens Yahoo!’s finance page in your default Web
browser every 15 minutes between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Other Useful Utilities
The following utilities are not meant for everyone,
but you ought to be aware of their existence. There’s
not much to say about how to use any of these, but
understand that the applications themselves are
good timesaving tools.

Pacifist (www.charlessoft.com, $20): Pacifist
lets you access specific files and folders from
package installers. This is very useful if you
know you need a particular item but don’t want
to reinstall all the software again. If you’d like to
get one file from one of Apple’s huge installers,
Pacifist can really simplify and hasten that
process.
CharlesSoft also makes a free product called
DockDisks, which adds mounted disks
(CD-ROMs, DVDs, disk images, and so on)
to your Dock. With this tool, you can access
mounted disks without going to the Desktop.

Cocoa Gestures (www.bitart.com, free): Cocoa
Gestures is a clever little tool that lets you asso-
ciate actions with mouse movements. For exam-
ple, you could set it so that when you Option+
click a file and move up your mouse, the Get Info
panel appears. Marc uses Cocoa Gestures to
associate mouse movements with the Back and
Forward Safari buttons. The Cocoa Gestures
functionality is far more useful than you might
imagine, and its free price makes it worth trying.
If you like Cocoa Gestures, bitart Consulting also
offers the $30 CocoaSuite, with many, many
added features, including
 Turn your laptop’s trackpad into a virtual
scroll wheel.
 Change existing menu shortcuts in
applications.
 Quickly run AppleScripts.

Konfabulator (www.konfabulator.com, $25):
Konfabulator is an application that runs widgets
(little segments of code designed to perform
specific tasks) written in JavaScript. Even if you
don’t know how to write JavaScript code, this is
far more useful than you might imagine because
you can download hundreds of widgets at the
Web site. Sample widgets can

runs in the background. It’s useful for program-
mers in particular by making a matching quota-
tion mark, parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace
whenever the initial one is typed. For example, if
you type a left bracket ([), AutoPairs adds the
right bracket (]) and places the cursor between
the two so that you can begin typing. Besides
saving you an extra keystroke here and there, it
helps you avoid errors caused by forgetting a
closing mark.
 Play games
 Manage to-do lists
Konfabulator is definitely one of those must-see-

ac OS X includes extensive support for Bluetooth, which is a wire-
less networking standard. Many new Macintosh computers now
have Bluetooth hardware built in. It is an exciting and versatile
technology, and in this Technique, we show several examples of how
Bluetooth can help you save time.
Many new cellphones are Bluetooth-enabled. With only a bit of configura-
tion, you can have your computer and your cellphone talk to each other
and exchange data. This one-time setup procedure is what we look at
first. We also take you on a tour of the things that you can do with
Apple’s own applications, and then we highlight some useful third-party
applications.
What Is Bluetooth?
Bluetooth (www.bluetooth.com) is a wireless communications protocol
used to connect up to seven compatible devices to each other within a
limited range, usually less than 30 feet. Designed to be small and inexpen-
sive, integration into today’s digital entertainment and communications
gadgets is technically and economically feasible. The list of Bluetooth-
enabled devices now includes mobile phones, portable music players,
digital cameras, printers, laptops, PDAs, and even computer mice and
keyboards.
Bluetooth can carry data and voice. Some wireless phone headsets use
Bluetooth instead of a cable to connect the headset (usually a tiny, 
battery-powered ear clip and microphone) to the mobile phone.
Because it doesn’t require a clear line of sight between the communicat-
ing devices, Bluetooth is also more convenient than infrared connections.
You can leave your mobile phone in your pocket and still use it to con-
nect to the Internet with a PDA or receive a phone call on your headset.


Unplug and replug it.

Make sure that it’s seated firmly in the USB port.

Try another USB port, preferably one directly on
the computer.
On the cellphone, you have to make sure that

Bluetooth is enabled.
It is usually disabled when not used to save bat-

The cellphone is in Discoverable mode, either
permanently or just for the next few minutes.
Both of these settings vary with each cellphone man-
ufacturer, so just browse the phone’s menu options
or check the documentation for your phone.
Setting Up Your Connection
The Bluetooth control panel is also where you set up
the connection between the computer and phone.
This process — pairing two devices — is a security
feature to assure that nobody can interact with your
Bluetooth equipment without you knowing it.
To set up the connection between computer and
phone:
Compared with other technologies, Bluetooth is
designed for lower cost, shorter range, and slower
speed than the AirPort/802.11x family of wireless
networking protocols. (You know, WiFi and its
cousins?) It is also more versatile. Whereas you use
AirPort to connect your computer with medium to
high speed to other computers on a network, you
use Bluetooth to connect your computer to small
communications and entertainment devices.
Bluetooth was initiated by computer and telecom-
munications heavyweights such as IBM, Intel,
Ericsson, Nokia, and Toshiba. Bluetooth has been
around for about six years, but only recently did all
the puzzle pieces like Bluetooth-enabled cellphones,
computers with Bluetooth hardware and software,
and applications that actually provide some useful
service become widely available. Now Macintosh
users can finally benefit from the technology.
If you want to find out more about it, start by visit-
ing Apple’s Bluetooth Web site at www.apple.com/
bluetooth.
Getting Started with Bluetooth
In order to follow the steps in this Technique, both
your computer and cellphone need to be Bluetooth-
enabled. On the computer side, if you own a new
Macintosh, especially an aluminum series
PowerBook, it already includes everything you need
for Bluetooth communications. For Macs without
built-in hardware, you have to use a USB Bluetooth
adapter. This is a tiny device that plugs into the USB
port. (Apple sells one for about $50 in the Apple
Store, Figure 54-1.)
In any case, you can determine whether your com-
puter’s Bluetooth system is working by checking the
Bluetooth system control panel, in the Hardware
section of System Preferences. If there is a problem,
the Bluetooth Device Name is displayed as Not
Available.

(Optional) Enter the Internet connection set-
tings that you wish to use while you’re on the
road (see Figure 54-9).
Ask your mobile carrier or ISP for this informa-
tion if you don’t know it. This step is optional,
and you can leave the fields empty if you don’t
plan to use the Internet connectivity. But don’t
deselect the Internet connectivity in the previous
screen in this case — just leave the fields blank.
Some of the tricks that we show you won’t work
unless the phone is configured for Internet
access. Then click Continue.
You’re finished setting up the connection 
(see Figure 54-10).
• Figure 54-9: Internet connection settings.
6.
On your cellphone, choose the Add to Paired
option when the phone asks you how to pair
the two devices (see Figure 54-6).
The specifics for your device might be slightly
different, but basically you need to tell the
device to accept the request coming from 
your Mac.
• Figure 54-6: The phone asks how to proceed with the
pairing request from the computer.
7.
When your cellphone asks you to do so, 
enter the same passkey set on your Mac 
(see Figure 54-7).

Setup Assistant.
The phone is added to the list of paired devices.
You’re now ready to explore the various Bluetooth
features.
Working with Your 
Address Book
The most elegant and useful features of Bluetooth
are in Apple’s Address Book application. To use
these features most effectively, make sure that you
always keep all Address Book entries up-to-date,
especially the mobile phone numbers.
First, you need to tell Address Book to watch your
mobile phone. To do that, click the little Bluetooth
button near the upper-left corner of the window
(see Figure 54-11; look for the angular capital B).
The button should turn blue — now you’re ready to
use your cellphone from within Address Book.
• Figure 54-11: Click the Bluetooth button to use it with
the application.
Dialing from within Address Book
To call somebody directly from within the person’s
Address Book entry, click the category word to the
left of the phone number (such as mobile or work)
that you wish to dial (see Figure 54-11). A pop-up
menu appears. Choose the Dial With option. Your
cellphone should now be dialing the number.
Using the Address Book to call people is much
faster than dialing the cellphone itself.
Display incoming call alerts
If you keep the Address Book open and connected to
your phone in the background, it will pop up a small
dialog if somebody calls you (see Figure 54-12).
Usually you will just pick up the phone and accept
the call like you usually do (or click the Answer but-
ton). If you are unable to take the call however, you
can use one of the other options offered by the dialog:

Voice Mail forwards the call to your voice mail-
box so the caller can leave a message there.

SMS Reply rejects the call and allows you to send
a short text message to the caller’s cellphone
(like “I’m in a meeting right now, will call back”).

• Figure 54-13: An incoming SMS.
3.
Type in your message and then click Send 
(see Figure 54-14).
• Figure 54-14: Writing the SMS reply.
To send a new message:
1.
Open the Address Book.
2.
Find the person’s card to whom you want to
send the message.
3.
Click the Mobile category label to the left of the
mobile phone number.
4.
Choose SMS Message from the pop-up menu
that appears (see Figure 54-15).
5.
Type your text into the field that appears and
then click Send.
Your Mac has a much better keyboard than
the phone’s 10-digit keypad! Use your Mac
when you can.

Log Call will add a short entry to the Notes sec-
tion of the person’s card in the Address Book.

If the incoming cellphone number is not yet
known in the Address Book, an Add Card button
lets you add a new card in the Address Book for
the calling person.
Figure 54-12: An incoming call alert.
Sending and receiving SMS messages
SMS stands for Short Message Service, a feature
available on some, slightly more advanced, cellular
networks. Using SMS, a short alphanumeric message
of up to 160 characters can be sent to a cellphone.
The receiving device will display the message and
allow you to respond. Replacing the functionality
people used to get from pagers, SMS messaging is
much like Instant Messaging using a phone.
If you use your cellphone to send text messages, you
know how awkward and annoying typing them on a
tiny phone keypad can be. When using Address
Book, you can send and reply to text messages with
the comfort of your computer keyboard.
Here’s how to receive and reply to an incoming 
message:
1.
If somebody sends you a message and Address
Book is hooked up to the phone, your computer
displays the text in a pop-up window (see
Figure 54-13).
2.
Click the Reply button if you want to write
back.
An empty text field appears.

Dialing Your Phone from a Text Selection
423
• Figure 54-15: Use the pop-up menu to send an SMS.
Dialing Your Phone from 
a Text Selection
You can download a great little (and free!) applica-
tion called T68iDialer that dials phone numbers that
you select in any piece of text. For example, if you
find a phone number on the contact page of a com-
pany’s Web site, T68iDialer lets you select that phone
number with the mouse and then dial it immediately
on your cellphone. How cool is that?
This program currently works with the T39m, T68m,
or T68i Ericsson cellphones. It might work with oth-
ers, and because it’s free, you can just try it with no
commitment. As of this writing, we don’t know of a
similar utility for other cellphones, but they’re
bound to come along sooner or later.
T68iDialer publishes a service to accomplish its
function. (See Technique 27 on Services for more
information about how Services work.)
Do this to try out the T68iDialer:
1.
Download the latest version from www.
macupdate.com/info.php/id/8913.
2.
Move the application into the Applications
folder.
3.
Log out of your Mac and log back in.
4.
Launch any program that supports Services.
Mail would be a good choice because many
e-mail messages end with a signature that
includes phone numbers.
5.
Select a phone number and choose
Mail➪Services➪Dial Number (see Figure 54-16).
• Figure 54-16: Select a phone number in any application
and choose the Dial Number Service.
6.
If it’s not already running, T68iDialer launches
and inserts the phone number into the corre-
sponding field in its main window.
7.
Click Dial to dial the number (see Figure 54-17).
• Figure 54-17: The dialer window.
Enable the Service Dial Immediately option in
the program’s preferences. That way, you won’t
have to click the Dial button anymore. Instead,
T68iDialer dials the selected number as soon
as you choose the Service menu command.

Technique 54: Controlling Cellphones with Bluetooth
424
• Figure 54-18: Adding a new device to iSync.
3.
Double-click the phone to add it to iSync’s list.
4.
In the For First Sync drop-down box, choose
the option that you prefer.
You usually want the Merge Data on Computer
and Device option unless you really want to
erase all existing Contact and Calendar informa-
tion on the phone (see Figure 54-19).
5.
Use the check boxes and pull-down menus to
indicate what to synchronize (contacts and
calendars).
6.
Click Sync Now.
After you set up iSync to work with your cell-
phone, you only have to click Sync Now to start
the synchronization. It usually takes a while,
especially for the first synchronization. You
should sync regularly because this feature is
most useful when all data is up-to-date all the
time.
You should enable the iSync menu bar icon in
the application’s preferences, which you can
find in the iSync menu. This allows you to start
a synchronization very quickly without having
to first launch iSync.
Synchronizing with iSync
Bluetooth-equipped cellphones usually also have an
Address Book and a Calendar. Some, but not all, of
these phones can be synchronized with the Address
Book and iCal data on your computer with Apple’s
iSync application.
Synchronization means that

All data is available in both places.

Any additions or changes made on either the
computer or the mobile phone will be effective
on the other device, too.
For example, if you add to your cellphone’s address
book the contact information for a person you meet,
this information will automatically be transferred
into a new card in your Address Book application on
the Mac the next time you synchronize the computer
with the cellphone. On the other hand, if you add a
new card for a person while working at your com-
puter, you will not have to remember to also store
the person’s mobile phone number into your phone
manually because synchronization will do this for
you automatically.
To find out whether your particular phone (or a
phone that you’re thinking about buying) can be
used with iSync, go to Apple’s device compatibility
list at www.apple.com/isync/devices.html. The best
way to be sure is to check that list . . . or to try it out
before buying, if possible.
Setting up iSync
To start synchronizing with your phone, you need to
add it to iSync’s list of devices.
1.
Launch iSync.
2.
Choose Add Device from the Devices menu.
Your phone should appear in the list of recog-
nized devices (see Figure 54-18). If it doesn’t, put
your device into Discoverable mode and try
again.

Your Cellphone as a Remote Control

Your Cellphone as 
a Remote Control
If you use a Sony Ericsson cellphone (or a Palm
PDA), you can use one of the hottest Bluetooth-
related utilities, Salling Clicker (http://homepage.
mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/SEMC,
$10). It installs a menu on your phone that allows
you to control your computer from the phone or to
view information about the computer on the phone’s
display. Examples of some things you can do include

Starting, stopping, or skipping music in iTunes

Displaying information about the current iTunes
song

Controlling DVD playback

Adjusting or muting the sound volume

Controlling slides in a presentation program,
including the ability to display slide notes on the
phone’s display
What’s more, Salling Clicker has a proximity sensor.
You can use this to trigger certain actions when you
(or more accurately, your cellphone) enter or leave
the proximity of your computer. Examples include

Stopping iTunes or muting the volume when you
leave

Restarting iTunes when you return to the
machine

Changing your iChat availability when you leave
or return.
Here’s how to quickly get started with Salling
Clicker:
1.
Download and install the software.
2.
Open the Salling Clicker panel in System
Preferences.
3.
Click Select Phone and choose the cellphone
on which you’d like the menu installed.
Again, if it doesn’t appear in the list, make sure
that the phone is in Discoverable mode.
4.
Back in the main Salling Clicker window, click
the Publish Menu button to install the menu on
your phone (see Figure 54-20).
5.
If it worked, you can now control your Mac
from your phone.
The location of the menu in the phone’s screens
varies depending on the model that you have. On
Marc’s T68i, it’s under Connect➪Accessories.
Have fun!

An even quicker way to send short snippets of 
text to your cellphone is to use a Services menu
command:
1.
Download the free Services menu extension
called BlueService, available from www.devon-
technologies.com/freeware.php.
2.
Copy the BlueService file into the Library/

Storing Notes and Pictures 
on a Cellphone
Modern Bluetooth phones can accept text and pic-
ture files. The text feature is especially handy for
storing items like shopping lists, travel itineraries,
travel directions, and so forth.
Panther includes the Bluetooth File Exchange
application to send files to and from a mobile
phone. Make sure to select the Show
Bluetooth Status in the Menu Bar check box
of the Settings tab of the Bluetooth control
panel (see Figure 54-21). That way, you always
have instant access to the File Exchange appli-
cation by choosing the Send File command
from the menu (see Figure 54-22).

Storing Notes and Pictures on a Cellphone

3.
Log out of your Mac and log back in (to enable
the newly-added Service).
4.
In an application that supports Services, select
a piece of text and then choose the Send to
Bluetooth Device Service.
In order for this to work, the application needs to
actively support Services, and not all do yet. Try
it out in a Cocoa application like Safari or Mail
first.
5.
Your note should be transmitted to the 
cellphone.
The phone will ask you whether you want to
accept the file. Choose Accept to do so and store
the file in the phone’s memory. (The details vary
with each cellphone manufacturer, so check the
documentation for your particular model if it’s
not clear how to accept a file.)

Save Time By
 Getting around within the
Terminal
 Making the Terminal and
the Finder work together
 Editing in the Terminal
Technique
The Terminal, the
Finder, and You
T
he Terminal is Panther’s bridge between the beautiful Mac interface
and the awesome UNIX infrastructure. Still, you don’t have to be a
UNIX geek to use and appreciate this application. After you under-
stand the basics of getting around and have picked up a few key com-
mands, you’ll see how useful the Terminal can be.
In this Technique, we begin with the quickest and easiest ways to move
around within the Terminal. Then we demonstrate some cool and handy
tricks to use, including how you can use the Terminal and the Finder
together. Finally, we cover some efficient ways to make edits in the
Terminal.
If you have some UNIX and command line experience, you’ll be
thrilled to see how most of those skills (plus a few more) apply to
your Mac. If you’ve never tinkered in this area before, this and the
subsequent Techniques will open a whole new — and quite cool —
universe to you.
Navigating within the Terminal
When you start using the Terminal, you learn pretty quickly that the stan-
dard Finder navigation techniques don’t work. In fact, without mastering
some commands, you can’t get anywhere in the Terminal. Luckily, figur-
ing out these things is not all that hard.
The Terminal window greets you with a lot of information (see Figure 55-1).
The most important of this is the command prompt line itself, which is
where you’ll find the cursor. This line is formatted as
Computer Name: Current Directory Current User

Navigating within the Terminal
429
• Figure 55-1: The basic Terminal window.
In Figure 55-1, you can tell that Larry is connected to
his G4 iBook, that he is in his Home directory (indi-
cated by the tilde; ~), and that he is logged in as the
user named larry. The $ reflects what kind of user
Larry is logged in as (a normal user, whereas a num-
ber sign indicates a root user).
If you ever forget where you’re at, you can use the
pwd (print working directory) command to have the
Terminal tell you (see Figure 55-2).
• Figure 55-2: Use the pwd command to find yourself 
(but not in a New Age-y way).
Getting around in the Terminal
Now that you know where you’re at, it’s time to get a
move on. To move around within the Terminal, you
use the cd (change directory) command, like this:
cd /path/to/directory
To go to the Applications directory, you would enter
cd /Applications (as shown in Figure 55-3). This is
the equivalent of double-clicking or otherwise open-
ing a folder in the Finder.
Command prompt line
• Figure 55-3: Larry is now in the /Applications
directory, which is also indicated by
/Applications after the colon.
When it comes to moving around, here are certain
facts that you should know:

/: A forward slash is called the root directory.
The root directory is the topmost folder on
your computer and is the equivalent of open-
ing your main hard drive in the Finder. If you
have multiple hard drives or partitions, the one
with the operating system will be at the root
level, whereas the others will be found under
/Volumes.

~: The tilde refers to the Home directory of the
currently logged-in user.

.: A single period refers to the current directory.

..: Two periods refer to the parent directory of
the current directory.
Those are just the basics — here are some other
things that you should know to use this tool 
effectively:

Use cd to go to your Home directory.

Use cd ~ to go to your Home directory.

Use cd .. to go up one directory.
The current directory is referred to as . or m.
The parent directory of the current one is ..
or ../. A subdirectory is simply directoryname
or directoryname/.

Technique 55: The Terminal, the Finder, and You
430
• Figure 55-4: Tab completion lets you type a minimum of
characters.
You can move around by using either absolute
or relative paths. An absolute path is accurate
no matter where you’re currently located. A
relative path is only accurate with respect to
your current location. For example, /Users/
larry/Documents/Books/ is an absolute path
(as is ~/Documents/Books/), but Documents/
Books/ is relative (and accurate as long as
Larry is currently in his Home directory).
4.
Press the Tab key.
The remaining folder name (Documents/) should
be filled in automatically.
If the Terminal cannot find a match for tab
completion, it will do nothing. If it finds several
matches, it will either do nothing or complete
the text that all the matches have in common.
For example, if a directory contains filename.
txt and filename.pdf, and you type fi and
try to do a tab completion, the Terminal
returns filename. (with the period).
5.
Type Bo and press the Tab key.
The folder name Books/ is filled in automatically.
6.
Type Mac and press the Tab key.
The folder name Mac OS X TST FD is filled in
automatically.
7.
Press the Return key to complete the command
(see Figure 55-5).
Tab completion
The best tool to use in the Terminal — which you
absolutely must use — is tab completion. Tab com-
pletion automatically completes words for you,
requiring less typing and cutting down on the num-
ber of errors that you might make. For example, to
use tab completion to move into the Mac OS X TST
FD folder within the Books folder within the
Documents folder of your Home directory (as a
completely hypothetical example), do this:
1.
Open the Terminal application, which can be
found in the Utilities folder.
2.
In the Terminal window, type cd.
The command that you want to eventually 
type is
cd ~/Documents/Books/Mac\ OS\ X\ TST\ FD
For this example, manually type the first part
(cd). Now we’ll show you how to use tab comple-
tion as much as possible.
Spaces in filenames are allowed in the Finder
but not in the Terminal because a space delin-
eates a command. To work around this poten-
tial problem, escape the space by using the
backslash, as in Mac\ OS\ X\ TST\ FD, which
looks like Mac OS X TST FD in the Finder.
Escaping is the process of preceding problem-
atic characters with a backslash, so that they
don’t cause problems. In this example, the
backslash-space combination will be inter-
preted as a space character.
3.
Type ~/Doc (see Figure 55-4).
In order to get to this destination, you must first
go into the Documents directory. Because the
Terminal automatically starts you in your Home
directory, you can make a relative path to it (just
start typing Doc) or you can be extra precise by
starting with ~/. This is then followed by Doc,
and remember: Capitalization matters!

Navigating within the Terminal
431
• Figure 55-5: Execute a long command with a minimum
of typing.
You can use tab completion on files as well as
directories. You can also use it with practically
any command, not just cd.
Viewing directory contents
If you’re in a directory and need to see what’s there,
use the ls (list) command. The ls command pres-
ents you with a list of a directory’s contents, much
like you would see in a Finder window . . . but with-
out the icons.

Type ls to list the basic contents of the current
directory.

Type ls -G (uppercase G) to show the list in
color (assuming that Disable ANSI color is not
disabled in the Terminal➪Window
Settings➪Color panel).

Type ls -a to show every file, including hidden
ones.
The –a flag makes the ls command show
many other items. These include hidden files
(filenames begin with a period), a line for the
current directory (marked by a single period),
and a line for the parent directory, if applicable
(marked with two periods).

Type ls -l to show more file information.

If you like, you can combine parameters, like
ls -al or ls -aG.

Add a directory name to view a directory other
than the one you’re in. Here are three different
ways to do it:
ls /Applications/Utilities
See Figure 55-6.
• Figure 55-6: You can view a directory’s contents without
being in it.
ls –G ~/Documents
ls –al /usr/local/php
Navigating among open Terminal windows
The Terminal opens a new window for you when you
load the application, but you don’t need to restrict
yourself to just a single session. You can open more
windows by selecting New Shell from the File menu
or using the Ô+N keyboard shortcut.
Each Terminal window opens with the default
user logged in and located in their Home
directory. There is no relationship between the
multiple Terminal windows, and no history is
maintained from one to the other.

Terminal Tips and Tricks
In the next four techniques, we cover various tips
and tricks involving broader subjects — finding files,
handling output, viewing files, and customization.
Here we include a few miscellaneous little tricks that
you’ll appreciate as well.
Getting help
The world of UNIX is a world of commands, but
you’d have to be a genius to remember how to use
them all. Fortunately, you don’t have to. Most com-
mands come with a help manual (called man files)
you can read. For example, to find help for the ls
(list) command, do the following:
1.
Open the Terminal.
2.
Type man ls.
This displays the manual for the ls command
(see Figure 55-8).
• Figure 55-8: The manual for the ls command.
3.
Press the spacebar or the F key to go forward.
Working with multiple Terminal windows is great if
you’re trying to accomplish many things at once. Or,
if you are doing some work in one directory, and
other work in another, you can use two windows
(one for each directory) so that you don’t have to
keep moving yourself around.
After you have multiple Terminal windows open, you
can easily move from one to the other:

Use Ô+←and Ô+→to move back and forth.

Use Ô+~ to rotate among them.

Use Ô+1 to access the first window, Ô+2 to
access the second, and so forth.
Other commands
Here are a few other must-know commands that we
should mention:

clear: Clears the Terminal screen

Control+C: Stops the currently running 
command.

exit: Logs out (see Figure 55-7)
• Figure 55-7: When you’re done using the Terminal, 
log out with exit.
You can set the Terminal to automatically 
close the window after you exit. Check out
Technique 59 or the Shell panel of the
Window Settings panel.

Terminal Tips and Tricks
433
4.
Press the B key to go backward.
5.
Press Q to quit (at any time).
Many commands also have a help option,
which is like a short version of the manual. If
it’s supported by a command, you would type
command --help to see that command’s help.
A command of history, or a history of commands
Along with tab completion, one of the best ways to
save time is to make use of the Terminal’s memory.
We don’t mean memory in a RAM sense, but rather
that the Terminal remembers your history of com-
mands. For example, you can use history to re-enter
a previously used command:
1.
Press the up arrow to display the previously
entered command.
Continue to press the up arrow to find earlier
commands.
2.
Press the down arrow if you went too far.
3.
Edit an existing command as needed.
4.
Press Return to re-execute it.
A more elaborate but related tool is the history
command.
1.
After you’ve used the Terminal for a while,
type history and press Return (see Figure 55-9).
The history command shows you what you’ve
done (in order), numbering each.
2.
Type !n to repeat a command listed by history,
where n is the line number associated with the
command (see Figure 55-10).
As you can see in Figure 55-9, each command is
numbered. To rerun the pwd command, for exam-
ple, type !4 and then press Return.
• Figure 55-9: The history command reveals the
commands you’ve recently entered.
• Figure 55-10: Repeat commands with the !n syntax.
3.
Type !command to repeat the last version of a
specific command (see Figure 55-11).
This version of the history trick tells the
Terminal to repeat the last version of whatever
the command was. For example, !ls might actu-
ally call ls /Applications/Utilities, which
you had previously entered.

Technique 55: The Terminal, the Finder, and You
434
• Figure 55-11: The history tool also provides shortcuts by
command name.
Do not use the !command trick with the rm
(remove) command. Doing so will most likely
permanently remove something that you
might not have wanted to remove. Or, it
might attempt to remove something that
you’ve already deleted (because that com-
mand has already been run).
4.
Use the !command:p or !n:p syntax to see what a
command would be (see Figure 55-12).
The :p addition will remind you of what a partic-
ular command was, rather than execute it. You
can use it with the numbering system (!4:p) or
with the command syntax (!ls:p).
• Figure 55-12: The :p flag gives you a preview of what
command a shortcut would be.
Role playing: Executing commands 
as another user
One final trick that you’ll inevitably need to know is
how to execute commands as other users. Most
likely, you’ll need to execute a command as a more
powerful user (like root, see the sidebar). Or, you
might want to access another user’s files (on your
Mac or another). The sudo command lets you run a
command as another user.
In the following example, we’ll show you one use of
sudo: controlling the built-in Web serving application. 
You need to use sudo when you get a permission-
denied error message in the Terminal.
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Try starting Apache by using apachectl start
(see Figure 55-13).
The Apache Web server can be controlled
through the Sharing System Preferences panel or
via the command line by using apachectl.
However, you will need to be an administrator to
use the command line. Therefore, trying to con-
trol Apache as yourself will create errors.
• Figure 55-13: Even administrators cannot start Apache
when logged in as themselves.
3.
Type sudo apachectl start.
To run any command as a more powerful user,
preface it with sudo.
4.
Enter your administrative password at the
prompt (see Figure 55-14).

• Figure 55-14: The first time you use sudo, a strong
warning is displayed.
The sudo command will recall your adminis-
trative password for five minutes after you last
used it. If you don’t use sudo for a few min-
utes, you’ll be required to enter the password
again.
Creating a Root User
Your Mac has many users on it, users that are entirely dif-
ferent than those you use to login and access the computer.
Of these system users, the most critical is the root user. The
root user has unlimited powers but is not enabled by
default. This is a good thing as it protects your computer
from highly detrimental mistakes (only the root user can do
very serious damage).
On the other hand, power Mac users who know what they
are doing appreciate being able to work as the root user
sometimes. Switching over to the root account lets you do
those things you need to do without preceding each com-
mand with sudo. To use the root user feature, you must
enable it and create a password, by following these steps:
1.
Open the NetInfo Manager application, which
is found in the Utilities folder.
2.
Select Enable Root User from the Security
menu.
3.
Read the prompt (shown here) and click OK.
4.
Use the second prompt (see the accompanying
figure) to enter the new password and then
click OK.
5.
Enter your administrative password at the
prompt in the Authenticate dialog (as shown
here) and then click OK.
6.
Quit the NetInfo Manager.
7.
In the Terminal, type su root and press Return.
8.
Enter the new root user’s password.
9.
Be very, very, very careful!
Even though you can create a root user password, you
really, really should avoid doing so unless you really know
what you’re doing and absolutely need a root user. 
Making the Terminal and the
Finder Play Together Nicely
One of the nice things about the Terminal is how
easily it interacts with the Finder. Here’s you’ll find a

Drag and drop with the Finder
If the tab completion trick that we discuss earlier
isn’t good enough for you, here’s another timesaver:
You can drag and drop items from the Finder into
the Terminal.
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type cd, followed by a space.
3.
Switch to the Finder.
4.
Navigate to the directory that you want to use
in a Finder window.
5.
Click the directory’s proxy icon in the win-
dow’s title bar and drag the icon into the
Terminal window.
6.
Switch back to the Terminal (see Figure 55-16).
• Figure 55-16: Dragging a folder into the Terminal copies
that folder’s path there.
7.
Press Return to execute the command.
couple of tricks to make interactions between the
two more seamless.
Using the open command
The open command is a pretty useful little tool. It will
use the Finder to open a file, directory, or even a
URL. Essentially, open works in the Terminal exactly
like how opening a file, folder, URL, or application
works in the Finder.

open .: Opens the current directory in a Finder
window (see Figure 55-15)
• Figure 55-15: The open command makes quick transitions
between the Terminal and the Finder.
Marc has created an AppleScript that can be
added to your Finder window toolbars (www.
entropy.ch/software/applescript/

opens the Finder directory in the Terminal.

Editing between the Terminal and the Finder
437
You can drag and drop anything from the
Finder into the Terminal, including folders,
files, and applications.
Editing between the Terminal
and the Finder
You can also make edits between the Terminal and
the Finder. You’ll use the Clipboard (of course) to
temporary store and retrieve text, but you have two
ways of using it:

You can select text in the Terminal by using the
mouse and then pressing Ô+C to copy it.

You can use the pbpaste and pbcopy commands.
These last two commands are very handy but not
until you’re familiar with piping. Head over to

Technique
Managing and
Finding Files Fast
T
here’s no shortage of things that you can do with the Terminal and
a command line interface. Many of them, including managing and
finding your files, can actually be done faster in the Terminal than
they can in the Finder. Plus, the command line options provide for flexi-
bility and automation of tasks that cannot be replicated elsewhere.
In this Technique, you find out the easiest ways to copy, move, rename,
and delete your files and directories by using the Terminal. Then you see
two different ways to search your hard drive for files and directories.
Copying, Moving, Renaming, and 
Deleting Files
Managing your files in the Finder is easy to do and relatively quick. But
you can also perform the same tasks in the Terminal with many benefits.
For example, you can

Move or copy files from one folder to another without having multiple
windows open.

Delete files without having to empty the Trash. (It’s a one-step
process.)

Manage files by using just a few commands rather than a bunch of
keyboard shortcuts.

Apply changes to files that meet a certain naming scheme.
To copy a file, use the cp (copy) command:
cp source target
For example, to make a copy of the myfile.jpg called myfile2.jpg (both of
which are in the current directory):
cp myfile.jpg myfile2.jpg
cp ~/Documents/Books/chapter.doc ~/Desktop/chapter.doc

Copying, Moving, Renaming, and Deleting Files
439
To copy an entire directory, add the -R flag 
(you must use a capital R):
cp -R myfolder ~/Desktop/myfolder
The cp command does not warn you if you
are about to overwrite an existing file (as the
Finder does). To prevent doing something
you’ll regret, use the -i flag: cp -i source
target. Then cp will prompt you before over-
writing an existing file (see Figure 56-1).
• Figure 56-1: The -i flag tells the Terminal to prompt you
before overwriting any files.
What a Difference a Slash Makes
Note the obscure difference between cp -R myfolder
and cp -R myfolder/. The former copies the directory
and its contents to the destination. The latter, because of
the trailing forward slash, copies the contents of the direc-
tory but not the folder itself. The result of this can be very
messy. It can be very confusing to beginners, especially
because the tab completion always appends the forward
slash. This also applies to the mv command.
If you want to move a file, use the mv command:
mv source target
For example
mv myfile.txt ~/Desktop/myfile.txt
mv ~/Desktop/afolder /Volumes/Main/afolder
Like the cp command, the mv command does
not warn you if you are about to overwrite an
existing file. Again, use the -i flag to be
prompted when this might happen.
There is no actual rename command in the Terminal.
Instead, use mv and provide a new name:
mv myfile.txt newname.txt
mv ~/Desktop/afolder ~/Desktop/bfolder
The mv command cannot create a path,
whereas cp can. In other words, if you try to
copy filename.txt to /Users/larry/
Document/newfiles/filename.txt and the
newfiles directory doesn’t exist, the cp com-
mand will create it for you.
To delete a file, use the rm (remove) command:
rm filename
rm mydocument.doc
Be very, very careful with the rm command.
Unlike deleting something in the Finder —
which places the item in the Trash to be
deleted (emptied) or recovered later — the rm
command is an immediate deletion. The com-
mand does have a -W (capital W) flag that
attempts to undelete a deleted file. It might let
you undelete a file for a few minutes after
deletion, but you can’t count on that. 
The rm command can also delete directories, using
the -R flag:
rm -R mydirectory
Command names (rm, cp, mv) are case-
insensitive, so RM, Cp, and mV will work equally
well. Flags (like the -R flag added to rm), file-
names, and directory names are case-sensitive. 
As with cp and mv, the -i flag asks for confirmation
before completing the action.
The absolute worst command that you can
ever use is rm - R /, which attempts to
delete everything on your computer. To avoid
running this risk, do not use rm with sudo
(see Technique 55), do not use rm when you’re
logged in as root, and always use the -i
option to be prompted before disaster strikes.

Technique 56: Managing and Finding Files Fast
440
• Figure 56-3: The -a flag reveals hidden files.
• Figure 56-4: The -A flag is like -a, but it omits the
current and parent directories.

-l: Use -l to view more information about the
directory contents (see Figure 56-5).
• Figure 56-5: The -l flag shows permissions, ownership,
modification date, and more.

-r: Use -r to sort the directory contents in
reverse order by name.

-S: Use -S to sort the directory contents by size
in descending order.
Another common Finder trick that is replicated in
the Terminal is the ability to make an alias. In UNIX
terms, these are symbolic links and are created with
the ln (make link) command.
ln -s file alias
ln -s directory alias
Creating and Listing Directories
If you’re in the Finder, you always see a directory’s
contents whether you are in icon, list, or column
view mode. In the Terminal — as you might have
noticed — you won’t see any directory contents
unless you specifically ask for them by using the ls
(list) command. (See Figure 56-2.)
ls 
ls ~ (Figure 56-2)
• Figure 56-2: The listed contents of Larry’s Home
directory.
The nice thing is that the ls command lets you view
the contents of a directory you’re not even in! For
example, to see the contents of the Games folder, use
ls /Applications/Games
Like most commands, ls takes several arguments.

-a: Use -a to view every file, including hidden
ones (see Figure 56-3).

-A: Use -A to view every file, including hidden
ones, but not list the current and parent direc-
tories (see Figure 56-4). The current and parent
directories are represented by one and two
periods, respectively.

Using the find Command
441

-t: Use -t to sort the directory contents by
time in descending order.
In the Finder, you can create a new directory by mak-
ing a new folder. In the Terminal, you use the mkdir
(make directory) command:
mkdir directoryname
mkdir junk
Again, with this command, you can even make a
directory without being in the parent directory:
mkdir ~/Documents/By\ Application/Excel
Conversely, the rmdir (remove directory) command
deletes an empty directory:
rmdir directoryname
rmdir junk
rmdir ~/Documents/By\ Application/Excel
To delete a full directory, you need to use rm
-R directoryname. To delete an empty direc-
tory, use rmdir directoryname.
Using Wildcards
The true power of the basic Terminal commands
comes with using certain wildcards to make less-
specific statements.

*: The asterisk represents zero or more 
characters.

?: The question mark represents a single 
character.

[ ]: You can place options within brackets.
For example, if you have a folder full of images, you
can move all the JPGs with
mv *.jpg /path/to/new/destination
Or, you can delete all the files that begin with the
word chapter:
rm -i chapter*
The best way to learn how to use wildcards is to test
your command first by preceding it with echo. The
result of this is to display (in the Terminal screen)
the affected files rather than actually affecting the
files (see Figure 56-6).
• Figure 56-6: Use echo to preview the results of a
command.
Run your rm commands with echo first to see
what the effect will be before you remove a
bunch of files.
Using the find Command
The find command alone is a really good reason to
use the Terminal. It provides a quick and flexible
search capability. Although find has a number of
options, the easiest way to use it is like so:
find -f directory --name ‘filename’
For example:
find -f ~/Documents --name ‘chapter.doc’
To search for a file in the current directory, use
find . --name ‘filename’

Technique 56: Managing and Finding Files Fast
442
All in all, the find tool is one of the most useful
command line utilities. As an example, if you’re
looking for a file called something like quotes.doc
or quotations.doc, and it’s somewhere in your
Documents directory, do this:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type find -f ~/Documents --name quot*.doc -type
f and press Return (see Figure 56-9).
This command searches through the Documents
directory (and its subfolders) looking for a file
whose name begins with quot and ends with .doc.
• Figure 56-9: The directories searched and the files found
are returned.
3.
If you see your desired file, open it with open
/path/to/filename.
4.
If you don’t see your desired file, rerun the
find with a new command.
You can also use grep to find files. grep is a
regular expressions tool (regular expressions
being a very useful, and not easy to learn,
method of creating patterns to match). For
more information, see a good UNIX (or regu-
lar expressions) book or search the Internet for
tutorials.
Using the locate Command
Another option for finding files is to use the locate
command. But before you can use this, you need to
create the locate database and then update this
database frequently. The updatedb command is used
to create and update the locate database.
Other options include the ability to search for files
by type. A type of f restricts the find to files, and d
limits it to directories.
find -f ~ --name ‘book*’ -type f
find -f ~ --name ‘book*’ -type d
You can add a number to the end to indicate a modi-
fication date within a certain number of days from
now. The following applies only to files modified in
the last 24 hours:
find -f ~ --name ‘book*’ -type f -1
The find tool can also be used without a filename, in
which case it returns all the contents for the named
directory and all its subdirectories, as shown in
Figure 56-7:
find ~/Sites
• Figure 56-7: All the directory contents and subdirectory
contents are listed by using find.
In this way, the find tool can be a much more potent
version of the ls command. In fact, another easy to
remember trick is to use the -ls flag with find, as
shown in Figure 56-8:
find ~/Sites -ls
• Figure 56-8: The same directory as in Figure 56-7,
displaying more information.

Using the locate Command
443
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb to 
create the database.
3.
Type locate filename to look for a particular
file.
As you can see, locate is faster than find but
requires the initial creation of a database (which is
really just an index) in order to function. Here are
some tips for getting the most out of this simple
command:

Run the updatedb tool frequently (to update the
database) in order for your searches to be up-to-
date and accurate.

Create a cron (see Technique 53) to automati-
cally run the updatedb command.

Use wildcards in your filename to create a more
flexible search.

Piping and

M
ost beginning command line users are able to execute simple
commands in the Terminal to accomplish basic tasks. But the
advanced user also understands the concepts of standard input
and output: controlling where a command’s results are directed. You can
do this with piping and redirection output. This Technique focuses pri-
marily on those two subjects, but we first discuss a few other useful com-
mands that can be used in conjunction with piping.
Handy Commands to Use with Piping
This book’s Techniques relating to the Terminal cover the most efficient
ways to use the most common and useful commands, but we also want to
mention a few other tools that you’ll likely appreciate. These commands
can be used independently, but you’ll find them particularly useful in
conjunction with piping and output redirection.
The wc (word count) command is used to count the number of lines,
words, and characters in a file:
wc filename
wc chapter57.txt
The output of this command is very simple. It returns the number of
lines, words, and characters (see Figure 57-1). In the figure, for example,
you can see that the Installer Log File contains 0 lines, 3,803 words, and
47,647 characters. If you only want to see some of these values, use the
different flags to control output:

l: For lines

w: For words

c: For characters

Handy Commands to Use with Piping
445
• Figure 57-1: Run wc to get statistics on a file.
You can also change the position of the flags to con-
trol the order in which results are returned. For
example, wc -wl filename returns just the number
of words and lines; wc -cw filename returns the
number of characters and then the number of words.
You can use the wc command with piping to
return the number of items in a directory. For
more information, see “Combining
Commands with Pipes.”
As with everything in the Terminal, command
names (wc, sort, ps) are case-insensitive, so
WC, Sort, and pS will work equally well. Flags
(like the -w flag added to wc), filenames, and
directory names are case-sensitive. 
The sort command sorts a file alphabetically and
returns the sorted list:
sort filename
The sort command takes several arguments to
adjust its parameters:

b: Ignores any blank spaces at the beginning of a
line

d: Sorts in phone-directory order (ignoring
everything but letters, numbers, and blank
spaces)

f: Performs a case-insensitive sort

r: Sorts in reverse order
You can actually use sort to see whether a file
is already sorted: Use sort -c filename.
The ps command lists currently running processes
(think process status). A process is UNIX-speak for a
running application, service, or technology. This
command is very easy to use:
ps flags
The relevant parameters (flags) for this com-
mand are

a: Shows all processes, not just the ones you’re
running

c: Shows a minimal version of the process name

m: Sorts the list of running processes by memory
usage

r: Sorts the list of running processes by CPU
usage

U: Shows the process for a particular user
The functionality of the ps command is dupli-
cated in the Finder by the Process Viewer utility.
Finally, the du command displays disk usage statis-
tics. It takes several flags:

k: Returns the statistics in megabytes

h: Makes the result more readable for humans

s: Shows the results for every file

c: Totals the statistics
Here are several practical examples of this com-
mand. To view

Total disk usage of the current directory, type
du -sh (see Figure 57-2).

446
• Figure 57-4: You can limit du to a specific directory.

Size of a specific file in kilobytes, type du file-
name (see Figure 57-5).
• Figure 57-5: Show a file’s size.
Combining Commands 
with Pipes
Pipes are one of the most important timesaving com-
mand line tools. As you can see, commands normally
send their output (the result of the command) to the
display (the Terminal). By using pipes, you can send
the output of one command to be used as the input
for another. This is accomplished by the pipe opera-
tor, a vertical bar (found above the backslash key),
to join multiple commands together:
output_command | input_command
For example, here’s how you would find the number
of processes that you have running:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type ps -auxU username to see all your
processes.
• Figure 57-2: Larry’s Home directory uses a whopping
3.9MB of space. 

Disk usage of individual files in the current
directory (and its subdirectories), type du -h
(see Figure 57-3).
• Figure 57-3: The du command can show the size of every
file.

Disk usage of a specific directory, type du -h
~/Desktop (see Figure 57-4).

Combining Commands with Pipes
447
3.
Type ps -auxU username | wc -l to view the num-
ber of your processes (see Figure 57-6).
• Figure 57-6: Use the pipe with multiple commands to
fine-tune your results.
Or, if you want to see how many items you have in a
particular directory, do this:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type ls directoryname to list the files in the
directory.
3.
Type ls directoryname | wc -l to view the num-
ber of files in the directory.
4.
Type ls -A directoryname | wc -l to view the num-
ber of files in the directory, including hidden
files (see Figure 57-7).
• Figure 57-7: Use the pipe with multiple commands to
fine-tune your results.
Or, if you want to find every file with an extension of
TIFF or TIF or tiff or tif, you can use the find com-
mand with grep:
find . | grep -i tif 
We don’t cover the grep command much in this
book, but you’ll get a sense of what it can do from
this example. The find command returns all the files
in the current directory and subdirectory. This list is
then sent to the grep utility, which removes every
file that doesn’t include some version of tif (the i flag
means that it should ignore case). The result of grep
is then sent to the Terminal (see Figure 57-8).
• Figure 57-8: Use a pipe with grep to help narrow a search.
Another good use of piping is to find the largest
directories on your computer. You can do this 
by combining the du and sort commands (see
Figure 57-9).
du -sk * | sort -nr

Technique 57: Piping and Redirecting Output with the Terminal
448
As an example, here’s how to use these commands
to create a TextEdit file that lists the contents of the
/etc directory:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type ls -A /etc | pbcopy and press Return 
(see Figure 57-10).
The ls command is executed (the -A means it
should list everything), but you won’t see any
results displayed in the Terminal. Instead,
they’re pasted onto the Clipboard.
• Figure 57-10: Send the results of a command to the
Clipboard.
3.
Open TextEdit.
4.
Create a new document.
5.
Press Ô+V to paste the Clipboard contents into
the document (see Figure 57-11).
Alternatively, you can use pbpaste to take the
Clipboard contents and do something with them.
For example, if you’re writing an e-mail and want to
know how long it is, do this:
1.
Open your e-mail message in Mail.
2.
Select the entire message body by pressing Ô+A.
3.
Open a Terminal window.
4.
Type pbpaste | wc -w and press Return 
(see Figure 57-12).
• Figure 57-9: Use piping to find the largest directories by
size.
The du -sk * syntax calculates the size of all the
items (indicated by the asterisk) in the current direc-
tory. (Larry was in his Home directory when he ran
it, so it will check his files.) This is then piped
through the sort command, which places this list in
numerically reverse order. You can be more exhaus-
tive by using cd to go into a directory and then use
the history command’s !du to repeat this piping
procedure:
cd Library
!du
As a final example of using pipes, you can use the
pbpaste and pbcopy commands, which allow you to
move data on and off the Clipboard while you’re
working with the command line. This means that
these two commands are the ultimate glue for trans-
ferring text between regular Mac applications and
UNIX tools:

pbpaste outputs the current contents of the
Clipboard (presumably put there by a standard
Mac OS X application) to the Terminal. You then
use output redirection or a pipe to feed this out-
put to a file or to a second UNIX program that
does something useful with the data.

pbcopy works the other way around, putting
data onto the Clipboard. The data is placed on
the right side of a pipe, which means that the
output of some other UNIX program is piped into
pbcopy. The output of the first program is stored
on the Clipboard, where it can be accessed from
Mac applications by pressing Ô+V.

Redirecting Output
449
• Figure 57-11: The results of the ls command have been
passed into the TextEdit document.
• Figure 57-12: Piping the Clipboard contents through the
word count command.
5.
If you wanted, you could store the number of
words back in the Clipboard by using pbpaste
| wc -w | pbcopy.
A more advanced level of piping uses the tee com-
mand. tee lets the output go to a command but also
saves it to a file (think of it like a plumbing T, where
the water splits in two opposite directions):
output_command | tee filename | input_
othercommand
ls -A /path/to/directory | tee ~/
contents.txt | wc -l
The above command lists (ls) all (-A) of the con-
tents of a directory. Instead of displaying these con-
tents, they are instead stored in a text file called
contents.txt (located in the Home directory). The
result of the ls command is also sent to the wc
command, which returns the number of items 
(by counting the number of lines).
Redirecting Output
Your Terminal uses the notion of STDIN (standard
input), STDOUT (standard output), and STDERR
(standard error) to control the flow of information.
These are each channels for information to travel
through. For example, the ls command receives
arguments through the Terminal (STDIN) and sends
its results to the Terminal screen (STDOUT). But it
doesn’t have to work this way. As you can see with
piping, you can send the standard output to another
command rather than the Terminal. Likewise, a com-
mand can take its input from the output of another
command. You can also add files to the mix by using
output redirection.
To indicate that a command should take its input
from a file, use <:
command < sourcefile
Use < in cases where the command normally
takes its input from the keyboard. Many
commands — including more, head, tail,
pine, and vi — take filenames as arguments
by default, so using < is unnecessary.
Comparatively, to redirect standard output to a file
instead of displaying it in the Terminal screen, use >:
command > filename

Technique 57: Piping and Redirecting Output with the Terminal
450
This syntax appends the output to the existing file,
adding it at the end. For example:
ls -l ~/Documents >> ~/Desktop/listing.txt
ls -l ~/Music >> ~/Desktop/listing.txt
ls -l ~/Pictures >> ~/Desktop/listing.txt
Essentially, this how your system logs function: All
messages created by the process being monitored
are appended to the existing system log.
The > operator erases any existing contents in
the named file. To be extra careful, use >
instead!
For example, you can create a text file listing the
contents of a directory by using
ls -la ~/Documents >
~/Desktop/documents_listing.txt
You should be aware that this technique overwrites
any existing file contents and creates the file if it
doesn’t already exist. If you want to build upon an
existing file or not risk overwriting a file, use >:
command >> filename

Viewing and Editing
Text Files
T
he last of the major Terminal techniques that we discuss deals with
viewing and editing text files. Although you can easily do this in the
Finder with TextEdit, BBEdit, and the like, here are some good rea-
sons for working with text files in the Terminal:

Accessing hidden files is easier in the Terminal.

If you’re already in the Terminal, you might not want to switch 
applications.

You might already be working on a remote server.
In this Technique, you master two basic commands for viewing a text file.
Then you see two other handy commands that will display only a portion
of a text file — a real timesaver. Finally, you see how to perform basic
edits of a text file in the Terminal by using the pico editor.
Viewing Files
Because UNIX comes with a gazillion little utilities, each of which does a
specific thing, separate commands exist for viewing files as well for edit-
ing files. Obviously, you can use an editing tool to just view a file, but why
would you want to? By using one of the two commands for viewing a file,
you can simplify the experience.
cat
The cat command is actually short for concatenation, which is the pro-
cess of appending one thing to another. The command’s intention is to
take several files as arguments and then display them all in order, as 
if their contents constituted one large file. You can use cat to do this,
showing multiple files at once, or you can use it to display a single file
(see Figure 58-1).
The syntax for this command is simply
cat filename

Technique 58: Viewing and Editing Text Files
452
• Figure 58-2: Use cat to pipe two files through the wc
command.
Do not try to concatenate two files with the
command cat myfile1.txt myfile2.txt >
myfile1.txt. This will not append the
myfile2.txt contents to myfile1.txt, but
rather destroy the original myfile1.txt con-
tents and then add the myfile2.txt contents
to it. If you want to concatenate myfile1.txt
to myfile2.txt, do so in a new file.
more or less
The cat utility is great for quickly looking at a file —
even though that’s not what it was originally
intended for — but it lacks certain features. Namely,
you can’t move around too much within the cat
command. As a step up from this, UNIX normally
comes with a more command, which displays a file
one page at a time. After the more command is dis-
playing a file, you can then press the spacebar (or
the F key) to paginate forward or Q to quit.
Sadly, your Mac doesn’t have more on it. What it has
instead is its successor, less (and no, we’re not mak-
ing this up). The less command is faster than more
and lets you page backward, too. To use less, simply
type
less filename
For example (the result of the second command is
displayed in Figure 58-3):
less ~/Documents/myfile.txt
less /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
For example, to view the Apache Web Server’s con-
figuration file, type
cat /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
• Figure 58-1: Use cat to view Apache’s configuration file.
These two examples demonstrate how you can use
cat to view multiple files at once (each appended to
the next):
cat myfile.txt myfile2.txt
cat myfile.txt ~/Documents/myfile2.txt 
~/ Desktop/myfile3.txt
You can make cat a little more useful by using either
the -n flag to number the lines as they’re displayed
or by using -b, which numbers all but the blank
lines. You can also use cat with the pipe or output
redirection. (For more on output redirection and
piping, see Technique 57.) For example:
cat myfile1.txt myfile2.txt > newfile.txt
creates a new file (named newfile.txt in this exam-
ple) by putting the other two (myfile1.txt and
myfile2.txt) together. 
This command tells you how many lines the two files
together contain (1,687 in the example shown in
Figure 58-2):
cat myfile1.txt myfile2.txt | wc -l

Viewing Parts of Files
453
• Figure 58-3: Use less to view a file one page at a time.
Familiarize yourself with less because all man
pages are displayed by using it. For more on
the man (manual) command, see Technique 55.
Here are the basic commands for moving around
after you’re in less:

Press H at any time to see all the commands
(see Figure 58-4).
• Figure 58-4: The help page for less.

Press F to scroll forward one page.

Press B to scroll backward one page.

Press Return to scroll forward one line.

Press D to scroll forward one-half page.

Press Y to scroll backward one-half page.

Press Q to quit.
You can also precede the d, b, f, Return, and y com-
mands with a number to move that many lines. For
example, 10f moves forward 10 lines, and 20b moves
backwards 20 lines. Similarly, g preceded by a num-
ber goes to a specific line. (1g goes to the first line,
and 169g moves to line 169.)
Type man less or less --help to see all the options,
including how to perform searches.
Your Mac has a utility called more on it, but it’s
the same thing as less (it’s not really more, it’s
just called more). In fact, if you check out the
manual for more (man more), you’ll see the
manual for less. Marc’s explanation for this
phenomenon is that sometimes less is more.
You can’t argue with that.
Viewing Parts of Files
If you don’t need to view an entire file, you have no
reason to use less. Viewing just the part that you
need saves time. Use the head command to view just
the first few lines of a file or tail to view just the last
few lines:
head myfile.txt
tail ~/Documents/file.txt
Both of these commands take an n flag to dictate
how many lines to display (see Figure 58-5 and
Figure 58-6):
head -n 5 /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

Technique 58: Viewing and Editing Text Files
454
Editing Files
If you want to edit files in the Terminal, you have
several options:

pico: A bare-bones application

vi: A more advanced text editor

vim: A modified version of vi

emacs: Perhaps the most powerful text editor
To keep this simple, we briefly discuss pico in this
chapter. If you find yourself doing command line
editing frequently, you ought to learn vim or emacs.
(Panther doesn’t actually have vi on it, just vim.)
Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly about vi, vim,
and emacs:

They’re all very powerful after you master
them.

They’re difficult to master and not even
remotely intuitive to learn.

Never, under any circumstances, suggest to
someone that vi or vim or emacs is any better
or worse than any other text editor.
If you do, you’ll never hear the end of that per-
son’s diatribe. (This is a point of serious con-
tention among computer geeks.)
In Technique 59, we demonstrate how to set
your default text editor.
The pico editor is really easy to use. Here’s all you
need to know:
1.
Type pico filename to open a file.
Type pico newfilename to create a new file
with that name.
2.
Type the text you want (see Figure 58-7).
• Figure 58-5: When using head, you can view just the first
few lines of a file.
tail -n 15 /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
• Figure 58-6: When using tail, you can view just the last
several lines of a file.
The tail command has a couple of other useful
flags. These are

-r: Shows the lines in reverse order

-f: Keeps the tail utility running (tail will con-
tinue to show the last lines of a file — even as
lines are added to the file — until you press
Control+C to stop it)
You can view system logs with tail by using
tail -f logname. This will keep the tail
utility running, persistently updating you as
the system log changes. In other words, the
last ten lines (the default number of lines to
display) are always displayed onscreen, even
as lines are added to the log. This is essentially
the functionality duplicated with the Console
utility. This is extremely useful to Web devel-
opers and system administrators.

Editing Files
455
This might seem like an absurd statement. As a
comparison, vim requires you to press I to begin
inserting characters. You cannot just type away
on other applications.
• Figure 58-7: Working in the pico text editor.
3.
Press Delete to remove characters.
Again, as a comparison, to delete characters in
vim, you press the X key.
4.
Press Control+O to save your work.
After you press this command, you’ll be prompted
with what filename to use (see Figure 58-8). Press
Return to use the default filename listed. To
change the filename, press the Delete key to
delete the default name and then type in the new
name.
• Figure 58-8: Saving a file in pico.
5.
Press Control+X to exit pico.
If you haven’t saved your work, you’ll be given
the option to do so (pico calls the changes a
modified buffer) before exiting.
6.
To copy or cut a section of code, do this (you
cannot use the mouse to move around, you
must use the arrow keys):
a. Place your cursor where you want to begin.
b. Press Control+Shift+6 to mark the beginning of
the area to be copied.
c. Move your cursor to the end. (The selected
text will be highlighted.)
d. Press Control+K to cut the selected text.
e. Move the cursor to where you want to paste
the text.
f. Press Control+U to paste the selected text.
pico doesn’t actually have a copy command.
To copy some text, cut it, paste it back in its
original place, and then paste it again in the
new location.
Don’t forget that you can also edit text files by using
Finder tools — but launch those from the Terminal.
For example:

open -e filename: Opens a file in TextEdit

open -a applicationname filename: Opens a
file in the named application

bbedit filename: Opens a file in BBEdit
BBEdit also has an option to open hidden files
directly in the application.

B
ecause the previous several Techniques — and much of what the
more advanced Mac user does — depends upon the Terminal appli-
cation, knowing how to adjust its behavior is well worth the time
spent. In this Technique, we begin with the different preference settings
the application itself has to offer and how they relate to using this tool
most effectively. Then we show you the benefits of the different shells
that you can use. (A shell is a tool that allows you to interact with the
operating system.) Afterward, you figure out how to use special prefer-
ences files that affect your shell. Finally, we discuss a few cool related
freeware and shareware applications.
Adjusting Terminal’s Preferences
The Terminal actually has two different areas for setting its preferences:

The Terminal Preferences panel (see Figure 59-1)
• Figure 59-1: The Terminal Preferences panel has limited uses.

Adjusting Terminal’s Preferences
457

Window Settings, also called Terminal Inspector
(see Figure 59-2)
• Figure 59-2: The Terminal’s Window Settings controls
much of the Terminal’s behavior.
Each of these is accessible under the Terminal
menu. The Terminal Preferences panel is great if you
know what you’re doing, whereas the latter is for
more general-purpose and cosmetic adjustments.
The Terminal Preferences panel has three settings:

What to execute when a new Terminal window is
created

How to identify the type of Terminal

What, if any, .term file to open when a new
Terminal window is created
You probably don’t want to mess with the first two,
but the last can be handy, as you’ll see in the section
“Creating Terminal Preferences Files” later in this
Technique.
The Window Settings dialog lets you adjust many
different features. Each setting can be altered by
selecting the general option (listed next) from the
pull-down menu at the top of the window. Each sub-
sequent panel uses some combination of radio but-
tons, check boxes, and/or pull-down menus.

Shell: The only thing you can do here is dictate
what the Terminal does when you exit a shell.
Most likely, you’ll want to close the window.
To change what shell you use by default, use
the Terminal Preferences panel. Read about
the different shells in the upcoming section,
“Choosing Your Shell.”

Processes: Don’t touch the processes unless you
really, really know what you’re doing. For most,
the best use of the Processes panel is to see
what processes are running, particularly if you
have some going in the background.

Emulation: The Emulation panel lets you control
how the Terminal behaves (in other words, what
other tools it behaves like). You probably don’t
want to mess around here unless you decide to
turn on the audio and visual bells.

Buffer: The Buffer panel controls how much of
the data the Terminal has received is retained in
memory. You definitely want to enable this, and
the 10,000-line default is sufficient for most
users. You can also tweak the Scrollback settings
here.

Display: Use the Display panel to set how your
Terminal looks (see Figure 59-3). You can choose
a cursor, a font, and how characters look on the
screen. Most importantly, select the Enable Drag
Copy/Paste of Text check box so you can easily
copy and paste between the Terminal and the
Finder.

Technique 59: Customizing Your Terminal
458
• Figure 59-4: For the truly stylish Terminal geek, use an
image for the background.

Window: This panel is also cosmetic but is
worth tinkering with. You’ll want to set the
dimensions of the Terminal so that it fits nicely
on your screen. The title section of this window
lets you give your Terminal a useful or silly title.
In Figure 59-5, for example, the Terminal title
shows the current command being run (vim) and
the keyboard shortcut to access this window
(Ô+1).
• Figure 59-5: Customize your Terminal title with the
Window panel.
If you use the Terminal a lot, you can save a lot
of time by giving your Terminal windows a useful
title. By doing so, you’ll be able to easily select
the right Terminal window by seeing its name in
Exposé or when it’s minimized in the Dock. We
recommend that your Terminal title comprise
• Figure 59-3: Use the Display panel to make your
Terminal more cosmetically pleasing.
If you spend a lot of your time using the
Terminal to access UNIX servers, you might
have better luck changing the encoding (using
the Character Set Encoding drop-down box) to
ISO Latin 1. Local filenames might look strange
with this setting, but your remote filenames,
which are normally in ISO format, will look
correct.

Color: This panel is completely cosmetic, but
what’s wrong with that? Most likely you’ll want
to use black text on a white background for legi-
bility, but if you don’t worry about your eyesight,
go wild. You can even use an image as the back-
ground, although you’ll have to be careful with
the text color or else you’ll have a hard time
using the Terminal (see Figure 59-4).

Adjusting Terminal’s Preferences
459
 The active process name
 The .term filename (if a .term file — see
“Creating Terminal Preferences Files” — is
being used)
 The command key (Ô) shortcut
You can also resize the Terminal window at
any time by clicking and dragging the lower-
right corner. This is likely to mess up the exist-
ing Terminal display, though.

Keyboard: The Keyboard tool is just downright
fantastic for people who use the Terminal regu-
larly. It allows you to map commands or text to
certain key combinations.
For example, with the Keyboard tool, you could
make a shortcut to list the current directory’s con-
tents as you want them:
1.
Open the Keyboard panel of the Window
Settings (see Figure 59-6).
• Figure 59-6: The Keyboard Terminal Inspector panel.
2.
Select the F5 line in the list of keys.
3.
Click the Edit button.
4.
In the resulting dialog, select Shift from the
Modifier drop-down list.
5.
Leave the Action drop-down as is (“send string
to shell”).
6.
In the text box, type du -sk * | sort -nr
(see Figure 59-7).
This is the basic command that you want to exe-
cute. It returns a list of files or folders and their
disk usage, sorted from most to least.
• Figure 59-7: Use the prompt to add a keyboard shortcut.
7.
Hold down the Option key and then press
Return.
The Option+Return combination adds a Return
to the end of the command so that you don’t
have to press Return after using the keyboard
shortcut.
8.
Click OK or press Return.
9.
To use the shortcut, press Shift+F5 
(or Shift+fn+F5 on a laptop).
See the results in Figure 59-8.

Technique 59: Customizing Your Terminal
460
5.
In the resulting dialog (see Figure 59-9), type a
name for your settings in the Save As text box
and save the file in the ~/Library/Application
Support/Terminal folder.
• Figure 59-9: The Terminal creates a .term file when you
save a window.
To use the .term file, you can

Choose it from the File➪Library menu 
(see Figure 59-10).

Drag the .term file from the Finder onto the
Terminal icon.

Double-click the .term file (if it’s set to open in
the Terminal by default).
After you create a .term file, you can edit it in any
text editor.
You can edit a .term file with ease, although
you’ll find that trying to change colors in the
file is ridiculously hard.
• Figure 59-8: Create keyboard shortcuts to run common
commands quickly.
You can also add new keyboard shortcuts
(instead of editing existing ones) by clicking
the Add button in the Keyboard panel.
After you customize the Terminal, click the Use
Settings as Defaults button. If you want to create a
temporary set of preferences, use a .term file, which
we discuss in the next section.
Creating Terminal 
Preferences Files
Because people who use the Terminal tend to use it
a lot, changing your settings for each circumstance
would be inconvenient. To work around this, you
can create .term files, which are like saved Terminal
settings.
1.
Create a Terminal folder within the
~/Library/Application Support folder.
2.
Open the Terminal.
3.
Adjust the settings as necessary.
See the previous section for which settings you
want to work with.
4.
Choose Save from the File menu (or press Ô+S).

Choosing Your Shell
461
• Figure 59-10: Your saved .term files appear as options in
the File➪Library menu.
Even more handy than saving your preferences, your
.term files can automatically run commands when
they’re opened.
1.
Create a new .term file by using the preceding
steps in this section.
2.
Open the saved .term file in any text editor.
3.
Look for the code that reads
<key>ExecutionString</key>
4.
Between the <string></string> tags on the
following line, type the command that you
want to run.
To execute multiple commands, separate each
with a semicolon.
5.
Save the file.
The next time you open this .term in the
Terminal, the commands are executed.
You can have the Terminal use this .term
automatically by selecting it in the Terminal
Preferences panel.
Choosing Your Shell
When you’re running the Terminal, you’re really
using a shell. A shell is a tool that allows you to inter-
act with the operating system. In other words, from
the command line, you don’t tell the OS anything
directly. You tell the shell what you want to do, and
the shell makes it happen. This is only really impor-
tant in that you must understand what shell you are
running to be able to configure it. Your Mac has all
the popular shells:

sh: The Bourne shell.

csh: The C shell.

tcsh: A enhanced version of the C shell 
(called the T shell).

bash: The Bourne Again shell. (Yes, that is its
name.)

zsh: A geeky, lesser-used shell that’s very 
powerful.
Panther’s Terminal uses the bash shell by default,
but Jaguar runs tcsh. If you’d rather go back to using
tcsh or any other shell, follow these steps:
1.
Open the Terminal Preferences panel.
2.
Select the Execute This Command (Specify
Complete Path) radio button.
3.
Enter /bin/shellname as the command.
All the shells are located in the /bin directory.
To use tcsh instead of bash, type /bin/tcsh in
the text box (see Figure 59-11).

Technique 59: Customizing Your Terminal
462
1.
In the Terminal, type pico filename, where file-
name is the appropriate file for your shell.
If you’re using bash, type pico .bash_profile. If
you are using tcsh, type pico .tcshrc. You don’t
have to use pico to edit these, but because they
are hidden files (note the initial period in the file-
name), you won’t see them in the Finder.
See Technique 58 for how to use the pico
text editor.
2.
To have the Terminal print a message, type
echo “This is a message.”.
The echo command prints out a string. You can
use anything as your message.
3.
To have the Terminal execute a command, type
it on its own line.
For example, you could have the Terminal show
you a calendar by entering cal on its own line.
4.
Set your default text editor by using setenv
EDITOR /path/to/editor.
If you’d like your shell to use a particular editor
by default (for example, vi or emacs), change
this environmental setting. All the command line
editors are in /usr/bin, so setenv EDITOR
/usr/bin/vim makes vim your default editor.
5.
Create aliases.
If you’re using tcsh, type alias aliasname
‘command’ — for example, alias mysite ‘ssh -l
user www.mysite.com’. If you’re using bash, use
alias aliasname=’command’.
Aliases let you use shortcuts for longer 
commands.
6.
Save the file and close pico.
7.
Create a new shell/Terminal window (by
pressing Ô+N) to use the customization file
(see Figure 59-12).
• Figure 59-11: You can tell the Terminal which shell to use.
4.
Close the Terminal Preferences panel to save
your settings.
Features like tab completion, using the asterisk
as a wild card, and many other tricks are parts
of your shell, not the operating system or the
Terminal. You can learn more about any shell
by typing man bash or man tcsh (for the man
files on each) in the Terminal.
Customizing Your Shell
Knowing what shell you’re using is important
because then you can create special files to cus-
tomize its behavior. Each shell automatically loads a
configuration file when a new shell is created (like
when you open a new Terminal window). You can
use these configuration files to

Print a message.

Create shortcuts for common commands.

Adjust your environment settings.

Automatically execute commands.

your shell, using some sample configuration ideas:

Some of the best free tools are

Terminal Pal (http://

files from the Dock, which saves you the step of
loading the Terminal and then selecting the
.term file from the File➪Library folder.

Terminal Here plug-in (www.pyehouse.com/lynn/
termopen.php) creates a contextual menu item
that allows you to instantly open the Terminal
but in the current directory.

Marc’s very own Open Terminal Here script
(www.entropy.ch/software/applescript/)
resides in your Finder window toolbars and
opens the current directory in the Terminal.

Terminal Services (http://homepage.mac.com/
stas/terminalservices.html) creates a service
for running the selected text in the Terminal.
Another service option that it provides is to
fetch a URL in the Terminal by using the curl
tool.

Connect 4 (http://members.tripod.com/
boneheadproductions/connect4/) lets you 
play the popular game in the Terminal. (Well,
Connect 4 was popular when you were eight, 
anyway.)

AppleScript 
and You
T
he first thing that you should know about AppleScript (if you don’t
know already) is that it’s a wonderfully powerful tool, giving you an
easy way to automate repetitive tasks. AppleScript is a small, easy-
to-learn programming language that can control one application or act as
glue between many different apps. It’s also one of those rare technologies
that can be used by beginners and advanced programmers alike. If you
don’t have the time nor inclination to learn a new programming language,
you can use other people’s AppleScripts or quickly record your own. If
you’re the inquisitive type and have some spare time on your hands, the
sky’s the limit as to what you can accomplish.
Entire books are dedicated to AppleScript, so you won’t master the tech-
nology in this chapter, but the novice can get a good taste, and the expe-
rienced AppleScript user can pick up a new timesaving trick or two. 
We start by showing how fast and easy it is to create your own scripts.
Then we demonstrate some of the better uses of AppleScript. Finally, we
point you in the direction of some AppleScript resources to further your
knowledge.
The Easiest Way to Write Scripts
The default tool for creating AppleScripts is the Script Editor, found in
the Applications➪AppleScript folder. Use this simple application to write,
record, test, and run your AppleScripts. As a quick example of how easy
it is to record your own scripts, read on as we create an AppleScript
that opens and tweaks two Finder windows. As you’ll discover, many
applications — including practically all from Apple — are scriptable,
meaning that you can use AppleScript to control them (to varying
degrees). Specific applications are also recordable, meaning that you can
click the record button in the Script Editor, do what you want in another
application, click stop in the Script Editor, and the Script Editor applica-
tion will have translated all of your actions into the AppleScript language.
Not all scriptable applications are recordable, sadly, but starting by
recording an AppleScript is a great way to learn the language.

The Easiest Way to Write Scripts
465
Choose File➪Open Dictionary to find a list of
scriptable applications and what properties
those applications have. In this example, we
use the Finder, which is both scriptable and
recordable. After following through this exam-
ple, you can open up the dictionary and use it
to parse some of the information in the
recorded AppleScript.
In this example, we’ll show how you can record
actions taken in the Finder to make a new (margin-
ally useless) AppleScript:
1.
Open the Script Editor by double-clicking its
icon in the Applications➪AppleScript folder.
2.
Click the Record button (see Figure 60-1).
• Figure 60-1: Use the buttons at the top of the Script
Editor window to record and run your
AppleScripts.
3.
Go to the Finder.
Navigate to the Finder however you want to,
including clicking the Desktop or using the
Ô+Tab method.
4.
Create a new window by pressing Ô+N.
5.
Move to your Home directory by pressing
Ô+Shift+H.
6.
Move the window to the upper-left corner of
the screen.
7.
Create another new window by pressing Ô+N.
8.
Move to the Applications directory by pressing
Ô+Shift+A.
9.
Make sure the window is in list view mode by
pressing Ô+2.
For most of these steps, we use keyboard
shortcuts (because we’re keyboard shortcut
kind of people), but the Script Editor will also
follow most mouse actions as well. For example,
you can select Applications from the Go menu
instead of pressing Ô+Shift+A.

Move this window to the lower-right corner of
the screen.
11.
Return to the Script Editor.

Click the Stop button.
You’ll see the resulting AppleScript in the Script
Editor (see Figure 60-2).
• Figure 60-2: All the actions taken during the recording
are translated by the Script Editor.

If you want, run the new script by clicking Run.
You see two new windows created. This is a triv-
ial (but still kind of cool) use of the technology.

there’s really no faster way to do it!

script, you can run it by double-clicking it, mak-
ing it load in the Script Editor. Then click Run.
How you save your AppleScript is important. 
If you save it as a script, you’ll need to go back
through the Script Editor to run it every time,
but it does allow you to re-edit the script. On
the other hand, if you save a script as an appli-
cation, you can more quickly run it, but you’ll
never be able to edit it in the Script Editor
again (if you need to make changes later).
16.
If you want, edit the script to alter its behavior.
Assuming that you did not save the script as an
application, you can open it in Script Editor and
make alterations by typing within the main win-
dow. Click on either Compile or Run to check the
syntax of your work. (Run will both check the
syntax and try to run the script.)
Add a description of your script — when you
created it, what it’s used for, why you did cer-
tain things, and so forth — by typing it in the
Description box at the bottom of the Script
Editor application. This will help jog your
memory the next time you go to edit or even
run a script.
Basic AppleScript Commands
As you’ll quickly see from recording simple AppleScripts,
the language uses just a few English-language-like com-
mands. The most essential of these are

tell: The tell statement normally gets the ball
rolling and states what application should do what
thing (command or sequence of steps), as in tell
application “Finder”.... Each tell is con-
cluded with an end tell.

activate: The activate command makes an
application (the one mentioned in the previous bullet
for tell) active. Applications can be told to do
things without being made active.

open: The open command, as you might expect,
tells an application to open a file or a URL, in the
case of Safari.
14.
If you really like this script (and who wouldn’t?),
choose File➪Save.
In the resulting prompt (see Figure 60-3), you
can choose a name and destination for the
script. The pull-down menu lets you choose a
format, the most useful of which are Script and
Application. If you choose Application, the 
Save dialog lets you specify its properties (see
Figure 60-4), such as Run Only, which means
that the script runs but is not editable.
• Figure 60-3: Save a script to use or review later.
• Figure 60-4: An AppleScript application can be run
without going through the Script Editor.
15.
Run the script.
If you saved (in Step 14) the script as an applica-
tion, you can run it by double-clicking the saved
script in the Finder. If you saved the script as a


set: set is used to assign values to variables.

quit: The quit command quits an open applica-
tion. (AppleScript is literal that way.)

comments: Adding comments to your scripts goes a
long way toward helping you learn the language and
remember what you’re doing at this point of the
script. To add a comment to your script, precede it
with two hyphens, like this:
--This is a comment.
In the previous example, we recorded a script, but you can
write them from scratch by firing up Script Editor and typ-
ing away (a new script window is created when you launch
the application). You’ll need to use the right commands, the
proper syntax, and refer to the correct objects and attrib-
utes of the application being scripted (which you can find
by using the Open Dictionary option in the Script Editor’s
File menu). Click on Compile to check your syntax and click
on Run to test the AppleScript. You can view the Result and
Event Log panels at the bottom of the Script Editor for more
information on how your script performed.
Four Fabulous Reasons to 
Use AppleScripts
Perhaps the easiest way to learn AppleScript and
appreciate its value is by seeing what can be done
with it. You can download hundreds of excellent
AppleScripts from the Web (many of which we men-
tion elsewhere in this book) to examine and try or
use the AppleScript features built in to the operating
system. Here are just a few of the many practical
uses of AppleScripts:

Script menu: Your Mac comes with a slew of
AppleScripts already, found in the /Library/
Scripts directory. These scripts are not only
nice suggestions for what you can do, but they
also encourage you to use the Script menu. The
Script menu resides in your menu bar and gives
you quick access to your AppleScripts. Some of
these scripts retrieve stock quotes for you, get
weather forecasts, or open Web pages. See
Technique 9 for more information.

Folder Actions: With Folder Actions, you can
assign a script to be run when certain actions
happen within a particular folder. An AppleScript
might alert you when a file is added to a folder
(like your Drop box for file sharing), convert an
image dropped into a folder, or make an archive
(compressed version) of the folder when it’s
changed. See Technique 12 for more information.

Create a startup routine (see Figure 60-5): If you
go through a set routine each day when you start
your computer, you can have AppleScript per-
form this for you. Although you can start applica-
tions from Startup Items in the Accounts panel,
an AppleScript can go one step further by also
opening Finder windows, starting iTunes playing,
and launching Web sites.
• Figure 60-5: This AppleScript executes when Larry starts
his computer.

AppleScript Sourcebook: www.
applescript sourcebook.com
If you’re a power UNIX user or do a lot with
the Terminal, look into osascript, a tool for
performing interactions between command
line tools and AppleScript.
In terms of software, these are some of the tools that
work well with AppleScript:

AppleScript Studio (www.apple.com/
applescript/studio): Part of the free Xcode 
studio, the AppleScript Studio is a nice tool for
developing more intricate AppleScript applica-
tions. You’ll find Xcode on one of the Panther
installation discs (number 4 at the time of this
writing), in an Installs directory within the
Applications folder for brand new Macs, or you
can download it from Apple’s Web site.

Script Debugger (www.latenightsw.com, $190):
Late Night Software puts out a wonderful
AppleScript tool called Script Debugger. It’s 
not cheap, but it’s a very simple and powerful
application for the serious AppleScript coder.

Smile (www.satimage.fr/software/en/softx.
html, free): Smile falls somewhere between the
Script Editor and the AppleScript Studio. It’s a
basic script editor but also has a lot of graphical
user interface tools included to help you make
more interactive applications.
An AppleScript for your startup routine is a
great, great time saver. It can be added to
your Startup Items to automatically run when
you log on or removed from your Startup
Items with a single click if you’re traveling.

iTunes: If you use iTunes a lot — and we really,
really do — you’ll find that it’s a great reason to
use AppleScript. Doug Adams has over 200
iTunes-related AppleScripts available for down-
load from his site (www.malcolmadams.com/
itunes). AppleScripts can be used to tune into
your favorite online radio station when you log
in or play “Happy Birthday” when iCal sees it’s
your special day.
All the examples in this Technique demon-
strate routines that can be automated with
AppleScript. You can actually make entire
applications with AppleScript after you really
get the hang of the technology.
AppleScript Resources
Sure, you could search Google and browse through
the returned results to find some of the best
AppleScript resources available, but we’ll save you
the trouble. The granddaddy of them all (but of
course) is the AppleScript page of Apple (www.apple.
com/ applescript), featuring dozens of premade
scripts available for most Apple applications.
Each of the following sites has sample code available
as well as information and tutorials:

Entertaining
Yourself with
Screen Savers
T
he Mac has always been a pretty operating system, complete with
some pretty nice screen savers. Unlike all those boring ones that
Windows users see — most of which just promote Microsoft and its
products — your Mac can display flying toasters, an aquarium, or com-
plex fractals. Even though screen savers no longer serve any practical
purpose whatsoever (it’s virtually impossible to burn an image onto your
display), there’s nothing wrong with some good old-fashioned eye candy.
This Technique is long on cool and short on boring. We begin with some
information about Panther and screen savers. This section will be practi-
cal for most users, and you’ll see some nice tips. Next, we tell you where
you can get more screen savers (for those of you addicted to them) and
how to install the suckers. Finally, we show you one way-cool trick, which
is of absolutely no practical benefit to you at all! All in all, you’re not
going to find much in the way of increasing your productivity here (just
the opposite, in fact), but all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,
right?
Configuring Screen Savers in Panther
If you don’t like screen savers, you should at least read this section of the
book to know how to turn the things off. If you do like screen savers, you
should read this section to discover how to configure them. If you’re
indifferent towards screen savers, read this anyway. What do you care?
You can control your screen savers from the Screen Saver tab of the
Desktop & Screen Saver panel of System Preferences (see Figure 61-1).
The left column lets you choose what screen saver to run. The right col-
umn displays a preview of the selected screen saver. Under the preview
is the Options button that lets you configure the selected screen saver
(for those that are configurable; see Figure 61-2) and the Test button to
preview it.

Technique 61: Entertaining Yourself with Screen Savers
470
Toward the bottom of the Screen Saver tab are two
important controls:

A Start Screen Saver slider that lets you control
when to start the screen saver: You can set the
screen saver to start after a certain amount of
idle time or never at all. Keep in mind that if
this value is longer than the sleep or display
sleep settings in the Energy Saver panel (see
Figure 61-3), you’ll never, ever see the screen
saver. Your machine will go to sleep before the
screen saver ever kicks in.
• Figure 61-3: Your computer’s Energy Saver settings could
affect whether you ever see the screen saver.
To disable screen savers, set the Start Screen
Saver slider (in the Screen Saver panel) to
Never. It doesn’t matter which screen saver is
selected.
• Figure 61-1: Control your screen saver settings here.
• Figure 61-2: If a screen saver can be configured, clicking
the Options button brings up this panel.

Adding to Your Screen Saver Library
471

A Hot Corners button that lets you set hot cor-
ners: Here’s our advice: Don’t use hot corners to
activate your screen saver. Save them for Exposé,
which is far more useful and important than a
screen saver. Also, there’s a decent chance that
you’ll set a hot corner to activate the screen
saver and then inadvertently hit that corner
when you’re working (or playing a game) and
momentarily throw your whole system out of
whack. If you’re doing a presentation, you might
find the Disable Screen Saver hot corner useful
(configurable by clicking on the Hot Corners 
button), but if you’re doing a presentation, you
ought to disable screen savers entirely anyway.
The Desktop & Screen Saver and Exposé pan-
els both let you set the hot corners for screen
savers and Exposé functions.
The Desktop & Screen Saver panel isn’t the only
place that affects how screen savers run on your
computer (the Energy Saver panel gets into the mix).
Another, much more critical option can be found
within the Security panel of System Preferences (see
Figure 61-4). There you can set Panther to require a
password when the computer is awoken from sleep-
ing or just returns from displaying a screen saver.
This will protect your computer while you’re away,
assuming that you’re in a multi-user environment
(like an office) or have some rambunctious pets that
like to walk across your keyboard.
The best, perhaps only, reason to set a hot cor-
ner to activate your screen saver is if you set
up your computer to require a password to
return from displaying a screen saver. If you’re
in a multi-user environment, select the Require
Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep
or Screen Saver check box in the Security
panel (see Figure 61-4), and then move your
cursor to the hot corner before you leave your
desk. By using this method, you can quickly
secure your computer before you walk away
from it. (Any mischief-makers will have to
enter your password before wreaking their
havoc with your system.)
• Figure 61-4: The Security panel option can force users to
enter a password to reactivate the computer.
Adding to Your Screen 
Saver Library
Your Mac comes with a half-dozen screen savers out
of the box, but you don’t have to be satisfied with
those. You can download and use dozens of screen
savers. Here are some Web sites where you’ll find
collections you can download:

• Figure 61-5: The downloaded screen saver, as it appears
as a mounted disk image.
• Figure 61-6: Add the new screen saver to your Screen
Savers folder.
If your Library folder doesn’t already have a
Screen Savers directory, create one. You can
also add screen savers to /Library/Screen
Savers, which makes them available to all
users. If you do this, though, they won’t be
backed up with the rest of your stuff and can
easily be lost during operating system upgrades
or transitions from one computer to another.
4.
Open System Preferences.
You cannot select and use your screen saver
unless you open the Screen Saver panel after
the screen saver has been added to your sys-
tem. If the panel was open when you added
the new file, quit and restart System
Preferences.
These are some of our particular favorite individual
screen savers:

After Dark X + Fish: http://en.infinisys.co.
jp/product/adx/index.shtml, $10
After Dark was the screen saver for many years.
Then people stopped using screen savers entirely
(or so the story goes). Then came Marine
Aquarium (see the next bullet), which opened up
the world’s eyes to how fun a screen saver can
be. The latest version of After Dark, put out by
Infinisys, has many different modules, from the
toasters to the aquarium to a Mandelbrot set.
Definitely worth the sawbuck!

Marine Aquarium 2: www.serenescreen.com/
product/maquariumx/index.php, $20
Marine Aquarium 2 (from SereneScreen) creates
a beautiful virtual fish tank, using dozens of dif-
ferent types of fish plus a healthy dose of coral.
You can run this as a screen saver or all by itself.
Another version of the Marine Aquarium is avail-
able that displays the current date and time on a
crystal located in the tank.
To install a screen saver, follow these steps:
1.
Download the file from the Web site.
2.
Decompress and/or mount the downloaded file.
The downloaded file is most likely in some sort
of compressed format, like .sit or .gz. You’ll
need to use StuffIt Expander to decompress it. If
the file then has a .dmg extension, double-click it
to mount it as a disk image. After you have either
a folder or a disk image left (see Figure 61-5), you
can install the file.
3.
Move the screen saver file to ~/Library/Screen
Savers, where ~ refers to your Home directory
(see Figure 61-6).
The screen saver itself has a .saver file exten-
sion. Move this into your Library/Screen Savers
folder to add it to your available entertainment.

Using the Desktop as a Screen Saver
473
5.
Click Desktop & Screen Saver.
6.
Click the Screen Saver tab.
7.
Select and configure the new screen saver (see
Figure 61-7).
The screen savers that you’ve installed appear
in the middle group of listings in the left-hand
column.
• Figure 61-7: Select and configure the new screen saver.
Here’s another really cool way to add screen
savers: Use iPhoto. Your photo albums in iPhoto
are automatically added as potential slideshows
at the bottom of the list of screen savers. You
can select a photo album to run as a slideshow
and even configure it (see Figure 61-8).
• Figure 61-8: Select and configure a new screen saver
from iPhoto images.
Using the Desktop 
as a Screen Saver
In a Technique that discusses nothing but eye candy,
this trick takes the cake. You can have a screen
saver — any screen saver — run in place of the
Desktop image. It’ll slow down your computer like
few other things can, but it looks so cool.
Unless you have a Quartz Extreme-compatible
computer with a really good processor (or a
dual-processor, ideally), don’t plan on doing
anything else when running a screen saver on
your Desktop. We found this to be really slug-
gish on a 550 MHz G4 PowerBook but not
too bad on a 933 MHz G4 iBook.

• Figure 61-10: CoolBackground is a good tool for turning


Desktop Effects: http://flyingmeat.com/
freestuff.html, free
Desktop Effects is a no-frills tool, essentially just
giving you a Start/Stop button to control the
screen saver. It will automatically use your cur-
rent screen saver as the Desktop.
You can create a similar but far less 
performance-taxing effect by setting your
Desktop to use a Pictures folder and auto-
matically change the picture every so many
minutes. Although this doesn’t have the flair
or activity of some of the other options, it
effectively creates a slideshow on your
Desktop.
One way to make this happen is to hack in manually:
1.
Open up your Terminal application.
2.
Type /System/Library/Frameworks/Screen saver.
framework/Resources/Screen saverEngine.app/
Contents/MacOS/Screen saverEngine -background
and press Return.
In a second or two, you’ll see the current screen
saver being used as your Desktop image (see
Figure 61-9).
• Figure 61-9: Running the Flurry screen saver as the
Desktop.
3.
Press Control+C to stop this effect.
If you have multiple monitors, one monitor
runs the screen saver while the other has a
solid black background.
If you’d rather not mess with the Terminal and want
something a little easier to turn on and off, try either
of these tools:
