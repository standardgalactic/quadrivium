This is the 3rd and final edition to our blackbook marketing manuals. 
As usual this is no frills and no nonsense, straight to the point book 
on how to accomplish and execute a variety of original cutting edge 
methods. 
 
We believe this one is the most powerful we have created due to a 
few concepts that we have connected through our ongoing testing 
and discovery. 
 
The data we have tapped into is immense and when hooked into the 
available functions of Facebook can be utilized in some really unique 
and interesting ways. 
 
Without further ado, we present our latest work, if you have any 
questions please direct them through pm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Build Massive Amounts of FB emails and contacts 
 
FFAP has some nice new features to implement. The two biggest ones are 
definitely “Upload Contact File” and “Share Wall Posts”. This makes adding 
large amounts of friends and reaching them easier than ever before. So now 
we must answer the obvious questions “How do we build a contact file?” and 
“What do I share with them?” 
 
 
BUILDING CONTACT FILE 
 
 
MANUALLY SCRAPING 
This is obviously the most time intensive way to build our contact file. This is 
also the best way to build a niche contact file. Check out this Google search 
string:  
 
“hotmail com” OR “gmail com” OR “yahoo com” site:facebook.com woodward  
 
This string will search only facebook.com for all combinations of “woodward” 
and the email strings above. This is obviously a last name search but this is very 
easy to replace with niche keywords for example “bieber” “justin bieber” and 
all related strings. You can then find the Google advanced results option and 
search day by day or week by week if you wish as far back as you want. This 
takes a while of course but you can gather thousands of emails for your niche 
pretty quickly. 
 
We have included a very powerful custom Excel file that will automatically 
outputstrings based on any input. 
 
These are search results and as you can see they aren’t just emails.  
Right click > select all on all the data that you have gathered. Go to this site: 
http://extractor.prusac.com and paste all your data into the “Put text with 
email addresses here” field. Check out all the different extraction options.  
 
You can exclude anything from your list. You can extract only US emails, or only 
foreign emails by country if you wish. Once you have all your settings right, 
click “start extracting emails”.  
 

After the results are visible, right cick > select all > paste into a text file > save 
as “contacts. txt” or any unique name that relates to the email data you have 
scraped. 
 
USING A SCRAPING PROGRAM 
 
We can build huge contact files using a scraping program. There is a custom 
program floating around as well as SEE: The Social Email Extractor. This is 
basically the most powerful scraping tool I have ever seen. You can basically 
just paste and go and it will use built in proxies to scrape and output the 
results. 
 
NAMES DATABASE 
We have included one file from the Facebook names database. These are all 
last names of Facebook users sorted by the most commonly occurring. You can 
easily cut and copy these into the Social Email Extractor or the custom Excel file 
to quickly make hundreds of search strings. You can find the whole database on 
some torrent sites, however we have stripped and extracted the most valuable 
parts and included them for you. Refer to the scraping section to learn how to 
turn these into powerful search strings for scraping. 
 
This is a motherload. It is almost unlimited amount of potential to be able to 
extract emails of the top 250k most occuring lastnames of facebook users. You 
can add them as friends through the contact file, email them, invite them to 
events, invite them onto other social platforms and more. 
 
ADDING FRIENDS 
Now that you have built your contact file, it’s time to add your friends. Go into 
FFAP and choose “Upload Contact File”. Not all results are actual Facebook 
emails, so you will want to set your friend add amount per account a bit higher 
than normal. Add 200-250 friends per account per process. This has had a 100% 
success rate for me in testing and I have not lost any accounts. 
 
NOW WHAT? 
Once you have a significant amount of friends, there are quite a few options 
available to you. Make a post on your own wall and share it with all your 
friends, message your friends directly, or invite to your custom Facebook 
pages. 
 
 

POSTING AND SHARING WALLS USING CUSTOM FACEBOOK PAGES 
 
One of our options is to post on our own wall, and share the post with all our 
friends. We can make this look very pretty with a nice logo or whatever picture 
we want. We like to make custom pages with custom “signup” tabs and 
geolocating. 
 
(PAGE CREATION) 
 
Now create a wall post and insert the link to your custom page. You will see the 
post expand with your clickable page name, and logo (picture). 
After that share your wall post with the “share wall updates” option. Select 
“First update on account profiles wall” this should be your custom page. You 
can also insert a variable laced message to be displayed with your share to get 
your friends to go to the page. 
 
METHODS FOR MESSAGING FRIENDS 
 
1) Ewhore IQ Beg method 
2) I don’t feel safe method 
3) We were meant to be together method 
 
EWHORE IQ BEG METHOD 
This method obviously works when messaging from a female user to a male 
user. We want to make them feel special, lucky, and chosen. We want to be 
with them SO bad but we just can’t risk being with another dumb guy. This is 
easily accomplished with a message such as this. 
 
“Hey Thanks for being my friend! Finding the right person is so hard, but just 
looking at you I swear that I have. This feeling I get inside is something I have 
never felt. I’ll be honest, I’m ready to get down with you ASAP, #i’m totally 
serious! BUT before we do that, I can’t STAND stupid ignorant people, I have 
been in too many relationships with dumb people and I can’t do it anymore I 
hope you understand. Before we talk again please just take this iq quiz quick 
at (IQQUIZLINKHERE) Please do it ASAP and respond with your score and the 
best time to come over to play! I can’t wait to meet you, touch you, feel you. 
Please I am serious I can go anywhere at anytime I want you NOW! “ 
 

IM JUST NOT FEELING SAFE METHOD 
 
Again for female to male users. Our friend was attacked by an online predator 
and after having the realization that this could happen to anyone, we can 
never be too careful and need them to just verify their identity quick. Here is a 
sample message: 
 
Hey thanks for being my friend! I’ve been searching so hard trying to find the 
right person you know, and I get this crazy feeling when I look at you that I just 
can’t explain, I really know I have to be with you. Before anything though my 
best friend was attacked by someone she met on a social site so I really need 
you to confirm you’re not a predator quick and verify your identity......No 
offense but I will NOT be a victim of online predators. Just take 2 mins quick 
and verify you’re not a predator or a rapist or anything here (INSERT ID 
PROTECTION LINK HERE) , otherwise I will just be too scared to talk to you. I 
really can’t wait to hear from you and please send some more pics too after 
you do that! 
 
 
WE WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER METHOD 
We are SO SURE that it is our destiny to be with said person, we took a love 
calculator test to make sure and imagine that, it said we were destined to be 
together: 
 
I’ll admit I’m definitely here 2 find a guy. I liked ur profile so I added u I really 
think we should b more than friends I took this quiz and entered our names 
and it said we were meant 2 be u take it too and if it works 4 u we should be 
2gether take it at http:/www.findthatcrush.com  and hit me back I can’t wait 2 
be with u! 
 
 
WALL POSTING YOUR CUSTOM PAGES 
Custom pages such as those talked about in this book are obviously great to 
post on your own wall and share with all your friends. It will expand the page 
title on your wall which will be clickable and whatever picture you have for it. 
You can customize this to draw the most attention. Adding a message with it 
such as “Whoa look at this!” can spread your page quickly. Add some geo 
locating and a good pitch and you will dominate this. 

If you are using FFAP go to “Post Wall Updates” and select to post on your own 
wall. Insert the link to your custom page and post it. Now you can simply go to 
“Share Wall Updates” select the first update on your own wall and you will 
share the wall update with your custom page with all your friends. 
Obviously there are numerous viral scripts floating around. These won’t be 
covered but if you do some research and can follow instructions you can find 
one and set it up. 
 
 
Crushing With Events 
 
We can also use our contact files to make devastating Events and get people to 
them very quickly. You will need a PVA account for this to work. I have included a 
few event templates that did very well for me. We will go field by field here to get 
you thinking each step of the way to quickly generate the perfect fields. 
 
FIELD 1: WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING 
This would also be known as “Title”. Remember this will send an email FROM 
FACEBOOK to the user, and it will say “(member name) has invited you to” so saying 
“you have been selected” after that would make no sense. The title is obviously 
very important, you want to make sure it’s something catchy to ensure that 
people at least go to your Event page. Make sure you use all capital letters for the 
maximum effect. My example: “OFFICIAL PRODUCT TESTERS”. 
 
FIELD 2: LOCATION 
This can be a fun field. If you are doing an only US offer you can put “US” or “USA” 
or my favorite “Select Parts of the USA”. The simple fact of the matter, however, is 
that some of your traffic will be foreign. I have found that the most traffic besides 
the US traffic you will receive goes in this order 2) Canada 3) UK 4) Australia. If you 
can find offers in these countries even remotely related to your offer, you should 
include these. (I will discuss how to implement these secondary links below) 
 
FIELD 3: MORE INFO 
This is your bread and butter obviously. A huge field to coerce the user into going 
to our link and completing our offer. Here is my example: 
 
We picked you and a select few Facebook users based on your experience to be official 
(INSERT PRODUCT / COMPANY NAME HERE) product testers. Products will be 
shipped via FedEx overnight. After testing is complete in 2-3 weeks you will get to 
keep the product. Click on the unique link and our official testing page will confirm 
your participation: 
 

 
I tweaked this campaign for a few weeks. Notice 1) We tell them they are part of 
only a select group of people (using “few” “a couple” “3” “4” etc), 2) That we are 
official (you can change this based on your own risk assessment) 3) They will get the 
products quickly and 4) They will get it for free with as little effort as possible. 
 
Follow these guidelines and you should ensure yourself of a solid campaign. 
You can use free URL shortening services or of course create a custom page as detailed 
in this book and send them to that. 
 
FIELD 4: PICTURE 
Make sure you add a picture to your event. In my case I would use something related 
to Apple. If you want to look official go and find pics to download that match 
your offer. Also the invite will send your profile pic also, it really helps to change 
your main profile picture to the same picture you put on your event. 
 
 
READY TO ROLL 
Now you are ready to roll out your event. Make sure the two boxes at the bottom 
are unchecked before you create the event. OK you should be ready to invite your 
guests. After your event is completely created and you see it in front of you, click 
“Select Guests to Invite”. You will want to pull these from your contact file. I just 
open a new list, start at the top and click and drag for a second or two.  
 
You don’t need to import the exact same numbers every time, and please don’t to ensure 
maximum speed here. Import 100-300 at a time. You will start to get the feel and 
the hang of it so you do roughly the same amount every time. I like to build each 
event to 20,000 invites and then create another one. If you are doing “Product 
Testers” or something similar you will want to delete the negative wall posts periodically 
otherwise you will lose traffic. 
 
Product testers in that exact form yielded about $60 profit per 10,000 invites. The fastest I 
was able to manually send them was 1 hour per 10,000. Not a bad return, for about 45 
minutes of work. 
 
ADDING INTERNATIONAL OFFERS 
If there are offers in multiple countries for the niche of your event, it’s easy to 
change the location field to, for example, “USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia” 
and below your main text add something like “RESIDENTS OF CANADA USE 
THIS LINK”. Of course you can set up a geo redirect however I will not be covering 
this here. 
 
 

INTERNATIONAL OFFERS 
International offers are certainly hot right now, and largely untapped. Search Offervault 
for country specific offers. There is tons of Canadian traffic on Facebook. 
An offer I have done very well with is Zemgo – CA. There are tons of international 
mobile submit offers like this all over the place. These offers don’t have the same 
kinds of visible terms and conditions that all the US offers have now, and are easier 
to convert. If you separate by country every time you scrape, you will eventually 
build a huge contact list for each country. Not only that but country specific events 
are more targeted obviously, generating a higher response rate. 
 
 
THINKING ABOUT EVENT NICHES 
To get the HIGHEST response rate for general invites, you would want to make an 
event such as “add the dislike button!” if you can use a custom page or a custom 
app and get people to an offer you can convert, that’s great. If you are going to 
finely target your events here are some things to think about. Separating into female 
or male users: There are many gender specific products, separating by gender 
is always a good way to target for high response rates. Separate by region, city: 
You can come up with many ways to scrape results by a certain city or region. You 
could do a string of common names followed by the same city, or simply search 
strings with just each major city from each region. 
 
CREATING AN EVENT WITHIN AN APP 
If you create a Facebook application, and then create an event within that application, 
the Event will say “Created By: (APP NAME)”. Therefore if you were making, 
say, a Justin Bieber event, if you made the app name “Justin Bieber” that’s correct 
it would say the Event was created by “Justin Bieber”. I know pretty ridiculous 
right????

Redirecting Links By Country 
 
Facebook is popular in almost every country at this point so if you aren’t redirecting your 
international traffic you are losing a lot of money. The majority of traffic comes in from 
US, Canada, the UK, Australia, 
Maxmind provides a free solution to do this, an example of the code is below- 
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
<script language=”JavaScript” src=”http://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js”></script><script 
type=”text/javascript”> if(geoip_country_code() == “US”) { window.location = “http:// 
www.US-redirect.com”; } else if (geoip_country_code() == “CA”) { window.location 
= “http://www.CA-redirect.com”; } else if (geoip_country_code() == “UK”) { window. 
location = “http://www.UK-redirect.com”; } else if (geoip_country_code() == “AU”) { 
window.location = “http://www.AU-redirect.com”; } else { window.location = 
“http://allothertraffic. 
com”; } </script> 
 
_______________________________________________________________________ 
 
Change the redirect links(ie. http://www.US-redirect.com, http://www.CA-redirect.com, 
etc) to your specific country redirects. Throw that code in notepad and save it as geoip. 
php and redirect all your link traffic to that. 
This geoip.php file is included in fbbb3.zip and you can simply use that. 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
All supported country codes are located at 
http://www.maxmind.com/app/iso3166 
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
If you need to add more countries redirects copy : 
 
else if (geoip_country_code() == “2 Digit country code”) { window.location = “http:// 
www.country-redirect.com”; } 
modify the country code and redirect url then paste before this line : 
else { window.location = “http://allothertraffic.com”; } 
 
 
 
 

App and Pages Section 
 
A lot of people may already know these steps, but they needs to be included for those 
that don’t know them. The power of this is huge and applicable to a lot more than just 
blackhat methods. You can gather massive amounts of emails through putting in optin 
forms, gain offline brick and mortar clients to create and manage their fb pages with custom 
tabs live support and optin forms, or make a new portal for your existing sites. That 
being said of course there are ways to use it for edgier methods, which we’ve included. 
The steps below are basic and the interesting page mods come 5 pages later. 
Create application and add it to page 
 
Before doing these steps, upload the files first.php, main.php to one of your domains. 
 
1. Go to http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php  
2. Create application 
 
 
3. Go to ‘edit settings’ 
4. Hit ‘Facebook Integration’ Tab 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Name your canvas page whatever you want, it doesn’t matter 
7. Canvas url is what your page will read as the first file, so the domain where you put files 
first.php and main.php ex. http://domain.com/first.php  
8. Name your tab, like “Signup” or “Qualify” and put a tab url as the same 
 

10. Ok that’s finished, save changes 
11. Create an official page- http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php  
12. Upload an appropriate logo 
13. Go back to your app page 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14. Click ‘Add to my Page’ then select the page you just created 
15. Now go to your page and see that there is the new tab on it 
16. Click ‘edit page’ on your page 
17. Go to wall settings then for Default Landing Tab for Everyone Else: 
select the new tab that was added through your app. 

 
Modifying the first.php and main.php files  
 
first.php 
 
First.php is only to pass through to main.php because they don’t allow 
scripts in the first landing frame anymore. You can put whatever you 
want as an image in first.php on line 2 
 
-<img src=”http://imgur.com/HJZsG.jpg”> 
 
 
or just continue.jpg to a new image upload service. 
 
Then change 
src=”http://yourdomain.com/main.php”></iframe> 
 
 
change your yourdomain.com to the domain you are using 
 
 
main.php 
 
 
Main.php is where your main content will go. You can do a number of different 
things with this which will be covered after this section. Leave the 
code as it is for now. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Now go to your facebook page 
This is what you should land on(check when you are logged out of the account 
you created the app and page with) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is what you should land on(check when you are logged out of the account 
you created the app and page with) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

When you click through you should see this page which is main.php 
 
 
 
Can you accomplish some of this with the static FBML app? Sure, however 
you have much more control with adding custom apps and FB is gradually 
moving away from the static fbml app and to the iframed apps so it’s 
worth the time to learn. 
 
 
When you create a tab on your page through adding your custom app 
to your page, you can modify it in a number of different ways to convert 
much better. This is what is covered in the next section. 
 
 
 
 

GeoLocation on pages 
 
It’s not revolutionary to put geo location on sites, but it surely helps out 
conversions when you do. 
 
In the main.php file you can see the code: 
 
Place this in the head of your page- 
<script language=”JavaScript” 
src=”http://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js”></script> 
 
Then this in your body wherever you want the city name to appear- 
 
<script language=”JavaScript”>document.write(geoip_city());</script> 
 
ex. You Are 1 of 3 Users Who Qualified From <script 
language=”JavaScript”>document.write(geoip_city());</script>. Claim your test 
product now! 

Page Mods- Optin Forms 
 
Opt-in forms within your pages 
This is a page with an optin form embedded within it. It relies on the same 
method of putting a custom tab your page through adding an application to 
your page. 
 
IJust add your aweber or icontact code to main.php in the ‘optin’ folder. 
 
 
 

Page Mods- Visible To Connection 
 
This has been shared around before but it’s still very useful to get a viral 
effect. Goto the Static FBML and add it to your page. Then go back to 
your page, ‘edit page’ go to the FBML app settings and rename the box. 
Then click edit and put the code below into the fbml box and save changes. 
 
<fb:fbml version=”1.1”> 
<fb:visible-to-connection><script type=”text/javascript” src=”http:// 
forms.prosender.com/form/72/1247627572.js”></script><fb:else><img 
src=”http://imgur.com/x85SF.jpg” alt=”” title=”Hosted by imgur.com” /></ 
fb:else></fb:visible-to-connection> 
</fb:fbml> 
 
 
Page Mods-Countdown Timer 
 
This is a good tool to increase response to your call to action. It’s nothing too 
advanced, but it does help increase conversion. 
 
You can find the files in the ‘timer’ folder 
 
If you want to change the amount of seconds on the countdown, open up 
main.php in the timer folder and edit: 
 
startCountDown(30, 1000, myFunction); 
 
Change 30 to however many seconds you wish. 
 

Closing 
 
We hope this guide has provided motivation and new ideas with the valueble 
information on how to proceed with marketing on facebook. It’s 
possible to do some incredible things with the methods contained here, 
so take action and advantage of it NOW.
