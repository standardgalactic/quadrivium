Decks  
 
Decks are a common addition to Auckland houses and come in a variety of shapes and sizes 
and construction methods and materials. They can range from a small entry deck to a most 
elaborate feature deck, and with a little bit of thought and artistic flair, can be a great asset to 
any house. This section concentrates on timber decks.  
 
 
DO I NEED A PERMIT FOR MY DECK? 
All decks 1 metre or more above ground level require a permit (building consent). A deck 
less than 1 metre above ground level does not usually require a building consent (permit) 
but may require resourse consent, and a deck extending less than two metres from the 
face of a building does not require subfloor bracing.  
Although a deck may not require building consent, it must still comply with the building 
code. In other words, it must be built properly. If in doubt contact your local authority        
DECKING MATERIALS EXPLAINED 
The three most common used decking materials are:  
 
KWILA 90x19 
Hardwood - Finished size is usually 90mm x 18mm. Kwila is a redish colour, but once 
weathered changes to a silvery-grey colour. It is a very dense and durable timber. Kwila 
can span 400mm, which means the joists (the timber the Kwila is nailed to) must not be 
more than 450crs or 400mm between each joist.  
 
PINE H3 90x35 
Usual finished size is 90mmx35mm. This board, because if its thickness, can span up to 
550mm. This means the joists (the timber the decking is nailed to) must not be more that 
600crs or 550mm between each joist. Pine decking once weathered has a tendancy to 
show little cracks or splits along the grain. This is a natural and accepted trait of pine. This 
timber usually comes in two grades. Premium and merchant. Premium is clear with only 
small tight knots, merchant is a mixture of grades and containes some big knots.  
 
PINE H3 90x18 
Same as above but can only span up to 350mm, which means the Joists (the timber the 
decking is nailed to) must not have more than 400mm Crs or 350mm space between each 
joist.  
All of the above decking examples usually come with one face smooth, and the other face 
grooved (grip tread). See Picture below. Other less common profiles are obtainable but not 
as readily available.  
 
 
It is personal preference as to which side of the timber faces up, however if you plan to 
spend a lot of time lying or walking barefoot on the deck, grip tread may feel 

uncomfortable.  
DECK STRUCTURE EXPLAINED 
  
 
 
 
The basic deck consists of  
•  Posts either embedded in concrete or bolted to appropriate metal post brackets 
embedded in concrete. 
•  Bearers, which either sit on top of, or are bolted to the side of the posts. 
•  Stringer, ledger plate or bearer plate, bolted or fixed to existing house. 
•  Joists, fixed to the ledger plate and on top of the bearers. 
•  Decking, as described in previous chapter. 
•  Boundary joist. Joist that goes around the perimeter of the deck. 
 
 
POSTS 
Usually 100x100 or 125x125 senton piles. Posts embedded into concrete footings must be 
H5 treated, where as posts bolted to appropriate metal (shoe) brackets aand off the ground 
need to be H4 treated. 
The spacing of posts along the bearer line depends on the structure of the deck, but they 
can only span a max of 2000mm without requiring engineers calculations. 
A standard footing hole is 300x300 square and 450mm deep. There should be 100mm of 
concrete between the bottom of the post and the bottom of the footing hole.  
 
 
BEARERS 
Must be H3 treated, unless very close to the ground in which case they will need to be H4. 
The size of the bearer depends on the length of the joists and the span of the bearer, but 
they cannot span more than 2000mm without requiring engineers calculations. 
example: 
 
Joist span    Bearer span    Size of Bearer 
1.45m           1200mm           100x75 
2.40m           1800mm           2/150x50 
3.40m           1800mm           2/200x50 
 
 
Stringer 
Also called ledger. The board bolted to the house upon which the joists are fixed to or on. 
The stringer must be H3 treated and fixed to the building using M12 bolts OR 
Dynobolts/anchor bolts if against concrete or block wall. 

Pack the stringer out from the building wall to stop moisture becoming trapped. 
The spacing between the bolts depends on the span of the joists which are fixed to or on 
the stringer.  
 
example:  
If the joists span 2m, the bolts should be 1.25m apart, where as if the joists span 6m, the 
bolts should be 0.5m apart.  
 
 
JOISTS 
Must be H3 treated unless very close to the ground, in which case they should be H4 
treated. Joists are fixed to the stringer either by butting up to and fixing with joist hangers, 
or by sitting on top of the stringer and nailing through both faces of the joist. 
The joists sit on top of the bearer and are fixed by way of nailing through each face of the 
joist into the bearer. 
The size of the joists depend on the joist span and the joist spacing. 
example: 
 
Joist spacing    Joist span    Size of Joist 
450mm              1.40m            100x50 
450mm              1.80m            125x50 
450mm              2.40m            150x50 
450mm              3.30m            200x50 
450mm              4.25m            250x50 
450mm              5.00m            300x50 
 
 
BOUNDARY JOIST 
Must be H3 treated. 
The boundary joist is fixed to the perimeter of the deck to give a neat finish. 
In most cases the boundary joist is decorative rather than structural, therefore another 
preference might be to replace the boundary joists with decking boards.  
HANDRAIL STRUCTURE EXPLAINED 
All decks 1 metre or more above ground level must have a handrail.  
 
A quick overview, a decks handrail must be at least 1000mm in height from the deck.  
 
Any vertical slats cannot have a gap exceeding 100mm, and there must not be anything 
horizontal forming a ladder effect. However there are many alternatives, such as solid 
handrails lined with harditex and plastered over, solid panelling etc. 
 
Trellis panels can be used, but most 'off the shelf' type trellis that most trellis manufacurers 
sell, do not meet the requirements. However, most trellis manufacturers are able to make 
trellis to ordered requirements. Depending on the size of the trellis panel, it's relevance to 
the thickness of the trellis and the size of the gaps in the hellis which are also governed. 
 
Another alternative is glass, although a very expensive alternative. Glass suppliers will 
know the type and thickness of glass required for a handrail, but get ready for a shock 
when you find out the price.

ABOUT DECKS BUILT CLOSE TO THE GROUND 
Often a deck will need to be built close to the ground. This is usually the case when 
building a deck on to a house which has a concrete floor. It is usually more costly and 
labour intense building a low deck than a deck, say, 1 metre off the ground. 
 
Firstly air needs to be able to circulate around bearers and joists to ensure a long life for 
the deck.  
 
If the bearers are near or touching the ground, upgrade them to H4, along with the joists. 
(In a normal deck construction, joists and bearers are H3 treated). 
Ensure there is a gap between the decking. 
 
Sometimes it will be neccessary to excavate the ground. In doing this, taper the excavation 
away from the house to let any water under the deck escape. If this is not possible 
because of the contour of the ground and a pool effect is created, then the excavation must 
be drained. In this case taper the excavation to a low point and run a drain to a lower point 
outside the deck. 
 
The drain can be made by digging a trench, putting scoria in the bottom of the trench, 
laying drain coil on top of the scoria and then covering the drain coil with more scoria.  
The home handyman should easily be able to do this with a small deck and minimal water 
discharge, but a larger area may require a professional drainlay as it may require tapping 
the possible water discharge into a stormwater drain.  
PRICE VARIATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT TIMBERS 
At the time of writing (October 2001) decking timber prices including GST are 
approxamately: Kwila $4.50 per Metre;   100x40 radiata premium $3.90 per metre;   
100x40 radiata merchant grade $2.90 per metre;   100x25 radiata premium $2.55 per 
metre;  
Most standard decking when dressed is 90mm wide. Allow 12 lineal (running) metres of 
decking for every sguare metre of deck area.  
The selection of decking boards will also have a bearing on the joist costs.   For example, 
100x40 radiata decking requires that the joists must be spaced at max 600mm, where as 

thinner decking such as 100x25 radiata and kwila require the joists to be closer together 
therefore needing more joists hence a higher cost.  
The cheapest overall deck structure would be using 100x40 radiata merchant grade 
decking, but be prepared to accept a lot of knots.  
 
 
Deck Anatomy  
 
 
 
1 stringers  Also called a ledger plate. The stringer is the piece of timber bolted to the house 
upon which the joists are fixed on or to. The stringer must be H3 treated and 
fixed to the building using M12 bolts OR Dynobolts or similar anchor bolts if the 
stringer is to be fixed to concrete or block wall. The stringer needs to be packed 
out from the building at every bolt fixing to prevent moisture being trapped 
between the stringer and the building. The spacing between the bolts depends 
on the span of the joists which are fixed on or to the stringer.  
example: If a stringer is 100x50 in size and if the joists fixed to that stringer span 
2m, the bolts that attach the stringer to the building should be 1.25m apart, 
where as if the joists span 6m, the bolts should be 0.5m apart.  
2 footings  A standard footing hole size for 100x100 or 125x125 post is 300mm x 300mm 
square and 300mm deep in firm ground. In soft ground the holes will need to be 
bigger and deeper. 100mm of concrete is required as a pad beneath the post.  
3 posts  
POSTS Usually 100x100 or 125x125 senton piles. Posts embedded into 
concrete footings must be H5 treated, where as posts bolted to appropriate 
metal (shoe) brackets need to be H4 treated. The spacing of posts along the 
bearer line depends on the structure of the deck, but they can only span a max 
of 2000mm without requiring engineers calculations.  
4 bearers  
Must be H3 treated, unless very close to the ground in which case will need to 
be H4. 
The size of the bearer depends on the length of the joists and the span of the 
bearer, but they cannot span more than 2000mm without requiring engineers 
calculations. 
example: 
 
Joist span    Bearer span    Size of Bearer 

1.45m           1200mm           100x75 
2.40m           1800mm           2/150x50 
3.40m           1800mm           2/200x50 
5 joists  
Must be H3 treated unless very close to the ground, in which case they must be 
H4 treated. The joists are fixed to the stringer either by butting up to and fixing 
with joist hangers, or by sitting on top of the ledger plate and nailing through 
both faces of the joist. 
The joists sit on top of the bearer and are fixed by way of nailing through each 
face of the joist into the bearer. 
The size of the joists depend on the joist span and the joist spacing. 
example: 
 
Joist spacing    Joist span    Size of Joist 
450mm               1.40m             100x50 
450mm               1.80m             125x50 
450mm               2.40m             150x50 
450mm               3.30m             200x50 
450mm               4.25m             250x50 
450mm               5.00m             300x50 
6 decking  Most popular decking is kwila (hardwood) or pine. Both materials usually have 
one smooth side and one grooved side (grip tread). It is personal prefernce as to 
which side faces up. The thickness and strength of the various deck materials 
determines how far apart the joists must be.  
7 boundary 
   joist  
Must be H3 treated. The boundary joist is fixed to the perimeter of the deck to 
give a neat finish. In most cases the boundary joist is decorative rather than 
structural, therefore another preference might be to replace the boundary joists 
with decking boards 
 
Building a Deck  
 
In this section we are going to show how to build a simple timber deck, two metres wide x five 
metres long and less than one metre above ground level. A deck less than one metre above 
ground level does not usually require a building consent (permit) but may require resourse 
consent. A deck extending two metres or less from the face of a building does not require 
subfloor bracing. Although a deck may not require building consent, it must still comply with 
the building code. In other words, it must be built correctly. If in doubt contact the Local 
Authority  
 
If necessary use the previous page Anatomy of a Deck for reference throughout these 
instructions.  
 
 
Construction Details  
 
Below is a list of the materials required for the construction of this deck. All timber used in this 
deck (with the exception of kwila) is pine. Gauged means dressed (not rough) and finished 
size of gauged timber is slightly smaller than that stated below. Tanalised means the 
treatment of the timber.  
All timbers listed below are common and readily available at any timber merchant.  
Scroll down for step by step construction details.

As required  
 
 
Step (1) Fixing the stringer 
The stringer (also called ledger) is the beam that the joists sit on or are attached to 
and is bolted to the building. See Anatomy of a Deck for detail.  
Cut the stringer to length (5m) and fix level to the building at the required height 
using m12 bolts every 1200mm apart. Pack the stringer out from the wall (5mm - 
10mm) at every bolt fixing to prevent moisture being trapped between it and the 
building.  
The finished height of the deck should be at least 60mm below the building floor, so 
the stringer height depends on the thickness of the decking and the method of fixing 
the joists to the stringer. See the two options below. Insure the stringer is level by 
using a level or water level 
 
 
 
Step (2) The footing holes. 
Dig five footing holes 300x300x300 deep to the dimensions as shown in the drawing 
below. If the ground is less than firm, then the holes may need to be larger and 
deeper.  
Make a mix of Concrete and pour a 100mm pad in the bottom of each hole. Place 
the posts on top of the concrete pads and pour more concrete around the posts to 
hold in place. Ensure the posts are plumb (vertical), parallel, and longer than 
required. (The tops will be trimed off later).  
Let the concrete cure. 
 

 
 
Step (3)  Fixing the bearers to the posts 
Trim the top of the posts to the required height which will be 100mm (thickness of 
bearer) below the underside of the joists. Mark the underside of the joist height on 
the building in relation to the stringer and use a straight edge and level or water-
level to obtain the required height of the posts.  
Sit the bearer on top of the posts and make sure any necessary join will be over a 
post.  
Fix the bearer to each post with two nails angled from each face. Use 100 or 90mm 
galvanised jolthead nails.  
Let the two ends of the bearer overhang the edge of the deckline at this stage. They 
will be cut later. 
 
Step (4)  Fixing the joists 
Fix the first joist to or on one end of the stringer depending on your choice of fixing. 
See diagram below.  
 
 
 
METHOD 1: Sit a joist on one end of the stringer leaving a gap between the end of 
the joist and the wall of the building. Fix the joist to the stringer with two nails angled 
from each face. Use 100 or 90mm galvanised jolthead nails. It is a good idea to drill 
the nail holes first to minimize the risk of splitting the end of the joist.  
The other end of the joist will be sitting on the bearer, but do not nail yet until the 
joist is sguare (90 degrees) to the house.  
 
METHOD 2: Butt one end of a joist to one end of stringer so the top of the joist is 
flush (even) with the top of the stringer. Nail in place. Attach a joist hanger (a metal 
bracket with nail holes in it that fits around the end of the joist and against the 
stringer) and nail with the appropriate nails to the joist and the stringer.  
The other end of the joist will be sitting on the bearer, but do not nail yet until the 
joist is sguare (90 degrees) to the house.  
 
Ensure the joist is square (90 degrees) to the building before nailing to the 
bearer. This can be done by using the 3,4,5,method.  
Measure along the outside of the joist 1500mm (3x500) from the building, mark (A). 
Measure along the building 2000mm (4x500), mark (B).  
When the measurement from mark (A) to mark (B) is 2500mm (5x500), then the 

first joist is square to the building. See diagram below.  
Make any necessary adjustment to the joist in the way of sliding the end of the joist 
either way along the bearer until square and then fix the joist to the bearer with two 
nails angled from each face. Use 100 or 90mm galvanised jolthead nails.  
 
Fix the rest of the joists in place parallel to the first.  
If 90x35 pine decking is to be used then the joist spacings should be 600mm crs, 
and if 90x18 kwila is to be used then the joist spacings should be 450mm crs. (crs 
means centres, and is the distance from the centre of one joist to the centre of the 
next joist.)  
All joists should be slightly longer than required at this stage and will be trimmed off 
later. 
 
Step (5)  Laying the deck 
Start laying the deck from the building side out, making sure there is a gap between 
the first deck board and the building so moisture does not become entrapped. Any 
necessary joins should be made on joists and staggered between rows (no two 
joins should be next to each other). Continue laying and fixing the deck boards 
using a 5mm spacer to obtain an even gap between them. Check deck boards are 
straight and parallel to the building.  
Let the decking overhang both end joists while laying, and then trim them flush with 
the outside of the end joists.  
 
 
 
Step (6)  Fixing the boundary joists 
Cut the joist ends vertical and flush with the outside edge of the last decking board. 
Nail the boundary joist around the perimeter of the deck making sure the top of the 
boundary joist is is flush with the top of the decking. See diagram below.
