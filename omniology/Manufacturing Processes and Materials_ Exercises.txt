Non-conventional manufacturing processes
Question 1a
Conventional and wide spread machining processes include: mechanical cutting operations, material 
removal techniques – chipping off, forging, casting, stamping, engraving. Additionally, conventional 
processes include turning, milling, drilling, grinding etc. mechanical operations. Back in the 1940s the 
needs of the defense industry, aviation and space industry, electronics and other industries necessitated 
machining techniques to be adopted for processing thin, fragile or special and very thin products that 
could not be manufactured using the conventional processes or this would have been rather impractical 
and costly. Therefore, a new group of “non-conventional” manufacturing processes emerged to provide 
improved, convenient and economically advantageous means for specific types of production. These were 
based on latest scientific and technical achievements and some new findings for using laws of nature 
relating to light – lasers, sound – ultrasonic processes, magnetism, atomic physics – plasma, electronics 
and new “powder” metallurgy materials.
Non-conventional processes include:
a)	 Chemical machining (CM)
b)	 Electrochemical machining (ECM)
c)	 Electrochemical grinding (ECG)
d)	 Electrical discharge machining (EDM)
e)	 Wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM)
f)	 Laser-beam machining (LBM)
g)	 Electron-beam machining (EBM)
h)	 Water-jet machining (WJM)
i)	 Abrasive water-jet machining (AWJM)
j)	 Abrasive-jet machining (AJM) (using air, sand or beads) 
Additionally, we could include here Ultrasonic machining (UM) and Deburring processes.
Example: A typical non-conventional process is the machining of abrasive discs using diamond (adopted 
in 1955) or synthetic tools – cubic boron carbide (1970). In some applications these processes replaced 
almost completely the aluminium oxide processes (1893) and the green silicon carbide processes (1891). 
Other non-conventional processes include powder metallurgy processes used to produce hard-alloy 
cutting tools made of tungsten carbide, titanium carbide, cobalt carbide, etc.

Non-conventional manufacturing processes
Question 1 b
The areas of application of non-conventional manufacturing processes are as follows:
a)	 Chemical machining (CM): This is used for removing a layer of metal material, either shallow 
or deep, by means of etching using chemical compounds, like acids, bases, etc. This is a 
comparatively old process and it has several options: 1. chemical milling, 2. chemical blanking 
and 3. photo-chemical machining. Chemical milling is usually applied where larger quantities 
of material is to be removed from large plates or panels in the aircraft industry, space industry or 
cutting in depths of up to 12 mm. The process is used to make large aluminium alloy, etc. plates 
and sheet-metal parts lighter. Chemical blanking is used for manufacturing various scales, 
dials, rulers, etc. in the instrument-making industry and fine mechanical engineering industry 
as well as for manufacturing a variety of thin component parts in the mechanical engineering 
industry. The photo-chemical blanking is applied for manufacturing printed circuit boards for 
the electronic industry, electrical wiring, electronic chip sets and very thin component parts 
(depths of up to 0.0025 mm) for the aero-space industry, optics, microelectronics, instrument-
making industry, printing industry, crafts – engraving metal or other material articles.
b)	 Electrochemical machining (ECM): This is based on “dissolving” ions of the processed material 
(metal) in the area around the tool, which is the electrode (-) of the DC source and the 
processed part is the (+), the ions thus being removed from the conductive electrolyte. This 
is used in wide machining applications for high-alloyed rigid steels and materials and also for 
manufacturing complex cutting shapes – turbine propellers, tools – stamps, moulds, dies. The 
technique is suitable for drilling small holes and cutting into hard materials
c)	 Electrochemical grinding (ECG): This process is a combination between ECM and a conventional 
grinding machine. The difference is in the electrical insulation provided in the machine spindle 
and grinding wheel and the use of an electrolyte instead of a coolant. The tool – the grinding 
wheel is the (-) of the electrical source and the part being machined is the (+). The technique 
is applied in machining carbide tools and alloy tools, carbide steel parts, etc. alloys featuring 
high strength characteristics. Used for grinding, milling and drilling small holes. Not suitable 
for manufacturing diesл
d)	 Electrical discharge machining (EDM): This is a widely applied and very useful method based on 
the erosion of metals caused by the discharge occurring between the electrode and the processed 
part. The technique is applied for manufacturing tools and dies – for machining cavities and 
contour shaping and cutting. Used to cut and machine very hard and hardened conductor 
materials. Could find application in various machine engineering fields, etc. Also applied in 
automated processes involving CNC machining centers. Used to manufacture complex dies, 
for example for extrusion of aluminium component parts, etc.
e)	 Wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM): This is an optional EDM technique where the 
electrode is a continuous wire, which is used to cut the metal material similar to a band saw. 
Used for contour cutting of flat or curved surfaces – Figure 1.

Non-conventional manufacturing processes
The depth of the cutting plates is adjustable to up to 300mm. The tool (the wire) is usually made of 
copper, brass or tungsten and of outside diameter 0.25mm.
Another optional EDM technique is the electrical discharge grinding where a conventional internal 
grinding machine is used the grinding stone of which is a conductor material (brass, graphite) playing 
the role of the electrode and the part being machined is any conductor material. Mostly used for grinding 
hard carbide alloys of titanium, tungsten, cobalt and tool steels; for machining fragile and brittle small-
size components, surgical tools, optical devices, electronic devices, etc.
f)	 Laser-beam machining (LBM) is used for similar applications to those stated above – cutting, 
drilling, marking and for surface machining and welding operations involving various materials: 
metals, ceramics, plastics, leather, textiles, composite materials (in the aircraft industry, etc.).
g)	 Electron-beam (plasma) machining (EBM) is used in similar applications to those described 
for LBM but performed in a vacuum surrounding medium: precise cutting and welding of 
various materials.
h)	 Water-jet machining (WJM): This technique is used for dynamic cutting and machining various 
materials: plastic, rubber, foodstuffs, paper, leather, insulation materials, composite materials of 
up to 25mm thickness. Finds application in the food industry and the production of plastics.
i)	 Abrasive water-jet machining (AWJM): for “shooting” under pressure and applying dynamic 
action to the surface of the machined component part. Used for the same applications and 
materials as those described for WJM.
j)	 Abrasive jet(gas) machining (AJM): Applied for machining small holes, cleaning surfaces from 
removing sand or scale in foundry applications, stamped forgings and also for non-metal and 
fragile materials, as well as for deburring operations.
Question 1c
As described in paragraph 1b above, machining operations feature similar or various spheres and sites 
of application. Non-conventional manufacturing processes are applied where conventional methods are 
not applicable, such as cutting and machining very hard, fragile, brittle or small-size component parts. 
1.	 Based on the particular characteristics of the process we can select the most suitable technique 
for each specific application. For example, cutting the internal cavity of an average-sized 
temperature treated high-hardness die is usually slow and expensive when using conventional 
machining techniques. A suitable non-conventional process for such an application is the EDM 
method. We select the suitable method based on the material hardness, brittleness, part size 
and material type. If we have to cut thick steel plates along an external contour that could be 
of a complicated shape the suitable method is the WEDM process. For drilling and welding 
various materials we select the LBM method and for drilling holes of outside diameter smaller 
than 0.1 – an operation which is almost impossible to perform using conventional techniques-
the EDM or ECG process.

Non-conventional manufacturing processes
Machining rough or corroded (oxidized) external surfaces is best performed using the AJM manufacturing 
process.
2.	 Quality comparison: Several quality characteristics are important here and these include 
surface roughness (Ra), dimensional tolerances, structure of the material in the cutting area. 
To examine these parameters we use data from tables, graphs, formulae and process studies.
For example, these include the Roughness (Ra)/ process type relation charts as shown in Figure 2 and 
the tolerance/process type relation chart, as well as the average and extreme repetition probabilities for 
their values.
3.	 Comparison based on structure: Some manufacturing processes, like for example the LBM and 
EBM result in distortions of internal material structure in the cutting area, so other techniques 
are to be preferred when this is not desirable, such as CM or ECM, EDG and EDM.

Non-conventional manufacturing processes
4.	 Process efficiency comparison (material removal rate comparison) (MRR): This is based on 
the data and formulae used to calculate the quantity of removed material (metal chips)  
per unit time of operation. For example, for EDM the material removal rate MRR = 4 × 44 
ITw –1.23 [mm3 / min]. This equation points out the major factors that influence the MRR rate – the 
current I (A) and electrode wear Tw. It is a known fact for this particular process that increasing 
the current I and reducing the discharge frequency (number of discharges per second) [Hz] will 
reduce process efficiency (material removal rate). For the ECG process the material removal 
rate MRR = CIh/A0, where in this particular case C is a constant value which depends on the 
type of machined material (values for C are taken from tables – for Al C-2.0; for Cu C = 4.4, 
for Fe…) These expressions could be used to evaluate, compare and draw conclusions on the 
value of energy used in the process and hence, estimate process efficiency. 
5.	 Tool wear [R]. We will discuss this factor separately and as an integral part of the factors used 
to judge for the suitable manufacturing process. Here again we use available data and formulae 
to make calculations. Hence, for EDM R = 2.25 Tr –2.3, where Tr = TW / TE; TW is the melting 
temperature of the material and TE is the melting temperature of the electrode (tool). Using 
copper, graphite or tungsten electrodes can extend tool life but would result in different tool 
cost. We can estimate tool consumption for a certain period based on tool wear and eventually 
estimate the efficiency of the selected process also considering the MRR rate.
6.	 Environmental considerations: It is important to assess the environmental impact of the process. 
Processes like EDM, which involve machining in a kerosene fluid, de-ionized water, etc. do not 
normally emit harmful substances into the atmosphere and are a preferred selection from an 
environmental viewpoint compared, for example, to laser-beam machining or other thermal 
metal cutting techniques. 
The LBM method could be very dangerous to operators as it might cause radiation and harmful fumes. The 
AJM should by all means be used with protective clothing for operators or air-tight automated chambers. 
The process emits dust and flying “damaging” metal particles, etc. It is necessary that the machines in 
most of the described processes are equipped with the required air filters, settlement sedimentations 
and air conditioning systems.
7.	 Personnel skills: To be able to compare and select the most suitable non-conventional process 
it is important to give consideration to the required personnel skills available in the company. 
Described machining processes generally require higher qualification and more costly labour. 
This is even more important when CNC-control machining centers are used. Some of the 
processes could also employ low-skilled operators but training cost and labour safety measures 
will be involved here.
Conclusion: A more precise and correct selection, assessment and comparison of the processes could 
be made using the table describing the general process characteristics – Appendix 1.

Non-conventional manufacturing processes
Question 1d
The current average-size toolmaking range of the company can preferably employ any conventional 
equipment and techniques used for this type of production along with the EDM, WEDM, AJM, ECG 
and ECM non-conventional manufacturing processes. The production of more complicated small-size 
component parts for the aerospace industry should preferably employ the EBM. LBM, EDM, ECM and 
EDG manufacturing processes. A precise estimate of process efficiency should be made when selecting 
the suitable type of process taking into account relatively expensive machines and equipment involved 
in the EDM, LBM, EBM, etc. processes.

The Electro-discharge Machining (EDM) process
Question 2	 The Electro-discharge

c)	 (Explain the principles and features of the “orbital technique” as applied to the EDM


[5 marks]
Question 2 a
When applying the EDM manufacturing process the workpiece is machined either “sunk” into a specific 
fluid or not, the fluid which covers the workpiece in the cutting area being a dielectric.
The method which involves die-sinking uses a work table specifically made airtight (a sinking bath where 
the fluid is provided). The type of fluid most widely used is kerosene (petrol), distilled water or deionized 
water. This arrangement of the application of the EDM manufacturing process provides for the electrical 
discharge between the tool [electrode (-)] and the cathode (+), which in fact is the machined workpiece, 
to take place in dielectric fluid medium. The method features the following advantages and disadvantages:
2a 1 	
Advantages:
1.	 The fact that the process takes place in a fluid medium improves the removal of metal chips 
from the cutting area and enhances cooling characteristics of the tool and workpiece.
2.	 Improved cooling and fast discharge resulting from switching off of the electrical impulse 
(frequency between 50 and 500 KHz) improves the wear resistance of the electrode (tool) 
and improves surface integrity (Ra) of the machined surface.
3.	 Due to the electrical discharge the process eliminates almost completely the emission of 
harmful gases into the atmosphere.
4.	 The process allows for “heavy” duty operation in higher frequency and current (A) values 
which results in increased process efficiency.

The Electro-discharge Machining (EDM) process
2a 2 Disadvantages:
1.	 The presence of a work table, a bath tank, requires longer servicing time and impedes the 
process. When the workpiece is to be positioned onto the work table the tank has to be 
emptied of the contained fluid and the same happens when the machined part is to be 
removed from the work table. 
2.	 Above requirements bring certain inconvenience during operation and involve higher 
energy consumption for filling in and pumping out the fluid from the tank. The machine 
itself becomes more complex in design and more expensive as it requires to be equipped 
with suitably designed units. 
3.	 Removal of metal chips could in some cases be provided when machining blind holes such 
that chips are accumulated at the bottom of the vertical tool feed. 
4.	 The presence of a large quantity of fluid, kerosene, in the machine in the operational area 
is a fire hazard. Special fire and explosion protection measures will be required for the 
machine and personnel. 
5.	 When the WEDM method is to be applied for cutting operations the entire machine will be 
much more complicated requiring additional sealing for the wire (the electrode). 
6.	 Applying the EDM method for turning lathes, grinding machines, etc. having horizontal 
work axis is not very easy as is the case for EDG (Electrical discharge grinding). 
7.	 Applying the “orbital” processing technique is rather difficult. 
8.	 The process provides poor visibility over the machined part for the operator to observe the 
process. 
9.	 Item 8 above results in using mostly CNC control machines and equipment, which are in 
turn more complicated and expensive to use.
Question 2b
1.	 Corona and spark discharge
This type of discharge process occurs when a relatively high pressure is available and electrodes are 
featured by very high non-uniformity of the discharge area (gap). Ionization takes place only in a thin 
layer around the electrode characterized by a small radius of the curve. This is called an ionizing layer. 
In real practice these are “corona” cylindrical wires. When DC voltage is supplied, a negative (-) or 
positive (+) corona is available depending on the polarity of the corona electrode. As the voltage on the 
corona electrode increases, the corona undergoes arch discharge or spark discharge (when the source 
output power is insufficient to maintain stationary arch discharge – constant electrical arch.* When a 
positive corona is applied spark discharge occurs at lower voltage (U) compared to negative corona. 
The temperature of the gas in the spark “channel” reaches 10000°K. This allows for thermal ionization 
to occur. This phenomenon does not fall within the category of the theory of the “avalanche”- type of 
discharge and is explained by the theory of “streamers”.

where a – coefficient of volumetric ionization [M-1];
p – gas pressure [Pa]
d – distance between electrodes
E3 – voltage in the area between electrodes [V/m].
From (1) we can conclude U3 = E3d (2),
Where U3 is the voltage required for a spark to occur [V], and
E3 is the voltage in the area between electrodes [V/m].
Thus calculated, the voltage U3 is exactly identical with experimental data measured at p.d > 250 [MPa].

2.	 Diagram of voltage pulse
According to (2) above the diagram of a single voltage pulse is as follows:
Figure 1
Where 	U35 is the voltage of spark occurrence (electrical discharge)
	
U3
max is the voltage of spark extinction (electrical discharge).
While the spark is present between U35 and U3
max, the initial gap “d” between the electrode and the 
workpiece increases as a result of the erosion to d1 and d1 > d, which results in interruption of the 
electrical arch (electrical discharge). For a pre-set value of d a constant U3
max is maintained by the DC 
voltage. Above condition results from equation (2) since this is a linear relation proportional to the 
distance between electrodes. From * above we can conclude that process efficiency can increase if we 
change the polarity of electrodes.
If we assume that U3
 rises from 0 to U35 without any time loss the voltage pulse will then look as shown 
in Figure 2(a) or 2(b), where DT is the time required to move the electrode.

Question 2 c
2 c 1. Features of the “orbital” technique 
The “orbital” technique is applied to the EDM process for the forging of some component parts, dies, 
etc. tooling. This reduces the stress between the tool (the die) and the component part in the contact 
area thus increasing tool life. Moreover, smaller size (diameter) tools could be used to machine larger 
cavities or holes of a shape which is completely different from the shape of the die. Moreover, the tool 
moves in an “orbital” manner, rotating around a certain axis with its operational end or at the beginning 
of its length, performing a movement similar to the orbital path of planets. (Figure 1).
The figure shows the principal drawing of the die, which “swings” similar to a flywheel around the axis 
O, such that O1 in its upper end moves along a circumference (ellipse, etc.), i.e. performs an “orbital” 
movement. Moreover, the flat radius R forms the recess of an OD = D, the forces required to press the 
material of the workpiece in the area around points M being smaller that what would be required if the 
entire area S = p.D2 /4 was to be pressed by a single stroke of the die without the “orbital” movement. 
The “orbital” technique is applied not only to the EDM process, but also to the ECM process, etc.

The Electro-discharge Machining (EDM) process
2 c 2.	
Applying the “orbital” technique to the EDM process 
The “orbital” technique is applied to the EDM manufacturing process with the tool, the electrode (-), 
performing a similar movement to the described in Figure 1 above. An example of one such application 
is illustrated in Figure 2.
Figure 2
1.	 Tool holder 
1.1 Tool (electrode)
2.	 Workpiece (round grinding machine)
3.	 Machine chuck
Let us consider an application of the EDM process for a machine featuring horizontal spindle and chuck 
3 used to support the workpiece to be machined, with the holder 1 feeding the tool 1.1 along the X 
direction, the feeding of the tool resulting in gradual change of the angle a from 0° to a°. The workpiece 
2 rotates around X – X with the chuck 3. This results in shaping (cutting) the cavity of an OD = D, having 
the shape of a pear. Different cutting shapes can be achieved through synchronizing the movement of 
the workpiece, tool and tool feed.
The “orbital” movement of the electrode can also be applied to conventional machines of vertical tool axis 
and die-sinking. This will require the rotational movement of the spindle of the machine to provide for

Tool wear – causes and significant factors
1.1 	
Introduction
When processing metals using cutting tools, which is usually accompanied by chipping (sometimes no 
chipping is involved), tools wear and get damaged. Worn tools are usually re-sharpened for re-use or 
replaced when unrecoverably damaged. 
The causes for this phenomenon are various and result from the nature of the different machining 
processes involved (metal cutting, alloy cutting, cutting other types of material) and also from all other 
subjective factors involved and influencing the process.
Processing, i.e. cutting conditions usually involve significant energy consumption, occurrence of 
substantial forces, vibrations, shocks and emission of heat. In this sense, cutting conditions are heavy 
processing conditions and therefore lead to faster tool wear or damage especially when hard, tough and 
high-strength materials are to be processed or when high-speed processing or fast-feed processing aimed 
at increasing production efficiency is involved.

Factors causing tool wear
1.2 	
Causes and significant factors
Generally, causes for cutting tool wear or damage are cutting edge wear or the occurrence of obvious 
breaking out on cutting edges or internal cracking and stress. These are determined by the extent of 
applied pressure and slipping of metal chips as well as the nature of surface being machined. Included in 
the cumulative load is also the tool temperature in the area where the load is applied. Tool temperature 
usually rises due to the heat Q emitted during the processing (cutting) operation.

where Q is the emitted heat; Pz is the shear force [dN] and V is the cutting speed [m/min].
Although cutting speed is an independent variable, the forces and temperatures generated are dependent 
variables and are functions of numerous parameters. Similarly, wear depends on tool and workpiece 
materials (their physical, mechanical and chemical properties, tool geometry, cutting fluid properties 
and various other operating parameters). The types of wear on a tool depends on the relative roles of 
these variables. Due to the complicated relations and numerous factors influencing tool wear, various 
experimental methods and data is usually used to define the type of wear. 
Let us consider, for example, tool wear on a conventional lathe knife – figure 1.

Factors causing tool wear
Key:
1.	 Front face
2.	 Rake face
3.	 Flank face
4.	 Cutting edge
5.	 Tool tip
6.	 Auxiliary cutting edge
Considering the geometry and characteristic elements of a lathe knife, tool wear usually occurs in 
indicated significant cutting edges and faces along with unrecoverable breaking (damage) with significant 
breaking out of the cutting tool and internally observed and hidden cracking. In other words, tool wear 
results in the tool being incapable to continue the process carried out between the machine, tool and 
workpiece (due to different tool size, surface integrity, internal structure, etc.). The term “tool life” is 
used to identify the time period until the tool is made incapable to perform its functions.
The most significant types of wear are crater wear and flank wear, as well as tool tip and cutting edge 
breaking out and cracking. These types of wear occur in different ways for different tool materials – figure 
2 (for example, carbides, high-speed steels, ceramics, diamond, etc.)

Factors causing tool wear
Key: 
1.	 Flank wear
2.	 Crater wear
3.	 Primary groove or wear notch
4.	 Secondary groove
5.	 Other metal chip notch
6.	 Inner chip notch
7.	 VB – average flank wear.
Tool life is as illustrated in Figure 2: (a) – the tool is within the normal required process parameters 
between points O and M. Following point M, KT and VB have reached the allowable limit.
Wear usually refers to gradually increasing wear without any visible scratching and furrowing, and 
damage is usually referred to notching with breaking off of particles from cutting edges. The ratio 
of occurrence of the two types of wear in a particular type of processing operation depends on load 
conditions at the tool-workpiece interface. In ceramics, for example, plates and tools operating under 
vibration and used to machine fire-resistant and alloy steels usually break off along their cutting edges. 
Apart from normal tool wear (flank wear) there are a number of other factors that influence tool wear: 
insufficient tool strength characteristics and available internal cracks. When the applied pressure (as 
a result of Pz) exceeds the ultimate strength limit this results in sudden breaking off along the cutting 
edge. High speeds and temperatures cause diffusion – interpenetration and rubbing of tool-workpiece 
materials. Friction causes abrasive and adhesive wear. To summarize, the most significant factors include:
--
Cutting conditions: speed, feed, cooling, geometry
--
Tool and workpiece materials (physical and mechanical properties, chemical composition, 
inclusions, density, etc.)
--
The characteristics of the machine-tool-workpiece system (stability, output, etc.)
--
Other factors – operator, qualification, processing technology.
Since cutting speed is among the most significant factors determining tool life (T), it is usually calculated 
using Taylor’s relation: 
VTn = C (2),
Where V is the cutting speed 9m/min], T is time [min] and n is a constant value which depends on 
cutting conditions and C is a constant value.

a- the slope angle: determines the value of “n”
It is obvious here that tool life increases when the speed V is reduced and the hardness and toughness 
of the material being processed are reduced, too. If we apply the expression (2) we can calculate that 
under certain conditions (fixed n and C), tool life T increases by 300% when V[m/min] is reduced by 
only 50%. It is a proven fact that for a constant tool life to be maintained, the speed is reduced when 
the feed f and the depth d are increased and vice versa.
1.3 	
Difficulties in forecasting (predicting) tool wear
All explained above makes it clear why it is so hard and sometimes even impossible to give precise 
forecast for tool life. It is not always possible to predict the influence that numerous factors and their 
combinations may have. If we take, for example, the expression for Pz(shear force) given above

where the following parameters are included: feed, cutting depth, hardness and a number of experimentally 
determined coefficients… up to kh, thus illustrating the complexity of the problem. If we assume that the 
main factor influencing tool life “T” is the applied load expressed by the applied forces, temperature 
(heat), shocks, vibrations, then the applied load is in turn influenced by:
•	 the cutting conditions: speed, feed, depth, cooling, type of processing
•	 material type: Al, Fe…, size, geometry, quality: porosity, abrasive inclusions, oxides
•	 the machine-tool-workpiece system: stability, power, vibration resistance characteristics, type
•	 tool type and characteristics: ceramics, Figure 4: A machine-tool-workpiece system
•	 high-speed steels, carbides; geometry, shape, angles, grooves, chipping, etc.
•	 cooling: intensity, coolant type
•	 other factors: operator, operator’s faults, low qualification, processing technique (incorrect 
processing technology).

Factors causing tool wear
Figure 4: A machine-tool-workpiece system
When cutting long workpieces the change in the angle j on the tool holder can sometimes cause 
unexpected vibrations, tool wear or breaking off due to operator’s fault (poor qualification). 
The complexity of the problem can also be demonstrated using the expression for 
T = C7 V7 d-1 f-4.
Question 3 b
Monitoring the condition of tools throughout various machining processes is very important for any 
production process and has significant influence on process efficiency. This is usually performed in two 
ways: a) Directly and b) Indirectly
a)	 The direct method involves visual observation by the operator for any signs of wear, 
wear hardening (getting dull) or breaking off. It usually requires the operator to stop the 
machine to dismantle and replace the worn tool. This method of monitoring tool condition 
involves visual observation or examining under special microscope for some out-of-service 
adjustment.
b)	 The indirect method uses indirect information to monitor the condition of the tool: noise, 
vibrations, size of machined workpiece, shear forces, surface roughness, etc. This is a 
relatively new method, convenient for CNC machines and is used to assess the condition of 
the tool “on-line” within the process.
1.	 Method of monitoring tool wear based on measured forces, vibration and deformations
The method is based on the principle of measuring the value or the change of the shear force 
Pz, vibration amplitude or frequency and deformation observed in the machine-tool-workpiece 
system to monitor the condition of the cutting tool – Figure 1.

Factors causing tool wear
The sensor 4, a piezoelectric transducer (crystal) senses deformations, a rotation of the tool holder around 
the point O, and sends a signal to the indicator 5. When the arrow moves beyond point F the machine 
stops automatically and this is an indication of a worn-out or broken tool.
1.2 	
Advantages
This is a convenient and easily applicable method. The sensor 4 can be mounted on the tool holder or 
on a number of other locations or assemblies: the spindle, tailstock, lathe bed, etc. In these positions we 
can measure the value of torsion, deflection, etc. resulting from cutting forces and momentums.
1.3 	
Disadvantages
Requires additionally rather complex electrical equipment to be installed and it is not always convenient 
to mount since it requires additional space on the machine and additional electrical connections. This 
is rather inconvenient for moving operational parts of the machine, such as the carriage, tailstock, etc.
1.	 Monitoring tool condition based on the level of noise and vibrations – the acoustic method
The relation between the amount of main types of wear and noise level during operation are monitored 
here – figure 2.
The method is very similar to the described above in para. 1 in the way of its application. In this case the 
piezoelectric transducer senses the noise signal, the cutting sound, and transforms it into an electrical 
pulse the level of which is monitored by the indicator 5 (Figure 1) and sends a signal to the CNC control 
whenever set limits are exceeded to stop the machine and a “warning” alarm signal to the operator.

Factors causing tool wear
2.1 	
Advantages
The monitoring device and the equipment it involves can be positioned outside the machine, far from 
moving machine parts.
2.2 	
Disadvantages
•	 Here, again special equipment and hardware is required to connect the device to the CNC 
control.
•	 Not all materials and cutting conditions allow for monitoring wear based on noise level. 
3.	
Pneumatic method
This is an older method very often used in serial and mass production. The condition of the tool is 
monitored based on the size of machined workpiece. The principle of the method is based on measuring 
the “gap” between a compressed air (or other type of fluid) nozzle and the machined surface, monitoring 
the pressure in the system (the volume of air being discharged) – figure 3. The volume (quantity) of 
discharged air is used to monitor the size [mm] of the gap between the nozzle and the machined surface of 
the workpiece 2. When the indication goes beyond point F on the indicator 5 the system sends electrical 
indication to the machine controls and signals the operator.
3.1 	
Advantages
This is a widely used and relatively inexpensive method for a number of grinding and other machines 
used in serial and mass production. Also useful for measuring during screening – reels, metal beads, etc.
3.2 	
Disadvantages
•	 The method involves fairly complicated arrangement of devices and larger units.
•	 Compressed air (fluid) installation connections are required. The method is not applicable 
to small-scale serial production and for the production of different product shapes and sizes. 
Additionally, the method is influenced by metal chips clogging the nozzle.

Tool “touch” sensing method
This is applied mostly for automated machines and recently, for CNC-control machining centres. It is 
very close to the “direct” sensing method (tool tip or cutting edge) or uses a microscope connected to 
the electronic controls of the machine. A command in the machine CNC control is issued to the tool 
to move towards the sensor, which touches the tool to read if it is still good, worn out or broken. The 
sensor send an electronic signal to the CNC control of the machine and signals the operator for the 
failure so he can dismantle or re-sharpen and replace the cutting tool. 
4.1 	
Advantages
Widely applied and suitable for machining centres and CNC-control machines.
4.2 	
Disadvantages
•	 This method does not provide for monitoring tool condition all the time.
•	 Data accuracy is influenced by metal chips and other types of contamination.
•	 Monitoring more complicated types of tools is fairly difficult to perform.
•	 (In some cases) the method requires operation time.
•	 Involves relatively expensive and complex equipment.

Acceptance sampling
Question 4	Acceptance sampling
Question 4a
Acceptance sampling is often viewed to be at odds with a TQM (Total Quality Management) philosophy. 
Why is acceptance sampling still in use by many companies and how might it conflict with the goals of 
a “world class” operation?
1.	
Introduction
Lot-by-lot acceptance sampling by attributes is the most common type of sampling. With this type of 
sampling a predetermined number of units (samples) from each lot is inspected by attributes. If the 
amount defective is less than the prescribed minimum, the lot is accepted, if not, it is rejected as being 
below standard. Each lot in the shipment or order is sampled and either rejected or accepted. Acceptance 
sampling can be used either for the amount defective or for defects per unit. Sampling plans are established 
for each class of defect severity (critical, major, minor) or on a demerit-per-unit basis. A single sampling 
plan is defined by the lot size N, the sample size n and the acceptance number c. (Example: N = 5000,  
n = 250, c = 20. 20 in 250 are defectives). Acceptance sampling can be performed in a number of 
different situations where there is a consumer-producer relationship. 
2.	
Why is Acceptance Sampling (AS) widely used by manufacturing companies and other 
organizations?
The basic and most significant reason is the fact that the method can be applied in a variety of situations 
related to quality management, complying with contractual terms, preventing unexpected situations, 
etc. Moreover, it delivers results or conclusions of sufficient accuracy for a wide variety of purposes.

Acceptance sampling
The method is applied in situations where:
* The inspection results in damage or destruction to the product. If instead of this method (AS) a 100% 
inspection is applied, this will destroy the entire amount of finished produce. Example: Inspection of 
batches of ammunitions (cartridges, shells, etc.) or melting electrical fuses (for 10A)[J].
•	 Since 100% inspection of products would involve additional cost this would add to the cost 
of the final products (quality control inspections are included in the cost of the product).
•	 When a large variety of similar products have to be inspected (a wide product range based 
on a single type of product or principle) sampling will produce as good, if not better results 
than 100% inspection. Such mass inspections cause fatigue to quality control personnel 
due to the monotonous work which might in turn result in more errors than the average 
accepted percentage when using the Sampling acceptance method.
•	 When the x  and R and p indicators are not provided in the information relating to 
quality – no diagrams are available (Paretto chart, etc.)
•	 When no automated means of control are provided and products are inspected manually or 
visually. 
Besides all said above, the AS method has the following additional advantages compared to 100% 
inspection:
1.	 It is less costly owing to fewer inspections
2.	 Less handling damage during inspection
3.	 Fewer inspectors are involved, thereby simplifying recruiting, training and supervising.
4.	 Upgrading the inspection job from monotonous piece-by-piece decisions to lot-by-lot 
decisions.
5.	 Rejection of entire lots, rather than the return of defectives, thereby providing stronger 
motivation for improvement.
3.	
How might Acceptance sampling conflict with the goals of “World-class” operations.
Besides all listed in para 2 above preferences and advantages in adopting the acceptance sampling method 
in practice for many companies and organizations (industry, trade, transport, etc.), the method also 
features several disadvantages. These might, in particular situations, make it unsuitable or completely 
unfit to use. Inherent disadvantages of AS are:
•	 There are certain risks of accepting defective lots and rejecting good lots.
•	 More time and effort is devoted to planning and documentation.
•	 Less information is usually provided about the product

Acceptance sampling
If we consider, for example some specialized and high-tech manufacturing processes, space and aviation, 
aerospace industry, microelectronics and all applications where requirements and responsibilities for 
defective components and products are much higher, AS is not an applicable method. In such applications 
very strict 100% inspection is usually performed on each individual component, parameter or event. For 
an aircraft engine, for example, the quality of component parts, parameters, assembly and functioning 
must be checked more than a single time. In some cases, multiple inspections and tests have to be carried 
out to prove the required quality and fitness for the purpose. Also, in the production of bearings, the 
production of balls, rollers, bearing rings involves 100% automated control and ranking in size and class. 
The same inspection is also involved in the production of a number of elements for the electronics – 
integrated circuit boards, chips, standard electronic component, etc.
•	 In developing sampling plans and Operating characteristics (OC) it is possible that in some 
cases characteristics and diagrams do not provide a clear idea and satisfactory results when 
errors have occurred in specific indicators, such as lot size N, n, c, etc.

Acceptance sampling
In view of all described above we should exercise great care when adopting the Acceptance sampling 
method for inspecting (and forecasting) the quality of production, transportation, services, trade and 
many other fields of application keeping in mind the allowable requirements and acceptable risk of losses 
and consequences. AS might in some cases lead to conflicts between manufacturers (suppliers) and users 
(customers). The producer is usually looking for lower possible rejection of manufactured products even 
when there is a high percentage of defective products in individual lots and the buyer (customer) has 
the opposite interest – higher possibility for not having defective goods above the agreed percentage and 
even have reduced percentage of defectives. 
Question 4b
The ACME packing company produces plastic bottles for the Kooler company, a soft drink manufacturer. 
Kooler have specified an acceptable quality level (AQL) of 1% and a tolerance proportion defective 
(LTPD) of 6%.
If a batch (5000 bottles) is rejected then all the bottles in the batch are scrapped and consequently the 
producer’s risk (a) be no more than 2%. In this case the consumers’ risk (b) has been specified as 4%. 
i.	 Design a sampling plan for the above conditions by determination of the required sample 
size and the acceptable maximum number of defectives in each batch.
Task (b) defines AQL = 1% and LTPD of 6%, where AQL is an acceptable proportion of defects in a batch 
to the consumer, and LTPD is the maximum number of defective items a consumer will accept in a batch.

Acceptance sampling
Producer’s risk is the probability of rejecting a batch that is within the AQL [(ά) – to be illustrated on 
the x axis of the diagram [Pa] as a coefficient].
Consumer’s risk is the probability of accepting a batch in which defectives exceeds the LTPD [(β) – 
illustrated on the y axis [Pa] as a coefficient]. 
When the producer’s risk a and its corresponding acceptable quality level (AQL) are specified, a 
sampling plan or a family S.Plans can be determined. For example: for a producer’s risk of a = 
0.05 and an AQL = 1.2% the OC (Operational curve) for a family of sampling plans are obtained –  
Figure 1.
Illustrated in the figure is a Single sampling plan for stipulated producer’s risk and AQL.
All three curves cross point K (for a = 0.05 and an AQL = 1.2% ) but have different points for L1 L2 L3 
for LQL. 
Each of the plans passes through the point defined by Pa = 0.95 (a = 0.05 ) and P0.95= 0.012 (0.012 × 
100 = 1.2%). Therefore, each of the plans will ensure that product 1.2% defective will be rejected 5% (of 
the time), or, conversely, accepted 95% (of the time).
The sampling plans are obtained by assuming a value for “c” and finding its corresponding “np0” 
value from Table C. 
Table C shows the values for Pa relative to c and np0 calculated using the Poisson formula:

where P(0) = P(d) is the probability for rejects (d); n is the number of units in the sample; a is the number 
of rejected components (events) from all “n” (defectives); p0 is fraction defective in the population, q0 is 
fraction good (1- p0) in the population / or c = d.
Then knowing np0 and p0, the Sample Size “n” is obtained. To eliminate the interpolation operation, 
np0 values for a = 0.05 and b = 0.10 are reproduced in Table 1. in this table, “C” is cumulative, which 
means that a C value of 2 represents 2 or less. We also use Table 1 since it provides C values for np and 
a typical risk for the producer and consumer.

etc. for c = 2.
For the first task condition in the task LTPD = 6% and AQL = 1% (LTPD = LQL). Since the producer’s 
risk and customer’s risk is set in advance, 4 plans are available that satisfy both the producer (2 off) and 
the consumer (2 off). It is difficult to obtain an OC curve that will satisfy both conditions – Figure 2 
(6-20 page 211).
The two curves crossing point K satisfy the producer for a= 0.05; 0.9% defective – AQL and the two 
curves (shown in dotted lines) through point L satisfy the buyer for 7.8% = LQL and b= 0.10.
Since we are interested in satisfying the interests of both the producer and customer, we use the following

Question 4 b (ii)
Draw the “Operating Characteristic” [OC] curve for the inspection station and determine the probability 
that the batch with 3% defective will be rejected.
1.	
Assessment of the particular sampling plan
Operating characteristic (OC) is an excellent technique for this purpose. It is desirable to know the 
probability (Pa) that a lot submitted with a certain percent defective, 100po will be accepted or rejected. 
The OC curve will provide this information.
2.	
Designing the OC curve
We have a single sampling plan available with set parameters and for this particular case we assume 
N = 5000 (lot size), a sampling size of n = 210 and an acceptance number c = 2. Additionally, we have the 
condition of 5% defectives. It is assumed that the lots are from a steady stream of product which can be 
considered infinite and therefore the binominal probability distribution can be used for the probability 
calculations. We use the Poisson’s equation. In graphing the curve with variables: Pa (probability of 
acceptance) and 100p0 (percent defective), one value 100p0 will be assumed and the other calculated. 
Acceptance of the lot is based on the acceptance number c = 2 and is possible when there is 0, 1, 2 
defectives in the sample. For 3% defectives: 
np0 = 210 . 0,03 = 6.30 . 3% = 0.03
Pa = P (0) + P (1) + P (2) = 0.052 (From Table “C” for 6.30).
The value 0.052 is too close to 0 and the curve is asymmetrically inclined towards the X axis.
We draw up the Table 3: N = 5000, n = 210, c = 2

Supplement to Question 4 b (ii)
Graphing OC using AQL = 3%
The initial condition set for AQL is = 3%. We assume a lot size of 5000 and c = 3. From the equation (3) 
and Table 1 (6-4) we can determine the sample size “n”. The OC characteristic for a = 0.05 and b = 0.10 e 
widely applicable for these values. It most fully satisfies the requirements of the producer (supplier) and 
the consumer when it is closest to the vertical straight line or is steeper than the abscissa.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Summary to Question 4b(i) – Figure 2
When selecting the sample size (Question 4 b (i)) we observe 4 additional criteria:
--
The first additional criterion is the stipulation that the plan with the lowest sample size be 
selected. Thus, for the example (i), only the two plans for c = 1 are calculated, and c = 1,  
n = 39 is selected (Figure 2).
--
A second additional criterion – the plan with the greatest sample size be selected (c = 2,  
n = 91, Figure2)
--
A third additional criterion is the stipulation that the plan exactly meets the consumer’s 
stipulation and comes as close as possible to the producer’s stipulation (c = 1, n = 50 and 
c = 2, n = 68) For c = 1, n = 50, p0.95 = 0.007. For c = 2, n = 68, p0.95 = 0.012. Since 0.007 is 
closest to the stipulated value of 0.009, the plan of c = 1 and n = 50 is selected.
--
The fourth additional criterion for the selection of one of the four sampling plans is the 
stipulation that the plan exactly meets the producer’s stipulation and comes as close as 
possible to the consumer’s stipulation. The two plans that are applicable are: c = 1, n = 39 
and c = 2, n = 91. For c = 1, n = 39 p0.10 = 0.100. For c = 2, n = 91 p0.10 = 0.058. Since p0.10 = 
0.058 is closest to the stipulated value of 0.078, the plan of c = 2, n = 91 is selected.

Principles of the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)
Question 5	Principles of the Resin 
Transfer Moulding (RTM)
Outline briefly the basic principles of Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) in the context of design and 
production of fibre reinforced plastic artefacts.

[5 Marks]
Discuss the requirements of ‘blocker’ doors in aero-engine thrust reverse systems and why the RTM 
process has been selected for manufacturing carbon fibre reinforced epoxy versions of them.

[20 Marks]
Question 5a
Resin transfer moulding is based on transfer moulding where the resin is mixed with the hardening agent 
(catalyst) and inserted into the mould by means of a compression plunger. The reinforcement material, 
the fiber, is positioned into the mould in advance of this process. The technique is an alternative to 
manual moulding of the resin and to spraying and compression moulding. The process is usually used 
for average-size serial production.
The process:
1.	 Upper section of mould
2.	 Mould
3.	 Middle section of mould
4.	 Resin (basic material)
5.	 Component part (product) area
6.	 Product
7.	 Ejector pin
8.	 Tapered sprue channel
The resin 4 is filled into a cylindrically shaped chamber of the mould 3. When moved downwards in 
the Y direction the upper section 1 pushes the plastic mass by means of the plunger into the area 5 
of the mould 2 through the opening 8, thus filling the area 5. Once the component has set it is then 
released from the mould 2 by means of ejector pins 7. The mould is usually pre-heated and additional 
heat is generated during the “injection” of the resin while it passes through the narrow openings and 
thin product shapes – thin wals of products.

Principles of the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)
The RTM technique is suitable for manufacturing products of relatively complex shapes and varying or 
differing wall thickness. As the resin flows through narrow sections of the product the flow and the heat 
thus generated help to achieve additional homogenization of the resin, good mixing with reinforcement 
fibers into the mould and high quality of the composite material and product.
Moulds are a little more expensive than those in compression moulding (CM) and a certain quantity of 
the resin is usually lost in the sprue 8. This manufacturing technique is used to manufacture a number 
of car and aircraft component parts. (Dodge RT/10, 1992 – 40%).
As far as the design of composite material components is concerned, the method ensures good product 
quality as far as dimensional stability and tolerances are concerned and when complex transitions 
between different elements are involved. The process features fairly high process efficiency – it is used 
for manufacturing series of 103 and 107 component parts.
Question 5 b
1.	
“Blocker” doors in general
Thrust reversers have various types Blocker doors, C’Ducts and Integrated Cold Stream reversers. The 
clam shell type utilizes two doors at the rear of the engine, which come together and deflect the exhaust 
gas to flow in the opposing direction to the motion. This is a fairly simple method of thrust reversal 
and is common on JT8D engines used on Boeing 737 – 100, … 200’s. The C’Ducts are the modern 
type and these have several functions. The prime function is thrust reversal. There are two halves to 
this type and in thrust reversal there is a translating sleeve which deploys and moves backwards. This 
causes “Blocker doors” to come up onto the by-pass air and deflect cascade fairing, which direct the 
air forward to oppose the motion of the aircraft. The second function of this type is noise suppression 
and acoustics are an important consideration in these units. The other type works similar to the C duct 
but rather than being a two-half reverser, it is a full annular section. This is commonly used on the RB 
211–524 G/H units. Again it uses a translating sleeve and blocker door system to deflect the air from 
the by-pass through the cascades to oppose the forward motion of the aircraft. The thrust reverser acts 
along with the brakes of the aircraft to reduce the speed of the aircraft during the touchdown segment 
of landing. They are particularly useful in situations where the brakes fail or there is a shortened runway. 
2.	
Requirements and operating conditions
Blocker doors in thrust reversers are generally subjected to high load conditions: the pressure of the jet 
stream, the high temperature of exhaust gas and flaring of the jet engine, vibrations and shocks occurring 
at engine start up. Moreover, components should have the lowest possible weight and feature high strength 
characteristics; they shall also be reliable and capable of withstanding fatigue. The function of blocker 
doors is as illustrated in figure 1.

Principles of the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM)
2.1	
Blocker doors material
The selected material, carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin, is suitable for this type of application. 
Composite blades for helicopter metal blades are now being replaced with blades made of composite 
materials – S glass fibers in an epoxy matrix. They have high stiffness, strength, resilience and temperature 
and fatigue resistance, high impact strength also. S-glass features higher fatigue life than E-glass. They 
are superior to “aramid” or carbon-reinforced composites. But glass or carbon fiber reinforced hybrid 
plastics are now being developed for high temperature applications with continuous use ranging up 
to about 300°C. These are used in DC-10 and also Boeings 727 & 777 (9% by total weight- vertical 
and horizontal tail). Reinforced plastics have reduced fuel consumption by about 2%. Substitution of 
Al in large commercial aircrafts with graphite-epoxy reinforced plastics could reduce both weight and 
production cost by 30% with improved fatigue and corrosion resistance. If we examine the diagrams of 
Tensile strength/% Reinforcement; Impact energy/% Reinforcement; Flexural modulus/% Reinforcement; 
Flexural strength/% Reinforcement for a carbon fiber-based and glass fiber-based (short and long) 
composite material, we can see that most carbon fiber (CFRP) characteristics are superior to those of 
glass-fiber composites with the exception of impact energy. Figure 2 (a, b, c, d).

Design considerations and selection of the suitable method
We know that the RTM (Resin transfer moulding) method features the following characteristics: it is 
used to manufacture more complex parts than compression moulding and for higher production rates; 
some scrap is lost; medium tooling cost. In our particular case this method ensures best characteristics 
of manufactured components to meet the high operational requirements. Components shall be light 
in weight, they have coupling elements to connect to particular assembly units involved in the overall 
mechanism (the reverse thrust system) and ribs are required to be provided along with sudden transitions 
between thin and thick walls and supports. The RTM method ensures uniform strength for different 
loading directions which is due to the uniform mixing of reinforcement fibers in the overall mass of the 
matrix – in our case the epoxy resin. Additionally, the method ensures complete filling of the mould 
without porosity. Despite of the higher cost of the moulds, the RTM method is very suitable for this 
particular application.

Question 6	Fibre reinforced 
plastic composites
In the case of a fibre reinforced plastic composite, explain the varied roles played by the different 
component parts in producing its physical properties.


With the aid of diagrams, describe the ‘pultrusion’ AND ‘vacuum-bag moulding’ processes for fabricating 
composite materials.

[10 Marks]
Question 6a
Composites are a combination of two or more chemically different and non-dissolving constituent 
compounds, the properties and structure of the resulting composite being superior to those of each 
individual constituent separately. 
Strength stiffness and creep resistance characteristics of plastic materials are usually inferior to those of 
metals and alloys. Adding reinforcing materials (phases) to the basic matrix of plastic results in significant 
changes and improvements of characteristics. Thus, the resulting composite material features improved 
abovementioned characteristics and strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios as well as other 
improved physical properties.
Example: An epoxy resin has the following characteristics: UTC [MPa] = 35-140, E [GPa] = 3.5 – 17, 
Elongation % 10 – 1. An epoxy-based composite will have UTC [MPa] = 70-1400, E [GPa] = 21 – 52, 
Elongation % 4 – 2.

6.1.	
Roles played by different constituents in producing the physical properties of composites
1.1	
Reinforcing materials – fibers
These mostly include glass, graphite (carbon), boron. All of them feature very high strength characteristics. 
Each of them is brittle, tough and poorly elongated itself – they have low structural value as a design 
material. Actually, the composite is a basic plastic material of homogenous nature, a matrix in which 
other phases (another phase) of fibers are spread, thus occupying part of the overall volume. The fiber 
content is usually between 10% and 60%. Material characteristics vary with the percentage of fiber content, 
the type of reinforcement material and the material of the matrix. For example: glass fibers render high 
strength, ductility and higher density (compared to carbon). Carbon fibers render higher strength, 
higher E, lower density (compared to glass fibers and boron). Carbon composites can withstand higher 
temperatures (1500–3000°). Aramids feature very high specific strength – “Kevlar”. Also, they provide 
for certain plastic deformation. Boron contains thin tungsten fibers of 0.012mm OD and renders very 
high tensile strength and high-temperature stability. This is due to the alignment of molecules along fiber 
length and the small cross-sectional area of the fibers. The smaller the cross-sectional area, the smaller 
the bending stress of the fibers.

Fibre reinforced plastic composites
1.2	
Shape, size and alignment (positioning) of reinforcement fibers
Fibers can either be short (20 ÷ 60) or long (200 ÷ 500). They differ in the fact that if we increase the 
length of a given fiber and improve its mechanical properties, it is a “short-length” fiber and vice versa. 
Fibers are usually in the form of continuous rovings, woven fabric, yarn and mats of various combinations. 
The reinforcing element may also be in the form of particles and flakes. They may be aligned either 
longitudinally, transversely or scattered throughout the matrix. 
1.3	
Role played by the matrix
The matrix has the function of absorbing and transferring the stress to the fibers, protecting the fibers 
from physical damage caused by load conditions and reduce the spreading of cracks inside the composite 
by virtue of the intrinsic ductility and toughness of the matrix. Materials include resins: epoxy, polyester, 
phenolic, etc. Polyamide resins withstanding up to 300°C are usually used with graphite fibers.
1.4	
Composite characteristics
To conclude we can say that characteristics depend on: the quality of constituents, shape and alignment 
of fibers, length of fibers and percentage content of the matrix with the reinforcement material. Short 
fibers are less effective than long ones and their characteristics are far more dependent on time and 
temperatures. Long fibers provide better load transfer through the matrix and are therefore used for 
critical condition applications – critical loads and temperatures. These relations are illustrated in the 
tensile strength/% reinforcement charts (for different fibers), impact energy/reinforcement % charts; 
flexural modulus/reinforcement % charts, etc., as shown in Figure 2.
Fiber reinforcement affects many other properties of composites, such as heat conductivity, thermal 
elongation, electrical resistance, stretching resistance, wear, endurance limit – see Figure 3.
A critical factor in reinforced plastics is the strength of the bond between the fiber and the polymer 
matrix, since the load is transmitted through the fiber-matrix interface. Weak bonding causes fiber 
pullout and delamination of the structure. Adhesion at the interface can be improved by special surface 
treatments, such as coatings and coupling agents. 
Generally, the greatest stiffness and strength in reinforced plastics is obtained when fibers are aligned 
in the direction of the tension force – Figure 4.
Figure 4 illustrates the effect of percentage filling of the matrix with fibers and the alignment of fibers 
relative to tensile strength.

Strength and elasticity modulus of reinforced plastics
The overall load on the composite is given by the expression:
Pc = Pf + Pm 
and the elastic modulus of the composite is: 
Ec = x Ef + (1-x) Em, 
where x is the cross-sectional area of fibers included in the composite, and
Ef is the elastic modulus of the fiber and Em is the elastic modulus of the matrix.
The total load on the fiber and the matrix is calculated using the equation:

Question 6 b – With the aid of diagrams, describe the “pultrusion” and “vacuum-bag” moulding 
processes for fabricating composite materials.
6 b 1. Pultrusion is a process used in the manufacturing of various shaped bars such as bars of round 
or different cross-section of constant shape and dimensions along the entire bar length. This process 
is similar to drawing long steel bars. Some examples of products made of such bars include golf sticks, 
fishing rods, machine spindles, guide rails, guides, walkways, etc. The process flow is as follows:.
Base materials for the fiber reinforced material are fed (unwound) from the reels 1 and 2 (continuous 
rovings and continuous strand mat). The fiber strand is transferred to an impregnating bath 3 containing 
impregnating resin (epoxy, polyester, other); the mechanism 4 unwinds and laminates the strand with the 
liner material and the strand is then fed to the unit 5 to undergo preforming. The so formed continuous 
fiber (strand) is transferred from 5 (by the right movement (+ x)) to the heated forming mould 6. 6 
shapes the cross-section of the desired product and hardens. The movement into the + x direction is 
performed by the puller conveyor 7 (worm-belt type) which transfers the now set in the pre-heated die 
6 product to the cut-off saw 8 which cuts desired lengths of finished bars 9.

Fibre reinforced plastic composites
6 b 2. Vacuum bag moulding
The vacuum bag moulding process is as follows: The basic semi-finished raw material, the resin-
impregnated fiber composite base in the form of prepregs 2 is laid into the component mould 1. We 
know that prepregs is the unhardened raw material composed of reinforcing fibers and resin, which 
is still an unset plastic mass. This is covered by the flexible bar (bag) 3 and a release cloth or bleeder 
cloth 8 is inserted in between to prevent sticking to 2, the cloths being made of paper, textiles or plastic 
sheets. For 2 to adhere to the mould 1, the air has to be pumped out of the space in between through 
the nozzles 4, thus resulting in a vacuum being created between 1 and 3, with the atmospheric pressure 
forcing 3 and all layers underneath to stick to the walls of 1. The flexible bar 3 is fixed in its upper end 
to provide airtight connection with the mould 1 by means of the camping bar 5 and the gasket 6. A layer 
of gel coat 7 is provided between 1 and 2 to facilitate ejection of the finished product from the mould 1.
When the resin and reinforcement fibers are laid manually into the mould, the alignment of fibers 
should be observed. Alignment is also required for prepregs when more than one layers 2 are involved. 
The resin and fibers may also be sprayed into the mould. Operations described above are performed at 
room temperature and are one preparatory step for inserting the mould into a pre-heater chamber to 
speed-up the setting process. Before the mould and materials set is inserted into the pre-heated chamber 
the mould is closed airtight by means of the cover 9, Figure 2b, which is pressed tightly to 1 along the 
Y↓ direction and pressure of up to 345 [kPa] applied for the cover 1 to be closed airtight and pressed 
tightly to the layers of resin and fiber reinforcement against the mould. The mould is then heated up in 
the pre-heated chamber by means of steam or hot water supplied along the pipes 10 to help setting up 
of materials contained inside. The product is thus finished and released from 1.

ii.	 Explain the requirements and properties of the EDM dielectric fluid
b) 
i.	 An electrochemical machining (ECM) process, using a 9mm × 9 mm square tool, is

Determine an expression for the volumetric removal rate w (mm³/s) and hence the current

Electro-discharg e machini ng (E DM) requirements  &  propertie
The electrodes are brought closer together at a voltage U that is higher than the breakdown 
voltage, Ub. This is defined by the dielectric characteristic of the clearance between electrodes 
d – in the area of the closest surface plane. The intensity of the field E=U/d is reaching a high 
value (2–3) 6V/m and a conductance through (2) is formed representing a relatively narrow 
cylindrical area of plasma. Flowing through this is the current I with a value of up to 100 
A and a very high speed of increase of its value dI/dt ≈ (5–8) mA/s. The servomechanism 
ensures equilibrium by controlling feed so the dielectric characteristic of the clearance between 
electrodes provides U>Ub following each material removal.
ii.	 In addition to providing suitable conditions necessary for discharges to take place 
(breakdown voltage), the dielectric fluid cools the electrodes and flushes away unwanted 
products of the process. Two types of dielectric fluids are used:
White spirit – operates for a short time at low viscosity and is mainly used for small holes.
Paraffin – has medium operation duration in press stamps, press moulds, etc.
Oil – works for long operations using powerful EDM.
The fluid must be of low unit cost and possess the following properties:
1.	 Low viscosity to ensure efficient flushing.
2.	 High flash point.
3.	 Non-toxic.
4.	 Non-corrosive.
5.	 High latent heat (high boiling point)
6.	 A suitable dielectric strength (resistivity).
The gas- and hydrodynamic processes taking place in the discharge area cause boiling and flowing 
out of melted material, de-ionization of the area between electrodes and restoration of its dielectric 
characteristics. 
Contaminated dielectric fluid deteriorates sparkling processing. Therefore filters are provided to ensure 
clean fluid.

ii.	 Advantages and disadvantages of ECM
In its capabilities ECM is the most universal method for electric processing of metals in all. 
Almost all kinds of operations involving cutting can be performed using ECM but there are 
some which have no conventional analogues, like sharpening, grinding (flat, circle, profile), 
three-dimensional copying, profile processing, broaching, graduating, cutting off, honing, etc. 
The disadvantages occur in the reverse relation between quality and efficiency and the necessity 
to control a great number of factors which complicates overall process control. We also, have 
relatively low output efficiency and possible risk of ecological contamination. A list with some 
of the advantages and disadvantages claimed for ECM is presented below:
Advantages
1.	 No tool wear.
2.	 High amperage (energy) can be concentrated on small areas.
3.	 Very high removal rates.
4.	 Surface finish isn’t adversely affected by high removal rates.
5.	 Cold machining less than 100°C leaving metal properties unaltered.
6.	 May be applied to tool grinding (Electro-chemical Grinding ECG)
7.	 No servomechanism required for feed control.
Disadvantages
1.	 High initial and running cost of machine and associated equipment.
2.	 Extreme pressures and flow rate necessitating special pumping equipment.
3.	 Extensive tooting and fixtures due to very high electrolyte pressures.
4.	 Hostile work environment.
5.	 Tolerances at best 0.05mm (less than EDM)
6.	 Sludge disposal and hence extraction (hydrogen). Expensive and problematic.

Hard and soft automation
Question 9	Hard and 
soft automation
a)	 i. Distinguish between “hard” and “soft” automation. 
ii. List some of the advantages claimed for mechanical automation in manufacturing.
b)	 Automatic control systems in CNC are often called servomechanisms. Explain what they 
are and what their purpose is. Your answer should include mention of open and closed 
loop systems, transducers and servomotors.
c)	 The end of an industrial robot wrist is usually termed an “end effector”. List tools and 
devices, which end effectors, are commonly equipped with?
a)	 i. Automation can generally be defined as the process of following a predetermined sequence 
of operations with little or no human labor, using specialised equipment and devices that 
perform and control manufacturing processes. 
 
 In hard, or fixed-position, automation, the production machines are designed to produce 
a standardized product, such as engine blocks, valves, gears, or spindles. Although product 
size and processing parameters (such as speed, feed, and depth of cut) can be changed, these 
machines are specialised. They lack flexibility and cannot be modified to any significant 
extent to accommodate products that have different shapes and dimensions. Machines 
used in hard-automation applications are usually built on the building block, or modular 
principle. They are generally called transfer machines, and consist of the following two 
major components: powerhead production units and transfer mechanisms. Because 
these machines are expensive to design and construct, their economic use requires mass 
production of parts in very large quantities. 
 
 It has been stated that hard automation generally involves mass-production machines 
that lack flexibility. In soft (or flexible) automation, greater flexibility is achieved through 
computer control of the machine and its various functions using a lot of programs. Soft 
automation is an important development because the machine can be easily and readily 
reprogrammed to produce a part that has a different shape or dimensions than the one 
just produced. Because of this capability, soft automation can produce parts with complex 
shapes. Advances in flexible automation, with extensive use of modern computers, have 
led to the development of flexible manufacturing systems with high levels of efficiency and 
productivity.

--
Responsiveness to shorter product life cycles, changing market demand, and global 
competition.
--
Emphasis on product quality and its uniformity through better process control.
--
Better use of materials, machinery, and personnel, and reduction of work-in-progress 
inventory, thus improving productivity and lowering product cost.
--
Better control of production, scheduling, and management of the total manufacturing 
operation, resulting in lower product cost.
--
Standardization of process plans, thus improving the productivity of process, reducing 
lead times, reducing planning costs, and improving the consistency of product quality 
and reliability.
--
Parts can be produced randomly and in batch sizes as small as one and at lower unit cost.
--
Direct labor and inventories are reduced, with major savings over conventional systems.
--
Production is more reliable because the system is self-correcting and product quality is 
uniform.
--
High-quality parts at low cost.
--
Reduced inspection and rework of parts

Hard and soft automation
a)	 Automatic control systems are sometimes called servomechanisms. They may be a complex 
array of electromechanical components or it may be just a simple mechanical device. These 
are power units, which control the line of movement of the tool and/or the work.
An open loop system is the simplest form of servomechanism. It is characterised as a system, 
which lacks feedback i.e. there is no sensing device to confirm the action of the control signal.
A closed loop system is characterised by the presence of feedback. It makes use of an error 
detector that returns a signal proportional to the difference between input and feedback i.e. 
error activated and strives to make the error zero.
Typical CNC servomechanisms include the following components:
i.	 Transducers which is defined as any device that senses an output condition and transforms 
the sensed information into a form that which can be understood by the servo system. A 
device that outputs a voltage in direct proportion to a measured linear movement is a typical 
example.
ii.	 Servomotors, or drives, are devices that convert electrical command signals to mechanical 
motions. Digital to analogue converters may be required to convert digital commands from 
the machine control unit to a continuous voltage, which in turn is used as the control signal 
to the axial drive.
c)	 In the terminology of robotics, an end effector can be defined as a device which is attached 
to the robot’s wrist to perform a specific task. The task might be work such as handling, spot 
welding, spray painting, or any of a great variety of other functions. The end effector is the 
special-purpose tooling which enables the robot to perform a particular job. Robot’s wrists 
are commonly equipped with devices such as grippers, and tools.
Grippers are used to hold either workparts or tools. The most common grasp methods used in robot 
grippers are:
--
Mechanical grippers, where friction or the physical configuration of gripper retains the 
object
--
Suction cups (also called vacuum cups), used for flat objects
--
Magnetized gripper devices, used for ferrous objects
--
Hooks, used to lift parts off conveyors
--
Scoops or ladles used for fluids, powders, pellets, or granular substances.

There are a limited number of applications in which a gripper is used to grasp a tool and use it during 
the work cycle. In most applications where the robot manipulates a tool during the cycle, the tool is 
fastened directly to the robot wrist and becomes the end effector. A few examples of tools used with 
robots are the following:
--
Spot welding gun
--
Arc welding tools (and wire-feed mechanisms)
--
Spray painting gun
--
Drilling spindle
--
Routers, grinders
--
Heating torches.

Surface integrity of manufactured surfaces:  
properties & applications
Manufacturing Processes  
and Materials: Exercises
Question 10	 Surface integrity 
of manufactured 
surfaces: properties 
& applications
a)	 Briefly explain the meaning of ‘surface integrity’ in relation to manufactured surfaces 
and their properties and applications.
b)	 Engineering parts require varying surface characteristics according to their function. 
List reasons for these varying requirements.
c)	 A magnified pen recording from a stylus type surface texture measuring instrument 
shows a pattern approximating to a series of triangles H = 6 mm the horizontal 
magnifications were × 20 and × 2000 respectively. Determine a relationship between H 
and Ra and hence the Ra (µm) value. Is this in the normal range for a turned surface? 
What factors do you think caused this regular pattern to be produced on the work?
d)	 When considering the evaluation of fine manufactured surface using light interference 
methods, with the aid of a sketch show that the difference in separation between 
adjacent interference fringes is equal to λ/2 where λ is the wavelength of monochromatic 
light of an incident ray L1.
a)	 In manufacturing processes, surfaces and their properties are as least as important as the bulk 
properties of the materials. Surface integrity describes not only the topological (geometric) aspects 
of surfaces, but also their mechanical and metallurgical properties and characteristics. Surface 
integrity is an important consideration in manufacturing operations because it influences the 
properties of the product, such as its fatigue strength and resistance to corrosion and its service life. 
 
Therefore, surface integrity pertains to properties such as fatigue life and corrosion 
resistance, which are influenced strongly by the type of surface produced. Factors 
influencing surface integrity are temperatures generated during processing, residual stresses, 
metallurgical (phase) transformations, surface plastic deformation, tearing and cracking. 
 
 Several defects caused and produced during manufacturing can be also identified. They may 
be responsible for lack of surface integrity. These defects are usually caused by a combination of 
factors, such as defects in the original material, the method by which the surface is produced, 
and lack of control of process parameters that can result in excessive stresses and temperatures.

b)	 Roughness has direct influence on the size of initial operational clearance and also on the 
duration of the operation (surfaces of lower roughness take less time to finish). The time 
that moving assemblies last largely depends on initial roughness of assembled surfaces which 
does not imply that wear will be proportional to surface roughness. At very low roughness 
surface lubrication deteriorates as a result of which wear is increased. Achieving a very 
smooth surface is rather expensive. Roughness has direct influence on the toughness of the 
assembly in press fits. Frequently disassembled press fits require less roughness and vice versa. 
 
Depressions and roughness are areas of concentrated stress and influence fatigue strength. For 
example, parts subjected to grinding are 40%–50% more resistant to cyclical loads compared 
to rats subjected to turning. Moreover, roughness is a reason for the occurrence of cracks. 
Corrosion resistance is directly influenced by roughness – acids, salts, water, etc. are easily 
retained in rough areas.

The parameter, which causes the occurrence of the irregular profile of the component, is roughness. It 
is considered as a combination of micro irregularities forming surface profile.
 During machining, removal of chip irregularities occurs as traces of the cutting tool. Similar effect is 
noticed in plastic processing during molding from stamps, moulds and also from some external inclusions 
like oxides, sand, etc.
Moreover, roughness is dependent on material strength characteristics, vibrations, temperature, coolant 
type, etc.

Manufacturing Processes

Question 12	 Integrated 
Manufacturing 
Systems: a facility 
of large and 
small machines
In a manufacturing facility three large and two small process machines need to be taken out of service 
for tool changing servicing. The frequency of this activity is primarily dependent on the production 
schedule. The work is carried out by a team of specialist engineers. The sequence of events has been 
observed and can be broken down into the following operations:
--
an electrician disconnects the power supply 10 minutes
--
a pair of men pull the machine from its mountings 2 hours
--
a finer removes the fittings 20 minutes
--
a tool engineer changes the tooling and resets the machine datums
The machine is reinstalled to its production location in reverse order of the above operations. There is 
one large space and one small space available for this work and small machines can be serviced in either 
space but the large machines require a large space.
The run time for the entire machine process varies from 5 to 25 hours. The time to change tooling and 
reset machine datums varies from 4 to 6 hours.
A closed discrete simulation of this facility is required to check if it is feasible to increase the number 
process machines in the facility, there is sufficient space to add one large machine within the existing site.

are included in a single operational activity – dismantling and mounting in the reverse order. These 
activities are all carried out by the same staff.

From the model built in Figure 12.6 we could draw the conclusion that there should be no activities 
queuing in Q1. However, it is possible to have activities queuing in Q2 and Q3. Thus all dismantling 
operations will be completed and activities will be queuing in Q2. Having completed all dismantling 
activities the team will then proceed with machine assembly and tool change operations.

Having considered the life cycles of defined entities we now have to define queues and activities. 
Data description of the activities and queues.
I use as a model (Figure 7.2) the specified technological sequence of machining individual parts assuming 
the first parts to be machined are A1, A2 and A3 and then follow B1 and B2.

Simulation method, determining the time to  
complete the batch and the machine utilisation
Manufacturing Processes  
and Materials: Exercises
The result of the performed simulation is that the specified lot of component parts will take 45 minutes 
to process.
Machine 1 – operates from 0 to 31 min with no idle time.
Machine 2 – operates from 5 to 54 min with 11 min idle time. 
Machine 3 – operates from 9 to 40 min with no idle time. 
Machine 4 – operates from 16 to 45 min with 13 min idle time.
Therefore, the most heavily loaded machines are:
Machine 1 – operates for 31 minutes, and
Machine 3 – operates for 31 minutes.

Analysis of the Simulation Process
The first part A will be finished for 40 minutes and the second part, for 55 minutes. Therefore, every 
subsequent part will be finished for 15 minutes (this is the step size).
The time between the last part A and the first part C (finished) is 12 minutes. The step between parts 
C is 16 minutes. The time between the last part C and the first finished part B is 14 minutes. The step 
of parts B is 9 minutes. 
The annual schedule for parts A is 15000 pieces; parts B – 7500 pieces and parts C – 7500 pieces.
The time required to process the whole lot is as follows:
Tlot = 40 + 14999 × 15 + 12 + 7499 × 16 + 14 + 7499 × 9 =
= 40 + 224985 + 12 + 119984 + 14 + 67491 = 412526 min
Annual working time:
Tann = 280 . 20 = 5600 hours × 60 = 336000 min.
Comparing both times we find:
	
Tlot > Tann
Therefore, this particular lot cannot be processed within one year. 
Analysing the simulation thus carried out we find the bottle neck issues are:
1.	 Machine 1 and machine 2 for part A
2.	 Machine 1 for part C
We can now determine the time required to implement this program.

Plain carbon steels and high strength low alloy steels (HSLA)
Question 14	 Plain carbon steels 
and high strength 
low alloy steels (HSLA)
a)	 Compare and contrast plain carbon steels and high strength low alloy steels (HSLA) as 
engineering component materials. Give examples to illustrate your answer. 
Plain carbon steels have up to 2.11 percent Carbon. The higher the content of carbon, the higher is the 
hardenability of the steel and the higher are its strength, hardness and wear resistance. High-strength 
low-alloy steels (HSLA) have been developed having low carbon content, usually less than 0.3 percent. 
They are characterized by a microstructure consisting of fine-grain ferrite and a hard second phase of 
carbides, carbonitrides or nitrides. Microalloying and controlled hot rolling produce them. They have 
better strength to weight ratio than carbon steels. Moreover, ductility, formability and weldability of 
HSLA steels are generally inferior to conventional plain carbon steels.
A comparison between basic mechanical properties for plain carbon and HSLA steels can be seen in 
the next page:

Plain carbon steels are generally used for: Common industrial products such as, bolts, nuts, sheet plates, 
tubes. Machinery, automotive and agricultural equipment parts such as, gears, axles, connecting rods, 
crankshafts, railroad equipment and parts for metalworking machinery. Sheet products of HSLA steels 
typically are used in certain parts of automobile bodies to reduce weight and hence fuel consumption. 
In transportation equipment, mining, agricultural and various other industrial applications. 
Plates are used in ships, bridges and building construction and shapes such as I-beams; channels and 
angles are used in building and various other structures.

Another reason for selecting this material is the presence of Magnesium which makes the alloy very light. 
Density is an important factor in the selection of materials for high-speed equipment. Environmental 
oxidation and corrosion of components is another major concern. The exhibited corrosion resistance of 
Aluminium and Copper alloys gives us an additional reason for the selection of AL-Cu-Mg-Zn alloy.

ii.	 For the railway locomotive components the suitable material is:
Low alloy steel 2.
We selected this type of steel because, it presents a huge KIC value [KIC= 100 Mpa*m0.5] after the yield 
strength value (800 Mpa). This means that, our material has a maximum damage tolerance, greater than 
the others’ do. The yield strength value though it is quite high, it isn’t higher than low alloy steel’s 1 value. 
What we need is to acquire the biggest KIC value in the plastic deformation region. This area begins 
after the yield strength value, which is the border between elastic and plastic deformation.
In spite of the high density, these steels can be in suitable form for production of spare parts by 
suitable heat-treatment. These steels function at some static and dynamic loads-bigger of permissible, 
in comparison with carbon steels.

c)	 Name and discuss two alternative heat-treatment sequences to produce the properties 
for the low alloy steel in Table Q1.
Appropriate heat-treatments.
1.	 Hardening: Heat to 850°C,  
Tempering: Quench to 500°C, oil quenched 
Isothermal transformation to upper Bainite 
[Hardening and tempering at 500–600°C]
2.	 Hardening: Heat to 850°C, 
Tempering Quench to 300°C, in salt bath. 
Isothermal transformation to lower Bainite 
[Hardening and tempering at 300°C]
Tempering
If steels are hardened by heat treatment, tempering is used in order to reduce brittleness, increase 
ductility and toughness and reduce residual stresses. In tempering, the steel is heated to a specific 
temperature, depending on composition and cooled at a prescribed rate. Alloy steels may undergo 
temper embrittlement caused by the segregation of impurities along the grain boundaries at temperatures 
between 480°C and 590°C.
In austempering, the heated steel is quenched from the austenitising temperature rapidly enough to avoid 
formation of ferrite or pearlite. It is then held at a certain temperature until isothermal transformation 
from austenite to bainite is complete. It is then cooled to room temperature usually in still air, at a 
moderate rate to avoid thermal gradients within the part. The quenching medium most commonly used 
is molten salt, at temperatures ranging from 160°C and 750°C.

Hardness: to 200 HRC, having a high Carbon content 0.26–0.45%, hardness will increase to 51 HRC.
Corrosion resistance: High value
Weldability: Satisfactory. Arch or gas welding.
Ferritic stainless steels can have a higher content of Cr and Ni:
Cr – [18–27%]
Ni – [3.7–5.5%]
Chromium in higher content improves Stiffness, Corrosion resistance, Machinability and Formability.
Higher Nickel content improves Strength and Toughness.
The alternative non-metallic materials, which have been used, are:
1.	 Polycarbonates, having very good mechanical properties and a high strength. They have low 
absorbability in contact with the water.
2.	 Polyamides
3.	 Fibre glass from polyester-acryl
4.	 Phenol-formaldehyde 
5.	 Fiber-reinforced epoxies
b)	 Early twin-tub washing machines often suffered from corrosion failures. Explain 
carefully the nature and mechanism of this type of failure and state how it has been 
overcome in modern front loading machines.
The nature of corrosion.
The corrosion is a surface destroying mechanism of metals and steels, as a result of a chemical and 
electrochemical influence of aggressive environment.
The corrosion is of two types: even and uneven.
1.	 Chemical corrosion appears as a result of interaction between the metal and environment 
(gas or non-electrolyte).
2.	 Electrochemical corrosion is associated with electrolyte. In this mode the character of the 
effect produced is electrochemical.

Ferritic stainless steel & the mechanism of corrosion
The mechanism of corrosion.
The atoms (ions) must receive a rather huge kinetic energy in order to tear off the surface of metal. Let’s 
assume that the metal has dipped into the water or into a solution of acid salt (electrolyte). We have 
to expect that an interaction will take place between them. Water molecules will possess positive and 
negative electric charges and create dipoles. Dipoles will attract cations from the surface of the metal. In 
this way, the energy necessary for tearing one ion off the metal surface will decrease considerably and 
the cations will start to be transferred in the water solution. This will cause the chemical combination 
between water molecules and metal cations.
[Cation (-) M(+)] + n *H2O → M(+)n *H2O + Cation (-)
metal Cation + water molecule → hydrated ion + free electron
The cations will continue to be transferred into the water solution while in the metal their respective 
electrons won’t move. Thus, creating on the border between metal and the solution a potential difference 
(electronic potential). The potential difference will reach the highest value when the cations will finish 
to tear off the surface of the metal, resulting in dynamic balance.This means that, the number of cations 
been transferred in the solution equals to the dehydrated and precipitated ions on the surface of the metal.

Ferritic stainless steel & the mechanism of corrosion
Assuming that a double phase system is dipped into a solution of electrolyte, then two heterogeneous 
crystals will make a short circuit of galvanic elements. In electrolyte, the crystal, which has negative 
potential, will be called anode and the one that has positive will be called cathode.
Prevention of Corrosion
Ferrous alloys and steels don’t corrode when they get in touch with dry air and pure water. In order 
to corrode electrolyte is needed to be present. The chemical pure metals corrode with more difficulty, 
compared to alloys. Corrosion can be transferred by contact between two metals. The metal, which will 
have negative potential, will corrode faster. Corrosion can be overcome in metals by alloying with other 
elements. 
For example if we alloy: 
Iron with 12%Cr – Corrosion resistance will be in low levels.
Iron with 12 to 14%Cr – Corrosion resistance in moderate to high levels. 
The necessary condition in order to acquire corrosion resistance is to create homogeneous solid solutions. 
The alloys with 12–14%Cr are homogeneous solid solutions, which form a preventive layer to protect 
them from this type of failure.

For A Lower energy: 10 J
For A Higher energy: 160 J

In our mild steel:
By increasing ⇑ the C%, the DBTT will increase ⇑.
By lowering ⇓ the C%, the DBTT will decrease ⇓.
For example, 
Mild steel: 0.2%C, 0.5%Mn, has DBTT = 0 °C
Mild steel: 0.15%C, 1.5%Mn, has DBTT = -20 to -30 °C
b)	 What is the practical significance of this data? Are plain carbon steels suitable for 
storing liquid nitrogen? If not why not and what alternative material is available?
Practical significance of Ductile/Brittle Transition Temperature measurement.
Many metals undergo a sharp change in ductility and toughness across a narrow temperature range 
called the transition temperature. This phenomenon occurs in body-centered cubic (bcc) and some 
hexagonal close-packed metals (hcp).
Face-centered cubic (fcc) metals rarely exhibit it. The transition temperature depends on factors such as 
composition, microstructure, grain size, surface finish and shape of the specimen and rate of deformation.

Suitable material for storing tanks.
Storing tanks made of plain carbon steel aren’t in condition to store liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen 
puts them under a high amount of pressure, which acts, on the walls of the storing tank. Under these 
conditions, Nitrogen is dissolved in the Iron and produces Fe4N. This new synthesis accelerates the 
operating life of these soft steels. It makes the material to grow old quickly reducing its strength property. 
It also lowers hardness against fatigue, because of tensions, which has created in lattices.
There is an opportunity to make a detachment of nitrides at the limits of the grains and on the relaying 
planes with a speed, which concurs with the speed of the loading. In other words there is a condition 
for an artificial acceleration in operating life, which accompanies plastic deformation.

A suitable alternative material for storing tanks.
It is preferable to use High-speed steels (HSS), and alloy them with non-ferrous elements such as 
Aluminium, Titanium and Nitrogen. These steels have excellent intercrystal corrosion, thus high 
corrosion resistance properties.
c)	 Discuss carefully how one could distinguish whether a steel shaft had experienced brittle 
fracture or fatigue failure?
One could easily distinguish whether a steel shaft had experienced fatigue failure or brittle fracture.
Fatigue failure
Fatigue is responsible for the majority of failures in mechanical components. Basically, shafts, cams 
and gears are subjected to rapidly fluctuating (cyclic or periodic) loads, in other words, rotations and 
severe vibrations. Minute external or internal cracks develop at flaws or defects in the material, which 
then propagate and eventually lead to total failure. We could distinguish fatigue in our steel shaft by the 
typical fatigue fracture surface showing beach marks. With large magnification, a series of striations can 
be seen on fracture surfaces, each beach mark consisting of a number of striations.

Impact Strength (J) to Test Temperature
Furthermore, fatigue can be identified by the endurance or fatigue limit. On the below, stress – number 
of cycles (N), this curve shows, the maximum stress to which the material can be subjected without 
fatigue failure, regardless of the number of cycles. Any failure below this limit would be considered as 
other type of failure because there is no fatigue failure occurring below this curve. The fatigue limit for 
steels is about one-half (½) of their tensile strength. Especially, steels have a definite fatigue limit, while 
other metals do not have one.
Brittle fracture
Brittle fracture will occur with little or no gross plastic deformation. In our steel it could be identified 
by the rapid separation of the material into two or more pieces. Brittle fracture mostly occurs under 
static loads.
d)	 How may the toughness and tensile strength of brittle thermosets such as PF resin 
(Bakelite) be increased?
In thermoplastics the typical effects of temperature on the strength, the stiffness and toughness are 
similar to those for metals. Thus, with increasing temperature, the strength and the stiffness decrease 
and toughness increases.
Because of the nature of their bonds, temperature or rate of deformation doesn’t affect the strength, 
stiffness and toughness of thermosets unlike thermoplastics. Moreover, if the temperature is increased 
sufficiently, the thermosetting begins to burn up and char.
Strength, stiffness and toughness will increase, if we reinforce the thermoset with fibers. Reinforced 
thermosets consist of fibers (the discontinuous or despaired phase). The fibers are strong and stiff and 
have high specific strength (strength to weight ratio) and specific modulus (stiffness to weight ratio). 
However, they are generally brittle and abrasive and lack toughness. Thus, fibers themselves have little 
structural value. The thermosetting matrix is less strong and less stiff but tougher than the fibers. Thus, 
reinforced thermosets combine the advantages of each of the two constituents. In addition to high specific 
strength and specific modulus, reinforced thermosets have improved toughness and creep resistance 
than unreinforced thermosets.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Metal and polymer material applicability
For the rectangular instrument case we have selected:
Polymer: Polystyrene (PS). Polystyrenes are inexpensive materials. They have generally average strength, 
toughness, chemical and electrical resistance. They are somewhat brittle.
Metal: Low carbon steel. It has less than 0.3% carbon. It is generally used for common industrial products 
that don’t require high strength, hardness and wear resistance.
Office or restaurant chair legs. For this application we have chosen:
Polymer: ABS Reinforced. It has higher values of strength and stiffness than unreinforced ABS. It is 
therefore, more stable and rigid and suites the purpose of selection for this application.
Metal: Ferritic stainless steel. This type of stainless steel has a high chromium content: up to 27%. It has 
good strength and impact toughness. It is magnetic and has good corrosion resistance. In comparison 
with austenitic stainless steel has lower ductility. Ferritic stainless steel is hardened by cold working and 
is generally used for non-structural applications such as kitchen and office equipment.

b)	 Choose one of the components already selected and name and justify manufacturing 
processes for the metal and polymer versions respectively.
We choose the 300-mm ruler and undertake an analysis in the manufacturing processes for the metal 
and polymer versions respectively.
Aluminium ruler
Rolling: The process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross-section of our workpiece by 
compressive forces applied through a set of rolls similar to rolling dough with a rolling pin to reduce 
its thickness. Our operation is flat rolling where, the rolled products are flat sheets (ruler thickness less  
than 3 mm).
Photochemical machining: This process (similar to stereo lithography) uses two laser beams intersecting 
each other to form the part. One beam moves in the X-Y plane and the other in the X-Z plane. Thus 
part production is more versatile and no longer done in layers.
Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) ruler
Injection molding is essentially the same process as hot-chamber die-casting. The pellets or granules 
are fed into a heated cylinder, where they are melted. The melt is then forced into a split-die chamber, 
either by a hydraulic plunger or by the rotating screw system of an extruder. Newer equipment is of the 
reciprocating screw type. As the pressure builds up at the mold entrance, the rotating screw begins to 
move backward under pressure to a predetermined distance, thus controlling the volume of material 
to be injected. The screw stops rotating and is pushed forward hydraulically, forcing the molten plastic 
into the mold cavity. Injection molding pressures usually range from 70 Mpa to 200 Mpa, which is in 
the same order of magnitude as in cold-chamber die-casting.

Metal and polymer material applicability
Because the material is molten when injected into the mold, complex shapes and good dimensional 
accuracy can be achieved, as in die-casting. However, as in metal casting, the molded part shrinks during 
cooling. Plastics have a higher thermal expansion than metals.
Injection molding is a high-rate production process, with good dimensional control. Typical cycle times 
range from 5 to 60 seconds.

Maximum tolerable through thickness crack size
Question 18	 Maximum tolerable 
through thickness 
crack size
a)	 Steam turbine blades are manufactured from austenitic stainless steel. Determine the 
maximum tolerable through thickness crack size for the components and state any 
assumptions made. Name and justify a suitable non-destructive technique to locate such 
cracks.
s(Operating stress) = 300 Mpa;KIC = 50 Mpa*m
In this case we use the Stress Intensity factor KIC for center crack length 2a in an infinitive plate. This 
factor it is given by the formula:

Critical crack 2ac = 17,69.10-3 m 
through thickness crack size for the component.
Firstly, let’s see which techniques don’t work for the detection of our flaw:
Dye penetration technique.
This method can only detect defects that are open on the surface, not internal defects such as the one 
we have.

Maximum tolerable through thickness crack size
Magnetic particle inspection technique.
This method is appropriate primarily for surface breaking defects and discontinuities not more than 
10 mm below the surface of the component. Our through crack size is = 17.7 mm.
Eddy-current inspection method.
Again, and this method is limited to surface and slightly sub surface flaws.
Radiography
The smallest defect that can be detected is 2% of thickness. The process becomes less reliable as the 
section thickness increases. In this respect it is a disadvantage compared with ultrasonic testing which 
can detect small flaws in steel up to 15 meters thick. Other disadvantages are: costly equipment, potential 
radiation and leakage hazard. The suitable non-destructive technique that we have chosen is the Ultrasonic 
Inspection method.
Ultrasonic Inspection
In Ultrasonic Inspection, an ultrasonic beam travels through the part, is interrupted from an internal 
defect and reflects back a portion of the ultrasonic energy. This method is suitable for our case, because 
it can be used to inspect flaws in surface and in large volumes of materials (deep flaws). It has also, 
penetrating power and sensitivity, thus high accuracy.
b)	 During service, the blades described in a) must not suffer an axial strain of more than 
0.001. Using table Q4.1 below, determine the maximum operating temperature of the 
blades, if a service life of at least 10,000 hours is required.

Maximum tolerable through thickness crack size
Our conditions are:
Maximum axial strain value = 0,001 = 10-3
Maximum service life value = 10000 hours = 104 hours 
Using, strain rate * hour-1 = 8,2.10-8 we receive:
8,2 . 10-8 .10000 = 0,00082 
Which, is an acceptable value for axial strain.
In order to find a strain value of 0.001, we need to determine the exact service life value. Manipulating 
formula A, we receive:

Thus, satisfying the first condition, by keeping axial strain 0.001 as our maximum axial strain value.

GGlass  fibre s production  – RReinforce d composi te desig
Question 19	 Glass fibres 
production – Reinforced 
composite design
a)	 Describe concisely how glass fibres are produced and how and why they are protected 
from surface damage. Using the data below, determine the maximum flaw size to ensure 
a minimum glass fibre tensile strength of 2,200 Mpa.
E = 100 Gpa;	 	
g = 0.8 J * m-2
Glass fibers are the most widely used and least expensive of all fibers. The composite material is called 
glass-fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) and may contain between 30% and 60% glass fibers by volume. 
Drawing molten glass through small openings in platinum dies makes Glass fibers.
Continuous fibers are drawn through multiple (200–400) orifices in heated platinum plates at speeds as 
high as 500 m/s. Fibres as small as 2mm in diameter can be produced by this method.

c)	 The composite designed in b) may contain small air bubbles in the resin. What effect is 
this likely to have on the overall properties of the composite?
The presence of bubbles in the resin results to a local increase of tension, which is caused by the sudden 
change in the structure. The matrix in reinforced composites has three functions:
1.	 Support and transfer the stresses to the fibers, which carry most of the load.
2.	 Protect the fibers against physical damage and environmental corrosion.
3.	 Reduce propagation of cracks in the composite by virtue of the ductility and toughness.
The presence of bubbles causes a weak strength of the bond between the fiber and the polymer matrix. 
Thus, our composite under static loading will present fiber pullout and delamination of the structure, 
particularly under adverse environmental conditions. The presence of bubbles reduces ductility and 
toughness of the composite, which means that, under static loading (transmitted through the fiber-matrix 
interface) the structure is expected to fail (brittle failure). This case is analogous to opening holes in a 
brick structure. It causes poor bonding between the bricks and the mortar. Under loading and extensive 
tension along the surface the structure collapses.
