Network Related Utilities 
 
 
ping 
 
The ping command sends an echo request to a network host. It is useful for:  
o 
Determining the status of the network and various foreign hosts.  
o 
Tracking and isolating hardware and software problems.  
o 
Testing, measuring, and managing networks.  
 
The ping command sends one datagram per second and prints one line of output for every 
response received. Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are calculated and displayed.  
Example:  
 
% ping kanaha or 164.122.27.33 
PING kanaha.mhpcc.edu: (164.122.27.33): 56 data bytes 
64 bytes from 164.122.27.33: icmp_seq=0 ttl=254 time=3 ms 
64 bytes from 164.122.27.33: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=2 ms 
64 bytes from 164.122.27.33: icmp_seq=2 ttl=254 time=2 ms 
64 bytes from 164.122.27.33: icmp_seq=3 ttl=254 time=2 ms

traceroute 
 
The traceroute command prints the route that IP packets take to a network host. It is intended for 
use in network testing, measurement, and management.  
Example:  
 
% traceroute  archie.rutgers.edu 
traceroute to dorm.Rutgers.EDU (128.6.18.15), 30 hops max, 40 byte

 
Warning: Because of the load traceroute imposes on the network, the traceroute command should 
not be used during normal operations or from automated scripts.  
 
The traceroute utility may not be available on all systems.  
 
 
 
ftp 
 
ftp stands for File Transfer Protocol. File transfer provides a means for you to obtain computer 
files (text, image, sound, etc.) from other computers over the network.  
 
ftp can also be used to send (upload) files from your computer to another computer, providing 
you have write permission or a real account on the machine you are uploading.  
 
The ftp utility has its own set of UNIX like commands which allow you to perform tasks such as:  
o 
Connect and login to a remote host  
o 
Navigate directories  
o 
List directory contents  
o 
Put and get files  
o 
Transfer files as ascii, ebcdic or binary

 
Many computers on the Internet permit anonymous ftp . You can login to these machines without 
a real account, to obtain files which have been made publicly available. Typically, the user name 
anonymous is used, coupled with your email address as the password.  
 
Anonymous ftp is usually restricted so that users can only see what the server permits them to 
see. Anonymous users do not have full privileges as would a user with a real computer account.  
 
 
 
telnet 
 
Telnet is a utility that allows a computer user at one site to make a connection, login and then 
conduct work on a computer at another site. For example, you can use the telnet command to run 
a program in your directory on a supercomputer thousands of miles away.  
 
Telnet is used to access many of the Internet resources, such as databases, libraries and 
computers  
Example telnet session:  
 
% telnet makena 
Trying...

rlogin 
rsh 
rcp  
 
rlogin (remote login), rsh (remote shell) and rcp (remote copy) are three utilities which allow you 
to perform tasks on other machines without requiring the usual login authentication.  
 
All three utilities depend upon a .rhosts located in your home directory. The .rhosts file contains 
the names of your "trusted" hosts and your userid on each of those hosts. An example appears 
below:  
 
     apache.unm.edu  jsmith 
     zeus.mit.edu    jsmith 
     athena.com      smith 
     fox.eeco.org    smithj 
      
 
rlogin: Allows you to login to a remote machine. It is nearly identical to telnet in function and 
appearance, however if your .rhosts file is setup accordingly, you will be able to login to your 
account on another machine wihout having to enter a userid and password.  
 
rsh: The remote shell command can be used to execute a command on remote host or log into 
remote host. With the proper .rhosts file, authentication is not required.  
Examples:  
 
rsh host2                       - will connect to host2 for 
                                  login 
rsh host2 df                    - check the amount of free  
                                  disk space on remote host2 
rsh host2 ps aux |grep jsmith   - check for processes owned  
                                  by jsmith on host2 
rsh host2 rm /tmp/myfile.old    - remove a file in host2  
rsh host2 cat test1 ">>" test2  - append test1 file on remote  
                                  host to test2 file on remote  
                                  host 
rsh host2 cat test1 >> test2    - append test1 file on remote  
                                  host to test2 file on local 
                                  host 
      
 
rcp: Remote copy enables you to copy files between different systems. With the proper .rhosts 
file, authentication is not required.  
Example:  
 
     rcp localfile host2:/home/eng/journal
