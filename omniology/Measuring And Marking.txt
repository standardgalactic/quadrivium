MEASURING AND MARKING  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Basic measuring and marking require very little skill, but 
always double check your results. Sometimes it's handy to 
have an assistant with you. 
  
 
 
Retractable rules can sometimes snap back quickly, so take 
care. When marking with a knife, keep your fingers away 
from the blade, and don't apply excessive pressure. 
  
 
 
Accurate measuring and marking are the secrets to success 
for many projects around the home and garden. 
  
Measuring and marking out help you to work accurately, and 
are important in the costing of large jobs around the house 
and garden.  
  
Most products are now sold in metric quantities, but some 
are still in the imperial system. Always work in one system 
only - changing between the two is confusing and often 
inaccurate. Tapes and rules are usually marked in both 
systems of measurement. 
 
2  - Planning the work 
If you are measuring a large area, such as a lawn or patio, 
have ready-cut pegs to hand for driving in at the important 
points.  
 
 
 
Working with an assistant helps with the measuring and also 
with checking calculations.  
 
 
 
When measuring for smaller projects, using timber, man-
made boards, plasterboard and other sheet materials, try to 
work on a clean surface in good light with all your tools close
to hand.  
 
 
 
Always allow a margin for wastage and error when 
calculating materials. This is often better than having to re-
order or spoiling the job by skimping.  
 
3  - Measuring large areas  

Where it is important to 
check the right angles, such 
as for the base of a shed or 
greenhouse, or for a formal 
design with block paving e
measure the diagonals to 
ensure complete accuracy. 
When the diagonals are 
equal, your base is said to b

The area of a large, irregular 
shape can be approximated 
by measuring square or 
rectangular areas within it 
and adding the 
measurements of these a
 
together. Make an allowan

To find the exact area of an irregular shape, first measure 
the outside with a flexible tape or piece of string, and call 
this the circumference. Then calculate as though you were 
dealing with a circle.  
 
 
 
Use the formula pr2 to calculate the area of a circle, where 
p=3.14 and r=radius of circle (the radius is the length of a 
straight line from the centre to the edge of the circle).  
 
 
 
Run a piece of string along irregular or curved edges if you 
need a quick linear measurement, for garden edging, for 
example.  
 
4 - Working with a straightedge 
 
Straightedges are used mostly to transfer measurements 
accurately across areas longer than the rule being used. 
Another use for them is to check that your material or 
surface is flat. Straightedges are long metal rules that may 
be calibrated or plain. 
 
 
 
The best way to check that a straightedge is accurate is to 
hold it by one end and look down it. Any curve is obvious.  
 
 
 
A straightedge can also be used to cut against with a craft 

knife, such as when cutting paper, leather, cardboard or 
plasterboard.  
 
5  - Marking out 
Measurements can be marked in various ways, depending on
how accurate they need to be. A felt-tipped pen is easily 
read, and can be used where accuracy is not too critical. A 
carpenter's pencil is also ideal for easy-to-read 
measurements.  
 
 
 
An ordinary hard lead pencil with a well-sharpened point is 
fairly accurate for most marking jobs, and it is quite easily 
rubbed out when required.  
 
 
 
For very fine work to be cut, 
use a marking knife or a c
knife. These not only mark 
but sever the fibres very 
slightly to enable furthe
cutting to be very exact (3)
The severed fibres leave a 
whisker-free cut edge.

6  - Marking with a bench rule  
Bench rules come as either rigid or flexible. The flexible ones
are handy for measuring curved surfaces, although very 
tight curves should be measured with a tape.  
 
 
 
Steel rules are very useful, 
but they do have a tendency 
to slip on smooth surfaces. 
Hold the rule down well, with 
your fingers spread wide 
along the rule (4).  
 
 
 

Using a rigid rule held on 
edge, with your fingers 
against the edge of the 
material being cut, is a quick 
way to step off the width (5

7  - Dividing into equal parts 
The simplest way to divide 
the work equally is to hold 
your rule diagonally across 
the surface and decide how 
many divisions you want to 
make. Be sure that the end o
the rule is level with the edg
of the material and the 
divisions will fall equal 
automatically. This is very 
handy for marking out 
dovetails and other joints (
 
8  - Using squares 
Squares are used to produce a line at right-angles to an 
edge and to transfer one measurement to the opposite side 
of the material or perhaps all the way round. In this way, 
they save having to measure each face. They must always 
be used against a flat, planed edge.  
 
 
 
The most basic square is the 
try square. Use a pencil or 
marking knife to mark your 
line against the steel edge 
(7).  
 
 
 

The try square is also used to 
check that faces are at 90 
degrees to each other. The 
stock of the square is laid fl
against one face of the work 
and a check is made visually 
to see if light appears u
the steel edge (8). If it does, 
more planing is necessary on 
the opposite side to the light, 
to square up the work. The 
try square is also used to 
check internal and external 
angles of assemblies.
