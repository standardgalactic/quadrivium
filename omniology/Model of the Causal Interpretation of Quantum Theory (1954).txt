In this paper, we propose a physical
model leading- to the causal interpretation
of the quantum
theory.
In this model, a set of fields which are equivalent
in many ways to a conserved
Quid, with density
~ P ~, and
local stream velocity, dg/dt = ryS/ns, act on a particle-like
inhomogeneity
which moves with the local stream
velocity of the equivalent
Quid. By introducing
the hypothesis
of a very irregular
and e6ectively
random
Quctuation
in the motions of the Quid, we are able to prove that an arbitrary
probability
density
ultimately
decays into
~ P
~ . Thus, we answer an important
objection to the causal interpretation,
made by Pauli and
others. This result is extended to the Dirac equation
and to the many-particle
problem.
1. INTRODUCTION
A
CAUSAL interpretation
of the quantum
theory
has been
proposed, '' involving
the assumption
that an electron is a particle following a continuous
and
causally
defined trajectory with a well-defined
position,
g(t),
accompanied
by a physically
real
wave
field,
P(x,t). To obtain
all of the results
of the usual
inter-
pretation,
the
following
supplementary
assumptions
had to be made:
1. f(x,t) satisfied Schrodinger's
equation.
2. d(/di= r'S/m,
where f=R exp(iS/Is).
3. The probability
distribution
in an ensemble
of
electrons
having
the same wave function,
is I'= ~P ~'.
These assumptions
were shown to be consistent.
Assumption
(3), however,
has
been
criticized
by
Pauli' and others4 on the ground that such a hypothesis
is not appropriate
in a theory aimed at giving a causal
explanation
of the quantum
mechanics.
Instead,
they
argue it should be possible to have an arbitrary
prob-
ability
distribution
[a special
case of which
is the
function P=ll(x—xs), representing
a particle in a well-
defined
location),
that
is at least
in principle
inde-
pendent
of the P field and dependent. only on our degree
of information
concerning
the location of the particle.
In a more recent paper, ' one of us has proposed
a
means
of dealing
with this problem
by explaining
the
relation, I' =
~f i ' in terms of random
collision processes.
It was
shown
in a simplified
case that
a statistical
ensemble
of quantum-mechanical
system with an arbi-
trary initial probability
distribution
decays in time to
an ensemble
with P=
~ P
~ '. This is equivalent
to a proof
of Boltzmann's
H theorem in classical mechanics.
Thus,

we can answer
the objection
of Pauli,
for no matter
what the initial probability
distribution
may have been
(for example,
a delta function),
it will eventually
be
given by I'= ~P~'.
In the work
cited above,
however,
certain
mathe-
matical
difhculties
make a generalization
of the results
to an arbitrary
system
very difficult.
(The difticulties
are rather
analogous
to these
appearing
in classical
statistical
mechanics
when one tries rigorously
to treat
the approach
of a distribution
to equilibrium,
by means
of
demonstrating
a
quasi-ergodic
character
of
the
motion).
In the present
paper,
we shall
avoid
these
difficulties
by taking
advantage
of the fact that
the
causal
interpretation
of the quantum
theory
permits
an unlimited
number
of new physical
models,
of types
not consistent
with the usual interpretation,
which lead
to the
usual
theory
only
as an approximation,
and
which may lead to appreciably
diferent
results at new
levels (e.g., 10 "cm). The model that we shall propose
here furnishes
the basis for a simple
deduction
of the
relation, I'= ~f~', and
in addition,
gives a possible
physical
interpretation
of the
relation
dg/dt=V'S/m
(postulate
2), which follows rather
naturally
from the
model. This model is an extension
of the causal inter-
pretation
of the
quantum
theory
already
proposed,
which provides
a more concrete physical
image of the
meaning
of our
postulates
than
has
been
available
before,
and
which
suggests
new properties
of matter
that may exist at deeper levels.
2. THE HYDRODYNAMIC
MODEL
The model
that
we shall adopt
in this paper
is an
extension of a hydrodynamic
model, originally
proposed
by Madelung'
and later
developed
further
by Taka-
bayasi'
and by Schenberg. ' To obtain
this model,
we
first write down Schrodinger's
equation
in terms of the

As shown
by Takabayasi'
and by Schenberg, ' the
quantum
potential
may be thought
of as arising in the
effects of an internal
stress
in the
Quid.
This stress
depends,
however,
on derivatives
of the Quid density,
and therefore
is not completely
analogous
to the usual
stresses,
such as pressures,
which
are found in macro-
scopic Qulds.
The above model is, however, not adequate
by itself;
for it contains
nothing
to describe the actual location,
g(t), of the particle,
which makes possible,
as we have
seen
in previous
papers, '' a consistent
causal
inter-
pretation
of the quantum
theory.
At this point,
we
therefore
complete the model by postulating
a particIe,
which
takes
the form
of a highly
localized
inhomo-
geneity that moves with the local fluid velocity, v(x, t)
The precise nature
of this inhomogeneity
is irrelevant
for our purposes. It could be, for example,
a foreign
body, of a density
close to that of the Quid, which was
simply
being
carried
along
with
the local velocity
of
the Quid as a small
Qoating
body is carried
along
the
surface of the water at the local stream velocity of the
water.
Or else it could be a stable
dynamic
structure
existing in the Quid; for example, a small stable vortex
or some other stable localized structure,
such as a small
pulse-like
inhomogeneity.
Such
structures
might
be
stabilized
by some nonlinearity
that would be present
in a more
accurate
approximation
to the
equations
governing
the fiuid motions than is given by (I) and (2).
3. FLUCTUATIONS
OF THE MADELUNG
FLUID
Thus far we have been assuming
that the Madelung
Quid
undergoes
some
regular
motion,
which
can in
principle
be calculated
by solving
Schrodinger
s equa-
tion with appropriate
boundary
conditions.
We know,
however,
that in all real Quids ever met with thus far
(and indeed, in all physically
real fields also) the motions
never take precisely
the forms obtained by solving
the
appropriate
equations
with the correct boundary
con-
ditions.
For there
always
exist random
Quctuations.
Now Madelung
originally
proposed
that E.' be inter-
preted as the density p(x) of a continuous
fiuid, which
had the stream
velocity v=7'S/m.
Thus,
the fluid
is
assumed
to undergo
only potential
flow. Equation
(I)
then expresses
the conservation
of Quid, while Eq. (2)
determines
the changes
of the velocity
potential 5 in
terms of the classical potential
t/', and the "quantum
potential":
$2 +2R
Q2 +2p
$ (gp)
2
2m
R
4m
p
2(p)
These
Quctuations
may
have
many
origins.
For ex-
ample, real Quids maybe subject to irregular disturbance
originating
outside
the Quid and transmitted
to it at
the boundaries.
Moreover,
because
the
equations
of
motion
Qow of the Quid are, in general,
nonlinear,
the
Quid
motion
may be unstable,
so that
irregular
tur-
bulent
motion
may
arise within
the
Quid itself. And
Anally,
because
of the underlying
constitution
of the
Quid in terms of molecules
in random
thermal
motion,
there may exist a residual
Brownian
movement
in the
Quid, even for Quid elements
that are large enough
to
contain a great many
molecules.
Thus,
in a real Quid,
there are ample reasons why the usual hydrodynamical
equations
mill, in general,
describe only some mean or
average aspect of the motion,
while the actual motion
has an addition
some very irregular
Quctuating
com-
ponents,
which are effectively
random.
Since the Madelung
Quid is being assumed to be some
kind of physically
real Quid, it is therefore quite natural
to suppose
that it too undergoes
more or less random
Quctuations
in its motions.
Such random
Quctuations
are evidently
consistent
within
the
framework
of the
causal
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory.
Thus,
there are always random perturbations
of any quantum
mechanical
system
which
arise
outside
that
system.
(Indeed, as we have already shown in a previous paper, '
the
effects of such
perturbations
are by
themselves
capable
of
explaining
the
probability
distribution,
P= ~f ', at least for certain
simple systems. ) We may
also assume
that
the equations
governing
the f field
have nonlinearities,
unimportant
at the level where the
theory
has
thus
far
been
successfully
applied,
but
perhaps
important
in connection
with
processes
in-
volving
very short distances.
Such nonlinearities
could
produce,
in addition
to many
other qualitatively
new
effects,
the possibility
of irregular
turbulent
motion.
Moreover,
we may conceive of a granular
substructure
of matter
underlying
the Madelung
Quid, analogous
to
(but not necessarily
of exactly
the same kind as) the
molecular
structure
underlying
ordinary
Quids.
We may therefore
assume that for any or all of these
reasons, or perhaps for still other reasons not mentioned
here, our Quid undergoes
a more or less random
type of
Quctuation
about
the
Madelung
motion
as a mean.
Thus, the velocity
will not be exactly equal to V'S/m,
nor will the density,
p, be exactly equal to
~ P
~'. All that
we require
is that the relations p= ~f~' and v=7'S/m
be valid as averages.
Indeed, it is not even necessary
that the exact velocity be derivable
from a potential.
Thus, we would have d(/dt = V'S'/m+ VXA, more gener-
ally, ' ' where
5'XA)A„——0 and
(VS')A„——(V'S)A„. Hence
Schrodinger's
equation
will not apply
to the Quctua-
Such vortex components
of the velocity may also explain the
appearance
of "spin" provided
that
they
could have a regular
component
as well as a random
component.
Indeed,
in another
paper, the Pauli equation
will be treated from this point of view.
But here we concern
ourselves
only with a level of precision
in
which the spin can be neglected,
so that Schrodinger's
equation
is a good approximation
for the mean behavior
of the Quid.

tions.
However,
the
conservation
equation
Bp/R
+div(pv)=0
will
be assumed
to hold
even
during
a
Quctuation.
Such an equation
is implied
almost by the
very concept of a Quid; for if there were no conservation,
then the model of a Quid would
lose practically
all of
its content.
From the above assumptions,
it is clear that if we
followed a given
Quid element,
we would
discover that
it undergoes
an exceedingly
irregular
motion,
which
is
able in time to carry it from any specified trajectory of
the mean
Madelung
motion
to practically
any other
trajectory. Such a random
motion of the Quid elements
would,
if it were the only factor operating,
lead even-
tually
to a uniform
mean
density
of the Quid. For it
would
on the average
carry
away
more
Quid from a
region of high
density
than it carried back. The fact
that
the mean
density
remains
equal
to
~P~', despite
the
eGects of the random
Quctuations,
implies
then
that a systematic
tendency
must exist for Quid elements
to move toward
regions of high mean
Quid density,
in
such a way as to maintain
the stability
of the mean
density, p= ~P~'. As for the origin of such a tendency,
the question is, of course, not important
for the problem
that we are treating
in this paper. We may, however,
suggest by way of a possible explanation
that the inter-
nal stresses in the fluid are such that whenever
p devi-
ates from
~ f ', a kind of pressure
arises that tends to
correct the deviation
automatically.
Such a behavior
is
analogous
to what would happen,
for example, to a gas
in irregular
turbulent
motion
in a gravitational
field,
in which the pressures
automatically
adjust themselves
in such a way as to maintain
a local mean density
close
to p=poe ""~xr if the temperature
T is constant.
(In
this
connection,
note
that
as
shown
in
theoretical
treatments
of turbulence,
the irregular turbulent
motions
themselves
raise the effective "pressure" in the Quid, so
that the eGective "temperature"
T is equal to the sum
of the mean kinetic energy of random
molecular
motion
and that of irregular
turbulent
motion. )
We must now make some assumptions
concerning
the
behavior of the particle-like
inhomogeneity.
We assume
that
ever ie a,CNctlatioe,
it follows
the Quid velocity
v(x,t). Such a behavior
would
result
if the inhomo-
geneity
were a very
small
dynamic
structure
in the
fiuid (e.g., a vortex, or a pulse-like
inhomogeneity)
or if
it were a foreign body of about the same density as the
Quid,
provided
that
the wavelengths
associated
with
the Ructuations
were appreciably
larger
than the size
of the particle.
For in this
case, the
inhomogeneity
would have to do more or less as the Quid did, since it
would act, for all practical purposes,
like a small element
of Quid.
The presence of Quctuations
with wavelengths
smaller
than the size of the body could complicate the problem,
especially if we were considering
inhomogeneities,
such
as vortices
and pulses,
which
were dynamically
main-
tained
structures
in the Quid itself. For, such Quctua-
tions would treat diGerent parts of the inhomogeneity
diGerently,
and thus, in general,
would
tend to lead to
a dispersal
of the inhomogeneity.
Let us recall, however,
that
we are by hypothesis
considering
only equations
having
such nonlinearities
in them as to lead to stable
inhomogeneities.
It is true that the equations
of ordi-
nary
hydrodynamics
do not
do this. But it is not
necessary
that the sub-quantum-mechanical
Madelung
Quid should
have exactly the same kinds of properties
as are possessed
by ordinary
Auids.
Indeed,
we have
already
seen that instead of the usual classical pressure
term,
it has
a quantum-mechanical
internal
stress,
which
depends
on the derivatives
of the Quid density,
rather than on the density itself. Thus, we may reason-
ably postulate
that it also has some characteristically
new
kind
of nonlinear
term
which
leads
to stable
inhomogeneities.
Hence,
small
Quctuations
of wave
length
much less than the size of the body will merely
cause irregular
oscillations
in the inhomogeneities,
the
eGects of which
will, for practical purposes,
cancel out.
Large Quctuations
may destroy
the inhomogeneity
or
transform
it into
new
kinds
of inhomogeneity.
This
could, however,
represent
certain aspects of the "crea-
tion, " "destruction, " and
transformation
of
"ele-
mentary" particles, which is characteristic
of phenomena
connected
with
very
high
energies
and
very
short
distances. But in the low-energy
domain,
which we are
treating
now,
where
Schrodinger
s equation
is a good
enough
approximation,
such processes
will not occur.
YVe see then that if there are Quctuations
of wave-
length a great deal shorter
than
the size of the body,
they will have a negligible
eGect on the over-all motions
of the body
(whether
it be a foreign body or a stable
dynamic
structure
in the fiuid). In this case, the body
will
follow
the mean
velocity
of the Quid
in a small
region surrounding
it. To take into account the possi-
bility that such Quctuations
may exist, we shall there-
fore hereafter let v(x, t) and p(x, f) represent
respectively
the mean velocity and mean density
in a small neigh-
borhood
surrounding
the
body,
while
V'S(x,t)
and
p(x,t) represent
the means of these quantities
in a region
that is much larger than the size of the body, but still
small enough
so that g (x,t) does not change appreciably
within this region. The consistency of these assumptions
evidently
requires
that
the body be very
small;
but
with a choice, for example,
of something
of the order of
IO "cm for its size, one obtains
ample opportunity
to
satisfy the above assumptions
in a consistent
way.
It is clear,
of course,
that
Auctuations
having
a
wavelength
close to the size of the body
will neither
cancel out completely,
nor will they necessarily
cause
the body to move exactly with
the mean of the Quid
velocity
in a small
neighborhood
surrounding
it. We
may
assume,
however,
that
the
magnitude
of the
longer-wavelength
Quctuations
is so great that we can
neglect the eGects of Quctuations
of these intermediate
wavelengths.
Thus, a rather wide range exists of kinds
of Auctuations
that
could lead to the type of motion
that we are assuming
for the inhomogeneity.
I

CAUSAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
QUANTUM
THEORY
2ii
On the basis of the above assumptions,
it is evident
that
the
inhomogeneity
will
undergo
an
irregular
motion,
analogous
to the Brownian
motion. " Let us
now consider a statistical ensemble of Quids, each having
in it an inhomogeneity,
and let us denote
the prob-
ability density of such inhomogeneities
in the ensemble
by P(x,t). Let us further
assume that the fluid motion
is so irregular
that
in time a Quid
element
initially
in an arbitrary
region dx' in the domain
in which
the
mean fluid density
~ it (x,t) ~' is appreciable,
has a non-
zero
probability
of reaching
any other
region
dx in
this domain. We can then quite easily see in qualitative
terms
that
the
proba, bility
density
P(x,t)
must
approach
~f(x,t)
~ ' as an equilibrium
value.
First of all, it is clear that if, for any reason whatever,
the distribution
P= ~P~', is once established,
then it
will be maintained
for all time,
despite
the random
Quctuations
in the Quid motion. For the inhomogeneities
simply
follow the Quid velocity in a small neighborhood
surrounding
the body.
Now
by hypothesis
the
Quid
Quctuations
are just such as to preserve the equilibrium
mean
density
of P= ~lt i'. Therefore,
they
must
also
preserve
the
equilibrium
probability
density
of par-
ticles in the same way.
Let us now
consider
what
happens
when I' is not
equal to ~P~'. Suppose, for example,
that there were a
larger
number
of particles
in a specified
element
of
volume
than
is given
by P= ~lt ~'. Now,
the random
motions
carry particles
away from such an element at
a rate proportional
to their density in this element. The
systematic
tendency
for particles
to come back to the
element,
which results from their following
the Quid, as
it drifts back. at a rate sufficient to maintain
the mean
equilibrium
density
of p= tf~',
will
however
be just
large enough
to cancel the loss that would have taken
place if the probability
density
of particles
had been
P= ~P~'. Since the density
was actually
greater
than
this, more particles
are lost than
are compensated
by
the drift back and
the density
therefore
approaches
P= ~iJ ~'. If the probability
density
of particles
in this
element had been less than P=
tf
~ ', the element
would,
of course, have tended
to gain particles
until it had a
density of ~f~'.
In the next section,
we shall
give a mathematical
demonstration
of the above result,
the correctness
of
which
should
however,
already
be evident
from
the
qualitative
considerations
cited above.
Finally,
we may mention
that the picture
of a Quid
undergoing
random
motion
about
a regular
mean
is
only one out of an infinite
number
of possible
models
leading to the same general
type of theory. Indeed,
all
the properties
that we have assumed
for our Quid could
equally
well belong to some 4-vector
field
(p,j) which
was conserved,
and which
underwent
random
Quctua-
Brownian
motion models of the quantum
theory have already
been
proposed
elsewhere,
but
on a very
diGerent
basis.

p and j were assumed
to satisfy

equations,
there
could
also exist pulse-like

for p and j that moved

Although
it is important
to keep in mind these more
general
possibilities
when
one is actually
trying
to
formulate
a more
detailed
theory,
we have
found it
convenient
in this paper
to express
our assumptions
and
results
in
terms
of a
hydrodynamical
model,
because
this
model
not only provides
a very natural
and vivid physical
image of the behavior
of the f field,
but
also a simple
explanation
of the
formula,
d(/dt
=VS/stt,
(postulate
2) expressing
the velocity
of an
inhomogeneity
in
terms
of the
local
mean
stream
velocity.
4. PROOF THAT PROBABILITY DENSITY APPROACHES
FLUID DENSITY IN RANDOM
FLUCTUATIONS
OF A FLUID
We shall now prove the following
theorem.
Suppose
that we have a conserved
Quid that undergoes
random
fluctuations
of the velocity, v(x,t), and of the density,
p(x,t), about respective
mean values
vp(x, t) and pp(x, t)
Lso that 8p/r)t+div(pv) =0 and itpp/Bt+dlv(ppvp) =0].
Suppose in addition that there is an inhomogeneity
that
follows the Quid motions, with the local stream velocity,
v(x, t). Then
if the fluctuations
are such that a fluid
element starting
in an arbitrary
element of volume, dx',
in the region where the Quid density
is appreciable
has
a nonzero probability
of reaching
any other element of
volume
dx in this region, it follows
that an arbitrary
initial
probability
density
of inhomogeneities
will
in
time approach P= pp(x, t).
This theorem
is seen to apply to our problems
as a
special case, in which
we set pp= ~P(x,t) ~' and vp(x, t)
=VS(x,t)/m,
where P(x,,t) satisfies Schrodinger's
equa-
tion, provided
that
we regard
p(x, t) and v(x,t) as the
mean
Quid density
and velocity
in a small region sur-
rounding
the inhomogeneity.
This theorem is a general-
zation of a well-known
theorem concerning the approach
to equilibrium
in a Markow
process." Essentially,
we
have
generalized
the
theorem
to treat
the
time-de-
pendent
probabilities
of transition
and time-dependent
limiting
distributions
with

we have to deal
in
our problem.
To prove this theorem,
we note that, as shown in the
previous
section,
a
given
Quid
element
follows
an
extremely
irregular
trajectory,
in
which
its
density
p(x, t) fluctuates
near
the
mean
density
pp(x, t). Now
because the volume
of a given
Quid element
is always

changing
in accordance
with
the changing
mean
Quid
density
in the new regions
that it enters, it is rather
dificult
in rectangular
coordinates
to keep
track
of
how
much
Quid
is transferred
on the
average
from
one element
of volume
to another.
To facilitate
the
treatment
of the
problem,
we
shall
therefore
take
the preliminary
step of introducing
a new set of coor-
dinates, $i(x), $s(x), $s(x), which are so defined thatan.
elementary
cell in the space of jt, $s, $s always contains
a mean quantity
of Quid proportional
to its volume.
Such a set of coordinates
is easily
defined.
For the
mean quantity
of Quid in a given volume
element
is
dg= pp(x, f)dx= pp(x~t) J(Bx&/Bg„)dcidgsdb
where J(8$„/8x„) is the Jacobian of the transformation.
Now we want to have J(8$„/Bx„)=cps(x, t) (where
we
shall choose e to be unity for convenience).
Since there is only one equation, it is clear that only
one of the g„can be defined
in this way,
so that
the
other two can be chosen according to what is convenient.
Thus, if we fix the forms of Ps and
$s, we see that the
above equation
becomes a linear
differential
equation
defining
gt, in terms of $s, gs, and ps. Such an equation
always has solutions
wherever
$s, gs, and ps are regular.
There may exist singular
points or curves, but we shall
later show how these are to be dealt with.
As an example,
consider
a cylindrically
symmetric
density
function
p(R)=e ~/R.
We first
express
the
volume
element
in cylindrical
polar coordinates
(with
Rs= X'+ Y')
p(R)RdRdrtidZ=
e ndRdrtidZ.
Now we want
e
dR=dgi, or pi= e ".As for $s and $s,
we can in this case leave them equal to it and Z respec-
tively.
Here we see that when R goes from 0 to ~, (, goes
from unity
to zero. This is an example
of a charac-
teristic property
of the g„space to be limited
in volume
when the function ps(R) is appreciable
only in a limited
domain. Such a property
is to be expected, because we
are mapping
the x„on the $„ in just such a way that
each region
maps into a new
volume
proportional
to
the amount of Quid originally
in that region. Thus even
infinite
regions
of x„space may
map
onto
negligible
regions of $„space, if they contain
negligible
quantities
of Auld.
The solution
of the differential
equation
for Pi, will
lead
in
general
to
multiple-valued
functions.
This,
however,
causes no trouble, as we need merely establish
a convenient cut somewhere
which defines which branch
of the function
that we are using. Thus the transition
to cylindrical
polar coordinates, R'=X'+ Y', &=tan '
X(Y/X), leads
to a multiple
valued
function
for g,
but we deal with
this problem
by establishing
a cut,
say at &=0, and then
defining
the range of variation
of it as being from zero to 2w. In order to cover the
entire XF plane only once, a similar
definition
can be
made with any multiple-valued
function.
If ps(x, f) vanishes
at certain
points,
then at those
points
we cannot
solve for all the g„ in terms of the x„
(as, for example,
in cylindrical
polar
coordinates
we
cannot solve for P at R=O). As long as ps(x, f) vanishes
only at a set of isolated points, or at most, on a set of
one-dimensional
curves, where will be no real difhculty.
For the vanishing
of ps(x, f) means only (as in the case
of cylindrical
polar coordinates)
that some of the $, are
not defined along these curves. To avoid any ambiguities
arising
from
the lack of definition,
we may
surround
each of these curves with a tube, as small in radius as
we please,
and
thus
exclude
them
from
the
region
under
consideration
without
excluding
any significant
physical
eGects.
If, however,
there are two-dimensional
surfaces where
ps(x, t) =0, this creates more serious mathematical
dif-
ficulties. Since such surfaces do not, in fact, arise in any
real problem
of interest
to us," we shall
assume
that
ps(x, f) vanishes
at most
on a set of one-dimensional
curves.
Finally,
let us note that since po changes
with time,
our P„will change with time correspondingly.
Thus, we
are adopting
a moving
set of coordinates
(but not in
general
one that moves
with
the mean
motion
of the
fiuid elements).
In the space of the $„, the mean fiuid density
will be
a constant
which also does not change with time. As a
result,
the problem
of describing
the Quctuations
will
be greatly
simplified.
For in the g„space there
is no
tendency
for
the
Quctuation
to
favor
any
special
region since the equilibrium
density, which was ps(x, t) in
rectangular
coordinate,
is now a constant. Thus, in the
$.space, the fluctuations
have a truly random character,
independent
of the Quid density at any particular
point.
%e are now ready to set up the equations
governing
"In the case of interest
to us, po= ~it(x,t)('. At first sight, it
may seem that we shall have to be concerned
with surfaces
on
which
po vanished,
because in a perfectly
stationary
state,
it (x,t)
can be zero on certain nodal surfaces. In the case of a perfectly
stationary
state,
it
can
be
real
Lor
more
generally,
writing
it = LT(x,t)+fV(x,t),
we
may
have
a
functional
relationship
between
V(x,t) and
V(x,t) permitting
both to vanish
on some
two-dimensional
surfacej.
However,
for
the
general
complex
function P, which we obtain in a nonstationary
state, it may be
shown that there is no such functional
relation between
U' and
t/",
so that P can vanish at most on a set of one-dimensional
curves.
Now a perfectly
stationary
state is an abstraction
that never
really exists. For all systems
that have ever been dealt with are
perturbed
to some extent by interactions
with other systems. Thus,
in a gas, a hydrogen
atom suGers
10'~ collisions per second. In a
metal,
the
electrons
suffer a correspondingly
large
number
of
collisions with each other and with the cores. In the nucleus,
there
is a continual
process of perturbation
due to the Quctuating
elec-
tronic and ionic 6elds acting on the spin and quadripole
moments
of the nuclei. EVen in interstellar
space, atoms undergo
at least
one collision
with
electrons
in 10~ seconds. Thus,
all states are
slightly
nonstationary,
and
no perfectly
nodal
planes
of the P
function
ever really appear in nature.
A set of perfectly
nodal surfaces could interfere
with our proof
that P~(P~'; for they would represent
surfaces that would never
be crossed so that the regions
on diferent
sides of these surfaces
could be completely
isolated from each other.

(Note that 8(' is the magnitude
of the volume element, "
whereas
dg' is the size of the cell in which the center of
the volume
element
was located at the time t'). This
probability
is
Let us now
discuss
the motions
of the inhomoge-
neities. Since these latter follow the Ruid in its Ructua-
ations, it is easily seen that the probability
density
of
inhomogeneities,
F((,t), is just the average
of F((',f')
weighted
with the probability E((g', f,t'). Thus,
(6)
Now, let (sr(f) represent
the value of ( for which F((,t)
is a maximum,
g (f) the value for which it is a minimum.
(If there is more than
one pair of such points,
let us
consider any single pair. ) We also let F
((,t) =M(t),
and F;„((,I)=m(f). Setting (=)sr(f) in Eq. (6), and
using (5), we obtain
dF =E((,(',t,f')dg'.
Clearly, by definition,
(4)
and with (=g (f) in Eq. (6), we get similarly
E((,(',l,l')dg'= 1.
Now the exact form of E(g,(',t,t') will depend
on the
precise nature
of the Ructuations
that are taking place
in the Ruid. We shall
see, however,
that in order to
prove
that F(g,f)—+1, it is suKcient
to assume
that
E((,g', t,t') fails to be zero
over the part
of g space
corresponding
to the region of x space in which pe(x, t)
is appreciable.
This
is clearly
just
a mathematical
expression of the assumption
appearing
in the 6rst part
of this section that there is a nonzero
probability
that
an element
starting
at any point x in this region
has
a nonzero probability
of arriving
at any other point x'
in the region.
Note, however,
that the region of x space in which
pp
is appreciable
will include,
for practical
purposes,
the
whole of the g space (except for a region of negligible
dimensions).
Thus,
we may postulate
that E(g,g', f,f')
fails to be zero in the whole of g space (except possibly
along
some one-dimensional
curves
where
ps(x, t) may
be zero, which
we can exclude by means
of tubes of
negligible
dimensions) .
As for other properties
of E, they are irrelevant
for
our purposes
here, although
we shall
discuss
some of
them in Sec. 6, in another
con'nection. "
'4 On the average,
bg will not change as the Quid element moves
because the Quid density Quctuates near a constant volume in space.
"It may be noted at this point
that;
the kernel E(g,(', t')l
already contains implicit
within it a description
of the mean Quid

this,

t—t'=St to be a small

(9b)
Thus, F((',t') = constant is also an equilibrium
solution,
since it does not change with the passage of time. The
result,
of course, is more or less to be expected
from
the physical
argument
given at the beginning
of this
section showing
that 8=ps(x, t) is an equilibrium
solu-
tion, so that F=F/ps

We conclude then that if F((',t') is not a constant, Eqs.
(9a) and (9b) must be written
as

short times. For longer times, the functional
form of IC is deter-
mined
in a complicated
way, which
is however
of no concern to
us in this paper.
In order for the equal
sign to hold in Eq. (9a), it is
necessary that F(g',f') be a constant. For by hypothesis,
E(g,g', t,f') fails to vanish
anywhere
in the g space; and
if F((',t') is not a constant,
then the integral
(7) must
obtain contributions
from regions in which F(g', t') &M.
Similarly,
we can show that the equal sign can hold in
(9b) only if F(g',t') is a constant.
But if F(g',t') is a
constant
in g space, then by (6) we have

Now we can show that Eqs. (10a) and (10b) imply
that F(x,t) must approach a constant,
with the passage
of time. To do this, let us consider a series of times,
t» f» ts
t~, 1„+r. .. We apply
(10a) and
(10b) from
one element
of the series of times to the next. Thus
M(t )(M(t

(11a)
m(t„) &m(t„,).
(11b)
It is clear that M(i„) and te(i„) must
each approach
constant
limits.
For M(t„) is always
decreasing
and
yet remains
greater
than
some
fixed
number,
m(t, ),
where
t, is any element
of the series such that t„&t,.
Similarly
m(t„) is always
increasing
and yet less than
M(1,). Now
there
are just
two possibilities:
(a) The
two constant limits are different;
(b) they are the same.
We easily see that alternative
(a) is self-contradictory.
To do this, we denote the two limits by 3f and ns, respec-
tively. Then M—m=lim[M($„) —nz(t„)J. But by (11a)
and (11b), we have
M—m&lim [M(t„,)—m(t

Because this is a contradiction,
alternative
(b) must
hold. Then F(g,t) must approach
a constant
limit, and
E(x,t) must
approach
ape(x, t), where
u is a constant.
If, as happens
in
quantum
theory,
the
integral
of
ps(x, t) is normalized
to unity,
then since by definition
the integral
of I' is also normalized
to unity,
we must

5. APPLICATION
TO DIRAC EQUATION
AND
EXTENSION TO MANY-PARTICLE
PROBLEM
We may
apply
the preceding
results
to the causal
interpretation
of the Dirac equation, "where, as in the
Schrodinger
equation,
we
have
a

we assume a fluid of the same kind as that treated

replace
V'S/ns
by /*rsvp/P*P
and
~f~' by
P*f, then according
to the results
of Sec. 4, the prob-
ability density
will ultimately
approach
1t*p.
Our results can also be extended
very readily to the
case of many particles.
We first discuss
this extension
in a purely
formal
way.
We have
a wave
function,
f(xr, xs . xiv, t), defined
in a 317'-dimensional
config-
uration
space. Writing P=E exp{i5/5), we have a set
of 3X velocity
fields, v„=V' S(xr,xs, .

V'„
refers to differentiation
with respect to the coordinates
of the eth particle. Ke have a conservation
equation
in the configuration

each
particle
follows
the
line
of
Qow
given
by
v„(xi,xs,
x&,t). Thus,
our model
is formally

ously. Hence, if we assume

result
that
the

~P(xi,xs,

To obtain a possible physical
picture of the meaning
of this model,
we may use the causal interpretation
of
the ~V-particle problem recently proposed by de Broglie."
De Broglie has shown
that
the usual
formulation
in
terms of a wave function
in the 3X-dimensional
con-
figuration
space
can
be
replaced
by
an
equivalent
formulation,
according to which each particle is accom-
panied
by its
own
3-dimensional
wave
field,
which
depends
on the precise locations
of the other (X—1)
particles.
Since
each
wave
field
satisfies
its
own
Schrodinger's
equation,
the
preceding
demonstration
still applies.
The above
model
would
imply
that
each particle
moves in its own Quid, and that the Quids interpene-
trate each other. For the case of equivalent
particles,
however,
de Broglie has suggested
that all particles can
be regarded
as moving
in a common
three-dimensional
Quid, the velocity of which, at any point x, is dependent
on the locations of all the particles, x„.Thus, we would
merely
need as many
Quids as there are types of par-
ticles.
6. ON THE RELATION
BETWEEN THE THEORY
OF
MEASUREMENTS
AND FLUCTUATIONS
IN THE Q FIELD
Ke have demonstrated
that with time, the limiting
distribution, I'= ~f~, will be established
for any func-
tional form of E(g,g', 1,1'), at least within a region which
is such that E((,(',1,t'), does not vanish for any pair of
points
F„' and
g in the region in question.
But without
a further
specification
of the E((,(',1,t'), the rate of
approach
to the limiting
distribution
cannot
be esti-
mated.
The very fact that
no conclusion
drawn
from
the
assumption
that I' = ~P
~ ' has as yet been contradicted
experimentally,
suggests,
however,
that at least to a
fairly high degree of approximation,
P is equal to ~f ~'
in all quantum-mechanical
systems
which
have
thus
far been investigated.
Hence, we are led in our model
to assume
that
the existing
Quctuations
are at least
rapid
enough
to insure
the approximate
maintenance
of the relation, I'= ~P~' in the very
wide variety
of
systems
which has thus far been studied.
In
connection
with
the
theory
of measurements,
however,
there
arises an important
case in which
the
rate of approach
to the equilibrium
distribution
must
be quite
slow, if the theory
as a whole
is to be con-
sistent. This is the case of two wave packets separated
by a classical order of distance,
throughout
which
the
mean density
~ P
~ s is completely
negligible.
To show
why
this case is important,
let us recall
» See reference 11; also Compt. rend. 235, 1345, 1372 (1953).

CAUSAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
QUANTUM
THEORY
2i5
briefly
some
results
of the
theory
of measurements
given in a previous paper. '
It was
shown
that
in a measurement
process,
the
interaction
between
measuring
apparatus
and observed
system
breaks the wave function
into a series of clas-
sically separated
packets, corresponding
to the various
possible
results
of
the
measurement.
The
particle,
however,
enters
one
of the
packets
and
thereafter
remains
in it. It is important
that the particle
remain
in this packet; because if it does, the other packets will
never play any physical role, so that they can thereafter
be neglected
and the complete
wave function
replaced
by a simplified
one corresponding
to the actual result
of
the
measurement.
Thus,
we
understand
how
a
measurement
can come to have a definite result, despite
the spread of the wave function
over a range of possi-
bilities.
Now, if the introduction
of a random
fluctuation
of
the f field led to an appreciable
diffusion
of the particle
from
one
of these
classically
separated
packets
to
another,
the above definiteness
of the result of a meas-
urement
would
be destroyed. It is essential
therefore
for the over-all consistency
of the theory that the prob-
ability
that
the particle
diffuse
across a large
region
where
pp(x, t) is very small shall be negligible. 'P
It is easy to see, however,
that almost any reasonable
assumptions
concerning
the Quctuations
will
lead to
this result. For the mean current
of particles
is (pv)A„.
Now
p is everywhere
of the
order
of magnitude
of
pp(x, t), which is by hypothesis
very small in the region
between
the wave packets. Thus a large probability
of
a Quctuation
that
would
carry a particle
across
this
space would mean an enormous
Quctuation
velocity in
this
region.
The
mere
assumption
that
Quctuation
velocities do not diRer by large orders of magnitude
in
different
parts
of the
Quid
is therefore
sufficient
to
insure that the probability
of diffusion across this space
be very small.
'7. CONCLUSION
The essential
result
of this paper has been to show
that
the
probability
density
P= ~ii ~'
follows
from
reasonable
assumptions
concerning
random fluctuations
of the f 6eld. Now, it has already
been demonstrated'
that
once
the
probability
distribution
P= ~f~' has,
for any reason
whatever,
been set up in a statistical
ensemble
of quantum-mechanical
systems,
then
the
results predicted
for all measurement
processes
will be
precisely
the same
in the causal
interpretation
as in
' Note that
the slowness
of this particular
type of diftusion
does not interfere
with the validity
of the relation P= ~tt )', for
the wave
function
as a whole
(i.e., over a whole
set of wave
packets). For the relation P= ~P ~' will aires, dy have been estab-
lished
by
random
fluctuations
before
the
measurement
took
place; and as we have
seen,
once established,
the relationship
persists and is not thereafter
altered by the fluctuations
no matter
what
happens.
But what
we have
been
discussing
is another
probability;
namely,
the probability
that if a particle has entered
a given packet, it will within a given time diffuse to another packet.
It is this probability
that is negliaible,
the
usual
interpretation.
The difference
between
the
two points of view, however,
is this: in the usual inter-
pretation,
the irregular
statistical
fluctuations
in the
observed
results"
obtained
in general
when
we make
very precise measurements
on individual
atomic systems
are assumed,
so to speak, to be fundamental
elements
of reality,
since it is supposed
that
they
cannot
be
analyzed
in more detail, and that they cannot be traced
to anything
else."In the model that we have proposed
here, however,
the statistical
Quctuation
in the results
of such measurements
are shown to be ascribable
con-
sistently
to an assumed
deeper level of irregular
motion
in the P field.
In this paper we have proposed
as a possible picture
of this deeper level the more specific model of a Quid,
undergoing
a random
Quctuation
of its velocity
and
density
about
certain
mean
values
determined
from
Schrodinger
s equation,
and
having
in it an inhomo-
geneity
that
follows
the local stream
velocity
of the
fluid.
Of course,
this proposal
has not yet reached
a
definitive
stage, since we have given only a very general
description
of the
assumed
Quctuations
and
of the
properties
of the inhomogeneity.
Nevertheless,
such a
model, incompletely
defined in character as it is, already
suggests a number
of interesting
questions.
For example,
the Quid may have vortex motion. In
another
paper"
it
will
be
shown
that
such
vortex
motion
provides
a very
natural
model
for the
non-
relativistic
wave equation
of a particle
with
spin (the
Pauli equation).
Work now in progress indicates
that a
generalization
of such a treatment
to relativity
may
yield a model of the Dirac equation.
Another
interesting
problem
to be studied
is the
possible
eRects of the assumption
of nonlinear
equa-
tions for the P field, which
could, as we have
seen in
Sec. 2, explain the existence of the irregular

Expansion
of Wave Packets
DANIEL S. LING, JR.
UnsoersQy of Kaissas, Laroremoe, Kansas
(Received April 16, 1954)
The Fourier coefficients of a wave packet are proved to be equal to the coefficients
obtained
when the
wave packet is expanded
in terms of a set of functions
appropriate
to a scattering
problem.
"N a recent paper discussing
the use of ingoing
waves
-
& in scattering
problems,
Breit and Bethe' made use
of the fact that
when a wave packet
is expanded
in
terms of a set of functions
appropriate
to a scattering
problem,
the expansion
coefFicients
are in most cases
identical
with
the Fourier
coe%cients
of the packet.
This note indicates a more precise proof of this theorem.
Let II (r) be a wave packet which is well localized
in
both coordinate
and momentum
space; r' and k' denote
the center of the packet in the two spaces. Ke assume
that
the
spread
of
the
packet
in
coordinate
(mo-
mentum)
space
is small
compared
with
r', (k'). Let
Pa(r) be a complete
set of wave functions
appropriate
to a scattering
problem.
As Breit and Bethe point out,
we get a complete
set of functions
if we choose lt q to
behave asymptotically
as a plane wave plus an outgoing
spherical
wave; thus
Let C(k) =B(k)—A (k), and form
J(r',k') = (2~)—
&
( C(k) i 'dk.
We assume
that f(r) is far enough
removed
from the
origin so that the asymptotic
form of f& may be used in
computing B(k). This gives
