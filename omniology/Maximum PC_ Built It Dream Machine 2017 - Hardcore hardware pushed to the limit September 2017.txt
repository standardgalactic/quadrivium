Tuan 
Nguyen
Dream machine is back, and this year 
it’s literally gargantuan outside, as 
it is on the inside. Never before has 
Dream Machine been this big at the 
micro level. Of course, I’m talking about 
cores—10 of them, in fact. Powered 
by Intel’s behemoth Core i9-7900X, 
Dream Machine 2017 is mammoth by 
pretty much all measurements. And so 
is everything else about this tower of 
ludicrous power.
The premise behind Dream Machine 
is a simple one: Put together the purest, 
most audacious computer we can, 
with no limits in mind. This means all 
components are up for consideration, 
regardless of their price. Think a high-
end system costs $5,000? Think again. 
$10,000? Weak.
Every issue we put out is a celebration 
of the PC in every aspect. From the 
hardware to the software, the platform 
is a Mecca if you want value and 
performance. You can have things your 
way, to your own specs, and on your own 
terms. So our terms were to gather the 
best and most hard-edged gear we could 
find, and put together a system that would 
be formidable in gaming, productivity, 
and daily general use.
But it wasn’t easy. Last year’s Dream 
Machine was already a hard beast to 
tame, and by any standard still rocks 
even high-end systems today. Besting 
last year’s machine came down to 
delicate choices: CPU, GPU, and storage. 
The first two are always difficult because 
AMD, Intel, and Nvidia tend to start 
talking about new products at around 
the same time our Dream Machine issue 
goes to print.
I always advise people to just get on 
with it, though. If you keep waiting for 
the next great component, it’ll never 
come. As soon as you’re ready to make 
a purchase on the part you’ve been 
waiting for, news will come out about 
the next-generation product. It’ll be a 
vicious cycle—the endless waiting game. 
Rather than waiting around, we decided 
that Dream Machine would be built on 
products you can buy today.
While I realize that Maximum PC’s 
Dream Machine is obscene, it doesn’t 
diminish your dream machine or anyone 
else’s. Everyone has different specs in 
mind for what they want their individual 
PC to be, and what makes this possible 
is the very essence of the builds we 
put together. It comes down to the 
total experience, and the joy of putting 
together a kick-ass rig for your own 
needs is irreplaceable.
Back in 2015, I built Dream Machine 
for the magazine, then that system sat on 
an empty desk for a really long time, and 
went to waste. Frustrating, I know. Zak, 
Alan—if that happens again this year, I’ll 
gladly take it off your hands!

Dream 
machine

Cryptocurrency mining rush causes worldwide shortage
Where Are All Our 
Graphics Cards?
them is well out of the reach 
of consumer hardware, even 
dedicated 
ASIC 
hardware 
struggles to do it economically. 
However, Litecoin and Ethereum 
mining is resistant to dedicated 
hardware, and it’s largely these 
that have powered the boom, 
notably in China and Japan.
Ethereum 
went 
live 
in 
2015, and rapidly became the 
second largest cryptocurrency. 
Tokens, called Ethers, jumped 
from $20 in March this year 
to $400 in early June, before 
calming down to $200 by July. 
Litecoin has seen its value triple 
in under two months. These 
lucrative returns have fueled 
the feeding frenzy.
It’s good news for graphic 
card makers, of course. Asus, 
Sapphire, and MSI have all 
built dedicated mining cards to 
exploit the fresh market, mostly 
based around the Radeon RX 
470. These cards often only 
sport a single video output, or 
even ditch them altogether. 
There are dedicated mining 
motherboards as well, notably 
the BTC-branded boards from 
ASRock. Its latest offering, the 
H110 Pro BTC+, can take 13 
graphics cards at once. 
Thinking 
of 
building 
a 
mining 
rig? 
Think 
again. 
Cryptocurrencies 
are 
very 
volatile. Fluctuations in price 
can quickly leave your mining 
machine consuming more in 
electricity 
than 
it 
returns 
in coins. There are speculation 
bubbles that can cause prices to 
halve or double in a day. 
The increasing difficulty of 
mining also acts as a natural 
brake—it soon reaches a point 
where only serious players need 
apply. Getting in early makes all 
the difference. By the time these 
booms hit the mainstream, the 
wheels have generally fallen 
off the bandwagon. Pundits 
are already declaring that 
small-scale Ethereum mining 
is “dead.” 
If all this sounds a little 
crazy, you may be right. The 
idea of making money using 
math is weird from the start. 
However, as the major financial 
institutions 
become 
more 
accepting of this new money, 
we will see much more of it. 
It has been estimated that 
worldwide Ethereum mining 
consumes 4.69 terawatt hours 
of electricity—enough to run a 
small European country. 
We’ve been here before, 
of course. At the end of 2013, 
there was a similar shortage of 
GPUs as Bitcoin mining took off. 
High-end Radeon cards will be 
back in good supply soon, and 
the market will settle down to 
normal. We can probably expect 
another spike in demand at 
some point, though, as another 
digital currency captures the 
interest of the miners. But it 
would be good if these didn’t 
interfere with the supply of our 
gaming cards…. –CL
Have you tried buying a high-
end graphics card recently? 
Almost 
everything 
above 
budget is in short supply. 
Manufacturing 
hasn’t 
been 
interrupted, but there has been 
a massive spike in sales, and 
the culprits are cryptocurrency 
miners. It is economically viable 
to use consumer hardware to 
mine 
coins 
again, 
and 
speculators have snapped up 
stocks of the best cards to do it.
Mining 
cryptocurrencies 
involves a huge amount of 
convoluted math, and GPUs 
are well suited to the task, 
the Radeon Polaris GPU in 
particular. Supplies of these 
were soon exhausted, so the 
miners turned to Nvidia Pascal-
based cards—not as effective, 
but efficient enough. Some 
high-end Pascal cards aren’t 
compatible with the mining 
software and are still to be 
had, but otherwise you’re out of 
luck. Meanwhile, there’s been a 
boom in the secondary market 
for old Radeon cards. 
Bitcoins are now relatively 
mature—their value recently 
hit $3,000 a pop, and mining 
Litecoin and Ethereum 
mining is resistant to 
dedicated hardware.
The Asus Mining P106 is 
built specifically to mine 
cryptocurrency.

Tech Triumphs and Tragedies
The spaT between Apple and Qualcomm just gets 
worse and worse. Both parties have reached for the 
legal sticks to beat each other. Apple claims that 
Qualcomm was using illegal business models in demanding royalty payments 
and a percentage of iPhone revenue in return for use of its patented technology. 
It’s suing for $1 billion in the US. It claims that some patents are invalid, and that 
Qualcomm has failed to charge fair and reasonable rates. 
Qualcomm alleges that Apple has infringed its patents, and is seeking a ban 
on certain iPhone models being imported in the country. It claims that Apple 
has deliberately checked the performance of its chips so as not to outshine 
Intel’s chips. None of this is very edifying. Lawyers will earn some hefty fees, 
while we may lose gigabit LTE speeds. Currently, only Qualcomm’s chips can 
handle these, ready for the iPhone8—Intel has chips in the pipeline, but they 
won’t be ready in time. –cl
Lawsuits start to pile up

Win 10 creAtors 
fAll updAte
microsoFT’s second win 10 updaTe of the year promises to “further power your 
creativity.” Whatever. But it does have some nice features, many aimed at cross-platform  
synchronization. Microsoft has finally accepted that we have Android and Apple phones. 
A new cloud-based clipboard makes shifting things between devices easier. Pick Up 
Where You Left Off makes sharing files across devices much easier, too, while Timeline 
enables you to go back to what you were doing, showing the apps and files you were using.
OneDrive Files On-Demand is better at using cloud files, as you can see them in Explorer, 
but nothing is downloaded until you need it. And Story Remix—a fancy slideshow that 
includes mixed reality—could be fun. Under all this will be a raft of tweaks and changes, 
plus an updated GUI called Fluent Design. Of more immediate interest is AI-powered 
malware protection, which promised intelligent threat detection and protection. –cl
Emphasis on cross-
pLatform connEctivity
a connecTicuT man’s claim that his wife 
was murdered by an intruder has been 
challenged by detectives due to his wife’s 
Fitbit. It recorded her moving about the 
house an hour after her supposed death. 
An Arkansas man’s murder of a friend 
was caught out by his Amazon Echo, which 
captured accidental recordings, and by his 
water meter, which recorded his attempts to 
wash away blood in the early hours. And an 
Ohio man’s attempted insurance fraud was 
uncovered by data on his pacemaker, which 
showed he wasn’t asleep when he claimed 
his house “accidentally” caught fire.
All recent examples of how technology 
can catch us out. As the IoT expands, we 
are being monitored and recorded on an 
unprecedented scale, our cells, watches, 
and cars all track and record. A new breed 
of detective is being born, one who sifts 
through our digital footprint for clues. Often, 
it’s not that difficult either—a surprising 
number of people research their intended 
crimes on Google, for instance, or use their 
satnav to make journeys they later deny.
In our everyday lives, we leave a 
considerable digital trail. And who owns 
that, and how much privacy over it we have, 
has yet to be clarified. Initially, Amazon 
refused to hand over data to investigators in 
the Arkansas case, claiming it was protected 
under the First Amendment. The suspect 
volunteered the data, presumably thinking 
it wouldn’t be incriminating, which avoided a 
stand-off. The law has a lot of catching up to 
do. Until then, companies such as Apple and 
Amazon will set their own policies on what 
they will hand over and to whom. 
The power and convenience of technology 
is marvelous, but as a price for that we often 
give away details of our private lives that 
we might hesitate to tell our neighbors. The 
surveillance is not being foisted upon us, we 
willingly buy it. How much of this collected 
data can be used against us is a debate to 
come. Meanwhile, detectives will be doing 
a lot more detecting from the desktop. –cl

Going Off the Grid
I remember the squeal of the modem as it connected, 
followed by ASCII art welcome screens. One popular 
BBS in my youth had an ASCII art picture that was 
about three screens’ worth of text. Let me help our 
younger readers put that into context. The C-64 
(because almost no software ran in the native C-128 
mode) used a television for its display, running a 
40x25 character text interface. 300 baud meant 
I could transfer a bit less than one line of text per 
second, so just waiting for the welcome screen could 
take a couple of minutes. But then, loading games 
off floppies—and, before that, tape drives—took 
several minutes as well, so we learned patience.
After a few years, we upgraded to a 9,600 baud 
modem. My BBS world was radically altered when I 
discovered welcome screens popped up in a matter 
of seconds! No longer did I need to think about 
whether it was worth the delay to go view a new 
screen; I could check it out, and if it didn’t catch my 
interest, I could exit and find something else to do. 
Modems picked up speed, and I eventually moved 
Let’s not mince words: I’ve been around the block, technologically 
speaking. My first “real” computer was a Commodore 128 in the mid-
80s, and I cut my teeth on MS-DOS 2.x on an IBM PC XT compatible. Our 
family got a special with the C-128, where it came with a free modem, 
capable of an astounding 300 baud. I hardly remember how we found 
out the numbers for various bulletin board systems (BBS), but there 
were hushed whispers of phone numbers in the school hallways, or at 
the weekly Dungeons & Dragons sessions.
to a 28.8k and then 56k model, 
but somewhere along the way, 
the Internet happened. Even a 56k 
connection could feel slow when 
surfing the web, especially for sites 
that included a lot of images.
When I upgraded to broadband 
DSL in 1996, capable of a whopping 
768kb/s, I couldn’t believe how 
fast everything felt. Even complex 
web pages opened in seconds, and 
“massive” 50–100MB downloads 
only 
required 
10–20 
minutes. 
(Remember, Windows 95 was only 
a couple hundred MB.) My patience 
muscles were still in great shape 
coming from dial-up, so I didn’t mind 
the wait. Twenty years later, though, 
I am no longer a patient man.
My home Internet connection is 
pretty fast, at 250Mb/s down but 
only 12Mb/s up, and multi-gigabyte 
downloads are commonplace. I 
have a dozen or so web pages open 
at once, 20 or more devices are 
connected to my network, and life is 
good. But every so often, you need 
to get away from it all and go on 
vacation. Which is where I am now.
The world has been radically 
altered by high-speed Internet 
connectivity and mobile broadband. 
I’m in the sticks, tethered to my 
smartphone, and I can pull data at 
about 1.5Mb/s. I’d have been more 
than happy with such a connection 
in the late 90s, but in 2017? Yuck! I’m 
ready to scream, waiting for just my 
standard web pages to refresh. Just 
the PCGamer.com/hardware page 
takes about 10 seconds to load, 
which isn’t too bad, but multiply that 
by 15, and it feels like going from an 
SSD back to floppy disks.
It makes me wonder: With 
100Mb/s 
and 
faster 
Internet 
connections now quite common, 
and 
the 
bleeding 
edge 
fiber 
connections 
pulling 
1–10Gb/s,  
in another 20 years will I find 
250Mb/s unacceptably slow? Will 
we all have 40–80Gb/s connections, 
available wherever we go, streaming 
augmented reality to our glasses, 
and enabling experiences we can’t 
begin to imagine? I hope so! But we 
might run into the same limitations 
we’re 
hitting 
with 
processors, 
where the rate of advancement no 
longer comes in quantum leaps, but 
in incremental steps.
Whatever happens, I’ll still need 
to drop off the grid on occasion, 
and leave my cell phone in the tent. 
Always on, always connected? Nice 
in theory, but sometimes I don’t 
want to be found. Now, pardon me, I 
have some swimming to do….

slow Internet.

As I was taking a look at the new release of Debian 
9 “Stretch” soon after its release, I began thinking 
of something beyond the OS I was testing. Sure, 
Debian’s structure is the technical basis for Ubuntu, 
but Debian represents much more. It represents 
stability and reliability in the Linux space. And being 
a vanguard of stability is great for commercial and 
industrial Linux, but is it great for desktop users?
In the years I’ve been using them, Linux OSes 
have been innovating and getting better every day. 
While Linux can do lots of things that Windows and 
Mac can’t, it’s also perpetually trying to catch up 
with things such as drivers and software availability. 
For the desktop user, that means if you want to get 
the most out of your GPU or shiny new CPU, you have 
to get the latest kernel and drivers pronto.
The thing is, those new drivers may be full of bugs. 
And some of those bugs make your system unstable. 
Few things induce more headaches than updating a 
graphics driver only to find on the next reboot that 
the X server won’t start. Or that a kernel driver 
won’t load. Or (in the case of self-compiled Nvidia 
drivers) that your driver isn’t compiled against the 
new kernel you just updated to.
These annoyances have driven me to yell, curse, 
and lose sleep as I try to figure out what’s gone 
wrong and how to fix it. Nevertheless, I still run Arch 
Linux on my personal machines to get the latest 
features as they appear. Every time I perform a full 
upgrade of the software on my system, I have to take 
it on faith that my PC will still work as intended.
That’s not what operating systems like Debian and 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux do. These OSes are geared 
for stability. Their repos generally 
don’t contain software that will 
break your system, and rigorous 
testing ensures that a system will 
keep running without issue. That’s 
important, because outside of the 
desktop, Linux is the dominant 
OS on this planet. Your smart 
thermostat, most internet servers, 
and driverless cars all use Linux. 
In each of these cases, stability and 
security are paramount. After all, 
if a driverless car segfaults while 
moving at 60mph, it can kill people. 
In comparison, having to recompile 
a video driver on a PC isn’t such a 
big deal.
If you’re looking to try Linux for 
the first time, I still recommend 
OSes like Fedora or Ubuntu. Why? 
Because they strike a good balance 
between 
stability 
and 
agility. 
Debian can feel a bit draconian 
after Ubuntu, as you may end up 
using older software than you 
would find in a comparative Ubuntu

By ExEcutivE Editor alan dexter
One of the attractions of PCs is that they come in all shapes and sizes, and you can build 
whatever system you want. Some love a full ATX system, while others only ever consider a 
compact Mini-ITX build. While there have been plenty of form factors over the years, there 
are four common ones these days: ATX, Mini-ITX, microATX, and Extended ATX (something 
of a niche). Of these, the battle generally comes down to a choice between ATX and Mini-ITX, 
but what are their benefits? Which should you use for your next build? Allow us to help.
Mini-ITX vs. ATX
Expansion
What do you really need in your PC? 
Once you’ve got your CPU, motherboard, 
memory, graphics card, PSU, and 
storage in place; what other components 
do you actually need to make it do 
what you want? The days of needing 
soundcards, network interface cards, 
SCSI boards, and various other goodies 
are long behind us (thankfully). And while 
there may be specific instances when you 
need to reach for such hardware, your 
motherboard does it all. 
The reason we’re talking about 
expansion is because it’s the main 
differentiator between the form factors. 
ATX can, in theory, squeeze up to seven 
expansion slots into its 12 x 9.6-inch 
space (realistically, E-ATX is a better 
option if you need all seven), while the 
6.7 x 6.7-inch Mini-ITX boasts a single 
slot; microATX offers a maximum of 
four, with SLI/CrossFire a possibility. 
Storage is another consideration: 
Mini-ITX boards tend to have fewer 
SATA ports, often as few as four, while 
ATX can easily hit 10. Obviously, smaller 
cases don’t have room for so many 
drives, either. So, ultimately, we have to 
give this one to the bigger form factor, 
although whether you actually need so 
much room is another matter.
Winner: 
ATX
Performance
The general perception for a long 
time was that if you wanted serious 
performance, you needed a full-sized 
motherboard and a sizeable full-tower 
case to put it in. Because, you know, size 
matters. An obvious win for the bigger 
formats, then? Not quite. The thing is, 
the world has changed, and as more 
and more silicon is squeezed into the 
CPU packaging itself, you’re losing out 
less when it comes to dropping down 
from an ATX to a Mini-ITX or microATX 
form factor. In fact, when it comes to 
the core functionality, about the only 
thing you can lose is support for SLI, 
because Mini-ITX only boasts a single  
PCIe slot.
That consideration aside, most Mini-
ITX motherboards boast feature sets that 
are comparable to their ATX siblings, 
and when it comes to raw performance, 
there’s pretty much nothing you can 
do in a larger case that you can’t do 
in a well-designed compact chassis. 
Planning on water-cooling your CPU? 
Plenty of the cases we look at in these 
pages support 240mm radiators, and 
we always consider them in that light, 
so you’ll be able to overclock your CPUs 
just as much as you can in a larger case.
Tie: 
Mini-ITX, ATX,  
microATX, Extended ATX
Compactness
Your choice of motherboard doesn’t 
necessarily 
have 
to 
dictate 
your 
chassis. If you want to slot a microATX 
motherboard into a full ATX case, 
you can. It’s the same story for Mini-
ITX mobos as well, because the four 
mounting screws are compatible with 
all modern cases (older cases may not 
be compatible, though, so that’s worth 
bearing in mind). Obviously, you can’t 
ease an ATX motherboard into a case 
designed for Mini-ITX, unless it happens 
to be a Tardis, but generally you have 
plenty of options for how you marry up 
case and motherboard.
The point is: You can still build a 
huge-ass system even if you decide to 
go down the Mini-ITX route, but with 
the advantage that you can actually 
build a much smaller machine, should 
that be a requirement. And space can 
often be a defining factor for new builds, 
particularly if you want the final machine 
to sit on the top of your desk, rather 
than be hidden underneath it. A compact 
build, with a dash of water cooling, 
can make for a beautiful thing—an 
important factor for more and more of 
us nowadays. Which means that if space 
is a factor, then it’s hard to go too wrong 
with Mini-ITX. 
Winner: 
Mini-ITX

Availability
Not only do you have the most options 
when looking at ATX motherboards, 
but new platforms are developed with 
ATX in mind. It’s where most of the 
market is, so it makes sense to ensure 
that’s working first. Other options, 
such as microATX and Mini-ITX, come 
later. That’s been fine for years, as 
motherboard manufacturers have had 
plenty of lead time to get these niche 
platforms sorted, meaning there hasn’t 
been much delay in getting your hands 
on a tiny motherboard. However, since 
Ryzen launched, there have been scant 
Mini-ITX motherboards for us to get 
hold of, and the options for the new 
X299 platform aren’t much better—
we’re aware of a single X299 Mini-ITX 
board, the X299E-ITX/AC, which has to 
work some pretty impressive technical 
wonders in order to squeeze such a 
massive socket on to such a small board 
(like using SO-DIMMs). 
The same is true for cases—smaller 
form factor chassis occupy a niche in the 
market. Which all adds up to a reduced 
selection for anything smaller than an 
ATX motherboard in a tower case. It’s 
generally worth shopping around to get 
the platform and form factor you want, 
but your options will be more limited.
Winner:
ATX
Ease of Build
While we’re big fans of compact Mini-
ITX builds, there’s no getting away from 
the fact that they don’t always play nice. 
Confined spaces can lead to scrapes 
and cuts, but it’s actually the frustration 
that comes from working in such a tight 
space that really grinds our gears. You 
can do it, and the resultant machines 
can make the effort pay off, but be 
prepared to spend much, much longer 
getting everything just right than with an 
ATX system. A tip on this front would be 
to connect and build as much as possible 
outside of the case before sliding your 
motherboard into place.
Conversely, building inside a large 
chassis is a pretty straightforward 
endeavor, with plenty of room for 
routing cables, space to easily reach 
components, 
and 
sufficient 
airflow 
without having to make sure every 
cable is tied down. You’ll find you have 
more options when it comes to placing 
your components as well, whereas in 
a smaller chassis you tend to find that 
there’s only one place that your hard 
drive can go, or your all-in-one radiator 
can be placed. Adding more components 
to a bigger chassis is also much easier. 
So, it’s a relatively easy win for the 
bigger form factor in this round.
Winner:
ATX
We build plenty of machines here on 
Maximum PC: at least one an issue, and 
usually several more. The majority of 
these machines are ATX rigs, although 
over the past year we’ve dabbled with 
Mini-ITX a few times, while the Dream 
Machine tends to go on the bigger side 
of things. In other words, we have 
plenty of experience of building across 
various platforms and form factors.
Do we have a preference? We do 
have a fondness for smaller systems, 
as they look awesome when built 
properly, although we make no bones 
about the fact that they’re not always 
the easiest systems to put together. 
Throw in some water cooling, and 
you end up with a machine that looks 
amazing on your desk, as opposed to 
something you want to hide under it.
These thoughts are reflected in 
this head to head: ATX is easier to 
build with, more readily available, and 
offers more options for expansions 
and upgrades. Mini-ITX and microATX 
produce more compact systems, that 
perform just as well as their bigger 
cousins, and generally don’t limit what 
you can do. It’s good to have options. 
And the
Winner Is…
ROUND 4
ROUND 5
ASRock’s X99 E-ITX/AC  
Mini-ITX mobo compares  
well to the ATX Z97 Extreme6, 
also from ASRock.

THIS MONTH THE DOCTOR TACKLES...

> Processor Pairs
> 4K Foray
> Ryzen Hopes
Doubling Up
Hi Doc, I recently found out 
that you can have two CPUs 
instead of one. However, 
I don’t really understand 
why you’d need a pair of 
processors. Is it for Bitcoin 
mining? Gaming? Can you 
please explain what a dual-
CPU configuration would be 
good for? 
–Nikita Plutenko
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Today’s desktop CPUs include 
anything from two to 10 cores. 
Technologies such as Hyper-
Threading double the number 
of processes that each of 
those cores can schedule, 
allowing a lot of computation 
to happen in parallel. Adding 
cores/threads helps maintain 
a smooth experience when you 
have many programs running 
concurrently—otherwise 
known as multitasking. Or, 
it improves performance 
in individual applications 
optimized to exploit host 
processing resources.
Now, let’s say part of your 
job involves transcoding 
video, consolidating servers 
via virtualization, or running 
scientific computing workloads 
requiring tons of RAM. Each 
of those tasks is notorious for 
taxing high-end hardware. A 
mainstream Core i7 or Ryzen-
based platform might limit 
their performance, costing 
time and money. Stepping up 
to a multi-socket motherboard 
makes it possible to drop 
in a second (or more) CPU, 
multiplying core count, I/O, 
and memory support, ideally 
alleviating your bottleneck. 
Although these sophisticated 
systems command a significant 
up-front investment, they 
often pay for themselves by 
accelerating workloads that 
generate revenue.
While it’s certainly possible 
to mine Bitcoins (or Litecoins, 
or Ethereum) using a CPU, 
that’s not very efficient. 
Bitcoin mining is dominated 
by purpose-built ASICs, while 
other popular altcoins are 
mined more effectively using 
highly parallel GPUs, rather 
than CPUs. So, it doesn’t really 
make sense to spend big on a 
dual-processor workstation for 
cryptocurrency work.
Similarly, games benefit 
most from a fast graphics 
card. Many titles are written to 
utilize four or more CPU cores, 
but don’t scale much further. 
You have little reason to buy 
an eight or 10-core processor 
explicitly for gaming, much less 
a PC with two of them.
Partition Control
Dear Doc, In the June issue, 
you talked Joel Vignere 
through expanding his 
reserved partition. But you 
neglected to mention that 
the new unallocated space 
behind the C: partition needs 
to be moved and located 
behind the reserved partition. 
The reserved partition won’t 
expand until this is done. 
Although this seems petty, 
a novice reader might get 
frustrated and use nasty 
adjectives to describe the 
Doc’s advice.
 
–Max Canestraro
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Thank 
you for the follow-up, Max. As 
a refresher, the Doc suggested 
that Joel use MiniTool Partition 
Wizard Free to first shrink his 
OS partition, and then extend 
his system reserved partition, 
creating enough room for 
Windows to finish updating.
If Joel followed the Doc’s 
advice and ran the tool’s Move/
Resize Partition function, he 
saw three text boxes under Size 
and Location: “Unallocated 
Space Before,” “Partition 
Size,” and “Unallocated Space 
After.” Dragging the partition’s 
handle in on the left made the 
“Unallocated Space Before” 
field grow, circumventing the 
issue you describe. Dragging 
it from the right created more 
“Unallocated Space After” 
(after the C: partition, that 
is). Either way, you end up 
with a chunk of storage space 
labeled “Unallocated.”
He was then able to run 
Extend Partition to grow his 
system reserved partition. 
Directing that feature to take 
free space from the unallocated 
MiniTool Partition Wizard Free’s Extend Partition tool moves 
unallocated space automatically.

capacity does perform the 
move operation you mention, if 
necessary, so there should be 
no need for nasty adjectives.
4K for Non-Gamers
Hi Doc, I’d like some advice on 
buying a graphics card for a 
4K monitor. I consider myself 
a technologist, a gadgeteer, an 
overall computer enthusiast, 
and a long-time reader of 
Maximum PC. But not a gamer.
There are plenty of articles 
about graphics cards and 
4K monitors, but they’re all 
gaming-focused. What about 
those who don’t play games? 
While I’m not necessarily 
on a budget, I don’t want to 
overspend just because I’m 
unsure which card has enough 
power for the tasks I do run. 
Besides standard productivity 
apps, I’ll be editing photos, 
doing some light 4K video 
editing, and watching movies.
If you’re wondering why I’m 
interested in 4K, there are a 
few reasons. To be honest, 
the high resolution just seems 
fun and cool, and I’d like to be 
able to enjoy the technology (I 
mentioned I’m an enthusiast, 
right?). Second, I need more 
screen space than 1080p 
affords. I’ve read reviews that 
say a 4K monitor is better than 
two lower-resolution ones, but 
I’d be interested to hear your 
first-hand experience. Third, 
high DPI has me salivating.
Oh, and are there any 
features like G-Sync that 
I can forgo to save some 
extra money? –Joey Lazzara
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Games 
aren’t the only applications that 
benefit from a fast graphics 
card. Adobe Premiere Pro CC 
(2017), for example, accelerates 
certain effects through CUDA 
(in the case of Nvidia GPUs) 
and OpenCL (for AMD and Intel 
engines). Similarly, Photoshop 
includes a number of features 
that are offloaded to the GPU 
through OpenGL or OpenCL. 
So, you’ll have to decide how 
important performance is in 
non-gaming workloads that still 
utilize GPU resources.
As for watching movies, even 
low-end cards include fixed-
function hardware dedicated to 
handling media playback. But 
do note that if you’re looking to 
go bleeding-edge with Ultra HD 
Blu-ray, DRM will likely dictate 
your build’s composition: 
Windows 10, a seventh-gen 
Core CPU, HD Graphics 630 
or better, a motherboard 
with Intel Software Guard 
Extensions support, an HDCP 
2.2-compatible display, and 
an Ultra HD Blu-ray playback-
capable optical drive are all 
required, in addition to playback 
software such as CyberLink’s 
PowerDVD 17.
With those requirements in 
mind, the ultimate approach to 
saving money would be to buy a 
Core i5 or Core i7 CPU with HD 
Graphics 630 built-in, snag a 
compatible motherboard, such 
as Gigabyte’s Z270X-Gaming 9, 
and connect an HDCP 2.2- 
equipped 4K monitor.
As for the Doc, he prefers 
the compartmentalization 
possible on three QHD displays 
for productivity tasks over one 
4K screen.
GPU Upgrade Time
Hey, Doc. After occasionally 
buying Maximum PC at the 
store, I decided to subscribe 
recently. I have a question 
about upgrading my PC: Right 
now, I own an old Dell OptiPlex 
780, and was told that the best 
graphics card I can get for it is 
a low-profile GeForce GT 1030. 
I want to know your opinion of 
that board. Can it hit 60fps? Is 
it worth buying? 
–Tyrone
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: There 
are several versions of the 
OptiPlex 780. You were probably 
told that a low-profile GeForce 
GT 1030 is the best card you 
can get due to its size, meaning 
you own the desktop or small 
form factor configuration, with 
limited room for an upgrade.
Depending on the games you 
play, it is possible to average 
60fps or more with Nvidia’s 
entry-level Pascal-based 
board. Dial the details down 
in WoW, and you’ll see more 
than 100fps at 1920x1080. 
Mainstream titles such as 
Dota 2 and StarCraft II leave 
plenty of room for fluid frame 
rates on GT 1030 at FHD, too. 
Newer games may require 
stepping down to 1280x720 for 
playable performance.
All of that assumes a fairly 
modern test platform, though. 
Your Dell OptiPlex 780 sports 
a Core 2 Quad CPU, at best, 
and may only have 2GB or 
4GB of DDR3 memory. Rather 
than spending $70 to get a 
little more life out of that old 
desktop, consider saving up 
for a better-balanced setup. 
Complementing a new graphics 
card with a current-gen 
CPU and solid-state storage 
will grant you a much more 
enjoyable experience.
Is Ryzen Viable?
Hi Doc, A couple of years ago, 
I decided to move away from 
Win XP and adopted Win 7; 
I like it a lot. I did try Win 10 
during the preview, but I’m 81, 
and it’s just not for me. I don’t 
play games, but I do work with 
videos, and also enjoy fast 
response times.
Now I’m finding that my 
current rig won’t work with the 
latest M.2-based NVMe SSDs. 
I originally planned to buy a 
new PCIe adapter. However, 
while it may work with my 
existing setup, I suspect it 
won’t improve performance 
due to a motherboard-
imposed bottleneck.
After reading Maximum 
PC’s take on the new AMD 
Ryzen CPU, I’m thinking of 
buying one, or waiting until the 
release of Threadripper. I’d 
like your opinion on whether 
it’s worth holding off for, or if I 
should buy one of the existing 
Ryzen chips. Right now, 
I’m looking at the MSI X370 
Gaming Pro motherboard and 
a new DDR4 memory kit. I 
assume all of that would work 
with either Ryzen 5 or 7, right?
If I wait, how much more 
would I be spending compared 
to Threadripper’s potential 
performance increase? With 
Intel already starting a price 
war with its new Core i7/i9 
models, it looks like Black 
Friday is coming early.
Oh, one more thing: My GPU 
has DDR3 memory. Will it still 
work on the new machine? My 
current rig consists of an FX-
8350 on Asus’s M5A99FX Pro 
R2.0, 16GB of DDR3-1866, two 
240GB Intel SSD 530 drives, 
two 1TB Caviar Black HDDs, 
and a Radeon R7 240, all under 
Windows 7 64-bit.
 
–Howard VanDover
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
At the time of writing, not 
enough is known about AMD’s 
forthcoming Threadripper 
for the Doc to guide your path 
confidently, Mr VanDover. The 
16-core/32-thread CPU will 
require a new motherboard, 
and it’ll no doubt be quite a 
bit more expensive than any 
existing Ryzen 5 or 7 processor. 
Plus, you’ll need a quad-
channel DDR4 memory kit to 
fully exploit its architecture.
Regardless of the chip’s final 
specs, your utilization of such a 
complex piece of hardware will 
depend wholly on the tasks you 
perform and whether they’re 
bottlenecked by, say, an eight-
core Ryzen 7, or its 16 lanes of 
PCIe 3.0 connectivity.
The Doc can tell you that 
Ryzen 5 and 7 look a lot better 
now than they did at launch. 
Constant firmware updates 
and software optimizations 
smoothed out many of the 
platform’s initial quirks. Oh, and 
AMD does support Windows 7 
through its chipset drivers. A 
Ryzen-based PC will yield a 
significant speed-up compared 
to your current FX-8350 setup.
As for your graphics card, 
yes, AMD’s Radeon R7 240 
will work on an X370-based 
motherboard. Just don’t expect 
much contribution from it if 
you’re using GPU acceleration 
in your video editing projects.
Firmware improvements from 
partners like MSI make AMD’s 
Ryzen platform compelling.

Dream 
machine 
2017
In the mIdst of chaos, there is also opportunity. In the 
convoluted world of transistors and nanometers, battles 
are being fought, as Intel and AMD vie for your hard-earned 
cash. The core count is rising, and we’re currently seeing 
the landscape change at an incomprehensible rate. Soon, 
16- and 18-core parts will become the weapons of choice for 
anyone looking to build such a ludicrously bank-breaking 
system as this.
For now, though, the heady heights of 32 threads are 
nothing more than a fevered dream, hidden from consumers 
until their grand masters see fit to release them upon the 
computational world. But Dream Machine doth wait for no 
man. It’s the culmination of a year’s worth of technological 
development, and the machine we build now, one of the 
most powerful and intricate of its kind, would look very 
different if we were to build it in even six months’ time. It is 
an exercise in hubris, neither adhering to any budget, nor 
any perceived spec—it is the best of the best of what we 
have available today.
Dream Machine is a concept, not something that should 
ever really be attempted. It is, by its very nature, an 
unreasonable machine, beyond any recommendations. So, 
when no holds are barred, what can you do with the latest 
and greatest hardware out there? That’s what we’re here to 
find out—to build, in-house, one incredible system, at one 
incredible price. –maXImUm Pc staff

as we’ve allUded to already, speccing out Dream Machine 2017 was a challenge. 
The processing world is in a state of extreme flux right now, with both Intel and AMD 
providing fantastic solutions for anyone looking to build beyond a quad-core system. And 
let’s go on the record: If AMD’s Threadripper were available today, with all of its 16 cores, 
we would have used that (believe us—we almost had it, but, unfortunately, AMD wouldn’t 
budge its shipping deadline by a week), and if Intel’s $2,000-plus Core i9-7980XE were 
around, that would have been on the cards, too. However, deadlines are a kicker, and you 
could wait around forever for the next big thing.
1  
CPU ConUndrUms
We went through three iterations 
of tubing runs before settling on 
two bow loops. The distance between the 
memory fitting on the left of the CPU and the 
one on the right is about half an inch, so we 
couldn’t use one as a template, and instead 
had to bend both loops by hand, using two 
different cylindrical objects—in this case, 
our deburrer and an unused reservoir. 
2  
CUstom Cables
These cables turned out great, and 
definitely add some pizzazz. Our one 
regret? Not opting for longer cables. The 
Elite is ridiculously big; the 24-pin was fine, 
but the two eight-pins at the top nearly didn’t 
make it. If it weren’t for some clever routing 
and Phanteks’s eight-pin EPS extensions, 
we wouldn’t have made deadline.
3  
Pass-throUgh PerfeCtion
One of the main reasons we wanted 
to use the Enthoo Elite was the 
compartmentalized design. Combining it 
with pass-through fittings keeps the top 
aesthetic exceptionally clean, and allows 
us to hide the majority of our more complex 
tubing runs out of sight between the two 
loops, and behind the back of the case. 
4  
reservoir ridiCUloUsness
These plates are genius. Designed 
to hide SSD/HDD mounting points, 
you can remove or keep them, depending 
on what you plan to install. If you want to 
install a res, remove one of the brackets, 
and choose whichever fittings you want. We 
drilled straight through the aluminum plate 
to install our two reservoirs, to keep the 
aesthetic clean and fit more than one loop.
5  
hard drive high jinks
“But Maximum PC? Where are 
the two 10TB hard drives?” Good 
question. We actually took them out of this 
shot, so you could see the complexity of 
the tubing runs, leading into the back of the 
chassis. However, the hard drives fit here 
snugly, under the tubes and slightly above 
the fans/radiator, on included brackets. You 
can just about spot the mounting hooks.

When it came to choosing a motherboard, 
we had a few criteria in mind. We needed 
a board that could overclock like a champ, 
with a clean-looking black aesthetic, 
and have the potential to support up to 
three PCIe M.2 drives, without any ugly 
protrusions jutting out from the PCB.
The last part was our main concern. We 
wanted two 512GB Samsung 960 Pros in 
RAID 0 for our OS, and a 2TB model for 
anything else we could think of. Coupled 
with two old-school 10TB HDDs, plus 
two 2TB Samsung 850 Pros for even 
more storage, and connectivity is 
hugely important. 
That left us with one 
winner: the Gigabyte Aorus 
X299 Gaming 9, a mammoth 
of a board to fit inside our equally 
gargantuan case. It’s one of the only 
mobos to support more than two PCIe 
SSDs on the board itself, second only to the 
Gaming 7, which lacks the heatsinks. Plus, 
its onboard audio is exceptional, it features 
dual eight-pin EPS power for smoother 
voltage application during overclocks, and 
five PCIe x16 lanes, in theory enabling us to 
run three-way SLI in x8x16x8 configuration.

The name of the game this time is 10 cores 
and 20 threads. Intel’s latest Skylake X parts 
are some of the gnarliest we’ve seen. With 
a reimagined smart-cache superstructure 
and a top-end turbo of 4.3GHz, the Core i9-
7900X is a single-core IPC-demolishing and 
multi-core rendering powerhouse. 
This is also Intel’s first use of its 
Turbo 3.0 tech. Similar to AMD’s XFR 
smart overclocking, in applications that 
aggressively use fewer than four threads, 
the Core i9-7900X allocates the process 
to its “best” cores, and boosts their clock 
speeds up to 4.5GHz. Anything capable of 
maxing out more than four brings the entire 
chip back to the 4.3GHz standard Max Turbo.
Compared to last year, we’ve also seen 
improvements to the number of PCIe 
Processor
intel Core i9-7900X
lanes (from 40 to 44), an increase in DDR4 
memory support, and the DMI (direct 
media interface between the processor and 
chipset) improve from 4x PCIe 2.0 lanes to 
4x PCIe 3.0, to alleviate any bottlenecks.
The Core i9’s true potential, however, 
lies in its overclocking capability. It’s an 
intriguingly mixed bag. And, for once, 
we’re not limited by silicon instability, 
but by thermals. There’s no denying the 
i9-7900X is one hell of a hot chip. Even 
with a 240mm AIO cooling the 10-cored 
behemoth, overclocking even to 4.5GHz can 
lead to thermal throttling hitting that TJMax 
of 100 C. That said, if you can circumvent 
the cooling conundrums with a sound 
liquid-cooled setup, it’s not impossible to 
see 4.8GHz or 4.9GHz—potentially even 
5.0GHz—on this powerhouse of a chip, 
pushing Cinebench R15 scores all the way 
up to 2,600-plus, and smashing CPU-heavy 
rendering times into the dirt.

12 Tflops of pure force, 3,840 CUDA cores, 
12GB of GDDR5X, and the full might of 
Pascal’s GP102 core. Multiply that by two, 
and what you’re left with is $2,400-worth of 
pure graphical power. 
Pascal was nothing short of a master 
stroke by Nvidia, making the impressive 
Maxwell architecture look like a toddler’s 
plaything in comparison. Designed to put 
AMD’s Vega on the back foot, we doubt even 
Nvidia expected what was about to occur. 
As AMD vacated the upper echelons of 
performance GPU computing, Nvidia was 
left unchallenged. Fast-forward a year 
and the Titan X (Pascal) of that generation 
was trumped by Nvidia’s own GTX 1080 Ti, 
matching it spec for spec, sans one extra GB 
of GDDR5X. The solution to derailing its own 
flagship? Unleashing the full might of the 
GP102 core on to the world.
Featuring an additional 256 CUDA cores, 
16 more texture units, and an impressive 
boost to core and memory clocks, the true 
Titan Xp arrived to sink its teeth into that 
upper ecosphere once again. A true 4K 
gaming card—but at a cost.

asus pG27uQ
The PG27UQ here is one of only two 
prototypes in existence. We called in some 
major favors with Asus to get this for Dream 
Machine 2017—and, boy, is it impressive! 
Although likely not available until the end 
of the year, Asus has told us it should cost 
around $2,500. Yeah, that’s ominous.
It’s hard to deny how incredible it is. 
Asus has always been at the bleeding 
edge of monitor development, and this is 
no exception. The PG27UQ is a 27-inch 4K 
IPS (in-plane switching) panel, capable 
of a 144Hz refresh rate, a 4ms G2G pixel 
response time, with HDR, quantum dot, and 
G-Sync tech included as well.
We’ve seen screens push beyond the 
bandwidth limits of 60fps 4K, but most 
operate with multiple DisplayPort cables, 
and often not that well. With the PG27UQ, 
Asus has taken advantage of the new 
DisplayPort 1.4 standard included in 
RX 400 series and GTX 10 series cards 
and above. Although overall bandwidth 
hasn’t increased since DP 1.3, it does 
feature Display Stream Compression 1.2, 
allowing visually lossless encoding with a 
compression ratio of 3:1 versus DisplayPort 
1.3’s 2:1. This means DisplayPort 1.4 can 
support 8K at 60Hz, and more importantly 
for us, 4K at 144Hz, with HDR enabled.

Memory hasn’t changed a huge 
deal since our last venture into 
the heady heights of Dream 
Machine stardom—maximum 
capacity remains the same at 
128GB, and the only thing that 
really has seen any increase 
is frequency, which now caps 
out at around 4,266MT/s. That 
said, at that speed, you cut 
For our OS storage, we knew 
we wanted something a little 
faster than your standard M.2 
PCIe SSD, and right now, the 
only way to achieve that is by 
RAIDing two, already powerful, 
PCIe drives. Although, with 
X299, you can invest in Intel’s 
on-processor RAID technology 
for a fee, it is, unfortunately, 
locked to its 600p drives, which, 
to be frank, pale in comparison 
to the likes of Samsung’s 960 
Pros. The chipset, however, 
still supports RAID 0, 1, 5, and 
10, so the solution was simple: 
your maximum capacity in 
half, and as massive advocates 
of capacity over speed, we 
simply can’t warrant it over 
the alternative.
That said, we did want to 
do something different, so 
this time around we decided 
to put all eight DIMMs on ice, 
stripping them of their stock 
heatsinks, and liquid-cooling 
the lot of them. We’ve always 
loved Crucial’s memory kits for 
their stability, availability, and 
performance, so we requested 
in a not-so-subtle 128GB (8x 
16GB) of its Ballistix Elites, 
running at 3,200MT/s, with a 
CAS latency of 16. It does feel 
something of a shame to strip 
two 512GB Samsung 960 Pros 
in RAID 0 for the OS. On top 
of that, we can provide an 
additional 2TB of standard PCIe 
storage for any other programs 
or games we want. 
For 
media 
storage, 
we 
decided to up the ante a little 
more, and opted for two, now 
almost ancient, 2TB Samsung 
850 Pro 2.5-inch SSDs. We’ve 
set these up in RAID 0 again, 
to capitalize on that additional 
speed, and will be backing up 
all 7TB of storage on to our 
10TB mirrored HDD array. 
these kits down, because the 
powder-coated finish on the 
heatsinks is one of the nicest 
we’ve seen, but the aesthetic 
finish and extra pep that liquid 
cooling your memory adds to 
a water-cooled loop is hard to 
deny, especially when you’re 
chilling two banks of the

could only use two, because 
any more would impact on 
our liquid-cooling plans. And 
there’s a certain noise element 
we’re trying to avoid. Relegating 
these disks to backup drives, 
however, does neutralize the 
noise 
somewhat 
as, 
using 
incremental backups, these 
should only be operating for a 
small part of the day or week.

The Enthoo Elite is undoubtedly the king of all full-
tower cases. Coming in at a staggering $900, this 
compartmentalized leviathan has the potential 
to support both an ITX and an XL-ATX system 
simultaneously. Combine that with its class-
leading liquid-cooling support and exceptionally 
premium build materials, and there’s simply no 
argument about why we chose this case.
The Elite comes in its own flight case to protect 
its massive 66lb bulk (when empty). It has two sets 
of accessory kits, and supports up to 20x 120mm 
fans, or 17x 140mm fans (with five included). 
Phanteks hasn’t spared any expense with build 
materials, either, utilizing 4mm anodized sand-
blasted curved aluminum, a powder-coated steel 
chassis inside, and 4mm tempered glass with 
mesh ventilation baked in. The list of features is 
almost endless, and the Enthoo Elite even comes 
with a five-year warranty.
The choice of PSU this time around was an easy 
one to make: We went straight for Corsair’s 
HX1200i. After using the 1,000W variant last year, 
and appreciating just how quiet it is with its 0dB fan 
tech, plus the fantastic Platinum energy efficiency 
rating, there really was no other choice.
We also went all-out this year and got in touch 
with CableMod to hook us up with some bespoke 
nylon-sleeved PSU cables. They’re certainly not 
cheap, coming in at $311 for the lot, but the quality 
is exceptional, and with CableMod’s cable combs, 
they really add some extra pop to your build. If 
you’re after your own set of bespoke cables, head 
over to CableMod’s store, select the configurator, 
then choose your model of PSU, add the cables you 
want, the material you’d like to use, and the color 
and length of the cables you need, and just add 
them to your cart. Simple.
Peripherals are a very personal thing. With 
multiple types of grip, and different hand 
sizes, use cases, and tastes in style, there’s 
never going to be one perfect mouse for 
everyone. For instance, if you wanted a 
super-clean workstation, you might take 
advantage of a wireless implement—
perhaps Logitech’s MX Master. A true 
FPS gamer? BenQ Zowie’s FK1 could 
be the ideal choice. Just want a solid 
mouse? Microsoft’s Intellimouse is still 
kicking about on the world wide web.
For this Dream Machine builder, though, 
it’s all about a clean, soft-touch finish, 
simple, sophisticated RGB lighting, and 
an ergonomic palm grip. All of that comes 
together in Mionix’s Castor gaming mouse. 
And, ironically for Dream Machine, it’s 
impressively affordable, with a pretty sweet 
PixArt optical sensor, too.

When we were first introduced to Logitech’s 
Romer-G key switch, we weren’t entirely 
sold on it. Being die-hard Cherry fans, it’s 
difficult to lean away from the brand as a 
switch archetype. After all, the company 
is very well established, with a history of 
developing switches all the way back to the 
1950s. However, Logitech’s Romer-G has, 
over time, grown on us, and when combined 
with the absolutely fantastic aesthetic 
For this year’s audio solution, we’ve 
decided to separate the headphones and 
microphone into two separate components. 
Audio quality is crucial, and a good set of 
cans helps to immerse you in your music, 
media, and games. One of our favorite 
pairs of headphones is the beautifully crisp 
Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro. With 45mm 
Tesla neodymium drivers, an impedance 
of 250 ohms, and a frequency response of 
5–40,000Hz, it provides the most perfect 
reference sound imaginable, with enough 
There’s nothing like having a premium 
gaming chair to plant your posterior on 
after a long day in the office. Noblechairs 
offers the high end of excess when it comes 
to gaming chairs, with models ranging from 
$300 to $650. Depending on your budget, 
you can net yourself an exceptional genuine 
or faux leather buttocks-hugger. We’ve 
tested a fair few fancy gaming stools, and 
Noblechairs has always come out on top for 
both quality and comfort. 
Admittedly, it is hard to justify a bucket 
seat for an office environment, but 
Noblechairs’ seats don’t look anywhere 
near as garish as those of some of its 
competitors, and the new ICON series, yet 
to be released, capitalizes more on the 
office style ethos. For our Dream Machine, 
we’ve opted for this stunning white faux 
leather EPIC. Newly released, it’s classy, 
comfortable, and fits right in with our desk 
setup this year.
punch in the bass and crisp, clear 
trebles to make any HRA pumped

For our dedicated microphone, 
we’ve gone for the Razer Seiren 
Pro. Arguably Razer’s best and most 
premium product, the three-cardioid-
pickup design lends itself to a multitude 
of recording modes, looks great, and can be 
mounted on to the RODE PSA1 Boom Arm. 
Couple that with XLR output and a pop filter, 
and it’s damn near perfect.
found on the G413 Carbon, it’s hard to argue 
against it.
There’s something about a crisp, brushed 
aluminum chassis that speaks to us. It’s an 
aesthetic that leans away from the “I game, 
therefore it needs to be pointy” styling of 
other brands, and toward professionals who 
appreciate a good switch. It serves multiple 
purposes, and multiple types of people, and 
that’s what, to us, defines a good product.

conclusion
Of Dreams, Nightmares, 
aND a whOle lOt Of 
DOwNright harD wOrk
Summing up the concept of Dream Machine 
in a single sentence is difficult. It’s a labor 
of love for those who work on it, often taking 
months to source the parts, plan the build, 
and finally construct the beast. But, in a 
lot of ways, it’s impractical, implausible, 
and excessive in its ambition. We’d never, 
ever recommend you buy or build a system 
quite like it, because it’s just not a feasible 
investment. That said, DM is a fantastic 
insight into what the very best of today’s 
hardware can achieve.
Over the past few years, we’ve looked 
ever deeper into liquid cooling as an avenue 
of thermal venting for these monster 
machines, because it offers multiple 
benefits. Whether it’s a reduction in noise, 
lower thermals, or higher overclocks, 
liquid cooling to this degree, for those 
who have the cash and the patience, is a 
no-brainer. On top of that, in the office, 
we collectively feel that Dream Machine 
should be a challenge.
But performance is the kingpin that 
holds this concept together, and all the 
cooling in the world does little if you’re 
running a Pentium processor and an 
Nvidia GT 720. Luckily for us, then, Dream 
Machine 2017 comes rammed with the best 
hardware around. 
Unsurprisingly, it demolished everything 
we threw at it. Whether that was processor 
or GPU-bound benchmarks, it destroyed 
our zero-point entirely—in some cases by 
nearly 500 percent.
It did lose out in a few areas, though. 
Our PCIe SSD M.2 RAID 0 array was 
excruciatingly 
lackluster, 
presumedly 
because we’d saturated the DMI between 
the chipset and the processor with those 
GPUs and three PCIe M.2 SSDs. And single-
core performance is still lacking compared 
to its high IPC Skylake competition.
As far as cooling goes, Intel is still 
scrimping 
on 
the 
thermal 
interface 
material between the processor die and the 
heat-spreader, unfortunately. With 1.25V, 
you can see temps spike up to 80-90 C (still 
lower than a 240mm AIO), but as soon as 
the load drops, it’s almost instantaneously 
back to idle temps. 
Overall, though, Dream Machine 2017 is 
one burly beast of destruction, filled to the 
brim with the best the world has to offer, 
and we’re exceptionally proud of it.

Rethink how you use Windows 10 
to speed things up. By Nick Peers
 Optimize

windOws
W
e all want our PCs to run faster, but that doesn’t 
simply involve fitting a new processor, doubling 
the amount of RAM, or tweaking system settings 
in an effort to boost Windows’ raw speed. It also involves 
reappraising the way you use your PC, finding new shortcuts, 
and basically forcing yourself to work in a more efficient 
way. There are dozens of hidden tips and shortcuts that can 
revolutionize the way you interact with both Windows and 
your favorite programs, saving you a huge amount of time in 
a relatively short period.
How much time can you save? Taken in isolation, 
each tip we reveal will probably shave a few 
seconds off here and there, but when you start 
using them regularly, things soon start to 
add up. Imagine: One tip that saves 
you five seconds, used 12 times 
a day, will save you a single 
minute, but over the course 
of a year, that adds up 
to six hours—from 
one tip. That means you don’t have to apply that many of our 
recommended keyboard shortcuts and tweaks before your 
annual savings stretch into days and even weeks, simply by 
familiarizing yourself with the content of this feature.
We focused primarily on Windows 10 here, although many 
of the tweaks and tips also work with Windows 7 and 8.1. We 
optimize the way you use the desktop, Start menu (and its 
hidden little brother, the Quick Access menu), and Taskbar, 
plus reveal which Settings tweaks can streamline the way 
you work.
We also take you on a tour of timesaving keyboard 
shortcuts, investigate ways of using the right-click menu 
more efficiently, and unlock ways to search faster using 
File Explorer. There’s even time to look at creating your own 
custom Jump List commands, reacquaint yourself with the 
Run dialog box, and speed up the way you use Microsoft Office 
(along with other apps).
With all that time waiting to be saved, don’t delay—start 
implementing these tips now, and discover how to make your 
Windows PC even more productive.

L
et’s begin our efficiency drive by 
streamlining 
your 
desktop 
and 
making things more accessible. 
If you’re not already doing so, start by 
placing shortcuts to your favorite apps on 
the Taskbar. This puts them a single click 
away—if you need to open a second instance 
of a program alongside the first, simply hold 
the Shift key as you click on the Taskbar icon 
to do so.
The simplest way to do this is to open 
the app in question—you’ll see its icon 
appear in the Taskbar, so just right-click 
it, and choose “Pin to taskbar,” then drag it 
into place. You might, for example, want to 
group related apps together, so office apps 
in one part, web apps in another, and so on.
Another advantage to running apps from 
the Taskbar is that many use Jump Lists 
to give you two-click access to recently 
opened docs—right-click the Taskbar icon 
to access them all. To permanently attach 
an item to this list, roll your mouse over it, 
then click the pin button that appears.
If you run out of space for items on the 
Taskbar, you could create a folder inside 
which you place all your shortcuts, then 
right-click the Taskbar and choose “New 
> Toolbars > New Toolbar.” Point it to this 
folder, then you can click the “>>” next to 
the newly created toolbar to access your 
shortcuts. Or go further, and create your 
own custom Jump Lists with the help of 
Jumplist Extender (see boxout on left).
Start Menu Shortcuts
The Windows 10 Start menu 
enables you to pin favorite items 
from the main list into the right-hand 
pane—just right-click the item in question, 
and choose “Pin to Start menu” (you can 
also pin the item to the Taskbar from here 
via the “More” sub-menu). Once it appears 
in the list, you can then drag and drop 
related items together, change icon sizes 
(regular program shortcuts can be small 
or medium), then name the group for easy 
identification (click the “=” button next to a 
group to rename it). Also, click and drag the 
title bar via its “=” button to reorder groups, 
placing your more frequently accessed 
groups at the top of the list.
You’ll also notice some handy shortcuts 
down the left-hand side of the panel—click 
your user photo to quickly access account 
settings via the “Change account settings” 
option that appears (you can also switch 
users without logging out from here, too, 
plus lock your PC). Other shortcuts—
including Settings and File Explorer—can 
also be found here. You have a limited 
choice of what you can display, including a 
selection of user folders (and indeed a link 
to the parent folder itself), Homegroup, 
and Network. To change these, navigate to 
Access your entire PC’s contents from the Taskbar.
Extend your application Jump Lists with 
Jumplist 
Extender 
(https://code.google.
com/archive/p/jumplist-extender)— 
despite its age, this open-source tool works 
perfectly with Windows 10. Simply select 
your program, then create app-related 
tasks you can add to the list of options that 
appear in the program’s Jump List. The best 
news? Jumplist Extender edits the Registry 
to create and edit your Jump Lists, so it 
doesn’t need to be running for them to work.
For example, launch the program, 
and choose “Start a new jump list.” Type 
“snipping” into the “Search Programs” 
bar, and select the Snipping Tool. Click 
“Open” followed by “Run Snipping Tool” to 
launch the program. When it loads, click the 
Snipping Tool window to select it, then click 
“OK” in the Jumplist Extender window.
Type “Rectangular snip’” into the “Name” 
box in Jumplist Extender, then hold down 
Alt and press N— you’ll see “Alt+N” appear 
in the ‘“Press keyboard shortcuts” window. 
Now press Alt-M, then press R on its own—it 
should now read “[Alt+N] [Alt+M] R.” You can 
add other screen-capture options with the 
right key combo by pressing the green “+” 
button—for example, “[Alt+N] [Alt+M] F” 
for a Freeform snip, or “[Alt+N] [Alt+M] W” 
for a Window snip.
Once done, choose “File > Save and Apply 
to Taskbar.” Pin the Snipping Tool shortcut 
to the Taskbar, and close the program. Now 
right-click its Taskbar icon, and you’ll see 
the options you’ve created, enabling you to 
capture screenshots without having to open 
the Snipping Tool first.
You can then apply this technique to any 
other program using keyboard shortcuts 
to trigger tasks (if no direct keyboard 
shortcuts exist, see the main text for the Alt 
workaround). Jumplist Extender can also 
be used to create a custom list of files to 
open using the program in question.

Use Quick Access
The 
Start 
menu 
has 
been 
streamlined 
slightly 
in 
the 
Creators Update, but it’s still no substitute 
for the Quick Access menu that appears 
when you right-click the “Start” button or 
press Win-X. This contains many useful 
shortcuts to various system settings 
and tools, but why stop with the options 
provided? You can add your own with the 
help of Win+X Menu Editor (http://winaero.
com/comment.php?comment.news.30). 
This portable tool enables you to edit what’s 
there, rearrange items, and—crucially— 
add your own. 
Once launched, click “Add a program” 
to add your choice of programs, Control 
Panel items, or Administrative Tools. Select 
“Add preset” and you’ll find some handy 
shortcuts to hidden tools and power options 
as well. You can also organize your items 
into groups to keep related items together, 
and make things easier to find.
More Settings Tweaks
The following tweaks all help 
save on clicks and unnecessary 
navigation, and can be found under “Start 
> Settings” (or use Win-I for even faster 
access). Start by heading over to “Devices 
> Mouse,” and—if necessary—flicking the 
“Scroll inactive windows when I hover over 
them” switch to on. You can now roll your 
mouse over any open window and scroll 
it, without first selecting the window in 
question. If you’re a trackpad user, click 
“Additional mouse options,” and look for 
a tab that gives you access to specific 
gestures and other trackpad-only settings 
that can speed up how you use your PC.
If 
you 
regularly 
switch 
between 
printers, head to “Devices > Printer,” and 
enable “Let Windows manage my default 
printer”—this makes whichever printer you 
use last the default. Select “Typing” if you 
want to disable autocorrect and remove text 
suggestions, although in most cases these 
are welcome timesavers. Finally, select 
“AutoPlay” if you want to pick a default 
option when you plug in external devices 
such as DVDs or flash memory cards.
Go to “System > Notifications & actions” 
to tweak which Quick Actions appear in the 
Action Center—useful shortcuts include 
toggling quiet hours and tweaking network 
settings. Then select “Multi-tasking” to 
change how virtual desktops behave—you 
can show open windows from all desktops 
on the Taskbar to speed things up if you 
frequently switch desktops, plus configure 
Alt-Tab to show all open windows, not just 
those open on the current desktop. More 
virtual desktop tweaks to come.
Go to “Accounts > Sign-in options” and 
set a device-specific PIN to save you time 
whenever you’re asked for your Microsoft 
Account password. Finally, it’s also worth 
exploring the “Ease of Access” section to 
see if any of the accessibility options on 
offer can improve your Windows experience 
to make things easier (and quicker) to use.
Master the Keyboard
Point and click is convenient, but 
it’s no substitute for fast keyboard 
action. Assign keyboard shortcuts to your 
favorite programs to quickly launch them. 
First, examine the Taskbar: The first 10 
entries to the right of the “Task View” button 
can be triggered using the shortcuts Win-1 
through Win-0 (left to right). Alternatively, 
right-click a program shortcut (or right-
click its Taskbar entry, then right-click the 
program entry in the Jump List), and choose 
“Properties.” From here, click inside the 
“Shortcut key” box, then hold down your 
choice of key combo to launch the app—it 
needs to be Ctrl-Alt, Shift-Alt, or Ctrl-Shift-
Alt plus your choice of key.
The Win key is also gateway to many 
useful tools: Win-Pause/Break opens the 
old System Control Panel, for example, 
while Win-A opens the Action Center. If 
you’d like to pair the Win key with Ctrl and 
Alt for more keyboard shortcuts, download 
WinHotKey 
from 
www.directedge.us/
content/winhotkey, which works fine in 
Windows 10.
It’s also worth exploring your favorite 
apps for useful keyboard shortcuts. There 
are some useful shortcuts universal to 
all apps (and Windows itself), such as the 
Ctrl-C, X, and V shortcuts for copying, 
cutting, and pasting to and from the 
clipboard. Ctrl-Z undoes the last action 
(including file operations in Windows), while 
Ctrl-Y redoes or repeats the last action.

The old “Start > Run” dialog 
may not be shown by default on 
the Start menu anymore, but it’s 
still there (press Win-R), and 
it’s as useful as ever. The more 
you use it, the better it becomes, 
because autocomplete kicks 
in, while typing paths is also 
quick, because all available 
sub-folders pop up as you type, 
helping you to locate and travel 
through your filesystem that 
little bit quicker.
Let’s start with a Windows 
10-only tip. The new Settings 
menu can be labyrinthine to 
navigate, but the Run dialog 
gives you access to any section 
with the following syntax:
“ms-settings:<shortcut>”
You 
need 
to 
replace 
“<shortcut>” with your choice 
of 
location, 
such 
as 
“ms-
settings:windowsupdate,” “ms-
settings:lockscreen,” or “ms-
settings:display.”
The Run dialog also speeds 
up 
access 
to 
the 
Control 
Panel, although many of the 
shortcuts 
now 
redirect 
to 
their Settings equivalent, such 
as “control desktop.” Those 
that 
don’t 
include 
“control 
admintools,” “control system” 
(System Control Panel), and 
“control sysdm.cpl” (System 
Properties). See a full list at 
https://support.microsoft.com/
help/192806/.
Others include “devmgmt.
msc” 
(Device 
Manager), 
“taskmgr” 
(Task 
Manager), 
“cleanmgr” (Disk Cleanup), as 
well as any program shortcuts 
or program file names (such as 
“winword” for Microsoft Word).
One other major use for 
the Run dialog is to browse 
hidden 
user 
folders—
specifically 
your 
application 
data folders. This is done 
with environment variables—
“%AppData%” points to C:\
User\<Yourname>\.AppData\
Roaming, for instance, while 
“%LocalAppData%” redirects to 
C:\User\<Yourname>/.AppData\
Local. Type “%AppData%\” and 
you see a list of sub-folders—
keep typing, and they filter down 
until you can select one.
Other environment variables 
include 
“%windir%” 
(your 
Windows 
directory, 
typically 
C:\Windows), 
“%OneDrive%” 
(your OneDrive folder), and 
“%ProgramData%” (the location 
of the ProgramData folder).
Use the Run Dialog
The Run dialog box is a timesaving superstar.
where no shortcut is forthcoming, always 
remember the Alt trick—press Alt and the 
highlighted letter of a menu, and you open 
the menu. Combine this with the underlined 
letter of a specific menu option—Alt-F-O 
for “File > Open,” for example—and you 
trigger that menu option.
Office 365 users should press Alt 
once—you’ll see a list of letters appear 
above the various ribbon and Quick Access 
toolbar options. Hold Alt as you press the 
corresponding key to access that option—if 
it’s a ribbon tab, more letters appear next 
to various ribbon options, enabling you to 
select those options quickly, too. For more 
Office tips, see the boxout opposite.
Use Right-Clicking
The 
right-click 
menu—also 
accessible by pressing Shift-F10 
to trigger it at the current cursor point—is 
packed full of useful, context-sensitive 
options, particularly in File Explorer. Hold 
down Shift as you right-click, and you often 
reveal hidden options—for example, “Copy 
as path” for a selected file or folder, or 
loads more destinations under the “Send 
to” sub-menu. 
To add your own custom apps and 
locations to the “Send:to” menu, open 
the Run dialog, type “shell:sendto” and 
hit Enter. Place your shortcuts in here, or 
use SendToToys (www.gabrieleponti.com/
software) to add loads more options, such 
as clipboard, Command Prompt, and so on.
The right-click menus can become 
cluttered by third-party apps adding their

own options, which can slow navigation 
down. If there’s no option to disable these 
within the application itself, there are a 
few third-party tools that can help clear 
the clutter for you. If you’re using CCleaner 
(www.piriform.com), then go to “Tools 
> Startup > Context Menu tab.” If you 
want 
more 
control—including 
options 
for adding more entries to the menu—
then use the portable Context Menu tool 
(www.sordum.org/7615/easy-context-
menu-v1-6/) instead. Choose “File > 
ContextMenuCleaner” to review and scrub 
unwanted entries.
Speed Up File Explorer
File Explorer is packed with 
timesaving tips and tools. Here 
are some of the best. First, make use of 
the Quick Access menu in the Navigation 
pane—drag frequently accessed folders 
here for quick and easy access.
If you’re still using Ctrl or Shift to select 
multiple folders or files, switch to the 
“View” tab of File Explorer’s ribbon instead, 
and select “Item check boxes”—now you 
can simply select each file or folder by using 
its checkbox.
File Explorer’s search box is still the 
go-to location for file and folder searches—
learn to make the most of its filters to find 
what you need. The “Search” tab on the 
ribbon provides you with two-click access 
to these, but you can quickly input your own 
filters directly into the search box, including 
“type:” (filetype), “kind:” (type of file, such 
as document), “date:” (date or date range), 
“size:” (file size), and even “tag:” (tags).
The Search box also supports all 
standard Boolean operators, so enclose 
exact phrases inside double quotation 
marks, precede unwanted terms with a 
dash (-), and use AND, OR, or NOT. Visit 
https://msdn.microsoft.com/aa965711 for 
a comprehensive guide. If you store key 
files outside of your user folders, it’s worth 
getting Windows to index those locations to 
speed up future searches. On the “Search” 
tab, choose “Advanced Options > Change 
indexed locations” to do so.
Windows Desktop
Let’s finish with some handy 
keyboard shortcuts for navigating 
your desktop. Aero Snap enables you to 
pin two windows side-by-side by dragging 
them to either edge of the desktop. You can 
also snap windows via the keyboard: Hold 
Win and press left or right cursor keys 
respectively. Once there, press Win-up to 
move the window to the top corner, or Win-
down to move it down to the bottom corner, 
allowing up to four windows to be on screen 
at once.
Finally, start making good use of 
Windows’ task- and desktop-switching 
tools with the help of some Tab key combos. 
The new visual Task View may not be to 
everyone’s tastes, but you can invoke it with 
Win-Tab. Once open, use the cursor keys to 
select your desired window, and hit Enter. 
If you prefer the old-school view, hold down 
Alt and press Tab instead—cycle left and 
right using Tab (right) and Shift-Tab (left), all 
while continuing to hold the Alt key.
Alt-Tab only displays windows from 
the current virtual desktop, while you can 
configure Task View (see earlier) to display 
windows from all desktops, making it 
quicker to switch. Speaking of which, hold 
Win-Ctrl-D to create a new virtual desktop, 
and Win-Ctrl-F4 to close the current one. 
Move between virtual desktops using Win-
Ctrl-left/right cursor keys.
As an aside, if you’re navigating a multi-
tabbed application, such as your web 
browser, then use Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-
Tab to cycle backward and forward through 
the tabs. 
 
If you’re an Office user, you’ll find lots of 
timesaving shortcuts are waiting to be 
discovered. Start by saving yourself a trip 
around the ribbon hunting down frequently 
used commands; instead, locate a popular 
command, right-click its button, and choose 
“Add to Quick Access Toolbar.” This pins it to 
the top of the ribbon for easy access. There’s 
space for a finite number of commands, so 
click the “More” button to the right of the 
Quick Access toolbar, and choose “Show 
below the ribbon” to move it to a more 
accommodating area.
You can customize the ribbon, too, with 
your favorite commands, placing them 
under a tab, or you can assign custom 
keyboard shortcuts to any frequently used 
tools: Choose “Options” from the “File” 
tab, and select “Customize ribbon” to set 
up the ribbon as you want it. While you’re 
here, click “Customize” next to “Keyboard 
Shortcuts” to assign shortcuts.
If you frequently waste time styling up 
individual passages of text, use Word’s 
Styles instead. This makes it easier to make 
wholesale—and consistent—changes 
across your document. You can apply 
keyboard shortcuts to styles, plus quickly 
update styles using the currently selected 
text (simply right-click the target style, and 
choose “Update… to match selection”).
Finally, save time performing repetitive 
tasks by recording them as macros. 
The simplest way is to use the “Record 
Macro” button on the “Developer” tab of 
the ribbon to record your command clicks 
or keystrokes—note it only works with 
items selected using the keyboard, which 
can restrict its usefulness somewhat. Go 
to https://support.office.com and search 
for “macros” to find out more—be aware 
that macros can harbor malicious code, so 
only allow macros that are digitally signed, 
by clicking “Macro Security.”
Speed Up  
Microsoft Office
Switch open apps quickly with the old-school Alt-Tab combo.
Place favorite commands on the Quick 
Access toolbar.

generAtion, 
A 
new 
socket—that inevitably means new 
motherboards. And this generation 
is no different. Each time we get a 
new architecture, a new chipset, we 
see refined iterations of the brands 
and models we love. Whether it’s 
Asus’s prestigious ROG Hero and TUF 
Sabertooth motherboards, or MSI’s 
ACK and EVGA’s Classified series, 
there’s always some new feature 
ready to be baked into a fresh design.
It’s arguably one of the best parts 
of the modern tech industry. Not great 
for those looking for a cheap and 
easy upgrade, but for anyone building 
a fresh system, it ensures you’re 
getting the very latest and greatest 
tech possible. X299 has been one of 
the more controversial releases from 
Intel, but the boards that have come 
along with it have been exceptional. 
Asus’s TUF X299 Mark 1 is a fantastic 
example. Catering both to the high 
and low end, this plated and armored 
mobo 
comes 
packing 
integrated 
cooling, multiple PCIe lanes, subtle 
RGB lighting, a rear I/O cover, and 
fantastic onboard support for any 
number of interface devices.
It’s also one of the cheapest 
motherboards currently available on 
the platform, making it fantastic value 
(relatively) for those wanting to build a 
super-clean system. If the armor isn’t 
your thing, though, fear not, because 
the TUF X299 Mark 2 is available 
armor-free. –ZAK StoreY

Put it all online—your games, your media, your 
desktop, or even your life. By Alex Cox
We’ve relied on end-to-end streaming 
for longer than we’ve relied on computers. 
Where would society be without the 
influence of radio or cable TV? Would we 
be quite the same if Major General George 
O Squier hadn’t developed Muzak’s 
earliest tech, a 1930s system of sending 
inoffensive music along electrical wires 
directly to elevators and stores? Well, 
probably. We might even be slightly more 
sane. But that’s not the point: Streaming 
has long been hugely important, and the 
Internet has completely democratized it. 
You’re now free to send whatever you 
want wherever you want. You can push 
data, making it available to anyone who 
wants it, or pull streams, just for you, 
from a private source. You can work with 
audio, video, live cameras, or any other 
data that suits. You can use streaming for 
entertainment, for profit, or for practical 
benefits. And you can do it all, for the 
most part, for free. All you really need is 
a quality broadband connection on either 
end of the streaming path. You might not 
even need that, if your server hardware is 
robust enough to transcode media on the 
fly, converting it to a lower resolution that 
reduces bandwidth demands.
In this feature, we take you through 
as many different content streaming 
situations as possible, from games 
to sounds, and beyond. It’s all very 
situational and personal. Everything 
you might want to stream has slightly 
different methodology, unique software, 
and technical considerations to take into 
account. Many of the tools we talk about 
can be used for more than one thing, and 
the specific one you use is, at the end of 
the day, up to you. 
We talk public and private streaming, 
and give a few suggestions as to how to 
take advantage of the former to increase 
your online profile. While it’s going to take 
a lot of work and a special kind of charisma 
to top Twitch’s 200,000-viewer record 
for a single streamer—and, indeed, its 
all-time stream record of over 1,000,000 
for a CS:GO tournament match—there’s 
nothing stopping you from trying.

media library Streaming
Right off the bat, Plex Media Server is, by 
far, the slickest and cleanest solution for 
getting video and audio content that you 
own from a personal server on to basically 
any device anywhere in the world. Originally 
developed as a fork of XBMC (now Kodi), 
Plex has, over the past nine years, evolved 
into an extremely capable media host, 
which can look after everything from your 
music to your video content, and even, if you 
sign up for the monthly Plex Pass service, 
serve as a backup method for critical files 
such as photos. It offers apps for every 
major games console, and for cell phones 
and tablets, includes compatibility with the 
Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire Stick, 
and has a fully-featured web interface for 
everything else. The server itself can run 
on a number of devices—you may even be 
able to get it going on your NAS—but we 
recommend something solid. Check the 
“Right Hardware” box opposite to see the 
kind of gear you should be aiming for to get 
maximum performance.
Getting it set up is simple. Grab the 
appropriate installer for your device from 
http://plex.tv/downloads, and run it. It’s 
a straightforward installer, no surprises. 
When it’s over, you have to run through a 
bit of first-time setup in a browser window. 
This basically just involves creating an 
account on the Plex.tv website—Plex 
handles online translation and routing 
for you, which makes for vastly simplified 
remote streaming—and running through 
a few self-explanatory steps, including 
setting up a folder for your media. This can 
reside, realistically, wherever you’d like, 
although it’s most efficient to use a drive 
directly connected to the computer that’s 
running the server, because pulling from 
network storage in order to send media 
via the network doubles up the bandwidth 
required—unless you opt for the cloud 
option (part of the Premium package), which 
accesses content on storage providers such 
as Dropbox and Google Drive, and doesn’t 
require a server PC at all.
With everything in place, you have access 
to your entire media library from anywhere. 
Just sign in to the Plex client, on any device, 
with the credentials you set earlier, or head 
to http://plex.tv/web in a browser window. If 
your files are named correctly (see http://bit.
ly/1Rxz8Ca), the server polls sites such as 
The Movie Database, Last.fm, and TheTVDB 
for thumbnails, episode information, and 
even trailers, and automatically arranges 
your media. Honestly, it’s ridiculously 
easy, and compatible with just about every 
format—the most difficult thing you have to 
do is collect together and rip your media.
In theory, you have other choices 
if you’re already tied into a different 
ecosystem. You could, with a bit of fiddling 
with SSH and VPN tunneling, make a 
Kodi library available online, or use VLC 
(www.videolan.org) to stream any kind 
of media locally. Alternatively, PlexBMC 
(http://bit.ly/2gCxAvq) 
can 
funnel 
the 
contents of a Plex media server into a Kodi 
client. Subsonic (www.subsonic.org) was 
designed solely for audio streaming, but 
also includes rudimentary video streaming 
capabilities, and works in a very similar way 
to Plex. And, hey, if you’re happy to forget 
about controlling precisely what you can 
watch, you could always eliminate the worry 
of compiling a media library, and sign up 
for a dedicated streaming service such as 
Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime, et al. 
deSktop Streaming
Now for something more practical: remote 
controlling your PC. There are several easy 
options for taking your desktop on the road, 
many of which have been around for a long 
time. VNC, for instance, is a well-seasoned 
open-source remote desktop client, highly 
configurable, with several different (but 
compatible) spins. Try TightVNC (www.
tightvnc.com) or RealVNC (www.realvnc.
com) if you’re leaning in this direction; run 
the server app on the machine you want to 
access, and set a strong password—VNC’s 
ports are, given that they offer up full 
access to your PC, often targeted by rogues.
Windows has a desktop streaming tool 
included in the form of Microsoft Remote 
Desktop, which can pick out individual 
apps from your desktop, and stream them 
seamlessly without the rest of it, and has 
client apps for phones and other operating 
systems. It’s well featured and really rather 
good, but it’s not our top pick. We’re leaning 
toward something that, like Plex, does all 
the hard work for you: TeamViewer (www.
teamviewer.com). It may be the most 
attractive among these tools in terms of the 
ease of its interface, and it’s generally used 
for idiot-proof remote support purposes, 
but it’s entirely feasible to set it up for easy 
access to your own hardware. 
When you’ve downloaded and run its 
installer, select “Unattended.” Now, when 
you first run TeamViewer, you’re given 
a wizard to run through; you don’t need 
to sign up for an account, you can use it 
anonymously if you choose. Note down the 
ID number you’re given at the end of the 
process, and you can use it in conjunction 
with the password you set earlier to gain 
YouNow’s leaderboards take streaming narcissism to new heights.
Plex does all the hard work of compiling covers and media information for you.

the right 
hardware
Streaming isn’t usually very gentle 
on your hardware. Transcoding or 
encoding a video stream puts strain 
on your CPU, your GPU, and your 
RAM, so if you’re looking for a smooth 
experience for your viewers, you 
should go as big as you possibly can to 
negate the overheads of putting that 
content online. Machines with more 
cores and threads tend to handle the 
task much better. Dedicate a machine 
to streaming if you can; use a device 
such as the Avermedia ExtremeCap U3 
to pull in a 1080p signal over USB 3.0, 
then feel free to tax the machine you’re 
creating content on, without fear of 
dropped frames.
That said, the most important 
asset of a good streaming machine is 
availability. If you’re not performing 
otherwise demanding tasks—say, 
if you’re only streaming your media 
collection—you can get away with a lot 
less, as long as your server is powered 
up and ready to go precisely when you 
need it. The best hosting hardware in 
this case is low-powered, low-noise, 
and able to be left switched on at all 
times. A specced-up Intel NUC, an old 
desktop tucked in an inconspicuous 
corner, an unloved laptop with its 
screen turned off, just about anything 
will do—and a cloud option, such as 
Plex, could be even better.
Regardless of whether you’re 
streaming to one or to many, your 
server needs a quality network 
connection. Don’t feel you’ll be able 
to rely entirely on wireless, because 
high-res video puts big bandwidth 
demands on your hardware, and 
shaky connections, naturally, affect 
performance, so wire it up via Ethernet 
to a strong broadband pipe if you can. 
Avoid powerline Ethernet—we’ve 
found it has a tendency to go up and 
down at random—and opt for an 
Internet package with as much upload 
bandwidth as possible. It sounds 
obvious, but some just have the ratio 
all wrong.
access to your desktop at any time, by using 
a TeamViewer app or through the website. 
The app also shows another password; it 
changes every boot, and you can give this 
to folks you want to be able to access your 
machine without knowing your login details.
One thing to note: Streaming your desktop 
is generally much more demanding, and 
slower, than streaming a media collection, 
because your videos and audio have been 
encoded in a format that reduces their size 
and required bandwidth. TeamViewer and 
its ilk usually do some work to negate this, 
such as blanking your desktop background, 
dropping the color depth, and compressing 
the stream on the fly, but this does increase 
sluggishness. If you’re trying to throw 
the raw contents of a 4K desktop down 
your Internet connection, don’t expect to 
comfortably run graphically demanding 
applications, or for the experience to be the 
same as being sat at your desk. 
If you want pinpoint control over the 
minutiae of your desktop streaming, there’s 
an option you may not have considered: VLC 
media player. Set up a server by opening 
your desktop as a capture device, and switch 
from Play mode to Stream mode. Run 
through the wizard that appears, select the 
destination IP address of your stream, and 
use port 1234. You can now select the exact 
compression method you want to package 
your stream in, from encapsulation to video 
and audio codecs, by clicking the tool icon. 
It’s a one-way street, so you can’t take 
control with VLC itself, but it’s an option.
game Streaming
Games are the gaudy poster child of live 
streaming, and the topic most associated 
with the phrase. Given its proliferation, there 
are plenty of technologies and services 
associated with transporting gameplay 
from one place to another. If you’re keeping 
it to yourself, look in the direction of Steam’s 
In-Home Streaming service, which, with 
the minimum of effort, translates titles 
running on a powerful gaming PC into an 
h.264 stream, and fires them off to a client 
machine. As long as it’s running Steam, 
this client can be equipped with almost any 
hardware—bringing beautiful games to the 
wimpiest laptop—though there are caveats 
to consider on the server end. 
You need a machine powerful enough to 
render your game and quickly compress 
a video stream at the same time. Your 
server resolution is the maximum that 
Subsonic’s cover-focused interface looks a lot like iTunes—but it’s slightly less irritating.
Streaming your desktop with TeamViewer is easy—you just need two numbers.

Stream 
into the 
big time
There are a lucky few out there who 
manage to make money from streaming. 
Only a few, though, so we don’t 
recommend quitting your job just yet. It’s 
hard to say what the prevailing source 
of income is for the average streamer; 
some make the bulk of their cash from 
tips and donations, which are often tied 
to shoutouts and on-screen recognition. 
This can work well, particularly for 
streamers with a growing audience, 
although those on the lower rungs 
often find this isn’t enough to constitute 
a wage. A few also push Patreon 
subscriptions, although that’s a system 
more associated with episodic content. 
The key to making a living from 
streaming really seems to be the Twitch 
partner program, a mildly exclusive 
club reserved for regular streamers 
with a growing audience. You need to 
apply to join, and you absolutely must 
behave in terms of copyright, but when 
you’re on the train, you share half of 
each $4.99 monthly subscription to your 
channel. Amazon’s ownership of Twitch 
also helps; Amazon Prime subscribers 
get one subscription included with their 
account, so dedicated viewers may even 
be able to chip in (virtually) for free.
 Getting to the peak, though? Aside 
from luck, there are a few key things 
to consider no matter what you’re 
streaming. Be consistent with your 
schedule and quality. Be pleasant, 
approachable, and civil. Interact with 
your chat without scaring people away. 
Make sure your content is accessible—
break it into manageable chunks on 
YouTube, and archive your broadcasts. 
Keep your image and audio quality high. 
Make friends with other streamers; 
they may host your channel when they 
are offline, which can drive attractive 
traffic your way. And, if you can stand 
it, pick a popular topic. Certain games 
do better than others—check Twitch 
for specifics. And, well, it also helps if

is replicated on your client, and that 
server needs to be actively running the 
game, so it can’t be used for anything else 
while you’re streaming. There’s a small 
amount of lag, naturally, and while it’s 
technically possible to use VPN trickery to 
run In-Home Streaming out-of-home, the 
additional delay makes your games all but 
unplayable. The same things are generally 
true for other stream playing experiences, 
such as Nvidia’s Gamestream, which puts 
your GeForce-accelerated games on to 
Nvidia Shield devices, and third-party game 
streamers, such as Parsec and Remotr.
Game streaming comes into its own with 
one-to-many solutions, such as Twitch and 
YouTube Live, which take a stream from a 
client app—OBS is complex but free, XSplit 
comfortable but subscription-based, and 
Gameshow the new paid-for pretender—
and send it online for anyone to enjoy. 
Microsoft is, as Microsoft does, sticking its 
own fingers in the pie, with Mixer (formerly 
Beam), which has the advantage of being 
built in to Windows 10 from the Creator’s 
Update onward, and available from the 
Game bar, but the disadvantage of being, 
frankly, not very good. It’ll grow, and it’ll get 
better, but stick with the big boys for now.
A few technical considerations: While 
it’s possible to stream to the Internet from 
the PC you’re playing on, that’s often not the 
best idea. You’re dealing with, potentially, 
far greater system overheads than in-home 
streaming, because you probably also want 
to process a video stream of your webcam 
and some sort of flashy overlay. Bigger 
streamers tend to split the load, with one 
machine managing the gameplay portion, 
and another equipped with an HDMI capture 
device and running the stream end, putting 
viewer interaction front and center. 
perSonal Streaming
While Twitch has long been the home 
of game streaming, it’s recently taken a 
turn toward the personal, in the form of 
Twitch IRL channels. These move the focus 
away from games and on to the streamer, 
allowing for personal, often inane, vlog-
style live streaming. Twitch’s terms of 
service require that these include viewer 
interaction, follow strict guidelines, and 
don’t deviate too far from the streamer as 
VLC gives you plenty of options for streaming formats, so switch it up if one isn’t working.
You need a package such as Telestream’s GameShow to ensure your broadcasts look sharp.

Security  
camera 
Streaming
You likely have a bundle of old cell 
phones or tablets hanging around, or 
can get your hands on some. So here’s 
a little bonus streaming idea: Set one 
up as a security camera, and beam 
the goings-on of your household to 
wherever you happen to be. It may take 
a bit of creative mounting and wiring to 
put them in place—though the Dockem 
cell phone wall mount ($15) may be 
all that you need. The software side of 
things is actually remarkably easy; grab 
IP Webcam (Android, free) or iVideon 
(iOS, free) from your device’s app store, 
run the app, point the phone’s camera 
at the thing you want to watch, and 
install the appropriate client on your 
PC.  VLC’s stream capture function is 
enough for IP Webcam, while iVideon 
asks for its own server, downloadable 
from www.ivideon.com/get/. 
That’s only the tip of the iceberg, 
though. With multiple cell phone 
cameras, standard webcams—which 
you could hook up to any old streaming 
box with little overhead—or dedicated 
IP cameras, such as the $29.99 
Wansview Home Camera, you can set 
up multiple simultaneous streams 
to a multi-cam server, such as the 
aforementioned iVideon or iSpy (www.
ispyconnect.com). iSpy records footage 
to a hard drive, triggers itself with 
customizable levels of motion detection, 
and even alerts you to intrusions with 
a private video uploaded to YouTube. 
A subscription (from $7.95 per month) 
gets you access to your security camera 
network online, although there’s nothing 
to stop you getting a little creative; why 
not stream your local cam server online 
using something like TeamViewer, 
for instance? It’s absolutely less 
convenient, but a darn sight cheaper. 
Alternatively, you could always revert 
to iVideon, which gets you online access 
with limited features on its free plan, 
or more if you want to expand your 
coverage for a fee.
the focus; the service also runs a talk show 
category, which caters for more subject-
focused content. 
YouTube Live, accessible from its Creator 
Studio, is more flexible in terms of subject 
matter—you’re free to stream whatever you 
like, as long as you don’t offend any copyright 
holders—and includes lots of useful tools. 
Sign up with your Google account, and you 
are given a livestreaming permalink that 
you can share with potential viewers, and 
(with the help of OBS or similar) you’ll soon 
be broadcasting. There’s an included DVR 
feature, which lets viewers who missed the 
beginning of your broadcast jump back up 
to four hours. You can also stream directly 
from your phone, as long as you have an 
adequate cell connection and data plan. 
There’s a number of options for those who 
desire a more intimate audience. Facebook 
Live is growing in popularity, and getting up 
and running is as simple as penning a status, 
then hitting the live video option. You can, as 
with any Facebook post, set your privacy to 
public, and this is certainly a good option if 
you’re using the broadcast functionality to 
push your brand, but bear in mind that you’ll 
need to publicize public events if you want 
them to reach beyond your timeline. Justin.
tv-style livecasting networks still exist, too; 
Ustream has been swallowed up by IBM, 
and now aims toward the corporate sector, 
but YouNow is increasingly popular, though 
it can lean toward Chatroulette and Omegle 
territory at times, and that’s not somewhere 
any civilized person wants to be.
If you want to share a hobby rather than 
your personality, there are other niche 
streaming services. Twitch has a Creative 
category, which permits art, coding, music, 
and, occasionally, classic Bob Ross and 
Mr Rogers shows, although you wouldn’t 
get away with broadcasting these yourself 
unless you’re the rights holder. Picarto.tv  
caters specifically to artists, and has a 
long history and large community behind 
it. We should also mention Mixlr, which is 
perfect for audio streamers; you can use 
it to set up a virtual radio station, or create 
a live podcast recorded for later. It’s not 
free—a full subscription with a permanent 
livestream URL will run you a cool $499 
per year—but you can test it out with a trial. 
Happy streaming! 
Microsoft’s Mixer project is a relative newcomer, but you need no additional software.
Pick up art tips or showcase your talents for drawing scantily-clad anime girls on Picarto.

Mighty 
Monitor ArM
I love my man corner, but it could do 
with a spruce-up. The reclaimed wood 
and glass top look fine, but the overall 
setup would benefit from a shake-up. 
I intend to migrate to a new chassis 
sometime this year, with In-Win’s 
recent foray into wooden-topped cases 
particularly catching my eye (more ITX 
AM4 boards, anyone?). But, apart from 
that, the biggy for me is the monitor.
I went out of my way to buy a 
Samsung CF791 earlier this year, 
managing to nab a B-grade sample 
from a retailer (allegedly returned 
because it was “too big” for the 
customer). Its 34-inch, 3440x1440, 
100Hz, VA panel is a dream come true, 
and its beautifully crisp design makes 
it a joy to use. Problem is, the stand 
doesn’t lend itself well to my desk, 
jutting out by almost seven inches.
It does, however, come with a 
rather odd VESA mount attachment 
(mounting to the integrated frame, 
rather than baked into the back of 
the panel), which may be the way 
forward. The stand is fairly rigid, so 
swapping it out for a monitor arm 
that can support its purported 13.4lb 
bulk, and be oriented in any direction 
I find appropriate, seems like the next 
logical step. For the moment, it looks 
like the AmazonBasics Single Monitor 
Display Arm will be the arm of choice. 
For $100, it checks all the boxes, and 
can take screens up to 25lb—more 
than enough for my CF791.
Flawless widescreen
Running 21:9 or multiple monitors? Fed up with games not 
supporting the glory of 2560x1080 or 3440x1440? Tired of 
going into game config files to set the resolution to your new 
super-monitor? Then Flawless Widescreen is your jam. With a 
ton of plugins to automatically fix any resolution woes, this app 
makes using the niche aspect ratio a dream. It’s freeware, so 
feel free to try it and donate at www.flawlesswidescreen.org.

Going under the hood of 
Microsoft’s latest full laptop.
Background:
Teardown is the word of the day, and we’re diving into Microsoft’s 
new Surface Laptop right now. Will this carpeted Alcantara-clad 
laptop excel in our teardown room? The power is in our hands. 
Major Tech SpecS:
• 13.5-inch IPS PixelSense display, 2256×1504 resolution (201 ppi)
• Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 (3M Cache, up to 3.1GHz),  
or Core i7 (4M Cache, 4.0GHz) CPU
• 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB RAM
• 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB PCIe SSD storage
• 720p front-facing camera with Windows Hello sign-in
• USB 3.0, Mini DisplayPort, and SurfaceConnect charging port
• 802.11ac Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n compatible, Bluetooth 4.0
key FindingS:
• We take a peek under the suspicious rubber footpads on the 
bottom of the laptop, but find metal feet instead of the screws 
we were hoping for. Looks like we have to peel up that (dubiously 
luxurious) Alcantara after all. Jimmy in hand, we start popping 
clips and peeling adhesive. Already, this doesn’t feel like it’ll go 
back together. We try to remove the fabric cover, but the going 
gets a lot tougher south of the keyboard. We have to pull out the 
knife now, to cut off the rest of the pelt. Layered underneath, we 
find a metal shield—the meat in our Surface sandwich.
• With more adhesive and plastic bits holding the shield from 
beneath, we fire up the iOpener. Now we have a clear look at 
the plastic, it seems these aren’t reusable clips at all, but weak 
ultrasonic spot welds that we’ve been busting through. This is 
definitely not going back together without a roll of duct tape.
• With the keyboard plate finally wrested free, we’re at least 
pleased to see the long cable connecting it to the body. However, 
our pleasure is short-lived: The connector is trapped under a 
clip-on shield on the motherboard. With the keyboard out, we 
begin the search for the trackpad, and find it trapped under tape 
and a metal shield, but it’s nothing we haven’t handled before.
• We look for a battery connector to dispatch, but it’s nowhere to 
be seen. Looks like we’re doing this live! The Surface Laptop 
packs a 45.2Wh battery, roughly the same capacity as the latest 
Surface Pro (45Wh), and more than the iPad Pro 10.5-inch 
(31Wh) and latest MacBook Retina 41Wh). 
• Also visible is a secondary heat pipe, helping dissipate heat from 
both sides of the mobo. The modular headphone jack is free to go, 
contacts and all. No Surface product is complete without a hinge, 
but these feel a little pedestrian. With that, the display is unhinged.
• Repairability Score: 0 out of 10 (10 is the easiest to repair). You 
can’t get inside without inflicting a lot of damage. The CPU, RAM, 
and onboard storage are soldered to the mobo, making upgrades 
a no-go. The headphone jack can only be accessed by removing 
the heat sink, fan, display, and mobo. The battery is difficult and 
dangerous to replace, giving the device a limited lifespan. 

Set Up the Perfect 
OwnCloud Server
1
Install OwnClOud
Step one is—obviously—to install OwnCloud. If you’re running 
a Linux-based server, download it from www.owncloud.org; if 
you’re installing it on your NAS, visit its app center, or Google the 
NAS model and “owncloud” to see whether a community-built 
app has been produced, then follow the instructions to install 
it—typically, it’s a simple case of clicking the OwnCloud icon or 
downloading a package, then uploading it to the NAS, which then 
does all the tricky installation stuff for you.
>> If you’re a QNAP owner, you’re stuck with OwnCloud 8.0.4, 
unless you’re willing to jump through some pretty tricky hoops, or 
make do with just the basic database (which is impractical, as you’ll 
see in the next step).

COnfIgure MysQl
Before launching OwnCloud for the first time, you need to 
set up a MySQL database for it to use. OwnCloud does ship 
with built-in support for SQLite, but by its own admission, this isn’t 
very practical, and doesn’t work with any desktop clients, so you 
need to upgrade. Any NAS supporting OwnCloud that’s worth its 
Cloud baCkup and synC is a brilliant way to ensure your data is both protected and available 
on all your devices. But you may have good reason not to want a third-party provider to look after 
your data—perhaps the cost is too great, you don’t trust their encryption methods, or you’d rather 
restrict synchronization to your own network.
The solution to having your cloud-based cake and eating it is OwnCloud. OwnCloud works in 
exactly the same way as most cloud sync providers, but your data is stored locally, so the only limit 
is the size of your server’s hard drive. It’s also restricted to your local network by default—you  
can open it up, as we’ll reveal, but if you’re leery about making it available over the Internet, 
you can keep it closed off.
The most difficult thing about OwnCloud is setting it up, which is where we come in. If you have 
a NAS drive with the OwnCloud app, you can skip the tricky installation part (covered in detail back 
in issue 130), and get on with configuring and using OwnCloud to ensure your data is backed up, in 
sync, and secure. Read on to find out everything you need to know. –Nick Peers

salt should give you access to the phpMyAdmin app (or 
similar) to configure your new database.
>> If necessary, install phpMyAdmin through your app 
center, then select the app, and click “Configure” or “Open” 
to open it in a separate browser window. You then need to 
log into phpMyAdmin as the root user—if this is your first 
time, try “root” as the username and a blank password. 
Once logged in, start by clicking “Change password” under 
“General settings” to secure the account with a strong 
password—use the “Generate password” button, then 
save the generated password to your password manager 
(such as LastPass).
3
Create and COnneCt tO database
Select the “User accounts” tab at the top of the 
screen. Click “Add User Account” to create a new 
user—say, “owncloud.” Change “Host name” to “Local.” 
Next, set a strong password by clicking “Generate”

manager). Check “Create database with the same name and grant 
all privileges,” then scroll down, and click “Go.”
>> Once done, switch to the “Databases” tab to verify the 
OwnCloud database has been created. Click “Check privileges” next 
to it to verify there’s an entry for your username—it should read 
“localhost” for “Host name,” “database-specific” for “Type,” and 
be given all privileges (but not able to grant additional privileges). 
Once verified, close the phpMyAdmin window.

fInIsh COnfIgurIng OwnClOud
Return to your NAS’s app center, locate OwnCloud, and 
click “Open.” First, create an administrator account for 
configuring OwnCloud—make sure its username and password 
matches the MySQL username password you created previously. 
Once entered, click the “Storage & database” drop-down menu, and 
select the “MySQL/MariaDB” tab. Enter your MySQL username and 
password again, then put the MySQL username in the “Database 
name” field, too, and change “localhost” to “127.0.0.1:12345,” 
replacing “12345” with the port number displayed in the Address 
Bar next to your NAS’s IP address. Click “Finish setup” [Image b].
5
set up user aCCOunt
After a short pause, the main OwnCloud screen appears, 
with handy links for obtaining the desktop and mobile 
clients, plus instructions for synching calendar and contacts from 
your smartphone. Click the close button. You’ll see a small list 
of folders and files have been created for the current user—your 
administrator, so to speak. Let’s start by creating a dedicated user 
account for yourself: Click the down arrow next to your username 
in the top right-hand corner, and click “Users.”
>> Now type a more memorable username and password into 
the boxes—you can make yourself a member of the admin group 
D
C
by clicking “Groups,” and checking the “Admin” box if you 
wish [Image C]—however, for maximum security, it’s best 
to leave administrating OwnCloud to the master user. 
Either way, be sure to protect your account with a strong 
password. Click “Create.”
6 
add MOre users—If reQuIred
If you plan to share your personal cloud with other 
household members, set up their user accounrs 
now—but don’t make anyone an admin. If you plan to set 
different sharing privileges for different users, click “Add 
Group” to create groups that you can place people into. 
Make a note of the “Quota” drop-down menu—this enables 
you to set limits on how much data people can store using 
OwnCloud, which may be crucial if your NAS drive isn’t 
particularly big. Options include unlimited, 1GB, 5GB, and 
10GB, plus a custom option for setting your own limit in 
gigabytes. Think about how much space you have, and how 
you would like to divide it up among the users—50GB each 
should be more than ample for most people.
There are mobile apps for iOS (99 cents), Blackberry (free), 
and Android (99 cents). Again, connect using your server 
address, username, and password. The app makes it easy 
to access your files on the go—you can view photos, stream 
video, and download files to your mobile storage. Go into 
Settings, and you can also automatically upload photos and 
video to your OwnCloud storage, too, plus set a PIN passcode 
to further protect your data.
You can also upload other files to OwnCloud from other 
mobile apps by looking for the option to send or share the 
file via another app—select “OwnCloud” from the list (if it’s 
not present, scroll right, and tap “More,” then flick the slider 
next to “OwnCloud” to “On”). From here, tap “Location” at the 
bottom of the screen to choose which folder to upload the file 
to, then tap “Upload to.” You then need to open the OwnCloud 
app for the transfer to take place.

sOMe InItIal tweaks
Before we switch attention to setting up your account, let’s 
configure some settings. Click the account username in the 
top right-hand corner, and choose “Admin.” Work your way through 
the options offered—you can restrict sharing to this OwnCloud 
server only, plus allow other users to only share within their user 
groups, for example. 
>> We strongly recommend you check the “Enforce HTTPS” boxes 
to ensure all connections are secure [Image d]. Note your NAS or 
server needs to have an SSL certificate applied to it—see the boxout 
on the right for some tips. It’s worth noting that OwnCloud’s built-in 
security isn’t perfect, particularly on older versions, but it’s a start.
8
swItCh tO new user
Click the username drop-down menu in the top-right corner, 
and choose “Log out.” Log in using your newly created 
account credentials to access your own personal cloud folder—files 
and folders can be created, uploaded, or deleted direct from here 
when you need to, although in most cases you’ll use the desktop 
client to stay in sync. You’ll see options on the left for favoriting files 
and folders, plus sharing them with others. Highlight a file in the 
list, and you’ll see options for sharing and downloading it [Image e], 
plus “Versions”—OwnCloud can store multiple versions of a file, 
enabling you to roll back should you need to.
9
COnfIgure desktOp ClIent
If you’ve not already done so, download and install the 
OwnCloud client on your desktop or laptop—it’s broadly 
the same process on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but we’ll focus on 
the Windows client. When you launch it for the first time, you are 
prompted to connect to your server [Image f]—use the following 
syntax to do so:
 https://192.168.0.2:8081/owncloud
>> Substitute your NAS’s IP address and the port 
number assigned to OwnCloud, and ensure it’s an https:// 
connection. Click “Next.” You get a message about an 
untrusted certificate, so ensure it’s correct, check “Trust 
this certificate anyway,” and click “OK.” Enter your 
OwnCloud username and password, and click “Next.”
10
let’s get synChed
Choose your sync settings—click the user data 
folder to choose a different location. If it already 
contains data, be sure to select “Keep local data,” so it’s 
synched to your server. You can choose to sync everything 
from the server, or selectively sync certain folders only 
[Image g]; you can also opt to receive confirmation before 
synching anything over a certain file size (500MB by 
default). Once done, click “Connect,” and OwnCloud starts 
to sync. Two buttons let you access OwnCloud through your 
browser or the local folder you’re synching to, but you can 
ignore these; click “Finish.”
11
traCk prOgress
Click the “^” button next to the Taskbar Notification 
area, and you’ll see the OwnCloud cloud icon is now 
present. Click this to open the OwnCloud status window, 
where you can use the buttons to track the progress 
of your file sync. Click your username for an overview 
and to browse folders that have been uploaded (you can 
also selectively choose folders to sync from here, too, 
should you wish). A handy link to the OwnCloud browser 
configuration page is also accessible.
>> The “Activity” button enables you to get an overview of 
activity—use “Sync Protocol” to review the latest changes, 
while “Not Synched” provides you with a list of files waiting

to be uploaded or downloaded. The “General” button provides 
you with access to client settings, such as enabling desktop 
notifications, and whether OwnCloud should automatically start 
with Windows. Use the “Network” tab to apply bandwidth limits 
to upload and download speeds—we recommend ensuring there 
are no limits during the initial sync, particularly if you have a large 
amount of data to upload to the OwnCloud server.
>> Remember, you can install the OwnCloud client on all your 
desktops and laptops—repeat steps 9–11, and you’ll soon have data 
synching between all your computers, with a backup copy residing 
on the server or NAS.
12
wIden yOur aCCess
As things stand, a locally installed OwnCloud server 
is only accessible through your home network. That’s 
good from a security point of view, but you may have reasons for 
wanting to be able to access your data or sync while outside your 
home network. To do this, you should first sign up for a Dynamic 
DNS (DDNS) service. Your NAS manufacturer may offer such a 
service (QNAP users should check out myQNAPcloud, for example 
[Image h]), or you can sign up with a third-party service, such as 
www.no-ip.com, that’s supported by your router. If you choose the 
latter option, you need to configure your router for remote access—
if possible, force secure connections, and change the router 
password to something stronger. Also consider strengthening 
your NAS’s protection—switch on two-factor authentication, for 
example, to prevent drive-by hackings.
13
COnfIgure ddns as trusted dOMaIn
Once set up in your router, open your web browser and 
type the following: “https://yourname.ddns.net:8081/
owncloud/” substituting “yourname.ddns.net” with your dynamic 
DNS address, and “8081” with the port you use to connect to your 
I
H 
OwnCloud server locally. You’re shown a message telling 
you that you’re attempting to access OwnCloud through an 
untrusted domain—try clicking “Add ‘yourname.ddns.net’ 
as a trusted domain.” If this works, you can now connect 
to your OwnCloud server through the web, or by setting 
up a separate connection in your OwnCloud client to the 
DDNS address.
>> If this doesn’t work, you need to manually edit the 
OwnCloud config.php file [Image I]. If you can access 
it through your NAS’s file manager (on QNAP drives, 
for example, you’ll find it under Web\owncloud\config), 
download the config.php file to your hard drive, then create 
a copy of the original file called config-old.php. Edit the 
config.php file in your text editor by locating the “trusted 
domains” section, and adding the following line inside 
array () below the line trusting your NAS’s IP address:
 1 => ‘yourname.ddns.net’,
>> Save the file, then upload it back to the config directory. 
Either reboot your NAS or stop and restart OwnCloud, then 
you should find you now have remote access. 
We strongly recommend you force OwnCloud to use a secure 
SSL-encrypted connection to improve privacy, even when 
transmitting over your own network. To do this, you need to 
add an SSL certificate to your NAS or server—a guide to doing 
this manually can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/
serverguide/certificates-and-security.html.
Any decent NAS should offer a simpler option, though—
for example, QNAP users who set up DDNS through 
myQNAPcloud should open the app and select the “SSL 
Certificate” tab. From here, you can either purchase an SSL 
certificate from QNAP (www.myqnapcloud.com—$45 for 
three years), or choose the free option from Let’s Encrypt.
QNAP users using their own DDNS address should 
instead open the Control Panel and navigate to “Security > 
Certificate & Private Key,” where you can create and use a 
free certificate from Let’s Encrypt.
Once configured in your NAS, you should find OwnCloud 
recognizes the SSL certificate when you switch to secure 
connections, although the first time you connect using the 
desktop or mobile client, you’ll see a warning appear—verify 
that the certificate is the one you created, check the box, and 
opt to trust it. Going forward, you won’t be prompted about the 
certificate again.

It’s a good idea to take vsync completely out of the equation 
before heading into frame limiter territory. However, it’s also 
a good idea to make sure vsync isn’t actually the answer to your 
problems. If you’re gaming on a 60Hz monitor, say, and you’re 
being tormented by frame dips above 60fps, turning vsync on is the 
best solution, because it locks the fps output to an even division of 
that refresh rate. Plus, you get to eliminate screen-tearing in the 
process, which is a nice little kickback. 
>> However, when running old games, trying to even out dips 
below 60fps, or looking to reduce power output and temps caused by 
unnecessarily high frame rates, limiters are the way to go, because 
they cap menu screens and cinematics, too. Make your call, and 
proceed. There’s also the world of frame limiting to improve vsync 
lag—we’ll get to that later.

turn off vsynC
For Nvidia cards, head to the Nvidia Control Panel and set 
“Vertical sync” to “Off” in “Global settings” [image a].  For 
Counterintuitive as it may seem to the PC enthusiast, sometimes your frame rate is too high. 
It might be that your fondly remembered classic game is running like a VHS tape stuck on fast 
forward, because it was never designed to run on those four GTX 1080s you plumped for. It may be 
that you’re getting a variable frame rate in a game that doesn’t offer its own limiter or vsync option, 
and you’re sick of the stutter, even above 60fps. Or, after several alarmingly high electricity bills and 
considerable hearing loss from listening to your red-hot GPU whine and blow a gale, you might 
decide that, actually, 2,500fps is more than you need in Counter-Strike: GO. 
The reasons are multitudinous, and consequently the methods are, too. You’ll want to take a 
different approach if you’re frame-limiting an old game on an Nvidia card, for example, than if your 
objective is locking out a solid 60 in a DX12 title with AMD silicon in your PC. Happily, although 
the methods vary, they’re unilaterally simple, and basically amount to finding the right option in 
the right screen, entering a figure, and checking a box. But, oh, the satisfaction of seeing that 
unwavering number in the top-left…. –PHIL IWANIUK

to provide any number of complicating factors that you 
could do without.

enable Msi afterburner’s fraMe Counter
In order to check that your limiter is working once 
you’ve set it up, you need a good, reliable counter 
overlay. FRAPS once ruled the roost, but doesn’t play nice 
with DirectX 12, and common alternatives from Steam, 
Nvidia, and AMD can be a little limiting. For that reason, we 
pick MSI Afterburner. 
>> Don’t worry, it works fine on non-MSI cards of both 
denominations, but it does take a bit more setting up than 
usual. Hit the cog button on Afterburner’s main overlay, 
and you’ll find an options screen, with several tabs at the 
top. Navigate to “Monitoring,” check the “Frame rate” 
option, then the “Show in on-screen display” option below 
that [image b]. Do the same for GPU temperature and fan 
speed, so you can see the benefits of your limiter. In the

set a liMiter
So, your love for Interstate ’76 is undying, but trying to 
play it with a frame rate well into the hundreds results in 
unmanageable handling. We’ve all been there. Setting a limiter 
solves your problems, and brings the game back down to a playable 
speed, but it’s not always plain sailing. For example, if the game 
in question is so old that it’s using a software renderer, or you’re 
emulating a 3dfx card to run it in the first place, setting a limiter 
in many programs doesn’t work, because the game isn’t trying to 
communicate with your graphics drivers directly, in the same way 
as a modern game does. 
>> For newer games, it’s less of a dark art, but in both cases, we’ve 
found Nvidia Inspector to be the best program for—you guessed 
it—Nvidia cards. Locate the spanner and screwdriver symbol in the 
program’s UI, and you’ll open a huge options screen. Simply find 
“Frame rate limiter” under the “Sync and refresh” header, and 
select your target fps [image C]. 
>> The good news for AMD gamers is that Radeon’s Frame Rate 
Target Control utility, bundled into Radeon Software, is actually 
pretty effective. Under “Game settings,” find or add the game you 
want to cap, and scroll the bar along to the desired frame rate. And 
if that doesn’t work, we found RivaTuner Statistics Server to be a 
decent contingency plan for AMD cards, too.

reduCe vsynC lag
Vsync has a lot to do in a very short space of time. In the 
process of arranging your GPU’s frames and serving them 
at just the right time for your monitor’s refresh rate, a bit of input 
lag can creep in. However, introducing a limiter can reduce that lag. 
Using the methods described in the previous step, you can set a 
limiter of 58fps to achieve a smoother experience on a 60Hz monitor 
with vsync enabled, 73fps for a 75Hz display, and so on.
6
test the results
This is where the GPU temp and fan speed readouts in 
the Afterburner overlay come in handy. Load up the game 
you want to limit [image d], hit that shortcut key, and observe the 
overlay. You should see a lovely consistent frame rate, and reduced 
load on your card. Measuring vsync lag is a less exact science, but 
hopefully you’ll feel a difference at 58fps.

No, we’re not joking. Having 
too many frames per second 
is admittedly extremely rare 
when you’re relying on an 
integrated graphics solution 
to do all the heavy lifting 
in your games, but there 
are cases when setting a 
limiter makes sense. Laptop 
battery life can be extended 
massively, for example, by 
capping the frame rate. If 
you’re getting performance 
in the mid-40s anyway, a 
30fps cap doesn’t adversely 
affect 
your 
experience, 
but does gain you lots 
more unplugged time. The 
bad news: It’s harder to 
find a program to limit 
frames on Intel graphics.

Set Up Your Own 
Raspberry Pi Wiki
1
Prerequisites
We’re going to assume you have a few things in place first of 
all. You need a working installation of Raspbian Jessie, which 
you can download from www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian 
and write to an SD card, and your Pi needs to be connected to a 
network. It’s also handy to be able to access it headlessly—run  
 sudo raspi-config  from the Pi command line, switch on the SSH 
server, and reboot to be able to access your Pi terminal from a 
Windows application such as PuTTY (www.putty.org). Finally, you 
need to find the IP address of your Pi in order to connect to it, by 
looking it up on your router, or by typing  ifconfig  into the terminal.
2
uPdate and install
In the Linux shell, run  sudo apt-get update  to make sure 
your Pi is looking for the very latest software packages, then  
 sudo apt-get upgrade  to pull everything on your system up to the 
most recent version. Now we can use “apt-get” to pull in a bunch 
of packages at once: Type  sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 
libapache2-mod-php5  to download and install the A and P portions 
of the LAMP equation, along with a bunch of packages on which they 
depend [image a]. All being well, that’s everything you need to do to 
start hosting HTTP content—you can now head to a web browser on 
any machine in your network, and type your Pi’s IP address into the 
address bar to see the default Apache landing page [image B].
The RaspbeRRy pi is peRfecT for a vast number of single-serving uses, and it’s cheap enough 
and light enough on power usage that you can reasonably keep one running at all times. What we’re 
doing here is more of a secondary purpose; it doesn’t matter what you’ve got your Pi doing day-to-
day, because having it host a web page or two, or serve as a base for your HTML experiments, barely 
taxes the little board at all.
Our aim is actually twofold: to install a LAMP bundle—Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP—to give 
us everything we need to run and serve web applications, and then to install some useful web 
software on top of it, to really take advantage of our intranet. What better practical application for 
what is essentially your own home intranet than a personal wiki? It’s the perfect place to make 
notes about your personal affairs, keep grocery lists, and share important information with your 
whole family. We’ll install the big boy of the wiki world in the form of MediaWiki, the software that 
powers Wikipedia—but keep this inside your local network, and be cagey about precisely what you 
host, because we’re not exactly locking this data away. –Alex Cox

Create a dataBase
You can now start hosting flat HTML pages to your 
local network by placing them in the “/var/www/
html/” directory on your Pi. But that’s a bit boring. To take 
things further, and install some serious web applications, 
you need a database running, and MySQL is the most 
straightforward choice. Run  sudo apt-get install mysql-
server mysql-client php5-mysql  in a terminal to get the 
necessary components, then set a password for your all-
powerful MySQL root user when prompted [image C]. Make 
sure it’s secure and memorable, as ever.

download Mediawiki
Nearly done with installations now—run  sudo 
apt-get install mediawiki imagemagick php-
apc  to get the final few components we need, including 
MediaWiki. Type  sudo nano /etc/mediawiki/apache.conf  
to open a MediaWiki configuration file, then remove the # 
from the third line down. Hit Ctrl-X, then Y to save changes, 
then run  sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf  to open 
the Apache configuration file, and add the line  Include /
etc/mediawiki/apache.conf  to the bottom, before exiting 
and saving as before. Reboot with  sudo reboot .

set uP the wiki
Head over to your web browser, and type your Raspberry 
Pi’s IP address followed by “/mediawiki”—if you see the 
sunflower graphic, everything’s going well. Click “Set up the 
wiki,” set your language, and MediaWiki pokes at your Raspbian 
installation to make sure it has everything it needs to run. If you get 
the green light (and, at this stage, there’s no reason you shouldn’t), 
scroll down, and click “Continue.” The only thing you need to enter 
on the next page is the MySQL password you set earlier—leave 
everything else as it is, and skip the subsequent page altogether. 
Give your wiki a name, assign a username and password to the 
wiki’s administrator—that would be you—and click the radio button 
that suggests you’ve had just about enough of all this, then click 
“Continue” a couple of times to finish the installation. There’s going 
to be a few minutes here when MediaWiki seems to have hung, but 
give it a little time.
6
PlaCe the Config
Now, as though that installation was far too easy, you’re 
given a configuration file [image d], which you need to place 
in the “/var/lib/mediawiki/” folder. If you’re doing the configuration 
on the Pi desktop, just open a terminal, and type  sudo mv 
Downloads/LocalSettings.php /var/lib/mediawiki/ . Or, if you’re 
accessing your Pi remotely, use an FTP package, such as Filezilla 
(http://filezilla-project.org), to drop the downloaded file in the same 
directory, overwriting the one that’s there [image e].
7
CheCk it out
With that done, your wiki is ready to go: Just point a browser 
on your network to “192.168.1.10/mediawiki/” for example 
(switching that IP address for that of your Pi), and you’ll see the 
C
D
default page. One last thing to do: enable image uploads. 
Jump into a terminal on your Pi, and type  sudo chmod /var/
lib/mediawiki/images 755  to give proper permissions 
to the appropriate directory, then  sudo nano /var/lib/
mediawiki/LocalSettings.php  to open the config file for 
editing. Find “$wgEnableUploads,” and change its value 
from “false” to “true,” then find “$wgServer,” and add a 
hash symbol before it to comment it out. Hit Ctrl-X to save 
and quit, and you’re finished. 
E
Editing a wiki is simplicity itself, using a very straightforward 
markup language. Log in to your wiki with the credentials we 
set in step five, then click the “Edit” link, and type away, using 
the string of buttons at the top of the editing box to format text 
appropriately, or add links to images or files—upload these 
using the link in the left column. If you want to create a new 
wiki page, make a link to it by surrounding some text with 
[[double square brackets]], save your edit, and click the new 
red link to start editing it.
There are, of course, a bunch of slightly more complex 
ways to organize your pages, and the default main page 
includes a link to MediaWiki’s own site, explaining many 
of these. If you want to add additional functionality beyond 
flat pages—a calendar, perhaps—you need to install an 
extension. This is usually as easy as downloading a file and 
adding a line to the LocalSettings.php file; check out www.
mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Extensions_by_category to 
see what’s available.

Bend Perspective 
in Photoshop
1
EnablE GPU ProcEssinG
Perspective Warp needs to use your GPU. You don’t need a 
FireGL or Quadro—anything from Intel HD upward should do 
the trick—but it’s worth checking if you’ve got it enabled, otherwise 
the Oil Paint filter won’t work either. Head to “Edit > Preferences 
> Performance,” and check “Use graphics processor” in “Graphics 
processor settings,” and “Use graphics processor to accelerate 
computation” in “Advanced settings.”
 2
DEfinE PlanEs
To warp something like the corner of a building, you first 
need to define the planes. These are flat areas of the shape, 
and you can intersect planes to create corners. With your image 
open and background layer selected, head to the “Edit” menu, and 
select “Perspective Warp.” Photoshop provides some handy hints 
to take some of the mystery out of what you’re doing, and they do 
a good job of explaining it. You need to draw rectangles over the 
PersPective WarP was one of the new features in Photoshop CC that passed many people by. 
It seems complicated, brings back memories of the terrifying 3D interface, and requires a bit of 
preparation work before you see results.
In reality, it’s a much easier process than using Photoshop’s 3D tools, and as long as you follow 
the setup procedure, it’s quite simple to get something that looks good. 
Perspective is the relationship between objects in an image, and can usually only be changed by 
moving the camera and taking another picture. Even changing the lens you’re using doesn’t affect 
it, although focal length may alter the perceived distance between objects as they recede into the 
background, with a telephoto lens causing them to appear bunched up.
Perspective Warp enables you to alter the look of a 2D object, so it matches the background 
you’re compositing it on to, or mark out straight lines in an image, so that they don’t change when 
you warp the rest of the photo. –Ian EvEndEn

flat planes of the object in your image—so with the corners 
of a building, that means each side gets its own rectangle 
[image a]. This is Layout mode, and there’s a mode selector 
in the top-left. Drag out a rectangle, then move its corners 
so they’re in the corners of the plane you want to mark. You 
can join them together to cover corners of the building just 
by dragging their corners so they touch.
 3
WarP!
Once you’re done defining, you can get on with the 
warping. There are a couple of automatic options, 
or you can use the mouse. Change to Warp mode, and the 
rectangles you placed in Layout mode lose their grid lines, 
but otherwise stay where you put them. What’s new is that 
moving their corners now affects the image, rather than 
just changing the rectangles. The automatic options—
buttons to the right of the mode selector—are to straighten

near vertical lines, straighten near horizontal lines, and straighten 
both. If you’ve fallen prey to the phenomenon of converging verticals 
by taking a photo of a tall building with a camera that’s tilted back 
from vertical, this can help you out. It can even turn an image of a 
building’s corner into one in which both sides of the edifice appear as 
one continuous wall—although it can do strange things to any roads 
or trees also in the image if you do this. At any time, you can use 
the mouse to drag one of the corners—Photoshop now calls them 
“pins”—across the image for an even stronger effect [image b].
 4
try oUt somE tExt
If you’ve played Prey, you’ll have seen the text of the intro 
incorporated into the city when you take the helicopter ride 
right at the beginning. Being an entirely rendered experience, this 
wasn’t done in Photoshop, but you can achieve a similar effect. A 
text layer must be rasterized before you can warp it, but the app 
reminds you of this. Use the Text tool to add your text to an image, 
and make sure you’ve got the text layer selected before you select 
“Perspective Warp.” It’s also a good idea to move it roughly into 
the area you want it to end up, because trying to move it when in 
Warp mode sometimes fails. Rasterize as needed, then drag your 
rectangle in the Layout stage. When you begin to warp, concentrate 
on getting the perspective right, rather than anything else, as once 
you’re finished, the text can be moved or rotated again.

shaDoW Play
If your text is in the right sort of place within the 
image, you can make it stand out by adding a 
shadow. Add another text layer that says the same thing 
as the first, color it gray, and use Perspective Warp to 
bend it into a shadow for the first layer, to make the text 
appear as though it’s standing up within the landscape of 
the image—for example, if you’ve placed it on a lawn or a 
beach. Take note of the direction of other shadows in the 
image, because it won’t look right if your new shadow is 
pointing in a different direction. Once you’re done shifting 
the perspective, use a blend mode, such as Multiply, to 
make the shadow melt into the underlying image.
6
sEttlE in
To really settle your text into the image, hide the 
layer it’s on, and decide whether any parts of the 
underlying image should be in front of the text. Select 
them, feather the selection by a few pixels (“Select > 
Modify > Feather”) to soften the join, and use “Layer > 
New > Layer via copy” to copy them to a new layer. Move 
this layer to the front of the stack in the Layers palette,  
re-show the text, and it should now be part of the image, as 
though it was always there [image c]. 
C
What else?
As we rasterized the text layer before we warped it, the 
implication is you can use this technique on any raster 
layer—and that’s true. Say you want to composite a car 
on to a street scene, but the two were photographed at 
slightly different angles. Twist the car using Perspective 
Warp, and make it look as if it’s at a sharper angle to the 
camera. The changes are small, however, so for the best 
results, you might end up doing one shoot again, and 
getting the setup right. But for a slight shift, it’s more 
than good enough, as long as no one looks too closely!

Pi Camera: Take 
Timelapse Photos
1
CirCuit City
To build the circuit for this project, we need to place an MCP3008 
analog-to-digital converter on to the breadboard. Pay special 
attention to a dip in one end of the chip, which identifies the top of 
the chip. Pin 1, which is the first analog input, is located in the top-
left of the chip if we look at the chip with the dip at the top. 
>> Connect the MCP3008 to your Raspberry Pi as per the diagram 
shown below [image A]. The potentiometers are connected to 3V 
and GND rails, and their output is fed into the first two pins of the 
MCP3008. Our push button is connected to the GPIO and to the 
GND rail.
>> Next, insert the official Raspberry Pi camera into the camera 
port [image B], which is located either between the Ethernet and 
HDMI port of the model B series, or on the end of the Pi Zero board—
note that this requires a special adapter. The ribbon cable should be 
carefully inserted with the blue tab that’s facing the Ethernet port, 
and remember to lift the plastic guard on the port before inserting, 
then close the guard to lock the camera in place. Applying a small 
blob of modeling clay prevents the camera from making contact 
with the GPIO pins, which could damage the camera. Now connect 
your keyboard, mouse, and so on, and power up your Raspberry Pi 
to the desktop.

but ensuring that the subject of your photography is lit correctly can be a little 
tricky. In this project, we shall create a timelapse controller that has analog 
controllers for the brightness and contrast of the images to be captured. The files 
saved will also have a timestamp, to ensure that they’re captured correctly and  
can be reviewed in chronological order. –Les Pounder

click “File > New” to create a new blank file. Immediately 
save the file (“File > Save”) as timelapse-controller.py  
before carrying on. We start the code by importing the 
libraries that we will be using. These are “picamera,” 
used to control the camera; “GPIO Zero” for our analog-
to-digital converter and the push button; the “sleep” 
function is imported from the “time” library; and we’ll need 
“datetime” to create a timestamp later.
 from picamera import PiCamera
 from gpiozero import MCP3008, Button
 from time import sleep
 from datetime import datetime
>> Now we need to set up the channel connections to 
the MCP3008, tell the GPIO where our push button is 
connected, and create an object from the “picamera” 
library that makes it easier to work with:
 pot1 = MCP3008(channel=0)
 pot2 = MCP3008(channel=1)
 button = Button(17)
 camera = PiCamera()
>> To capture our images, we create a function that can 
be called later in our code. The function, called “capture,” 
starts with a “for” loop that iterates for a user-controlled

number of times. The “for” loop creates a timestamp—the time 
and date at that moment—then uses that value as a filename to 
capture an image. The loop then sleeps for another user-controlled 
duration before repeating:
 def capture():
    for i in range(timer):
        timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
        camera.capture(‘/home/pi/%s.jpg’ % timestamp)
        sleep(delay)
>> In order to see what the camera sees, we create a preview 
window. In this case, this window has a fixed resolution of 640x480, 
and is placed in the top-left of the screen (0,0). But, typically, the 
preview is full-screen.
 camera.start_preview(fullscreen=False, window = (0, 0, 640, 
 480))

try And try AGAin
Using a “try, except, finally” construction to handle any 
errors and the user exiting the code, we create two variables: 
“timer” and “delay.” The “timer” variable stores the amount of time 
in minutes that the timelapse should run for. The “delay” variable 
is used to store the delay in seconds between shots. Both variables 
capture user input from the keyboard, and convert it to an integer:
 try:
    timer = int(input(“How long in minutes should the timelapse 
 run for?”))
    delay = int(input(“How long is the delay, in seconds, between 
 shots?”))
B
>> Inside a “while True” loop, we now take the value of the 
potentiometer, typically between 0.0 and 1.0, and multiply 
it by 100 to give us a value to control the brightness and 
contrast of the image. Turning the potentiometers changes 
the value, and prints the new value to the shell:
    while True:
        brightness = round(pot1.value * 100)
        print(“Brightness”,brightness)
        contrast = round(pot2.value * 100)
        print(“Contrast”,contrast)
>> Use the “brightness” and “contrast” variables 
to update the preview window, showing the change in 
configuration. We then create the “settings” variable that 
contains both values:
        camera.brightness = brightness
        camera.contrast = contrast
        settings = “Brightness: “+str(brightness)+”  
 Contrast: “+str(contrast)
>> These settings are then printed to the Python shell, 
before being annotated to the preview window, typically 
at the top-center of the image. There’s a sleep step of 0.1 
seconds before the process is repeated:
        print(settings)
        camera.annotate_text = settings
        sleep(0.1)
>> Now our button is ready to start the timelapse 
sequence. When the button is held for two seconds, it calls 
the “capture” function (created earlier). This then captures 
a timelapse using the “timer” and “delay” variables that 
the user specifies.
        button.when_held = capture
>> We now come to the final part of the project. Here we 
have the “except” part of the construction. This handles 
the user exiting the application by pressing Ctrl-C, a 
keyboard interrupt. It stops the preview, then moves on to 
the “finally” part, where we print that the application has 
exited to the Python shell:
 except KeyboardInterrupt:
    camera.stop_preview()
 finally:
    print(“TIMELAPSE EXITING”)
>> Save the code, then click “Run > Run Module” to 
start. The preview window opens, and you can tweak the 
brightness and contrast using the potentiometers, set 
the timer and delay, then, when ready, press and hold the 
button to start the sequence. Now all you need to do is find 
a suitable subject to photograph over time. 
We recently had to create a timelapse 
video using images, and the first obstacle 
we faced was converting the timestamps 
into an ascending numerical order of 
images. Luckily, and thanks to a little 
Bash magic, we found a one-line shell 
script that managed to convert the 
timestamp images into numbers. We 
did this with a copy of all the images, to 
ensure that we had backups.
 $ ls | cat -n | while read n f; do mv “$f” 
 “$n.jpg”; done  
So, why did we capture the images 
with a timestamp? Well, this project 
can be used in scientific experiments, 
so capturing the time and date of each 
image means that we can review when a 
change took place, say watching cress or 
sunflowers grow.
To create the video we used avconv. 
This can be used with the Raspberry Pi. 
To install it, open the Terminal and type:
 $ sudo apt-get install libav-tools
We used it with a Core i5 laptop, because it’s 
much quicker in terms of performance. Now 
run the command in the same directory as 
the images we’ve just renamed. This will 
set the frame rate to 10fps, it will start 
from number 1 in the sequence of images, 
it sets the bitrate to 1,000k, and saves the 
file to test.mp4:
 avconv -r 10 -start_number 1 -i %d.jpg 
 -b:v 1000k test.mp4  
Now open the video using omxplayer, 
and enjoy the fruits of your labor.

Mounting the reservoir brackets on the SSD brackets 
at first seemed like quite a challenge—at least, until 
we delved into the box and found that EK includes these 
awesome bracket mounting stickers with its Revo D5 pump 
models. Simply line up your stickers, make sure there’s 
enough space between the two reservoirs, then you can 
go off and drill through the four mounting points with the 
appropriate drill bit. Drilling through this aluminum plate 
was a dream; it’s one of the few materials that feels both 
solid and soft when you’re drilling through it.

Marking up Mounting
boy, is this case a Monster! The Enthoo Elite can house two 
systems internally—a full sized XL-ATX and an ITX below—if 
you fancy it. And because of that, there are two sets of front I/O, 
meaning excess cables everywhere. On top of that, due to the 
phenomenal size of the case, Phanteks has included two of its 
own PWM fan headers, and a whole plethora of Velcro cable ties, 
including spares, to help cable-manage your system. The first 
thing we did here was strip out those two pump mounts seen 
below, and remove the left cable cover panel, so we could drill 
into it and the aluminum covers, to mount our two reservoirs. 
Speaking of which….

then caMe the tricky part. Once the holes were drilled 
through the aluminum bracket, we had to remove the sliding 
cable cover panel behind it to drill through that as well. 
Fortunately, it’s secured in place with simple Phillips head 
screws, so it’s simply a case of removing the necessary screws, 
taking the panel out, removing the plastic cable covers and any 
of the rubber mounting grommets for those aluminum panels, 
marking up where the holes need to be drilled, and going at 
it again. It’s worth noting that this steel panel was far more 
difficult to drill through than its aluminum counterpart, despite 
being about a third as thick.
here’s a shot of that top radiator mounted in place, 
with the four Corsair ML120 Pros securing it. It seems like 
a moot point, but on a chassis as big as this, correct fan 
orientation is imperative. We’re not talking about push 
versus pull here, but rather cable orientation. Find your 
cable routing holes, and orient your fans so the cables can 
reach those holes with ease. With the Elite being such a 
stupendously tall case, even with the two PWM fan headers, 
it’s imperative you get this right, because the fewer cables 
you have in the back, the better, and using fan splitters or 
headers is less than desirable.

once we had our reservoirs fitted, our next job was 
to mark up our pass-throughs. For this, we cut a few 
pieces of tube to length, installed the fittings on the res, 
and marked with a metal punch where we wanted to drill 
through the panel, using the tubing as guides. Both of these 
PSU compartment covers are removable sheets of 4mm 
aluminum, so we can remove them from the case, clamp 
them down, and drill through. The diameter of the hole 
necessary for the pass-through is 20mm. We ended up 
needing to use a spiral flute step drill bit to get through the 
panel, after attempting to use a traditional drill bit. The one 
on the left still works effectively, but the one on the right is 
clearly far cleaner, thanks to using the correct tool.
thanks to phanteks’s intuitive case design, these radiator 
brackets make installing the meaty 480mm radiators as easy as 
pie. Simply remove the bracket from the case by taking out the 
six attached thumb screws, then place it on top of your radiator, 
and mount your fans to your radiator, sandwiching the radiator 
bracket in the middle. We had to do this twice, though, because 
on our first attempt we managed to misalign the radiator a 
fraction, stopping us from securing the bracket in place. This 
meant we had to remove each individual Allen-headed screw 
(all 16 of them), shuffle the fans and radiator along, resecure 
them, then reattach it all to the top of the case.

it’s funny, but those two tiny pieces of tubing are some of the 
most difficult parts to create. It took around six attempts to 
get them the right length. Too long, and they’ll place too much 
pressure on the PCIe slots, and stop you from using a fixed HB 
bridge. Too short, and you run the risk of a leak. EK can sell you 
an FC Terminal dual-slot adapter, but you have to know ahead 
of time which slots you’re using, and it’s another $40 on top. To 
connect these two pieces of PETG, we took both the cards out of 
the motherboard, installed the two tubes, then carefully placed 
them back into the motherboard, before fitting the HB bridge 
again. It took some wiggling, but it looks a treat.
here’s where things got really tricky: figuring out 
how both loops would operate under the hood. The GPU 
was relatively simple—the bottom radiator connects to the 
pump, the pump goes to the right-hand tube of the GPU, 
pushes coolant into the first then the second GPU, then 
down, and out back to the radiator. The CPU loop, however, 
operates in reverse (with the coolant going in through 
the left), and its 480mm radiator at the top of the chassis 
required some inventive thinking about tubing runs to get to 
the right-hand reservoir, but more on that later….

dual loops and MeMory cooling

the undercarriage
MeMory cooling might seem a little excessive, and some 
would say it’s a lot of hassle and risk for little gain, but 
there’s no arguing about how good it looks. We knew from 
the get-go that we wanted to run two loops, like last year, 
so next we had to figure out how those loops were going 
to operate. We did a simple 90-degree bend on a length 
of tubing, then replicated that, before lining up the tubes, 
metal punching the floor, removing the panel (fittings, 
tubing, and all), and reaming through another two pass-
throughs, ready for our tinkering underneath.
here’s what we Mean by being flexible. This is our third setup 
of CPU tubing. First, we tried an overly complex tubing run from 
a single flat fitting on the CPU block to the right-angled fitting 
at the top of the memory block, which proved excruciatingly 
difficult to both bend and secure. Next, we used the same 
number of fittings as pictured, but with a short piece of tubing 
in between, which was at too tight an angle to secure. Lastly, we 
opted for this double U bend style, with all the fittings pointing 
upward. To do this, we heated up a larger area of the tubing, 
then slowly bent it around our deburring tool for the left side, 
and around an empty reservoir for the right.

here’s what we’re talking about. There are two tubing runs 
going from that top radiator, using two T-blocks, to the loop at 
the bottom of the chassis. Amazingly, the D5 pumps coolant 
from the pump, through the DDR4 on the left side, to the CPU, 
through the other set of DDR4 on the right, down, then back up to 
the radiator, using the right-hand side tubing run, where it cools 
it, goes back into the left tubing run, down, and then back to the 
pump. Ideally, we’d have preferred to use soft tubing here, but 
as it was our last day of shooting, we had no time to order some 
in, although it’s definitely on the cards for a future upgrade. This 
was also prior to our cable management run, which brings new 
joy to putting on that side panel.

there you have it: Dream Machine 2017, complete and 
ready to go. We went with red and white coolant: red for 
the CPU loop, and white for the GPUs. We mixed the white 
with Mayhem’s Silver Aurora concentrate to try to replicate 
the particle effect you see in the red coolant pictured. It’s 
great to indicate flow, and looks stunning. As for filling the 
loop, we disconnected all power from the motherboard and 
graphics cards, and used a 24-pin bridge on the ATX power. 
We also disconnected the pump that wasn’t going to be 
filled (as you should never run a pump dry). Then it’s simply 
a case of filling the res until it’s about two-thirds full, and 
cycling the power supply to prime the loop. 
dM 2017 took a lot out of our reviews editor. 
It was a mammoth task that took three 
months to plan, and over five days to build 
and shoot, driving everyone involved to the 
brink of insanity. Figuring out how the loops 
were going to operate, in which direction, 
and how the tubing runs were going to fit 
together was testing. Couple that with the 
modding of the panels to allow for the pass-
throughs, the careful cable management 
to ensure the CPU power reached, making 
sure the fans fell into place, the blocks were 
installed correctly, and everything else was 
a success, and it was incredibly draining.
At Maximum PC, we’re not afraid to admit 
when we make mistakes, and when it comes 
to the finer pursuits, such as liquid cooling 
and case modding—of which there was a lot 
this year—we still have much to learn.
Tubing runs can always be cleaner and 
tidier, but it was the DIY aspect of the modding 
that really caught us off guard—mounting 
the reservoirs and the pass-throughs in 
particular. Using the correct drill bit to get 
through that aluminum is imperative, as 
is using the right technique. We certainly 
could have been more precise. Working 
with the steel panel behind the reservoirs 
also proved tricky. If we did it again, we’d 
make sure that the pass-throughs below the 
GPU were better marked and separated, to 
make them more parallel, that the reservoir 
mounting in the back of the steel plate was 
cleaner, and that the tubing runs in the 
back of the chassis consisted of soft tubing, 
making it easier to route the tubing, tidy the 
cables, and be safer to transport.
That said, being flexible helped. There 
are 86 separate fittings in this build, in all 
sorts of combinations. The CPU block, for 
instance, uses two extension fittings at the 
base of the two G1/4-inch threads, followed 
by two 45-degree rotary fittings on each side, 
then a hard compression fitting on the end, 
to create an extended 90-degree fitting, with 
a bit more height to give some wiggle room 
with those top two tubing runs. Additionally, 
we used a combination of 45-degree 
fittings with unused pass-through fittings 
to connect two lengths of tube at the back 
of the motherboard tray, to enable us to run 
the loop from the uppermost radiator to the 
CPU pump at the bottom of the chassis. 
And, of course, finding some way of 
mounting the hard drives in the back of 
the chassis (potentially on the back of the 
reservoir tray) would have been far nicer 
than our solution, which was to mount 
them on the included Phanteks mounting 
trays, on the right, slightly above the bottom 
radiator at the front of the case. We removed 
them for the photo shoot, but it’s certainly 
possible to run them like that, forsaking a 
touch of airflow over that bottom rad.
Naturally, this isn’t where our story ends. 
We’d tested the CPU, memory, hard drives, 
and GPUs outside the chassis, before we 
liquid-cooled them, but the one thing we 
hadn’t done was test the motherboard. We 
just didn’t have the time, as it arrived on the 
day of the build—so, after all the tinkering, 
building, and filling of the loops, on first boot 
we received a memory error, implying that 
we either needed to change the memory 
channels, or reseat them. Less than ideal, 
given what our setup entails. In short, using 
the two T-blocks at the top of the chassis, we 
attached a ball valve, drained off the CPU 
loop, removed the memory blocks, reseated 
the memory, and the problem was solved. 
Such are the potential setbacks of hardline 
liquid cooling.
That said, all in all, it’s a phenomenal 
build. We’ll let our main feature do the talking 
as far as performance goes (see pg. 26), but 
it’s certainly a beauty to behold. Combine 
those looks with sub-50 C temperatures and 
minimal noise, and it’s hard to argue with 
just how nice a system it is. The big question 
is, where do we go from here?

Bleeding-edge GPUs have been coming 
thick and fast from Nvidia of late. This new 
Titan Xp board, for instance, finds itself 
among a family of at least three other 
seriously high performance graphics cards 
based on Nvidia’s smash hit Pascal family 
of GPUs.
We’ve had the GeForce GTX 1080 and its 
GTX 1080 Ti sibling, as well as the Titan X. 
Admittedly, only two of those are based on 
the bad boy GP102 graphics chip that sits 
supreme in the Pascal GPU lineup. But 
the point is that Nvidia has been cranking 
out big-money boards at a frightening rate 
over the last year or so.
That’s not going to change any time 
soon, what with Nvidia recently giving a 
sneak peak of an early board based on its 
upcoming Volta GPU architecture. The pace 
is relentless and Nvidia’s rival, AMD, is 
struggling to keep up. But Volta and AMD’s 
response are stories for another day. Right

now, we’re concerned with the ultimate 
manifestation of the Pascal architecture.
Titan Xp is, quite simply, the GP102 chip 
fully unlocked and unleashed, all 12 billion 
transistors of it. Count ’em. Unlike the GTX 
1080 Ti and Titan X boards, Titan Xp has all 
3,840 CUDA cores and 240 texture units 
switched on. Like the Titan X, it also has 
all 96 render outputs enabled, and thus the 
full meaty goodness of a 384-bit memory 
bus and 12GB of VRAM. Yum.
It also sports a Boost clock of 1,582MHz. 
That’s identical to the 1080 Ti and a smidge 
quicker than the Titan X. It all adds up to 12.1 
Tflops of processing power, and the title of 
undisputed heavyweight GPU champ. It’s 
the most powerful gaming card ever.
If all that constitutes objective fact, how 
you view it subjectively is another matter. 
The Xp clocks in at $1,200. On the one hand, 
that’s the same as the outgoing Titan X, 
meaning you get a little more for the same 
money. On the other, the 1080 Ti is barely 
over half the cost, at $699. 
Thus, the additional $500 buys you about 
7–10 percent more of everything: 7 percent 
more CUDA cores and texture units, 
9 percent more render outputs, and so on, 
compared to the 1080 Ti. At best, you’re 
looking at 10 percent better performance—
and, most of the time, not even that. Allow 
us to let you in on a non-secret: That’s not a 
big enough performance step that you will 
be able to feel the difference in games. 
What’s more, it’s not as though even the 
Titan Xp is infallible in terms of gaming 
performance. There is a long list of games 
that it can’t render smoothly at 4K with high 
levels of antialiasing enabled. One might 
argue that lots of AA at 4K is somewhat 
moot, and that’s probably true for 4K panels 
from 32 inches and down in terms of size. 
But on a big 40-inch-plus 4K panel, you’re 
going to want to run AA, and sometimes 
it will be AA of the performance-sapping 
MSAA variety. At that point, you’re going 
to be pretty pissed that your $1,200 GPU 
can’t handle the heat, and you find yourself 
knocking it down to 2x MSAA, or switching 
it off altogether to get nice frame rates.
Not that you’ll do any better with some 
other GPU. The Titan Xp is as good as it 
currently gets. And a lot of the time, it’s very 
good indeed. Paired with a sub-4K gaming 
panel, the result is often ridiculously 
smooth gaming performance. But the 
price creates expectations of something 
stellar, something completely different, 
an experience unlike any other. And that 
simply isn’t the case. If you absolutely 
positively must have the best, this is it. But 
the regular 1080 Ti, if such a thing as a $699 
GPU can ever be called “regular,” is a far, 
far better buy. –Jeremy laird

Nvidia’s latest uber 
GPU inevitably

sep 2017

For the past six months, we’ve spent 
time with more than a dozen machines—
benchmarking, 
playing 
games, 
and 
generally working—to determine the best 
gaming laptop. What stuck out more than 
anything is that gaming laptops are thinner 
and lighter than ever. Thanks in a large part 
to Nvidia’s Pascal architecture (the GTX 
10-series GPUs), which offers excellent 
performance at lower temperatures than 
generations past, the latest crop of gaming 
laptops offer superb power in a shell that’s 
thin and light, free from huge, bulky fans. 
At Computex this year, Nvidia revealed 
its new “Max-Q” design philosophy. In short, 
Max-Q is centered around finding the right 
balance between power and efficiency, in 
order to put high-performance graphics 
cards into the thinnest notebooks possible.
Asus’s ROG Zephyrus is the first Max-Q 
laptop we’ve tested, and it delivers on that 
promise of thin, quiet, powerful gaming, 
while measuring just 20mm thick when 
closed. To be clear, the Zephyrus’s GTX 
1080 is not as powerful as its desktop 
equivalent—or even one found in a (much 
bulkier) non-Max-Q laptop. In fact, it’s 
about 15 percent less powerful than those 
hefty mobile options—more on that later.
What it loses out on in raw power, the 
ROG Zephyrus makes up for in size and 
sound. The Zeph is significantly quieter 
than any gaming laptop we’ve seen. More 
impressively, all of these other “thin-and-

lights” have mostly sported GTX 1060 (or 
below) GPUs, so even if the Zeph’s GTX 1080 
is underpowered compared to a desktop 
GTX 1080, it’s still vastly more powerful 
than everything else called “thin and light.”
ThaT’s cool!
To keep temperatures cool (and stay quiet in 
the process), the Zephyrus has a somewhat 
awkward keyboard layout that gives way 
to a rather ingenious cooling solution. 
The keyboard is located right at the front 
of the chassis—where the touchpad and 
wrist rests are normally situated—with the 
touchpad smushed over to the right. This 
leaves the top half of the chassis—where 
the keyboard would normally sit—free for 
a meshed ventilation area. A number of 
fans sit here, sucking in air to cool the GPU, 
before spitting it out the back through a gap 
that opens up when the laptop is open.
The keyboard layout is a little awkward 
to use (the Zeph comes boxed with an 
external rubber wrist rest to improve 
things a little), but is far from unusable. 
More than anything, it means you’ll situate 
the Zephyrus a few inches further back on 
your desk than a normal laptop, which might 
be an issue if you lack desk real estate. 
Similarly, it’s even more awkward to use 
on your lap, though that’s not something we 
recommend in the first place.
In addition to the Max-Q GTX 1080, the 
ROG Zephyrus has all the standards of 
a current-gen gaming laptop: Intel Core 
i7-7700HQ CPU, 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM. 
It also features a 15.6-inch anti-glare 
wide-view panel, with a 1080p resolution, 
120Hz refresh rate, and Nvidia’s G-Sync 
technology. Those final two bits are the 
most important, because aiming for a 
higher frame rate at 1080p is a much better 
use of GPU power than attempting to run 
games at higher resolution.
As for performance, the Zephyrus 
outperforms the GTX 1070 laptop in gaming 
tests by about 5–10 percent, but falls short 
of the full-size laptop or desktop GTX 1080 
systems by 10–15 percent. Of course, the 
trade-off in performance is more than 
made up for by the Zephyrus’s sleek frame.
Of course, all that greatness is not 
without drawbacks—primarily cost. The 
ROG Zephyrus starts at $2,699, which 
sounds like a lot for its level of performance 
(by comparison, the ROG Strix GL502VS 
that it barely outperforms is roughly $1,000 
cheaper). But, in this case, you’re paying 
for the convenience of a sleek, tiny frame, 
and the engineering required to keep 
everything cool and quiet. –Bo moore

When is a laptop not a laptop? When it’s a 
convertible. It’s not a great joke, and it isn’t 
much of a differentiator in real terms either, 
but it’s enough for HP to take on the road. 
While you can achieve some cleverness 
thanks to the extra flexibility of the screen 
hinge, you’ll either use it as a laptop or as 
a tablet (on steroids). HP claims it actually 
has five modes, with “presentation,” 
“media,” 
and 
“conference” 
rounding 
things out, but you’ll rarely (i.e. never) 
use these, even in an office environment. 
Don’t completely dismiss its overly athletic 
flexibility, though, because there’s a lot to 
love in this svelte and versatile system.
Just to return to the convertible concept 
a second, they’re pretty hard to sell, so we’ll 
forgive HP its hyperbole of the EliteBook’s 
five modes. Essentially, though: Take a 
standard laptop, pop a fully rotatable hinge 
on it, and a touchscreen display, add a 
smattering of screen-orienting tech, and 
you end up with a machine that can work 
in multiple ways. They’re quite fun to use, 
especially when they’re as light as this, and 
as pleasing to hold. You can do far more 
than with a normal tablet, with the option of 
using it in more ways than a typical laptop. 
There’s another cunning inclusion 
here, that really brought the machine 
into its own: The HP Active Pen 
may set you back another $60, but 
we see it as a necessity for anyone 
looking to make the most of the 
HP’s versatile convertible flexes its agile form

Flipping the screen all the way around and

The fact it can be clipped to the side of 
the machine for easy access makes it a 
trouble-free accessory to keep with you.
All work And no plAy
While we have been won over by the form 
factor, the same can’t quite be said for 
the internal component selection. We are 
unashamed performance junkies here on 
Maximum PC, so anything less than a real 
Core i7 has us wary (especially at this price). 
The fact that this uses a “Core i5-7300U”—
which, it turns out, is more like a Core i3 (as 
in it has only two cores and four threads)—
means it has a tough job of winning us over. 
We were momentarily hopeful about the 
M.2 SSD, but our benchmarks proved that 
this wasn’t anything to get too excited about 
either. Raw performance isn’t its forte. This 
is unashamedly a work machine, so you’ll 
search in vain for anything approaching 
decent gaming performance (we’re not 
going to mark down a work machine for 
this, though). 
There are a couple of counters that 
explain this component selection. First, the 
svelteness of the machine certainly helps 
win us back on side—it’s a shade under 
15mm and weighs under 3lb. The low-
power nature of the components means 
it doesn’t get too hot either, so even at full 
load, it doesn’t need excessive cooling. 
You can tell when it’s working that little 
bit harder, but it never makes a nuisance 
of itself due to overzealous fans. It’s worth 
noting that you have a couple of USB Type-A 
slots to plug things into, too, which means 
you don’t have to carry around a startling 
array of convertors. 
Where the EliteBook x360 really excels, 
though, is in the stamina stakes. It will 
quite happily stick with you through a 
whole day of work, and it’ll still be going 
strong long into the evening. We clocked in 
at around 13 hours playing back HD movies. 
Not bad going by anyone’s standard. This, 
coupled with the thin and light nature of 
the machine, makes for a great travel 
companion, even if it doesn’t quite scream 
the kind of raw power that we’re used to 
seeing here on Maximum PC. –alan Dexter

Choose between pixels and performance. 
That’s the new LG 34UC79G’s core 
proposition. 
More 
specifically, 
at 
34 
inches and with a 21:9 aspect ratio, you 
might expect LG’s gaming panel to pack 
3440x1440 pixels. Instead, it rocks a mere 
2560x1080, a resolution we’re more used to 
seeing on 29-inch superwide monitors.
The performance implications of that 
lower resolution are twofold. For starters, 
it allows the 34UC79G to crank out a 144Hz 
refresh rate over a standard DisplayPort 
1.2 
connection—3440x1440 
at 
144Hz 
requires too much bandwidth. Then there’s 
the minor matter of GPU performance. 
The more pixels you have to pump, the 
more load you put on the GPU. In simple 
terms, 3440x1440 is getting on for double 
the number of pixels of 2560x1080. Fewer 
pixels mean less load and more frames.
There are, of course, downsides. That’s 
obvious the moment you fire up the LG. 
Immediately, the coarseness of the pixel 
pitch is apparent. As a corollary, you don’t 
get a lot of desktop real estate, either, 
despite the generous 34-inch proportions. 
The 1,080 vertical pixels feel especially 
stingy, and result in a lot of scrolling 
around web pages and other documents. 
Put simply, at this price, there are far 
better options for pure productivity.
It’s not the most stellar monitor when it 
comes to image quality, either. Yes, it’s an 
IPS panel. But it won’t blow you away with 
its punch and vibrancy. The backlight lacks 
zing, and the standard calibration crushes 
some details in darker tones. A little dither-
related pixel fizz is also visible in gradients.
As for pixel response, it’s good enough 
for the gaming remit and to cash in on 
that 144Hz refresh rate, but it’s not going 
to scare the best TN panels. The gentle 
curve is also a little perplexing. If you buy 
into the idea of a curved monitor, you’ll be 
disappointed. If you don’t, well, you won’t 
want any curve at all. That said, the IPS 
tech does deliver fantastic vertical viewing 
angles and a nice color balance overall.
If all that sounds like we’re down on the 
34UC79G, there’s no doubting it delivers 
in game. If you have a powerful GPU, the 
34-inch widescreen panel zipping along at 
100-plus frames per second is a sight to 
behold. In terms of response and fluidity, 
there is no beating a high-refresh panel. On 
a related note, if you have an AMD graphics 
card, LG includes support for the FreeSync 
adaptive 
refresh 
technology.

equally no doubting that adding pixels 
would somewhat undermine that sense of 
slick, lag-free performance.
Elsewhere, you get a pretty good 
looking display in terms of the design of 
the stand and chassis. The 34UC79G sports 
LG’s latest design language, with very thin 
bezels on three sides, plus a small chin 
along the bottom. As this is a gaming panel, 
it eschews the white-and-silver aesthetic of 
a number of new LG monitors for black and 
red. Whatever the look of the thing, it’s very 
nicely put together and assembles neatly, 
thanks to a stand that clips efficiently into 
the rear of the screen enclosure.
The 34UC79G’s on-screen control menu 
will likewise be familiar to LG fans. There 
are lots of options, though accessing them 
through the single joystick-style button on 
the base of the lower bezel can be tricky.
All of which makes LG’s latest a niche 
proposition. As a productivity tool, it’s 
limited by the relatively modest 2560x1080 
native resolution. That has an impact on 
the crispness of the image quality, too. 
However, for gaming, the 34UC79G has to 
be worth a look. It’s well priced for such a 
large IPS screen, and the 144Hz refresh 
and FreeSync support make for a fantastic 
gaming experience. –Jeremy laird

The reasons to go ITX for your next build 
are manyfold: You reclaim valuable space; 
you need fewer cans of compressed air 
to clean it; and now, thanks to BitFenix’s 
latest model, you can pretend you built a 
rig inside one of Portal’s sentry turrets. 
Perhaps the reason ITX isn’t the 
dominant form factor is that you need 
to make compromises in the name of 
compactness, although they aren’t as 
significant today as they once were. In 
the Portal’s case, you need a smaller SFX 
power supply to power your diminutive 
machine, and you’re limited to a single 
GPU that takes up a maximum of two slots. 
Neither is a big surprise for an ITX case, 
but we also recommend going as modular 
as possible with that PSU to minimize 
unnecessary cables, as this case’s unusual 
interior design doesn’t leave much room 
between PSU and drive bays.
There are benefits to that design, 
though. Rather than giving you access 
to the components via a removable side 
panel, BitFenix instead opts for a frame 
within a frame, so your entire build lives 
in an interior chassis that’s accessible via 
a ball-bearing runner. It’s also oriented so 
that your graphics card lies “upside down” 
at the very top of the case, visible through a 
perspex window on the top panel, although 
variants without the window are also 
available. In practice, this allows easy 
access to some usually hard-to-reach 
parts, and makes cleaning the PC much 
easier—just pull it out, bust out that air 
can, and push it back in. It does mean it’s 
a bit more tricky for cable management, 
though. Certain cables can be tied in place 
on the interior frame, but those connected 
to the case itself—case fans, power button, 
and so on—must have enough slack to 
allow the interior frame to run out past the 
exterior. It’s a little like building a ship in a 
bottle in that way. 
With a system built inside, the exterior 
features of the Portal are kept minimal

to stay in line with that Valve-inspired 
aesthetic. A single power button graces the 
front panel, and along one side are two USB 
3.0 ports next to inputs for headphones and 
a mic. At the rear, an additional bracket is 
fitted over the GPU screw holes on the case 
to allow easier access to the thumbscrews, 
and two large gaps at the top and bottom 
provide exit points for the hot air as it’s 
pushed through from front to back, helped 
along by a single 120mm fan at the front 
and an 80mm fan at the rear. There is room 
for a 120mm radiator to be fitted instead of 
that 80mm fan if you opt for a more heavy-
duty CPU cooling solution, though. Below 
the interior frame there’s also plenty of 
room at the base for hot air from your PSU 
to disperse. For a case this size, which 
appears so solid and unventilated at first 
glance, airflow actually looks ample in 
the Portal. 
But let’s be honest, if this case piques 
your interest, it’s probably due, in large 
part, to its looks. In person, as it were, 
those looks hold up well. The aluminum 
panels are well finished and feel sturdy 
enough 
that 
transporting 
a 
built-up 
machine shouldn’t do any damage, and 
it’s nicely topped off with a black or white 
powder coat, depending on your taste. 
The only question mark comes in that 
runner design, which is fine for the initial 
build, but doesn’t feel smooth or robust 
enough to endure repeated action in the 
long term, for frequent cleaning or regular 
upgrades, without exhibiting a bit of wear 
and tear. So, was this indeed a triumph? 
Unfortunately, the Portal falls just shy, but 
its looks and interesting design read big in 
the plus column. –PhIL IWanIUK

We have spat so much bile about the trend 
for adulterating mundane hardware with 
extra buttons, switches, lights, and other 
pointless frippery in these pages that you 
might presume there’s a Maximum PC-
wide stance on such things. There is not. 
The team is torn. Some love a pretty thing; 
others would rather functionality took 
precedence. The Pulsefire FPS seems 
determined to either further divide or 
finally unite our two camps—HyperX’s 
scientists must have toiled hard in the 
hardware labs to find a formula for the 
most middle-ground mouse possible.
First of all, purists rejoice: It’s visually 
subtle, neither overdoing the pizzazz nor 
shaped like an art project that’s been left 
too close to a space heater. Yet even the 
grumpiest among us must admit there’s a 
certain sexy charm to this thing. Glowing 
red LEDs—just glowing, not flashing, or 
pulsating, or doing anything other than 
being red—highlight the palm end and 
mouse wheel, with a single RGB LED 
switching color, used for a practical reason, 
but granted some beautiful shades, to 
show what resolution it’s running at. The 
top shell is one smooth-textured piece 
of plastic, perfectly shaped for mousing 
with the heel of your hand on the desk, 
the stiffness of the plastic adding slight 
additional resistance to the switches.
On either side, there’s a textured 
rubberized pad for additional grip; again, 
practical, and only lightly patterned for 
what seems like maximum efficiency, but 
definitely not unpleasant to look at. At the 
peak of the left edge sit two additional 
buttons, high enough that they don’t 
interfere with the average resting thumb 
position, but in no way uncomfortable to

Inside, things are similarly considered—not 
unique or flashy, but well-chosen, quality 
components that anyone can appreciate. 
The main microswitches, for example, are 
Omron’s well-regarded white-top variety, 
which feel solid and plenty clicky. The 
sensor beneath has similar mass appeal—
it’s a PixArt 3310, as seen in countless 
other mice in this particular market 
sector, and which was at one point in time 
considered the best sensor on the market. 
It can’t keep up with the 12,000 dpi pace of 
many enthusiast sensors, though those 
are apparently made for delicate souls 
who game gently within a half-inch square. 
For normal mousers, the 3310’s maximum 
dpi of 3,200 is plenty, and it’s generally 
accurate and glitch-free, as long as you’re 
using a good surface; it’s not over-friendly 
with reflections or plain textures.
Balance and usability for high-paced 
FPS games might have been in the front 
of HyperX’s minds when designing the 
Pulsefire FPS—there’s a pretty big clue in 
the name—but there’s no reason a gaming 
mouse like this can’t similarly appeal to 
desktop warriors. Indeed, the $49 price 
point means this is accessible to just about 
everyone. That price does explain a few of 
its weaker spots—the unit can feel rather 
light (though not flimsy) at only 3.3oz; its 
curvy shape won’t appeal to claw-grip 
aficionados; and there’s an odd division 
between the feel of the forward and rear 
side buttons. It also can’t be calibrated to 
your surface, unlike some competitors. 
The arguments in the office are over, 
though. 
We 
can 
all, 
caffeine-fueled 
adrenaline junkies and buttoned-down 
pencil-pushers 
alike, 
appreciate 
just 
how solid the Pulsefire FPS is for its 
price. Granted, none of us actually wants 
to own it—we would each spend our 50 
bucks on a mouse more aligned to our 
particular tastes—but that’s a different 
argument altogether. –alex Cox

You’ll either love the mesh design of 
Logitech’s new surround sound cans, 
or you won’t. They’re certainly a striking 
pair of closed-cup headphones in any of 
the four available colors. Our test sample 
came in “triple black,” and while it’s true 
that Logitech’s sports mesh design does 
help to keep the weight down to just 9.14oz, 
we didn’t notice that they were especially 
breathable. More noticeable is the G433’s 
tendency to collect and display dust in 
all those hard-to-reach dimples. Also 
included are a color-matched carry case 
and an alternative set of ear pads with 
a tighter weave, but they, too, have an 
unorthodox finish. Think faux chamois. 
They’re slightly more comfortable against 
the ears, and a bit easier to keep clean. 
But this isn’t Good Housekeeping 
magazine, and headphones are there to 
push sound into your ears. The G433s are 
better at that. Built with 40mm drivers just 
like their forefathers, the much bulkier 
G430s, these lightweight cans are capable 
of powerful bass, and that’s important. 
But more than that, they deliver said bass 
along a relatively flat frequency response, 
which means it doesn’t sound distorted 
at high volumes, or muddy up the overall 
sound. There’s a real alchemy to this, and 
it’s as much about construction materials 
as it is about drivers—so maybe we’re 
being harsh on that sports mesh after all. 
The upshot is that you don’t need to tweak 
any EQ settings manually or cycle presets 
for different activities—gaming, music, 
and so on—in order to get a rich sound. 
It’s not quite up there with Kingston’s now 
legendary HyperX Cloud, or Sennheiser’s 
higher-end models, but for $87, the sound 
can’t be faulted. Surround sound, provided 
digitally via DTX Headphone-X, provides a 
really wide and yet precise soundscape, 
which benefits both games and movies. 
Digital surround can be something of a 
lottery, but it works well here.

model, too, has shifted away from gaming 
alone and broadens out into a headset 
that Logitech hopes you will use for all 
your consoles and mobile devices, too. 
That much is evident by the total absence 
of RGB lighting and tribal motifs, but it’s 
more tangible in the additional cables that 
you’ll find bundled in the box. While the 
DTX Headphone-X digital 7.1 surround is 
only compatible with PCs, the additional 
4.9-feet cable enables you to hook this 
up to a PS4, Xbox One, or smartphone as 
a stereo headset. As for connecting to 
your PC, both USB and 3.5mm options are 
lavished upon you. 
So far, so good, then. There’s inevitably 
a “but” coming, though: There’s a couple of 
areas in which the G433’s concessions to a 
lower price point end up impacting upon the 
usability to a noticeable degree. Firstly, the 
microphone. We have no qualms about its 
sound quality or noise gate, but it’s difficult 
to get along with that non-retractable 
piece of bendy rubber it’s attached to. It 
feels like a relic from an already bygone 
era of gaming headsets, such is the pace of 
advancement and the widespread adoption 
of retractable or swing-arm designs that 
don’t intrude on your peripheral vision. Our 
only other gripe is with the inline remote, 
which is small and lightweight, as per the 
design brief, but actually quite awkward to 
use. The mic mute button is very stiff and 
requires concerted effort to operate, and 
finding the tiny volume scroll wheel takes 
some practice. 
All that nitpicking still leaves two good 
reasons to buy this G433 headset (two-
and-a-half if you’re into the mesh look): 
good value and solid sound. They’re good 
boxes to check. If we were building a 
headset, we’d make sure it sounded good 
before adding luxury to the inline remote, 
too. There are no real deal-breakers in this 
package, but you should know not to expect 
luxury from the mic or controls before 
making the purchase. –Phil iWANiuK

Pedal to the metal—if you didn’t leave it in a tree
Dirt 4
Thundering round the Michigan woods in 
a tuned hatchback may not be what you’re 
expecting 10 seconds into a new driving 
game, but that’s where Dirt 4 starts. No 
tedious training, just you and a Ford against 
the gravel. It should be simple, but we find 
ourselves in the trees more than we’d like.
Before that, Dirt 4 exists in a state of 
quantum uncertainty: Game or Simulation? 
Pick one, and you enter one of two parallel 
universes, in which the rules are subtly 
different to one another. Game mode is 
more entertaining, faster, an enjoyable 
blast round a track in a ridiculous vehicle. 
Simulation is much deeper, the tuning of 
your cars becomes vastly more important, 
and the whole game slows down as a result. 
In fact, you could call this two games. 
Game mode is a sequel to 2011’s Dirt 3, while 
Simulation follows 2015’s more hardcore 
Dirt Rally. The latter was better received, 
thanks to its racing purity, realism, and 
lack of reliance on the Gymkhana obstacle 
course mode. It seems what players want 
from a rally game is a technical challenge, 
not a whooping idiot smashing his car

burst of speed from a Landrush driver 
surprised us, but shunting him into the 
sidewall sorted that out. If Game mode is 
like this, where would Simulation take us?
Into the ditch, that’s where. Suddenly, 
tuning mattered, damage was mounting 
up, and the grip at the front of our car was 
gone. Those pace notes began to matter, 
and limited restarts meant we had to 
concentrate. Simulation mode needs to be 
approached in a very different way to Game 
mode, and it’s to the devs’ credit that they’ve 
incorporated two very different approaches 
into one package. –ian evenden
up. So, Gymkhana is gone. Its replacements 
are more thoughtful—the Landrush buggy 
and truck racing, around sandy circuits, is 
the first you’ll encounter, and makes a fine 
contrast to the woodland stages before it. 
The laps are short and the circuits not too 
twisty, otherwise all the racers would be 
sliding all over the place. Win that, and you 
do it all over again, this time in a pickup. 
The game is clever enough to keep the 
modes coming. A championship is over 
before you’ve had time to tire of it, and the 
next provides a different vehicle and surface 
to race on. Practice laps are available, but 
restarts are unlimited in Game mode, so 
you can treat every run as a practice. It’s 
this that exposes one of the downfalls of 
Game mode: It’s a bit easy. The co-driver 
may be reading pace notes during rally 
stages, and there’s a team radio to alert 
you to other cars and your performance in 
Landrush, but it’s too easy to zone these 
things out, and see nothing but the next 
corner and the red marker in the top-
right that denotes your placing. Having

Putting politicians in orbit never looked more inviting
Endless Space 2
The Tree loves us, we’re fairly certain. 
Its messages about trade agreements and 
our role in maintaining cosmic harmony 
certainly look affectionate. We don’t think 
a race of sentient plants could be warlike 
liars, but there’s a small chance they just 
see us as a future source of compost.
The affable arboreal astronauts are just 
one of Endless Space 2’s races, along with 
entrail-obsessed cyborgs, perky Grays, and 
humans. We’re deep in 4X territory here, 
pushing the boundaries of the genre set up 
by Civilization, and discovering light years 
of room for expansion beyond them. 
Pushing your boundaries is what the 
game’s all about, be they the literal borders 
of your empire, or the scientific limits that 
will allow you to explore new areas of the 
map, exploit resources, and crush your 
opponents. It also pushes at the boundaries 
of 4X game design a little, by being only a bit 
opaque and unfriendly to newcomers. 
Before the game gets its teeth into you, 
with its mix of turn-based empire building 
and interplanetary politics, the interface 
exerts its charm. Rather than oppressing 
new players with reams of stats, tiny 
icons, and scattered notifications, it 
takes a somewhat Microsoftian (eighth 
dynasty) approach, with screen-filling 
notifications—this time using some nice 
art, too. Another step toward friendliness 
and the enormous number of CPU 
calculations spread throughout the turn, 
so there’s no hiatus at the end. The map 
remains accessible throughout, so even 
when cunning plans are being hatched 
against you, you can admire your warships.
Endless Space 2 is a streamlining of the 
sci-fi 4X, which needed to be done. All the 
options are there (you need to design your 
own spaceships, but there’s an auto-design 
button), but can be easily cleared out of the 
way, so you can concentrate on the conquest 
of the galaxy. The interface makes it easy 
to get to grips with, but the game design 
includes all the depth, political intrigue, 
diplomacy, and violence you could need. It’s 
a triumph from French studio Amplitude, a 
game that provides a good starting point for 
those new to 4X, as well as offering plenty 
for veterans to chew on. –Ian evenden
The galaxy map is accessed 
often, and gives a lot of 
information at a glance.
is to make everything optional—you can 
turn off the tutorials, not be bothered by 
many notifications, and even opt out of 
the 3D space battles (we recommend this, 
as while the ship designs are interesting, 
watching the sides line up and take turns 
firing at each other soon begins to drag).
All of this is nice, but isn’t the heart of 
the game, which is found on the galaxy 
map and diplomacy screens. You have an 
entire galaxy to play with, but there are 
other civilizations waiting to get in the way, 
shoot holes in you, and generally ruin your 
plans. If you want to conquer known space, 
you need to negotiate your way past them, 
or leave them as a rapidly expanding and 
cooling cloud of plasma. Either works, but 
if you try the latter, you may come unstuck, 
unless you’re really, really sure.
The other races are a mixed bunch: 
some aggressive, others passive; some 
liars, others genuinely going to blow you out 
of space, and enslave your colonists. They 
all play by different rules, their colonization 
options dependent on things as diverse as 
colony ships or interstellar space roots, 
and once you’re out of the starting human 
empire faction, the differences open up. 
You’ll soon (well, after a few tens of hours) 
settle on a favored faction for multiplayer.
Performance is generally very good, 
never leaving 60fps on last-gen hardware,

Zak Storey, Reviews editoR
Dream machine 2017, you have ruined me. 
Five whole days of planning, stripping, 
drilling, 
installing, 
reworking, 
and 
rebuilding one of the biggest and most 
advanced systems I’ve ever worked on have 
left me mentally destroyed. It is certainly a 
thing of beauty, and an absolute beast of a 
machine, beyond anything I’ve ever worked 
on, but is it the Dream Machine for me? 
Ironically, probably not.
If you’ve been following my musings for a 
while now, you’ll know I am wholeheartedly 
dedicated to the ITX and microATX form 
factors. Bigger isn’t always better for me, 
and although the power toiling away within 
the bowels of this year’s DM is incredible, 
there’s little here that would affect my 
day-to-day activities in any meaningful 
manner, outside of the GPUs. However, 
if I want to migrate to a smaller rig than 
the ATX tower I have in my own home, the 
problem is two-fold: It all comes down to 
cases and processors. In short, for my next 
system, I’m craving a Ryzen eight-core CPU 
(preferably the Ryzen 7 1700)—problem is, 
there are very few motherboards on the 
X370 platform, in that form factor, and fewer 
still that operate well and look good. 
Ryzen, being the relatively power-hungry 
monster it is, demands a substantial amount 
of VRMs to operate effectively. Which is 
something you can’t easily pack into the 
ITX form factor without including a raised 
PCB, similar to what Asus used to do with 
its Impact series. And, secondly, outside of 
the Manta, there aren’t any cases that look 
good, have solid airflow, and support the 
liquid-cooling I want to introduce. 
For the time being, at least, it looks as 
though I’m stuck with my NZXT S310 Elite. At 
least until another ITX chassis launches that 
offers the same flair and support as the 
Manta. Or perhaps a desk PC would fit the 
bill better? Hmm, now that sounds like a 
solid idea….
It cost more than money to build this year’s Dream Machine
Blood, Sweat, and 
Millennial Tears 
If you’ve followed my last few 
Lab Notes, you’ll know my life 
has been consumed by laptop 
testing. This month continues 
that trend, save for one small but 
significant difference: I finally 
got the chance to test Nvidia’s 
new Max-Q design philosophy. 
As seen in my review of the Asus 
ROG Zephyrus (page 80), I’m 
excited about Nvidia’s promise 
of compact and portable laptops 
that don’t skimp on power.
The Zephyrus is still the only 
Max-Q laptop I’ve tested, but 
I’m planning time with other 
GTX 1080 systems soon, and it’ll 
be interesting to see how the 
different OEMs (Acer, Gigabyte, 
MSI, and Sager all have Max-Q 
models) 
interpret 
Nvidia’s 
philosophy—and how they stack 
up against their own kind, rather 
than non-Max-Q fare.
I’m also curious to see how 
the slightly lower spec Max-Q 
laptops hold up. Considering 
that the Zephyrus and its Max-Q 
GTX 1080 performed only slightly 
better than a desktop-class 
GTX 1070, it’ll be interesting 
to see how a Max-Q GTX 1070 
compares. If it’s only a small 
downgrade in performance, I 
can see Max-Q 1070 laptops 
becoming a favorite, offering 
the best balance of price, 
performance, and portability.
On the other hand, it’ll be a 
harder recommendation if the 
Max-Q philosophy pushes the 
1070 down closer to GTX 1060 
performance. Either way, we’ll 
know more soon.

Geek
Approved 
i’ve bought several Amazon tablets 
over the years, but they’ve generally 
been gifts for others. This changed 
recently when I grabbed a budget Fire 7 
for myself in the Amazon Prime Day sale. 
When a tablet sets you back just $30, it 
seems ridiculous not to have one to mess 
around with. Thirty bucks! Crazy. Even 
before being reduced, though, it’s still 
decent technology for just $50.
I had actually been planning on getting 
one for a while, as I’ve been intending to 
put CyanogenMod on my wife’s Fire 7, but 
didn’t want to risk leaving her without a 
working tablet (there’s always a chance 
of “bricking” any tablet with such a 
process). So, the plan was to grab a 
second Fire, try it out on there, then I 
could safely repeat the process on hers, 
so that she’ll have the full gamut of 
Android apps to play around with.
That was the theory. 
In reality, I still haven’t “upgraded” 
the tablet, because… Well, to be honest, 
it’s actually pretty good as it is. I’ve been 
using it to catch up on a bit of reading (so 
many friends have written books that 
I’ve got an impressive backlog to work 
through), and the apps that are available 
are much better than when I last looked. 
In fact, everything I can think of seems to 
be covered, even if it’s indirectly. It would 
seem that pushing out so many cheap 
tablets has made it a viable platform 
for developers, and while there may 
be some app that ultimately forces my 
hand, right now I’m just enjoying the 
crazy bargain as it was meant to be. –aD

Asustor As6208t
In the world of storage, 
more is better. There 
was a time when I 
thought a 1GB hard 
drive was substantial. 
I also remembering paying $300 for one 
when they’d just come out. These days, 1GB 
is absolutely puny.
Enter the Asustor AS6208T. I’ve been 
testing this unit for a while, fully loaded with 
eight Western Digital Red 6TB NAS drives. 
The Asustor is a business-class network 
attached storage device that has everything 
an enthusiast or home user would want: 
multiple Ethernet ports, USB 3.0, eSATA, 
and even HDMI and SPDIF output. Equipped 
with an Intel 1.6GHz quad-core Celeron and 
4GB of RAM, the AS6208T can even act as a 
standalone PC. That’s not to say you should 
use it as one, but if you’re looking for a beefy 
home-theater machine, a NAS such as this 
might just be worth it.
Asustor has NASes that support 10-gigabit 
speeds, but the AS6208T tops out at 1Gb 
Ethernet. For most users, this is enough, 
especially if the unit is serving up movies to 
your home theater machine directly.
Performance has been good so far, and 
I haven’t ever experienced slowdowns. The 
only nitpick is Asustor’s ADM software. It’s 
horrible, and Asustor could learn a thing or 
two from Synology or QNAP.

Not 
long 
after 
introducing 
direct 
streaming 
to 
Beam 
in 
Windows 
10, 
Microsoft changed the 
service’s name to Mixer. It now supports 
co-streaming, and has better cell phone 
support. The service is trundling along 
smoothly enough, but it still has the same 
problem that it did when we first saw it—
there just aren’t enough people using it.  
In case you didn’t know, the big two 
streaming services are YouTube and Twitch, 
and it’s the latter that rules the roost for day-
to-day streaming. This is where you’ll find 
gaming celebrities plying their trade, and 
where you can easily watch gamers playing 
games. If you’re struggling to understand 
why you’d want to watch someone else play 
a game, the parallels to sports are obvious, 
and there are plenty of streamers who are 
just downright entertaining, making the 
whole thing feel like a whacky radio station.
Twitch isn’t without foibles (the chat that 
accompanies a stream can be frustrating, 
to say the least), and with more viewers, 
the chance of interacting with the streamer 
becomes harder. So, in theory, Mixer could 
be the place to be, but with fewer watchers, 
you have fewer streamers, then it feels you 
don’t have the choice that you do on Twitch. 
It’s tough to make it in the tech world.

Comparing Cars
I know this is Maximum PC, 
but why use a Core i7-6950x  
processor costing $1,600 
when an i7-7700k at $300 
would be a much fairer 
comparison with Ryzen in 
both performance and cost. 
I’m a long-time subscriber, 
but this build-off makes 
Ryzen seem like it is the 
affordable performance 
option, when it is not. The i7-
7700k is as fast at stock, and 
can comfortably overclock to 
5GHz. Most comparison sites 
have the i7-7700k 9 percent 
faster than Ryzen, so it 
doesn’t seem like there’s a 
reason to compare a Ferrari 
with a Mustang, when a 
Camaro would be fairer. I 
think a rematch is in order: 
Ryzen versus Intel i7-7700k, 
and let the readers decide 
which makes more cents 
(pun intended). 
–OB
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: We 
actually did compare both 
of our workstation systems 
to the Core i7-7700k—that’s 
what we used as the zero-
point in the tests. And while 
the results varied for both 
machines, you’ll see, for 
instance, that Ryzen was 41 
percent faster in the X264 
benchmark, and 4 percent 
faster in the Gigapan test, 
although slower at the 
Premier Pro benchmark 
(by 9 percent). Ultimately, 
though, we were comparing 
high-end workstation-
class hardware, and while 
we’re big fans of the Core 
i7-7700K for most normal 
tasks, when you get to heavy 
number-crunching, it isn’t 
quite the performance king 
that some sites would have 
you believe. 
Signaling Thanks
Just wanted to thank you 
for the very timely article, 
“Networking 101” (July 
2017). I’m not only amid my 
personal CompTIA N+ Exam 
studies, but also would 
enjoy seeing more network 
coverage, and up-to-date 
information on these 
magical boxes we call home. 
The Internet does require 
more know-how than just 
making the connections from 
time to time. It’s handy to 
have this kind of knowledge, 
and after reading, I’m 
looking into Wi-Fi mesh for 
my home nightmare of weak 
signals. 
–Ryan Anthony
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: Glad to 
hear you enjoyed it, and 
good luck with the studies. 
Going Back in Time
I have little use for the 
features in the Creator's 
Update. The emphasis is on 
gaming, but I have never 
played a computer game in 
my life, other than Solitaire.
3D Paint? I use Adobe 
Illustrator, and have no 
interest in 3D printing. 
Improvements to Edge? I use 
Firefox and Thunderbird. 
Better streaming? My only 
internet option is Verizon 
Wireless, so forget it, even 
if I wanted to (ditto for 
broadcasting with Beam). 
And why watch a movie on 
a 24-inch monitor when I 
can do so on a 63-inch HD 
screen? Night Light sounds 
useful, but getting it is not 
worth having my desktop 
littered with tiles that won't 
let me remove them. 
My computer is a work 
tool. My system and desktop 
are set up the way I like it, 
and I don’t need Microsoft 
messing around with it. How 
can I get just the security 
updates, driver fixes, and 
so on—in short, everything 
except what messes with 
my personalized desktop 
and configuration?
I have seriously 
considered going back to 
Win 7, and may do so if this 
continues. –Rick Thompson
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: While 
I feel your pain (not so 
much with Win 10, but 
definitely with Win 8), 
there’s something to be 
said for sticking with the 
latest version of Windows, 
and that pretty much starts 
and ends with protection. 
Sure, you may not need all 
the extra “features” that 
come with a new release or 
update of Windows, but you 
do want Microsoft on your 
side, fighting exploits and 
patching code to make sure 
you’re protected. 
Having said that, rolling 
back to Windows 7 wouldn’t 
be the worst thing in the 
world, especially if you bear 
in mind that at some point 
support will stop, and you’ll 
either have to upgrade, 
or come up with another 
solution. You wouldn’t be on 
your own—the recent Steam 
Survey had a third of users 
still running the beloved 
Win 7 (while Windows 10 
had the lion’s share, at just 
over 50 percent).
Value Proposition
The builds at the back of the 
magazine appear to double 
in price as you go from 
budget to mid-range to turbo 
($600, $1400, $2900). So,

does performance increase 
linearly, too? Which is the 
best value? Is it really better 
to spend more? 
I think it is, if we choose 
the right mix of components. 
For example, gaming is far 
less important to me than 
serious 2D and 3D programs, 
so I need more CPU cores 
than a very expensive GPU. 
We all need RAM and SSD. 
Maybe that is why “roll your 
own” is the best answer.
What are your thoughts? 
Which items yield more bang 
for more bucks? Which are 
better to pay less for?
 
–Doug Schafer
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: We do 
consider value in every 
review (the Titan Xp on page 
78 being a good example), 
but what you want out of a 
piece of hardware may be 
different to what someone 
else wants. As you point out, 
gaming isn’t so important 
to you, so you’re obviously 
going to have a different 
opinion to another reader.
It can be tricky as well, 
because as you pay more, 
it generally enables you to 
do more. An Nvidia GeForce 
1080 Ti, for instance, can 
hit 60fps at 4K in certain 
games, while a 1050 may 
only hit 10fps at the same 
settings. Does that make the 
Ti six times better? Hardly. 
And some things are even 
harder to ascertain—how do 
you objectively compare a 
4K IPS professional panel to 
a 1080p TN gaming screen? 
Still, we like a challenge, 
and this is something we’ll 
investigate further, as there 
are certain pieces of gear 
that jump out as being great 
value—the GeForce GTX 
1060 instinctively feels like 
a great card for the money 
as far as 1080p gaming 
goes. Watch this space. Until 
then, rolling your own is 
absolutely the way we’d go. 
Metaphorical Misfire
On page 14 of the July issue, 
Chris Lloyd talks about the 
US Army having Tomahawk 
missiles. I was in the Navy 
for 22 years, and my last 
job was Pacific Fleet Cruise 
Missile Officer. I can assure 
you that the Army never 
had and will never have 
Tomahawks. These are ship-
launched only. 
–Rona
nEws Editor, chris lloyd 
rEsponds: It wasn’t 
actually said by me, it was 
Microsoft’s president, Brad 
Smith. He was referring 
to the army as a generic 
“armed forces” at a guess. I 
just didn’t question him. 
Coaxial Cleverness
I really liked the “Set Up the 
Perfect Network” article in 
the July issue. It mentioned 
using powerline equipment, 
such as HomePlug brand, 
to expand the network 
without having to run cables 
behind walls and through 
floors. Another alternative, 
although not as versatile as 
HomePlug, is to use MoCA 
adapters. You do need an 
active coax feed in the room 
where you want to add wired 
Internet access, so if you 
don’t have this, HomePlug is 
a better alternative.
I bought a house where 
there were active coax 
connections on the walls 
in just about every room. 
I was telling a friend, a 
professor teaching wireless 
networking, that my 
wireless “n” network was 
starting to get bogged down 
with all the devices I had. He 
suggested MoCA adapters. 
We both have Verizon FiOS, 
and he had been using these 
adapters for several years.
I ordered two Actiontec 
adapters from Amazon—the 
ones specified for homes 
without MoCA routers, as I 
did not have cable service. 
The adapter has a separate 
input and an output for a 
coax cable, an RJ-45 jack, 
and power connector. They 
also have indicator lights for 
power, coax, and Ethernet. 
The adapter acts as a pass-
through for the TV signal, 
and you’re instructed to run 
a coax cable from the output 
jack of the adapter connects 
to a TV’s set-top box (STB).
My friend recommended 
not using the pass-through 
feature for the TV signal, but 
to run the coax coming out of 
the wall into a two-way coax 
signal splitter; running one 
cable from the output of the 
splitter to the MoCA adapter, 
and the other to the STB. If 
you run a coax cable from 
the output of the adapter to 
your STB, you lose certain 
features, such as the on-
screen TV guide. He also 
recommended using at least 
a 1GHz splitter.
Once I had the adapters 
connected, I had Internet 
access, and was able to get 
a bunch of devices off the 
wireless network. I checked 
the download and upload 
speeds of the devices using 
www.speedtest.net, and 
they were the same as the 
devices connected directly to 
the Verizon router. 
Compared to HomePlug, 
using MoCA adapters is a 
bit more work and won’t 
meet everyone’s needs. 
Every room in a house has 
AC outlets, but not active 
coax feeds. You need an 
extra coax cable, Ethernet 
cable, and a signal splitter 
if you choose to use one 
instead of the pass-through 
feature of the adapter. I 
had considered powerline 
equipment, and I know that 
it has improved since it first 
became available. However, 
your article mentioned one 
limiting factor, which would 
have been a problem for 
me: “noise” on the electrical 
circuit. My house is over 
50 years old, and I have to 
use UPS/battery backups 
with line conditioners so 
my sensitive devices get 
good, clean power. I did not 
experience any loss in speed 
with the MoCA adapters, 
which I would have with 
powerline equipment.

This is geTTing silly. Two months ago, a GeForce GTX 1070 would 
have set you back $350, at the time of writing you’re looking at $600. 
You can pick up a GTX 1080 for that much. However, this is a mid-
range build, and as such, throwing half the budget on the graphics 
card doesn’t make sense for everyone, so we’ve dropped down to 
using a 6GB GTX 1060 instead. Hardly ideal, but while mining is driving 
up the price of cards, now is not a great time to be buying. Elsewhere, 
the machine doesn’t change much—we were tempted to move up to 
a Ryzen 5 1600, but we’re trying to get the overall price down, so will 
save that shift for another day. It’s worth looking at the bundle deals 
that will pair up your CPU with a compatible motherboard and possibly 
memory for a reasonable saving. Don’t go for a motherboard you don’t 
want, though—here we recommend going for an X370 motherboard, 
as opposed to dropping down to a B350, just to save a few bucks. 
WiTh one excepTion, there weren’t a lot of price moves for our 
budget build this issue. The EVGA power supply saw a $5 saving, 
with a further $10 rebate on offer, although we don’t include those 
in the pricing, as such deals can be short-lived. Worth watching out 
for when you’re buying, though. There’s no change on the CPU or 
motherboard front, but the continuing scarcity of graphics cards, 
thanks to cryptocurrency mining, means that options here are 
limited. We’ve seen a $15 increase since last issue for a similar card 
(we’ve switched to EVGA as last month’s Gigabyte was out of stock), 
but it does come with a copy of Rocket League (a great game). We 
switched to Patriot Viper memory to try to save some cash, but that 
was swallowed by a price increase on the SSD. Overall, we’re pleased 
that we managed to keep a vague check on the price increase, but 
suggest waiting for the mining bubble to burst if you can.

if you’ve looked aT The deTails of the other two machines in 
this month’s build, it’ll come as no surprise to see that we’ve had to 
change the graphics card in our turbo machine, too. The previous 
PNY GeForce GTX 1080 Ti FE was out of stock, snapped up by those 
number-crunching Ether miners, no doubt, so we had to swap out for 
a standard-clocked card. The effects on pricing aren’t so great at the 
high-end, and the $10 premium over last month’s card isn’t ideal, but 
it’s hasn’t forced us to drop to a slower card.
As mentioned in our mid-range build, it pays to look at motherboard 
and CPU bundles, and at the time of going to press, Newegg has a deal 
on the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 and the MSI X370 Gaming Pro Carbon, saving 
$46 compared to buying the components separately. There’s another 
bundle that includes memory, although only half of what we’ve specced 
this machine out with, but still worth considering if you’re looking to 
make your money stretch further. Pick your motherboard of choice, 
then see what deals are available—it can throw up some tempting 
offers, even enabling you to get a faster CPU for nearly the same cash.
We actually saw a slight drop in the memory pricing this month—
down $5 from the previous issue—which was a pleasant surprise, 
given the general trend for much of this year. Even more welcome, 
though, is the $50 saving on the Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD, which helps 
bring the overall cost of this machine below last month’s.

It’s a sign of the times that the 
cards least affected by the 
cryptocurrency mining fad are 
the most expensive. Where 
we’ve seen prices double for 
more affordable cards, at the 
high end, pricing has hardly 
shifted—just $10 on the 1080 
Ti. This is a great GPU if you 
can justify its cost, and it’s 
your best bet for handling 4K 
right now. Of course, when 
the mining market implodes, 
as it will, we should see the 
second-hand market flooded 
with plenty of good quality, 
affordable cards. Even then, 
this will still be a great card.
