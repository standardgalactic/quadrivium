Nervous system – Methods of communication
In a post-synaptic neuron, which of the following changes would increase the 
likelihood of an action potential ﬁring?
 
A. increasing the number of excitatory synapses
 
B. increasing the ﬁring rate of an excitatory synapse
 
C. moving an inhibitory synapse closer to the initial segment
 
D. both A and B
E. A, B, and C
Put the following steps of synaptic transmission into the proper order:
 
1. neurotransmitter is released and binds receptors on the post-synaptic cell
 
2. voltage-gated calcium channels open
 
3. an action potential travels down the axon
 
4. vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane
 
A. 2, 4, 3, 1
 
B. 3, 2, 4, 1
 
C. 2, 3, 4, 1
 
D. 3, 2, 1, 4
Answer 1: D. both A and B
Answer 2: B. 3, 2, 4, 1
