the field of laser materials processing. It is addressed to engineering students as 
support for university lectures and also for those who want to develop skills in laser 
processing.
The book mainly focusses on the basic principles of laser machines and laser 
processes; however it does not cover all circumstances or all material specialties 
that might occur. The intention is to give an idea of general relations and principles.

1 Introduction
The Laser Story in Short
The success story of the laser started with the developed concept of stimulated 
emission by Albert Einstein in 1916 proving Planck’s law of radiation. The underly­
ing concept that an atom in an excited state can emit a photon when it encounters 
another photon made the laser process theoretically possible. The incoming photon 
just needs the same energy as the excited atom, and both photons travel further with 
the astonishing properties of having the same wavelength, direction, polarization, 
and phase. However, naturally, the stimulated emission is very rare, and it took until 
1928 to experimentally confirm the theory. In the 1950s, researchers took ideas and 
developed a concept that realized the stimulated emission in a resonator system.
Maiman [Mai60] developed the very first MASER by using ruby as laser active 
medium. The MASER emitted pulsed light. In 1960, the first laser was built. Korad 
and Raytheon already promoted the first industrial laser in 1963, built for drilling 
processes [Kla84]. Then, the laser concept was quickly further developed and is 
nowadays used for many purposes. Laser light is able to transport information and 
energy, which enables applications in various fields, e.g., in data transfer in infor­
mation technology, medical applications and, of course, in material processing. Its 
unique features enable it to reach peak powers in the petawatt range, short pulses 
in the pico- and femtosecond range and small dimensions in the nanometer range. 
Laser light shows high coherence and therefore high measurement resolution and a 
distinct color.
Within manufacturing, dieboard slotting was the first industrial application of 
laser cutting demonstrated in 1970 at William Thyne Ltd (Edinburgh, UK) using a 
BOC Falcon 200 W CO2 laser. Five years later, Ford showed the feasibility of car 
body part cutting with a 400 W CO2 laser, while in 1978, the first car with laser-cut 
parts was launched. Laser beam welding was shown by Martin Adams in 1970. At 
the Welding Institute, he presented welded sections made with a CO2 laser beam in 
1.5 mm thick metal [Ada70].
The laser became a success story and is great for many applications. In materi­
als processing, the laser enabled processes that were not possible before. However, 
to be honest, the laser is not perfect for everything. Therefore, this book shall help 
engineers to get a quick understanding of the main features of lasers for industrial 
processing and the related material interactions to learn about the main possibilities, 
challenges, and limitations that can occur and how to deal with them. This book 
concentrates on laser-based manufacturing of mainly metals with current state-of-
the-art solid-state lasers.

2 Theoretical Background
2.1  LASER THEORY
2.1.1  What Is Light?
Light is electromagnetic energy. It can be defined as an electromagnetic wave 
consisting of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to each other. 
Albert Einstein proposed that light consists of bundles of wave energy, named photons 
[Ein05], and received the Nobel prize for finding the photoelectrical effect. Besides the 
description of light as a wave or a photon, nowadays, the dualism is handled by calling 
it a quantum mechanical system. However, both descriptions can help to understand 
and explain the behavior of light in different circumstances. In the wave theory, light 
is described by its wavelength and polarization (orientation of the E- and B-vectors). 
Due to its wave character, light shows interference phenomenon. The energy that light 
can transport depends on the frequency or wavelength of light. The higher the fre­
quency, the higher the energy (Figure 2.1). Following the particle-like nature of light, 
a photon has (almost) no mass, no charge, but transports energy (in Joule)

with h being Planck’s constant (6.625 × 10−34 J·s), c the speed of light (2.998 × 108 m/s), 
and λ the wavelength of light (in meter). The speed of light is high but not infinite, 
and reaches in vacuum a speed of 2.998 × 108 m/s, which is a universal constant. The 
speed of light is slower when traveling through a medium (e.g., air: 0.03% slower or 
glass: 30% slower). A light beam is considered a stream of photons.
Photons can interact with other particles such as electrons. The phenomena 
involving typical interactions of photons with a medium include absorption (trans­
fer of photonic energy to another particle), reflection (path change of photons at a 
material interface), and transmission (passing of photons through the medium) that 
includes refraction effects.
Typical values to describe characteristics of a light stream include transported 
energy (in Joule), power P (in Watt) or flux (in Joule per second), flux density or 
power density or irradiance per unit area (in Watt per square meter or Joule per 
square meter, respectively).
2.1.2  Laser Principle
The word laser is an acronym that stands for “Light Amplification by Stimulated 
Emission of Radiation”. Nowadays, the word laser is used for the physical process of 
laser light creation as well as for the machine that produces the laser light. According 
to the standard ISO11145, in a laser machine, the laser light is produced inside a 

3
Theoretical Background
resonator, where the laser active medium (LAM) is positioned (Figure 2.2). Energy 
input is needed for so-called pumping, which increases the energy state of the LAM. 
Most laser systems require active or passive cooling devices due to energy losses 
during the laser beam creation.
2.1.3  Laser Active Medium
Three different mechanisms can occur during the interaction of light with material 
(Figure 2.3). When a photon interacts with an atom or molecule, it can absorb its 
energy and increase thereby the energy state of the atom or molecule (excitation 
of matter). This process is called absorption. According to Planck, photons have 
quantized energy states, which means that the energy transfer is a multiple of the 
minimum quantized energy.
Since most attenuated states are unstable, after a certain time, the atom or molecule 
prefers to go back to a more stable condition. This energy decrease can then lead to a 
so-called spontaneous emission of radiation. The exact time and direction of the emis­
sion can be predicted by statistical methods but are not precisely defined. Absorption 
and spontaneous emission are natural mechanisms that can be observed all the time.
However, stimulated emission is a special case that does not occur regularly in 
nature but is necessary for laser light production. It is possible that a photon can 
stimulate the energy decrease of an excited atom or molecule. Thereby, the energy 
release can be transferred to produce another photon (similar to the spontaneous

emission), called relaxation of light. When this happens, the stimulating photon and 
the newly created photon have identical characteristics. They are exiting the system 
with the same wavelength, direction, polarization, and phase. Since there is one pho­
ton entering the active atom/molecule of the LAM and two photons are exiting, this 
process can be seen as light amplification.
In nature, spontaneous emission occurs more likely than stimulated emission. 
According to Boltzmann’s law, the population of energy states in a system shows less 
population in higher states (Figure 2.4). However, for a stimulated emission, the so-
called population inversion is necessary, which means that in a higher energy state, a 
higher population must be present. Since this state is not possible in thermodynamic 
equilibrium, population inversion must be created to enable laser light production. 
This requires thermal non-equilibrium.
A pre-requisite for laser light production is the maintenance of population 
inversion for a certain time. Therefore, the LAM needs to be pumped to enable 
FIGURE 2.3  Principles of light-matter interaction.
FIGURE 2.4  Principle sketch of population distributions at (a) thermodynamical equilib­
rium (Boltzmann equilibrium) and (b) population inversion.

Theoretical Background
the necessary energy input. Pumping describes the energy input into the LAM to 
increase its energy state, which later enables population inversion, having more pop­
ulation at a higher energy level. At the same time, losses occur, which lead typically 
to the requirement to have a cooling system.
Energy input can be achieved in different ways depending on the nature of the 
LAM; typical are optical pumping (absorption), electrical discharge (electron col­
lisions), electric processes (semiconductors), or chemical processes. Most typical 
LAMs for lasers in production are solids and gases.
Solid-state lasers use a host medium, typically a YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum-
Garnet) or SiO2 crystal, in which the LAM is dotted. Neodymium ions (Nd3+) were 
found to be feasible material for laser systems; however, ytterbium (Yb), being a 
more energy-efficient material, started to replace it. Independent from the used 
design (rod, disk, fiber), those systems are usually optically pumped by high-power 
flashlights or nowadays, by diode laser light.
The most typical gas laser in production is the CO2 laser. The CO2 gas is excited 
by electrical discharge, while first the added nitrogen (N2) is excited, which transfers 
energy to the CO2 molecules that enables stimulated emission.
2.1.4  Laser Resonator
The sole energetic pumping of LAM would not lead to a directed laser beam yet. 
Therefore, the LAM is placed inside a resonator (Figure 2.5). The resonator enables 
multiple paths of photons by reflections through the LAM to increase amplification of 
FIGURE 2.5  Principle sketch of the LAM in the resonator at (a) starting of pumping, 
(b) amplification initiation, and (c) stable amplification.

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
laser light and create a standing wave. The photons guided by the resonator through 
the LAM enforce stimulated emission. Both photons from the interaction are emit­
ted in the same direction, which enables the photons to build a standing wave within 
the resonator. The pumping energy continues to excite atoms and molecules, but the 
stimulated emission in a perfect process continuously emits light only in the direc­
tion of the photons that already travel within the resonator.
Resonators are designed to enable the laser beam to exit at some point. The most 
typical resonators consist of two-shaped mirrors, which need to be precisely posi­
tioned at a distance L as multiple of the 0.5 times the wavelength λ to enable the 
build-up of a standing wave (Figure 2.6).
Stable resonators (Figure 2.6a) can use a fully reflective mirror and one mir­
ror that is partly transmissive so that a certain number of photons can leave the 
resonator. Since the laser beam shows a caustic with a waist of the radius w0 and a 
divergence, the mirrors must show a concave shape. Stable resonators are used for 
continuous wave (cw) solid-state lasers. Unstable resonators (Figure 2.6b) can only 
operate in pulsed width mode (pw lasers). Compared to stable resonators, unstable 
resonators can emit higher power since a larger volume of LAM can be used.
An ideal stable resonator produces a perfect Gaussian beam (Figure 2.7a), with 
the spatial intensity (power density) distribution of

equation can be derived leading to possible modes of the laser beam that can start 
vibrating in the resonator (Figure 2.7b).
2.2  LASER MACHINES
2.2.1  Laser Designs
Different laser designs were developed with different LAMs, different principles 
of pumping, cooling, and resonator designs. The main aim is always to efficiently 
provide energy to LAM to enable population inversion and emit laser light with 
the lowest possible heat losses. Several laser designs are commercially available. 
Typical industrial high-power systems are CO2 lasers, Nd:YAG rod lasers, Yb:YAG 
disk and fiber lasers, and direct diode lasers. CO2 lasers are widely used, e.g., for 
cutting processes. Compared to gas lasers, like the CO2 laser (wavelength 10.6 µm), 
the solid-state lasers (rod, disk, and fiber) emit at a wavelength around 1 µm and 
show therefore different caustic characteristics (Figure 2.8). Diode lasers at differ­
ent wavelengths are also available for high-power applications. Typical values of 
selected high-power laser systems are given in Table 2.1. A smaller beam parameter 
product (BPP) indicates a better focusability of the laser beam.
In 2017, the total laser sales were $12.3 billion with increasing tendency for all 
laser types. The main markets are material processing and communication (each 
1/3), R&D military, medical, lithography, instrumentation sensors, displays, optical 
storage, and printing [Las18].

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Besides BPP and beam quality M2, the efficiency of systems is used for the com-
parison of laser systems. The wall plug efficiency ηWP describes the total energy loss 
from the electrical plug power input Ptotal to the laser output power PL.

Energy losses occur due to electrical transfer of energy to the pump source and 
the transformation of energy to be available for pumping, e.g., from electrical energy 
to light. Since not all the energy from pumping can be transferred to LAM, losses 
occur during this transfer as well (Figure 2.9).
In the LAM, quantum losses are systematic losses that appear since not all energy 
input from the pumping can be transferred to the photon energy due to the energetic 
scheme of LAM. The quantum efficiency ηQ is defined as the energy input into the 
produced photon (energy difference between the upper, u and lower, l laser level)

Further losses occur in optical systems. All losses are transferred into heat, which 
requires cooling of the components to avoid thermally induced damages.
2.2.2  CO2 Lasers
The most industrially used laser type is the CO2 laser, which is a representative of 
gas lasers. Other gas lasers use Argon ions or Helium-Neon (He-Ne) gas mixtures. 
He-Ne laser is often found in industrial machines as pilot laser that is guided through 
the optical system to support the alignment and positioning of the laser beam in rela­
tion to the work piece.
As indicated by the name of the laser, the LAM is a gas. For CO2 lasers, the 
energy increase is induced by the excitation of CO2 molecules into different vibra­
tion states, which are quantized. This means that only certain energy states can be 
reached. Figure 2.10 shows the typical excitation states of CO2 molecules in a CO2 
laser system. A specialty in CO2 lasers is the use of N2 molecules that are excited 
first by electric glow discharge pumping before they transfer the gained energy to 
CO2 molecules.
FIGURE 2.10  Vibration states of N2 and CO2 molecules.

10
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
The achievable energy levels and related vibration states are shown in Figure 2.11. 
Changes in the energy levels of CO2 initiate the creation of laser light. The main 
wavelength created during de-excitation is 10.6 µm, while a small number of photons 
emit at 9.4 µm as well.
The electrical discharge pumping initiates N2 excitation (Figure 2.12), while the 
energy is transferred to the CO2 molecule, which is the upper laser level (state 4). 
Relaxation to state 3 (lower laser level) initiates the creation of photons. Further 
de-excitation to state 2 and the ground level (state 1) mainly results in energy trans­
formed into heat. In order to keep population inversion (more molecules in state 4 
compared to state 3), the de-excitation of the lower laser level (state 3) is supported 
by He atoms that are added to the gas mix in a CO2 laser.
FIGURE 2.11  Energy levels of N2 and CO2 molecules, including excitation and relaxation 
states with photon emission relaxations.
FIGURE 2.12  Schematic energy levels in a CO2 laser system.

11
Theoretical Background
As can be seen in Figure 2.12, the energy needed to pump the system is larger 
than the energy transferred to the photon of the laser beam. Therefore, a systematic 
energy loss occurs. The so-called quantum efficiency of typical CO2 laser systems is 
10–15%, which means that only 10–15% of the input energy can be transferred to the 
laser photons through pumping. Typically, active cooling of optical elements and gas 
mixture is therefore necessary.
A schematic sketch of a typical CO2 laser system is shown in Figure 2.13. Pumping 
is done by electric glow discharge by a high-power, high-frequency power source 
through electrodes in the gas-loaded system, which shows the typical purple glow-
ing. The LAM is CO2, while N2 and He gases are further added into the system. N2 
is needed for excitation and He for relaxation. The laser beam is established in the 
gas system within the resonator consisting of a non-transmissive back mirror and a 
partly transmissive decoupling mirror, wherefrom the laser beam exits the system. 
Cooling of gases is done by circulating the gas mixture and implemented cooling 
devices.
Typically, BPP > 3.4 mm*mrad (minimum diffraction limit for a certain wave-
length) is achievable. The main characteristics of CO2 laser systems are summarized 
in Table 2.2.
For safety issues, eyes must be covered by protection glasses with the appropriate 
filtering of wavelength. The laser light is not visible to human eyes.
2.2.3  Solid-State Lasers
Solid-state lasers use solid material as LAM, which is made up of amorphous glass 
or dielectric crystals with dotted active material. The active ions are of rare earths 
or transition ions that have discrete electronic levels (Figure 2.14). Pumping is done 
FIGURE 2.13  Sketch of a CO2 laser system design.

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
by high-energy photons from the ground state 1 to the excited state 4, lifting the 
electrons of ions into higher energetic states. De-excitation into the upper laser level 
(state 3) occurs that further continues to the lower laser level (state 2) to create laser 
photons, followed by further relaxation into the ground level.
In order to create population inversion, the upper laser level (state 3) must be 
constantly and reliably filled with excited ions, while state 2 should have a low popu­
lation. The used dotted ions show the necessary characteristics to enable these char­
acteristics. The transfer of ions from level 4 to level 3 is very fast that fills level 3, 
while the ions remain in level 3 for a comparably long time. The transfer of ions 
from level 2 to level 1 is also fast, which enables quick emptying of level 2. Typical

quantum efficiencies of those systems are around 50%. Optical pumping is used to 
excite ions using a light source. The laser process in the LAM is initiated and devel­
oped as seen in Figure 2.15.
Compared to other systems, solid-state lasers show relatively long lifetimes of the 
excited states, which enables higher energy storage and increased efficiencies.
2.2.3.1  Nd:YAG Rod Laser
Typical materials used in industrial laser systems are Nd:YAG crystals, which con­
tain Nd3+ embedded in a YAG crystal. A rod laser uses a crystal rod that contains 
LAM (Figure 2.16), which is pumped by a flashbulb or by laser diodes. The resonator 
consists of two mirrors—one mirror is highly reflective and the outcoupling mirror 
is partly transmissive. Both the pump light source and the LAM typically need to 
be cooled. The possible output power of one rod is around 500 W, while a serial 
arrangement of rods can increase the output power of the laser system. The produced 
laser light has the wavelength of 1.064 µm. Laser light at that wavelength enables 
fiber guidance.

2.2.3.2  Yb:YAG Disk Laser
New designs of solid-state lasers were developed in order to improve cooling pos­
sibilities and limit thermal lensing effects. A rod crystal with laser beam oscillating 
through the center can show steep thermal gradients. When laser light is produced, 
the temperature in the center of the rod is high compared to the circumference where 
typically water cooling is applied (Figure 2.17a). This temperature difference leads 
to inhomogeneous deformation of the rod due to thermal expansion and bulging

of rod surfaces (thermal lensing effect). In combination with the temperature-­
dependent change of the refractive index, defocusing of the laser beam can occur at 
the end of the rods, which can lead to a misalignment or loss of laser light. In order 
to enable homogeneous cooling, disk laser systems have been developed [Gie05], 
where the rod is reduced to a thin disk that can be homogeneously cooled from the 
rear (Figure 2.17b).
However, by shrinking the rod to a disk, the distance of the laser beam propagat­
ing through the crystal is reduced in this design, which means that the amplification 
is reduced. Therefore, a smart laser design has been developed that leads the pump 
laser beam multiple times through the crystal. In order to guide the pump light, sev­
eral prisms and parabolic mirrors are necessary (Figure 2.18). The rear side of the 
disk is used as a mirror (part of the resonator) for pump light and laser light.
Typically, ytterbium ions (Yb+3) are used as the dotted material for disk laser in 
YAG crystals (LAM). Optical pumping with laser diode light enables a high-energy 
transfer efficiency due to the possibility to pump with the correct wavelength that 
can be actually absorbed by the LAM, which is 941 nm for Yb+3. This enables ~90% 
absorption of the pump energy into the laser active material. The quasi-3-niveau 
system has a lower laser level already filled with 7.6% at 100°C due to being close
to the ground level. The main data about disk lasers are summarized in Table 2.4.
2.2.3.3  Fiber Laser
A second design was developed based on the rod design to increase cooling possibili­
ties and avoid thermal lensing effect in solid-state lasers. Instead of reducing the rod 
shape to a disk, long fibers dotted with typically Yb+3 are used. The generated large 
circumferential surface of the fiber is easy to cool, while guaranteeing a long path of 
the laser beam inside the LAM (Figure 2.19).
FIGURE 2.18  Sketch of a disk laser design.

16
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
The diode laser generated pump light is guided into the fiber core cladding, where 
the pump light is lead through the fiber with multiple reflections at the fiber cladding. 
Asymmetric fiber cores can improve the energy coupling from the pump light into 
the LAM. Double-cladding fibers can help to avoid the necessity of high-­quality 
pump light. The pump light initiates the laser process in the fiber core (LAM). 
Mirrors at the ends of the fiber form the resonator. Fiber lasers show a high gain and 
high efficiency. The main features of fiber lasers are summarized in Table 2.5.
2.2.3.4  Pulsed Lasers
Several possibilities exist to pulse a laser machine. Intrinsic pulsing happens when 
the laser medium is not able to maintain population inversion due to the energetic 
state configuration of the LAM. This happens, e.g., in the first demonstrated Ruby 
Laser, where after laser emission, pumping has to regenerate population inversion 
again, since the upper laser level is emptied faster than the pumping can fill it.
A simple way of pulsing a laser beam is a mechanical shutter, e.g., a rotating 
disk with an opening at the outlet of the laser beam of the resonator. These lasers

are called quasi-cw-lasers (QCW). However, the maximum energy peak is still the 
same as for a continuous emission, which means that the average energy emission is 
reduced compared to cw emission. The unused laser energy is transformed into heat 
on the rotating shutter when not emitted, which requires additional cooling.
In addition, emission control is possible by the input of the pumping source, which 
can be pulsing of the pump light. More efficient use of the population inversion 
is possible by creating laser pulses using quality-switching (Q-switching). Optical 
pumping is used to increase population inversion, while the losses are kept at a high 
level. That way, no stimulated emission happens yet. Switching the laser on induces 
stimulated emission and a short pulse can be created. Active elements (e.g., electro-
optical or acoustic-optical modulators) can create pulses in the nanosecond range, 
while passive elements enable shorter pulses. Such lasers are often used in mark­
ing systems or micromachining. Mode locking enables to synchronize modes in the 
resonator, which leads to interference. Constructive interferences enable high-peak 
short pulses. Pulse durations of pico- and femtoseconds are possible.
2.2.4  Diode Laser
A diode laser uses semiconductors to produce laser light and has the advantage to 
directly create laser light from electricity without creating, e.g., pump light to trans­
fer the energy into the LAM. Diode lasers are typically used as pump source for 
fiber or disk lasers, but are also increasingly used directly without further transfer 
for material processing.
The LAM is the p-n-transfer of the semiconductor, while pumping is directly 
enabled by electrical energy. The laser emission is induced when electrons pass the 
p-n-transition (Figure 2.20a). A single p-n-transfer induces about 5 mW to 50 mW 
laser energy output. A single diode emitter is limited to a few Watts energy emission 
and produces comparably divergent light.
A combination of multiple laser diodes assembled to bars increases the output 
power to, e.g., 60–120 W using 20–25 laser diodes (Figure 2.20b). The challenge of

emitted diode laser light is the divergence of the laser beam that requires typically 
the installation of micro-lenses to enable a more focused laser beam. The so-called 
stacks of multiple diode bars are typically used to further increase the laser output 
power. Wavelength coupling and polarization coupling result in increasing the laser 
power even more by combining several diode laser beams (Figure 2.21).
2.3  CHARACTERISTICS OF LASER BEAM
Laser beams have unique characteristics that distinguish laser light from other light 
sources (Figure 2.22). Due to the creation process of laser light, all photons in a laser

Theoretical Background
beam have the same energetic state, which means that they have the same wave­
length. Therefore, laser light has in principle only one color (monochromatic). Laser 
light waves have a strong phase correlation and are directed in one direction (with a 
certain but small divergence angle compared to other light sources).
Laser light has a high coherence in time and space, which means that two wave 
fields have a defined phase shift for a long travel distance. This property enables 
the laser beam to show interference effects. Spatial coherence can be measured by 
the double-slit-test, while temporal coherence can be measured in, e.g., the Mach–
Zehnder interferometer. Considering two geometrical non-identical observation 
points in space, the spatial coherence is given when two parallel light waves show 
a constant phase shift (Figure 2.23). Whereas, temporal coherence compares the 
phase relation of two light waves observed in one observation point. The coherence 
is higher at longer times of a constant phase relation.
As indicated before, a laser beam is a stream of single photons and does not 
propagate perfectly parallel. A laser beam shows a caustic with a minimum diameter 
at the waist and a divergence θ along the propagation direction. The spatial beam 
radius is defined as the distance from the beam center where the intensity drops to 
1/e2 (≈13.5%) (Figure 2.7). This means that the beam area 
2
π⋅w  contains 86.5% of 
the entire laser power. The more precise physical definition of the laser beam area 
uses the second moment approach (ISO 11146). A Gaussian beam propagates along 
the z-axis showing a planar wave front in the waist changing into a curved wave front 
(Figure 2.24).
A laser beam can be described using the two introduced characteristics, namely 
the beam waist radius

Theoretical Background
The Rayleigh length zR is the distance along the propagation direction from the 
beam waist to where the beam area is doubled. The principal relations of beam caus­
tic characteristics at same BPP are shown in Figure 2.25. At a constant BPP of the 
provided laser beam, a smaller beam radius will lead to a higher divergence angle 
and thereby to a smaller Rayleigh length.
The standard ISO 11146 requires 20 measurements of the beam radius along the 
optical axis (Figure 2.26). Ten measurements must be done around the beam waist 
within the Rayleigh length in order to detect the beam waist radius and its z-position 
precisely. The remaining ten measurements must be conducted in the far field in 
order to be able to detect the divergence properly. With these two parameters, the 
laser beam caustic can be described.
Laser beam measurements can be done with different methods. For rotational 
symmetric laser beams, non-contact measuring methods are possible, observing the 
laser beam from the side and recording the intensity projection. Other methods are 
based on measuring the spatial intensity distribution plane by plane, which enables 
the visualization of beam profiles. Rotating needles that raster through the laser 
beam and measure the local intensity along different paths through the laser beam

are combined to a distribution frame. Furthermore, camera chips can be used to 
record a spatial intensity distribution. The beam diameter is defined by the second 
moment method or the simplified definition that 86.5% of the laser intensity must be 
inside the laser beam spatial intensity profile.
All methods have in common to measure the beam radii/diameters in different 
positions along the propagation axis (Figure 2.27). The theoretical beam caustic 
equations are used to describe and visualize the beam caustic. In addition, laser 
beam characteristics, such as the z-position of the beam waist, the BPP as well as 
,
2
M  can be derived.
2.4  BEAM GUIDING AND BEAM SHAPING
The laser beam produced in the laser machine needs to be further delivered to the 
processing zone to enable material processing (Figure 2.28). Depending on the used

intensity distribution at the beam waist (1200 W laser power, 1070 nm wavelength).

fer to the processing zone.

23
Theoretical Background
laser system, beam guiding can be done using mirrors or fiber optics. Further, optics 
are usually applied to project the laser beam onto the processing zone.
2.4.1  Fiber Optics for Beam Guiding
Laser light can be transported in optical fibers when the laser wavelength allows a 
high transmissivity through the fiber material. Wavelengths of the typical introduced 
solid-state laser emitting at ~1 µm wavelength show a high transmissivity. However, 
the CO2 laser wavelength of 10.6 µm cannot be transferred in optical fibers.
Compared to free beam laser transport, fibers are more flexible and require less 
optical components. Little effort is necessary for the installation of machine systems, 
and a constant beam diameter is guaranteed at possible long fiber lengths. Laser light 
is guided in the fiber core by total reflection at the interface between the core with the 
optically denser material and the cladding (Figure 2.29).
The maximum angle βt to achieve total reflection is defined by the refractive 
indexes of the used materials for the core and the cladding (clad)

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
In case the incident laser beam is larger than the NA, not all laser rays can 
be coupled into the fiber, and power losses occur along with heating of the fiber 
cladding. For a typically used fused silica fiber material, the NA is between 0.17 
and 0.25.
Fiber bending partly decreases the incident angles of the laser rays inside the 
fiber core when interacting with the cladding and can be seen as a quasi-increase of 
the refractive index 2
n , leading to a reduced maximum NA. In addition, polarization 
effects can occur affecting the output laser beam. Typical characteristics of fibers for 
laser beam guiding are summarized in Table 2.6.
Multi-mode fibers typically homogenize the spatial laser intensity distribution, 
leading to a typical top-hat beam profile (Figure 2.31a), while special fiber designs 
offer further possibilities of laser beam shaping in the fiber optic (Figure 2.31b 
and c).

2.4.2  Beam Shaping Elements
2.4.2.1  Mirrors
Mirrors are reflective optical elements that can be used for the change in direction 
of laser beam (Figure 2.32, left) or beam shaping, including focusing (Figure 2.32, 
right).
When selecting the mirror dimensions, the whole laser beam should illumi­
nate the mirror area to avoid a cut-off of the laser beam along with a reduction 
in the transferred power and beam quality 
2
M . Mirror materials are typically 
chosen to show high reflectivity of the used laser light in combination with 
reflective coatings. Copper fulfills the requirement of high reflectivity for the 
IR wavelengths used for typical process lasers and offers in addition a good 
heat conductivity that enables quick heat transfer of the absorbed laser energy. 
Copper shows good processability that enables a high precision of the surfaces 
and a low surface roughness with possible cooling channels inside the mirror 
element. Cooling can be enabled by integrated cooling channels using cooling 
water, which avoids severe deformations of the reflecting surface even at high 
laser power illuminations.
Besides copper, silicon and molybdenum are used as substrates, which are also 
often used for beam deflection mirrors. Coatings are used to protect mirror sur­
faces against oxidation and enhance reflectivity to possibly >99.7%. A single layer 
anti-reflective coating with a layer thickness of λ/4 can be used (Figure 2.33a). For 
increased reflectivity, an accumulative high-reflection coating can be produced with 
alternating high- and low-refractive index coatings (Figure 2.33). Molybdenum mir­
rors can be used uncoated.
Typically, free beam guiding from the laser machine to the processing head is 
enabled by a combination of mirror systems. Such setups are mainly used for CO2 
laser light that cannot be transferred in fibers. Mirrors can be used for laser beam 
collimation and focusing.
FIGURE 2.32  Sketch of mirrors for laser beam shaping for direction change (left) and 
focusing (right).

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
2.4.2.2  Lenses
Lenses are transmissive elements that are typically used for guiding and shaping the 
laser beam (Figure 2.34). Plano-convex, convex-concave, and aspheric lens surface 
designs are used. Lenses are usually used at an angle of incidence of 0°.
Typical lens materials for different laser types are listed in Table 2.7. The surface 
quality of both surfaces must be in the range of λ/20. Typically, anti-reflective coat­
ings are used for both interfaces in order to decrease the energy absorption of the 
optical element.
The central heating by the laser beam usually leads to a temperature increase 
and a thermal gradient in the lens material (thermal lensing effect). This can lead to 
a focus shift. Different materials show different thermal focus shifts (Figure 2.35) 
[Las21a]. The thermal impact of laser illumination on the optics needs to be consid­
ered when positioning the laser optics with the material to be processed to guarantee 
the correct laser beam diameter on the material surface.
Compared to mirror beam shaping, typically lenses offer the possibility to achieve 
smaller focusing spots and are less sensitive to deviations of the incident laser angle. 
However, lenses are more difficult to cool, which results in limited laser power that 
can be used. Anti-reflective coatings can be sensitive to mechanical impact, e.g., 
during cleaning.
FIGURE 2.34  Examples of different transmissive elements for beam shaping and guiding.
FIGURE 2.33  (a) Single layer anti-reflective coating and (b) multi-layer, high reflection 
coating based on different refractive indexes n.

27
Theoretical Background
Due to the cooling possibilities that are limited to the circumference of the optic, 
lenses often show thermal lensing effects when the temperature of the lens center 
reaches higher temperatures than that of the outer parts. This non-uniform (gradient) 
heating due to absorption of high-power laser radiation in optical elements causes 
thermal lensing, paraxial focus shift, and aberration. These effects lead to changes in 
the size and intensity profile of the focused spot in the optics. The induced thermal 
expansion in combination with the increase in the central temperature-­dependent 
refractive index can lead to a decreased focal distance and increased laser spot 
size, which can affect processing. This effect leads to a change in the wavefront of 
the focused laser beam. In addition, as a consequence, a shift of the paraxial focus 
occurs, together with the appearance of the effect of spherical aberration, when dif­
ferent rays of the beam cross the optical axis at different points (Figure 2.36).
Fortunately, the physical properties of some natural optical materials allow either 
self-compensating or minimizing the optical effects induced by gradient heating, 
e.g., CaF2 and crystalline quartz (Figure 2.35) [Las21a].
A remarkable property of crystalline quartz is that when the main axis of a crystal 
is orthogonal to the optical axis of the optical element (as in a waveplate), the self-
compensation condition is almost exactly satisfied, and neither thermal focus shift 
nor aberration effects occur even in the case of contamination or surface absorption 
of optical elements. Users of optics made of crystalline quartz simply do not observe 
these undesired optical focus shift effects.

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Athermal crystalline quartz and sapphire with extremely high thermal conductiv­
ity ensure minimal temperature gradients. Optics made of these materials exhibit 
minimized thermal focus shift and aberration even during absorption of laser energy 
in the bulk material and coatings by contamination, scratches, and other surface 
defects. Weak birefringence of crystalline quartz and sapphire does not prevent their 
successive use in laser optics.
2.4.3  Laser Beam Focusing
In order to utilize the laser beam for material processing, the characteristics of laser 
beams need to be understood. From the fiber or directly from the laser source, the 
laser beam shows a large divergence angle. Therefore, a collimator is typically used to 
guide the laser beam at a comparably large diameter and small divergence further to 
the focusing optic. Since the laser beam diameter on the focusing optic related to the 
focal distance of the optic is an important factor, the F-number is defined (Figure 2.37).
The principal impacts of the beam quality M2 on the processing beam are shown 
in Figure 2.38. A better beam quality (smaller M2) enables the use of smaller lenses 
at constant focal diameter, processing at a further distance at constant lens dimen­
sions and focal diameter or a smaller focal diameter at the same focal distance.
When the same focal diameter and focal length is accepted, smaller optics (lower 
beam diameter on the focusing lens) can be used at better beam quality (lower 
2
M ). 
Smaller processing optics can be used for easier handling and faster movement with 
possibilities of better accessibility. A higher beam quality enables a longer focal 
distance at constant spot size and lens diameter.

ture distribution, the refractive index distribution and geometry of a lens; principal sketches

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
This feature enables remote laser processes. When the F-number is chosen to be 
constant, a better beam quality enables a smaller focal diameter and thereby a higher 
beam intensity in the focal spot.
The spatial beam intensity distribution typically changes along the beam propaga­
tion. In the beam waist, typically, the fiber end is projected. For typical multi-mode 
fibers, this is a homogeneous distribution (top-hat) over the beam area; for single-
mode fibers, it is a Gaussian-like distribution (Figure 2.39). Further away from the 
beam waist, the intensity distribution becomes bell-shaped.

versal electromagnetic mode (TEM00). The intensity distribution

31
Theoretical Background
Many high-power laser systems are multi-mode systems with 
2
M ≫1. Single-mode 
lasers are also available that typically achieve 
2
M >1.1. As already seen, the multi-
mode spatial intensity distribution is typically top-hat-shaped in the focal position, 
where the fiber end is projected and changes into a bell-shaped profile when leaving 
the focal position. A single-mode laser beam keeps the bell shape at all axial posi­
tions. Beam shaping for high-power applications can be done using several methods 
that can be distinguished in dynamic and static beam shaping.
One possibility to dynamically shape the beam is the use of “flying” optics or also 
called scanning or oscillating optics. A typical setup is a combination of two moving 
mirrors that enable the laser beam positioning on the material. This method can be 
highly efficient for the so-called remote processing used for, e.g., welding, cutting, 
marking or powder bed fusion processing since the mirror movements are typically 
faster than computer numerical control (CNC) or robot machine movements that 
require positioning of the whole optics. The moving mirrors have much less weight 
to move to initiate the beam scanning. In practice, there are, of course, also limita­
tions of the movement of the mirrors that, e.g., reduce the amplitude of the movement 
at high frequencies.
The common challenge of such systems is visualized in Figure 2.40a. The differ­
ent path lengths s of the laser beam from the mirror to the interaction point with the 
substrate lead to different beam shapes and beam dimensions d on the substrate. Such 
a defocusing of the laser beam can lead to interruptions of the process and must be 
considered or avoided. Therefore, f-theta optics are used to guarantee that the laser 
beam focal position is, e.g., always placed on the substrate surface (Figure 2.40b 
and c).
FIGURE 2.39  Example of spatial intensity distributions along the beam propagation of 
a multi-mode laser beam caustic (collimation lens: 150 mm focal distance; focusing lens: 
250 mm focal distance).

32
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
For even faster movements and spatial shaping possibilities of the laser beam, 
deformable mirrors are used. Adaptive mirrors using water/air pressure for changing 
the mirror surface geometry, rapidly activated membranes or piezo-activators can be 
used to induce rapid changes in the spatial laser intensity distributions.
The impact of an oscillating laser beam as heat sources for surface hardening is 
shown in Figure 2.41 [Dew20a]. In the turning points at the edges of the oscillation 
patterns, heat accumulation can happen that leads to increased hardened depth or 
local melting.
For static laser beam shaping, refractive or diffractive optical elements are typi­
cally used. Diffractive optical elements use micropatterns on the optic surfaces to 
create a variety of beam shapes in a flexible way using interference effects. Typically, 
thin optical material can be used, making the optics lightweight. Due to the fine 
surface structures, high laser power application was often critical to use to avoid 
melting. However, nowadays, possibilities increase.
Refractive optical elements use specially shaped surfaces of mirrors or lenses 
to guide the beam rays on the desired paths. Using such systems, e.g., single-mode

Theoretical Background
beams can be formed from a Gaussian-like-shaped intensity distribution into a top-
hat or donut beam shape (Figure 2.42).
Beam splitters enable the redistribution of intensity into several parts. Thereby, 
the beam is physically split in several profiles, e.g., to guide the beam around a wire 
feeder system. Another possibility of beam shaping is the beam splitting into several 
rings inside a fiber. Splitting the laser beam into several spots can also be accom­
plished with refractive optics (Figure 2.43). Multiple spot generation is possible with 
even controllable intensities for the single spots [Las21b].
In addition, several beams with different focal distances can be positioned along 
the beam axis, which enables to produce varied beam intensities along the beam axis 
and a “quasi-elongated” depth of field (Figure 2.44).

2.5  LASER BEAM ENERGY TRANSFER
2.5.1  Phenomenological Overview
The laser is a thermal tool that basically only transfers energy to increase the tem­
perature of material, unlike many other processing methods that use geometrical 
tools. The material impact depends on the interaction time and intensity of the laser 
beam, which describes the heat input. Absorption properties of the material are one 
of the main parameters that impact the energy input besides the surface geometry/
quality. Laser light absorption depends on the material properties, inclination angle, 
surface temperature, and wavelength. The main heat loss of the processing zone is 
heat dissipation/conduction from the process zone, which depends on the material 
properties and part geometry.
Absorption happens when photons from the laser beam interact with the atoms 
(or molecules) of the material, while the photonic energy is assumed to be first trans­
ferred to the electrons that increase the energy state of the system. Afterward, the 
electron energy is transferred to the atom and the lattice, where heat conduction 
takes place in the form of particle collisions that transfer momentum and thereby 
energy. Laser energy that is not absorbed is either reflected Prefl or (in transparent 
materials) transmitted. Transmission can be typically neglected in metal material 
processing, but can play a role in, e.g., polymer processing.
While absorption is typically defined as the one-time interaction with a material, 
energy coupling or absorptance summarizes all effects that impact energy transfer 
into the material. In addition to sole absorption of a surface, geometrical (e.g., oxida­
tion, roughness) and chemical aspects (chemical energy from reactions Pchem, e.g., of 
material elements with oxygen) need to be considered that alter the energy input. The 
most pronounced impact can be seen considering multiple reflections as part of the 
absorptance in a laser-induced vapor channel (keyhole).
The energy transport from a laser beam into the material is generally from pho­
tonic energy to electron excitation. Short time afterward, the energy is transferred to 
atom and lattice vibrations, where the heat conduction process starts. In addition to 
heat conduction, thermal radiation losses and convective losses can occur.

[Vol21a]).

35
Theoretical Background
Thermal radiation (Prad) can often be neglected in laser material processing due to 
its small portion compared to other energy transport phenomena. Thermal radiation 
follows the Stefan–Boltzmann law and is proportional to the fourth power of the mate­
rial temperature. Heat conduction (Pcond) is the transfer of energy from atom to atom 
in a bulk material without changing the position of atoms. The process is temperature-
dependent typically showing a slight decrease with increasing temperature, with severe 
changes at phase changes. Convective heat transfer (Pconv) plays a role in processes that 
include material melting and is defined as the energy transport due to change in atom 
position, and therefore, includes a mass transport also. In general, the liquid flow field 
depends on the temperature effects, geometry of the melt pool, and melt speed. An 
overview of the main energy transport effects is summarized in Figure 2.45.

light or oxide layers [Ind18, Küg19]. Absorption measurements have mostly been 
made on solid materials (e.g., [Dau93]). Lasers are often used as light source for the 
absorption measurements due to their distinct wavelengths, which makes it easier to 
relate an absorption value to a certain wavelength.
Absorption measurement methods mainly include calorimetric and radiometric 
measurements [Ber08]. Direct calorimetric measurements include thermocouples 
attached to the specimen [Het76]. However, thermocouple measurements require 
the knowledge of heat conductivity and dissipation effects [Gon07]. Therefore, water 
calorimetric measurements have been developed that are more accurate, but take 
some time to reach equilibrium states [Pep11].
Indirect radiometric measurements are suitable for absorption measurements 
when transmission of light through the material can be neglected, which is typi­
cally the case for metals in the dimensions relevant for high-power laser engineer­
ing. Kirchoff´s law correlates the spectral emissivity to the absorption. Integrating 
spheres (e.g., [Ber07]) are used, where the reflected laser light is absorbed and quan­
tified. Furthermore, methods include gonio reflectometry, integrating mirror reflec­
tometry, and emittance spectroscopy [Zhu04, Mod03, Tho82].
However, measurements at higher temperatures are difficult. Absorption values 
are often approximated at higher temperatures based on linear extrapolations.
2.5.2  Absorption of Metals
The absorptivity is a value that does not contain the absorption mechanism into the 
material. In case of metals, absorption takes place in a thin surface layer. In general, 
absorptivity depends on material parameters such as the refractive and absorption 
indices, electric and heat conductivity, and the specific heat. Knowing these param­
eters in combination with the laser wavelength and polarization, the absorptivity can 
be approximately calculated. Besides the material parameters, absorptivity depends 
on surface conditions (e.g., roughness), material geometry (e.g., material thickness), 
and applied or ambient gases. Furthermore, phase changes and vapor or plasma for­
mation can influence the absorbed laser energy.
In general, metals are highly reflective, which means that laser light absorption 
is low. However, absorption varies with the wavelength of light (Figure 2.46). The 
FIGURE 2.46  Wavelength-dependent absorptivity of different materials at room tempera­
ture and perpendicular laser beam illumination.

material dependence of the absorption of laser energy in different materials is shown 
in Figure 2.46 [Spi69]. Modern laser systems at 1 µm wavelength show a tendency to 
higher absorbance compared to CO2 lasers (wavelength 10.6 µm) on typical materi­
als for laser material processing.
Electromagnetic waves can be described using the Maxwell’s equations. Beer’s

Due to the short interaction distance, the laser beam can be typically well described

theories.

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
The mechanism of the absorption of laser energy in a surface layer is already 
under investigation for a long time and theories have continuously been improving. 
One of the first models was the Drude’s model, which was developed based on the 
assumption that the free electrons are accelerated by the electric field and damped by 
collisions with phonons, other electrons, and lattice imperfections. Other theories, 
e.g. the Drude’s theory, are based on solid-state absorptivity [Dru00]. The Drude’s 
theory is based on classical physics and enables a good qualitative description of the 
absorption in many cases. One improvement of the model was the inclusion of the 
Fermi-statistics (e.g., [Pri95]).
The Fresnel equations explain the impact of the laser polarization, laser beam angle, 
and material properties on the absorption at a material interface with two different 
refractive indices. The absorptivity of an electromagnetic field (Maxwell’s theory) is

For a CO2 and YAG laser beam, typical absorption curves depending on the inci­
dent angle are presented in Figure 2.47. The absorption of the s-polarized part of the 
laser light decreases at increased incident angles, while the p-polarized part shows 
an increase with a peak at the Brewster angle, where the absorption shows a maxi­
mum value and the p-polarized light is hardly reflected at tanϕ
= n
Brewster
.
Unpolarized or randomly polarized laser beams are typically described by taking 
the numerical average between p- and s-polarized absorption. At lower wavelengths, 
the Brewster angle decreases. At higher temperatures, in general, a higher absorption 
can be expected.
Typically, an increased absorption is expected at increasing temperature with a 
jump at the phase transition from solid to liquid. The absorptivity increases with 
the temperature. A slight increase can be observed when increasing the temperature 
below the melting point and a sudden increase occurs when the temperature 
is close to the melting point. It is assumed that the material in a semisolid state 
shows surface roughening, which leads to a rougher surface and therefore a 

39
Theoretical Background
higher absorptivity due to multiple reflections on the rough surface (e.g. [Dau93]). 
Additional effects can alter the absorptance such as the creation of a plasma or scat­
tering of light on small material particles in the vapor plume.
At higher temperatures, the laser beam absorption and further impacts of high 
temperature are widely unknown. The measurement of absorption on liquid or even 
boiling surfaces is challenging due to additional effects to consider such as thermal 
expansion, vapor ejection, and melt pool dynamics. Some attempts have been made 
using integrating spheres showing a slight increase in absorptivity at increasing tem­
perature and wavelength [Bob80]. In addition, parallel temperature measurement 
must be conducted in order to relate the measured absorption to a certain tempera­
ture, which is challenging as well due to the often-missing knowledge about the 
actual emissivity of the material at high temperatures and the impact of high tem­
peratures on the measuring equipment.
Recent radiographic measurements using a diode laser reflecting on a liquid metal 
surface confirmed the general trend of higher absorption at elevated temperatures 
[Vol23c] that interband and intraband absorption theories predict. Between melting 
and boiling temperatures, a local absorption minimum has been found, following 
the trend of combined intraband and interband absorption predictions (Figure 2.48). 
Above boiling temperature, the absorption values showed values closer to the sole 
intraband theory.
Around boiling temperature of steel, it has been shown that Brewster angles 
decrease to surprisingly low values that the Fresnel equations do not predict 
(Figure 2.49) [Vol23c]. Modeling the surface as a multi-layer structure with several 
interfaces between air, Knudsen layer, surface, and base material has helped to 
describe the observed trend. The results suggest that surface layering can possibly 
help to explain the absorptance effect at elevated temperatures.

2.5.3  Heat Transfer in Materials
In laser material processing, the heat conduction equation is typically used to 
describe the thermal impact of the absorbed laser energy in a material. For solving 
the heat conduction equation, it is usually assumed that no convective or radiative 
losses appear since they are usually comparably low and that material properties are 
temperature independent. Common models can be distinguished in empirical, ana­
lytical, and numerical models. Empirical modeling uses input data from experiments 
to continue simulating certain aspects of a process. Analytical models use general 
relations between parameters to derive the results. More complex relations cannot be 
described with direct parameter relations but must be numerically solved in time-
stepwise calculations. Such numerical models use typically finite element methods, 
e.g., for structural deformation calculations. Computational fluid dynamics models 
can also simulate fluid movement, which can help in describing the melt flow inside 
melt pools, spattering, or pore formation.

Analytical solutions of the heat conduction equation exist for simplified bound­
ary conditions. When flat surfaces are irradiated, moving surface heat sources are 
usually sufficient to describe the heat input into the material. The temperature field

A surface heat source on a semi-infinite specimen induces a 3D temperature pro­
file moving in x-direction with the energy source in Watt per square meter and can be 
evaluated numerically (e.g., [Mat10]). Thereby, the spatial intensity distribution can 
be adapted. When a vapor channel is present in the process, other approaches can be 
used to include the energy input in depth for numerical simulations, e.g., the Goldak 
heat source [Kaz09] having a double ellipsoid heat input.
For finite element calculations, thermal field calculations enable the prediction 
of thermal distortion, residual stresses, and the occurring phases. The used meshes 
are typically larger compared to the fine meshes used for fluid dynamic simulations 
and phase changes are often not directly modeled, which make the calculation time 
comparably low. Fluid dynamic models require typically finer meshes and shorter 
time steps in order to simulate material melting and even vaporization (e.g., [Ki02a], 
[Ki02b], [Vol16a]). However, even the creation of the keyhole and porosity, or spat­
tering can be simulated [Ott11].
Latent heats of melting and vaporization are often required for process simula­
tions but are typically difficult to integrate into the equations. The energy needed 
during heating to overcome the bonding energy of the lattice is typically isothermal. 
The same considerations are necessary during cooling.
Modeling approaches are partly highly advanced and can predict real-world rela­
tions quite accurately. However, often simulations are used to find working process 
parameters or to increase knowledge about data that are not accessible or measurable.

Theoretical Background
most of the material parameters are temperature-dependent. However, in special 
cases, the temperature-dependence can be neglected for modeling of processes.
2.6.1  Surface Tension
An important material property regarding fluid behavior is the surface tension. It 
defines, e.g., the wetting characteristics [Eus13], the Marangoni flow, and melt pool 
dynamics [Sem06]. Surface tension is the resulting force needed to increase the sur­
face area against the tangential bonding forces in a surface. It can also be defined as 
the energy needed to increase a surface area. Compared to a bulk atom/molecule that 
typically has twelve direct neighbors, there are only nine neighbors on the surface. 
This leads to the surface forces and the resulting surface tension [Mar11].
The surface tension is temperature-dependent. For pure materials, the surface ten­
sion decreases in general with the increasing temperature and can be, e.g., described 
as [Kee88]:
	
,
0
(
)
γ = γ −∆γ ⋅
−
T
Tm
with Tm being the melting temperature. This formula is mainly based on the mea­
surements and calculations just above the melting temperature of the materials, e.g., 
maximum 2400 K for iron and steel (e.g., [Sey99, Mor11, Pok63]). However, this 
formula indicates that at a certain temperature, the surface tension disappears or 
even becomes negative. The main challenge of surface tension measurements are 
the conditions at such high temperatures that influence the measurements or affect 
the measurement equipment. Furthermore, liquid surfaces can become dynamic and 
show temperature gradients, which makes the definition of the actual temperature 
challenging. In addition, temperature measurement itself is a challenge at such high 
temperatures due to similar reasons.
Several surface tension measurement methods were developed (e.g., [Dre02]). For 
liquid metals, non-contact methods are preferred to avoid impacts on equipment. 
Therefore, oscillating drops can be used for measuring the surface tension, either 
during falling [Mat05] or more commonly while levitated [Tri88]. Also, sessile drop 
and pendant drop methods can be used to some extent. The maximum bubble pres­
sure method enables measurements at high temperatures by evaluating the maxi­
mum pressure in a gas bubble pressed into the liquid material, but requires a tube 
physically moved into the liquid. Characteristic wave frequencies of surface waves 
traveling on the liquid metal can be related to the surface tension. Descriptions of the 
surface waves as capillary waves allow the calculation of surface tension depending 
on the wavelength and frequency (e.g. [Sch19]). Recent measurements using surface 
wave observations indicate that the decrease in surface tension is steeper than what 
linear approximations predict [Vol23e]. Above boiling temperature, the surface ten­
sion seems to stop decreasing (Figure 2.50).
2.6.2  Phase Changes
Laser processing utilizes the thermal impact on materials. Materials can remain in 
solid state (e.g., during hardening), be transferred to liquid state (e.g., heat conduction 

44
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
welding), or even be locally vaporized (e.g., deep penetration welding). In many pro­
cesses, several phases appear at the same time, which means that thermal gradients 
occur; latent heats must be considered due to phase changes, and emissivity and 
absorptivity usually vary within the processing zone. Therefore, thermodynamic 
material properties play an important role in laser processing. Heat and mass transfer 
need to be known, e.g., for predicting porosity formation.
The mechanical properties and the material performance depend on the resulting 
microstructure that defines if the material is weldable. The microstructure mainly 
depends on the chemical composition and the thermal cycles applied. For the micro­
structural development, often the characteristic t8/5 time (temporal duration dur­
ing cooling of the material volume from 800°C to 500°C) is used to describe the 
thermal cycle and estimate the resulting microstructure from a thermal treatment 
(Figure 2.51).
FIGURE 2.51  Typical thermal cycle during laser material processing with characteristic 
t8/5 time.
FIGURE 2.50  Surface tension of steel at elevated temperatures measured from propagating 
surface waves. (Adapted from [Vol23e].)

45
Theoretical Background
In addition, laser processes induce material changes regarding microstructures. 
The heating and in particular the cooling conditions define the resulting micro­
structure after the thermal treatment. Typically, rapid cooling leads to the growth 
of comparably large grains. In steels, the transformation of austenite into martensite 
is induced. Phase changes can be desired (e.g., for surface hardening) or unwanted 
(e.g., when induced in the heat-affected zone during welding). Depending on the 
local thermal cycle that a volume element experiences, different microstructures can 
form. In general, larger grains are more brittle and can lead to cracking.
After a rapid thermal cycle produced by a laser beam, the created melt pool condi­
tions often lead to dendritic grain growth during solidification.
In general, the resulting microstructure depends on
•	 the chemical composition of the material and its possible variations (e.g., 
element vaporization, chemical reactions),
•	 initial microstructure and precipitations,
•	 holding time above austenization temperature,
•	 heating and cooling rates, and
•	 melt convection and diffusion processes.
Different lattice structures of the same material are possible at different tempera­
tures, which is the basis of surface treatments of metals. This process is typically 
accompanied by volume changes, induced stresses, and plastic deformation, which 
can in turn hinder the transformation or even cause cracks.

Element diffusion in a lattice mainly depends on the concentration gradient and the 
thermal cycle. The macroscopic diffusion can be described as

Diffusion effects are, in particular, relevant for the short thermal cycle laser pro­
cesses. E.g., in steels, carbon diffusion can be interrupted during rapid cooling, which 
can form phases that are not expected in equilibrium cooling conditions. At quasi-
static conditions, where the steel has a very long time to cool, the Fe-C-diagram can 
be used to predict the resulting microstructure. However, when rapidly cooling, con­
tinuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) and time-temperature-transformation (TTT) 
diagrams (Figure 2.52) must be considered since non-equilibrium situations occur. 
Typically, the martensite start and end temperatures and austenization temperatures 
are increased at rapid thermal cycles.
2.7  PROCESS MONITORING
2.7.1  Process Emissions
Multiple emissions occur during laser processing that can be used to identify process 
characteristics. This information can be used for process monitoring and even for 
process control. Typical in-process emissions are shown in Figure 2.53, with typical 
ranges of wavelengths given in Table 2.11.
Optical emissions mainly originate from the reflections of the laser beam light 
on the surface, which can give indications about the process dynamics and thermal 
emissions due to heating. Acoustic emissions originate from the melt pool move­
ment, vapor outflow and can transmit in the ambient gas or air or also within the 
material. Material is ejected in the form of spatters or vapor. Thermal radiation 
occurs from the heated surface.
Thermocouples can be installed to measure temperatures at fixed positions usu­
ally on solid material around the track area. Since the measurement happens further

rates and resulting phases.

47
Theoretical Background
away from the melt pool, often thermal simulation models are calibrated to the mea­
sured temperatures to derive thermal information about the processing zone.
Radiographic thermal measurements do not require contact of the measuring 
device and are therefore useful to retain temperature data closer to the laser-induced 
track. Those sensors require translation of spectral emissions into temperature. 
Cameras or pyrometers use different wavelengths to analyze. One-color sensors 
need to be calibrated to give absolute temperature values but can already give 
useful information about temperature changes during a process. Multi-color sys­
tems evaluate minimum two wavelengths or wavelength range emissions. This can 
be done using a Dualscope [Dew20c], RGB-camera (e.g. [Vol23c]), or two-color 
pyrometers (e.g. [Gat14]). When the spectral sensitivity of the sensor is known, 
Planck´s curves can be used to calculate the temperature. In the calculation, black 
body radiation is often assumed, which might require calibration to an offset. The 
advantage of two-color systems is the independence from emissivity characteris­
tics of the material.
2.7.2  Process Sensors
Process sensors can be categorized based on their application purpose. Pre-process 
detectors aim for detecting, e.g.,
•	 the position of joining partners,
•	 the gap and gap width between the joining partners, and
•	 the position of the tool center point.

In-process sensors can detect, e.g.,
•	 the welding depth or root fusion,
•	 holes, dropouts, and pores, and
•	 the seam position.
Post-process evaluation can identify, e.g.,
•	 cracks, undercut notches,
•	 holes/pinholes (open pores),
•	 insufficient fill, and
•	 seam and edge quality.
Based on the emissions from the laser processes, sensors are chosen in order to 
get information about the process, while some sensors are used for pre-, in-, and 
post-process tasks (Figure 2.54).
Pre-process sensors are used to identify the correct positioning of the laser beam 
in relation to the specimen. This can be done, e.g., using visual cameras or triangula­
tion sensors to identify the gap position for welding (Figure 2.55). During laser beam 
cutting, often induction sensors are used to maintain the distance between the sheet 
and the gas nozzle.
In-process monitoring is used extensively in research for detecting the spectral 
characteristics of vapor or plasma, temperature fields (thermocouples, thermal imag­
ing), acoustic emissions for quantifying process dynamics or imaging system to 
detect geometrical and temporal events (Figure 2.56). Scientific methods include, 
e.g., high-speed imaging or inline X-ray CT. However, many methods are applicable 
to be also used in industrial environment and even usable for process control. Optical 
coherence tomography can, e.g., measure the keyhole depth during deep penetration

welding, while deviating signals from the desired depth can be used to immediately 
change the laser power accordingly.
Post-process measurements are typical approaches to learn about the material 
and part characteristics after processing. An immediate measurement can be tem­
perature sensors to record the cooling of the material or triangulation sensors to 
measure the geometry of the produced surface (Figure 2.57). Very typical are cross

section polishes as part of the destructive testing to learn about the microstructure 
or mechanical properties.
Additional sensors can be used to monitor equipment. Laser beam measurements 
should be conducted on a regular basis to detect possible contaminations along the 
laser beam path and the possibly related impacts of thermal lensing effects. Caustic 
measurements can be included into the process or can be conducted during process 
downtime. In addition, power meters measure the actual output power of the laser 
beam. In order to make sure that the programmed output power arrives at the pro­
cessing zone, power measurements are recommended to integrate into the regular 
processing.

3 Laser Material Processes
The laser beam as a tool for material processing provides several advantages. Due 
to the local heat input, energy can be applied where needed and precise processing 
is possible. In addition, the high local energy input enables comparably fast process­
ing. Laser processing is contactless, which means that the “laser tool” itself needs 
no maintenance. Modern beam guiding and optic designs make it possible to use the 
laser in automated ways, e.g., by robot handling. The high available beam qualities 
enable remote processing also, where optics can be positioned further away from 
the processing zone, which still reach the necessary intensities on the material’s 
surface. However, laser systems can be a large investment and must be evaluated for 
each case if, e.g., the lower processing time offers the desired benefits compared to 
conventional methods.
Laser systems are already an important part of modern production. They show 
the ability to be integrated in automated production lines, and the flexibility to be 
used for many applications and processes. The laser is an unavoidable tool to enable 
the changes required for the implementation of Industry 4.0. The industrial laser 
applications 2017 were distributed to cutting (35%), welding/brazing (16%), mark­
ing (15%), semiconductors (14%), fine metal processing (8%), non-metal processing 
(6%), and additive manufacturing (AM) (4%). Descriptions of selected high-power 
laser processes is made in the following paragraphs.
3.1  OVERVIEW
Laser processes can be categorized based on the applied intensity and interaction 
time of the laser beam with materials (Figure 3.1). The chapter starts with the pro­
cesses that operate at low intensity and take large interaction time; such processes 
include hardening, forming, and marking. At higher intensities, brazing and welding 
are possible, while at very high intensities, deep penetration welding, cutting, and 
drilling are enabled. In the end, the process variants of alloying, dispersing, and 
cladding are discussed, which lead to the AM technologies.
A laser beam carries energy in the form of photons. The lower the wavelength 
(higher frequency), the higher the energy per photon. When a laser beam inter­
acts with a metal surface, energy is either absorbed or reflected (see Section 3.5.2). 
Therefore, laser beam is typically used as a thermal tool in materials processing to 
heat the surface of materials. The transferred energy to the materials and the induced 
heating defines the achieved processes.
At low intensities, only the surface of a material is heated (Figure 3.2). At higher 
intensities, the interaction may result in melting of material and even in vaporization. 
At very high intensities, plasma can form, which can be very hot but reduces the 
transferred laser energy to the material. Roughly as a thumb rule, intensity required

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
for metal heating is about ~103 W/cm2 and vaporization starts at ~106 W/cm2 for 
CO2 lasers and at ~104 W/cm2 for lasers with around 1 µm wavelength. As described 
earlier, absorption effects depend on many parameters, which makes an accurate 
prediction of the regime difficult, but can help to have a good starting point when 
developing a process.
Material properties (absorption, heat dissipation, etc.) and part geometries define 
the material reaction to laser heating. The main process parameters typically used 
for developing laser processes are
•	
intensity (power transferred per illuminated area) and
•	
line energy (energy input per traveled distance).
FIGURE 3.2  Laser beam heating regimes depending on the laser beam intensity.
FIGURE 3.1  Rough categorization of selected high-power laser processes.

53
Laser Material Processes
Typical advantages of laser processing technologies are high precision and com­
parably low, but local energy input, while no direct mechanical forces are necessary. 
This can lead to short production times and high quality. Processes can be highly 
flexible with respect to geometries and materials. Process efficiency can be improved 
compared to other processes, although high wall plug energy is typically required 
to run a laser. When the processing speed is high enough and quality requirements 
cannot be fulfilled otherwise, the laser is the ultimate tool to use.
Laser processing heads are usually mounted on a robot or a computational numer­
ical control (CNC) machine due to the required precision of positioning and high 
processing speeds. Nowadays, industrial applications are installed in mass produc­
tion for repetitive tasks. However, the possible advantages of tailoring the laser beam 
to customized processes are in progress.
3.2  SAFETY
When working with lasers, precautions are necessary. Lasers are classified into four 
laser classes. Only class 1 lasers are not harmful to humans. Class 2 lasers are in 
the range of 0–1 mW, followed by class 3R (1–5 mW) and 3B (5–500 mW) lasers, 
where an eye injury risk is medium/high. Severe damage must be expected when 
using class 4 lasers. Lasers above 0.5 W in continuous wave (cw) as used in high-
power laser processing are all class 4. For increasing safety, processing cells can 
be installed to make the processing area sealed from the outside. When using the 
correct housing, the operators outside are safe from laser impacts, denoting a class 1 
zone outside.
All laser machines must be labeled with laser class. Laser warning signs need 
to be installed to make people aware of the risk including laser wavelength and 
maximum output power. For protection of humans, safety for eyes and other precau­
tions need to be provided according to the risks. Not only directed laser light can be 
dangerous for the human eye but also reflections (diffuse or on reflective surfaces) 
can be dangerous. Even a collimated laser beam focused on a small area inside the 
eye can increases its intensity and cause irreparable damage. This also happens in 
case of invisible infrared and near-UV light. CO2 laser light (mid-infrared) is mainly 
absorbed in the outer cornea and might burn those parts.
Therefore, wearing appropriate laser safety goggles for all emitted wavelengths 
is mandatory (indicated by a high-optical density, OD, number for the emitted wave­
length), which usually protects the eye from a 10 s collimated beam, but there is 
still a high risk when illuminated by a focused beam. The goggles should have no 
scratches or damage.
Further protective measures should be installed such as passive walls that show 
slow melting at irradiation. This gives operators a chance to press an emergency stop 
button. Active walls can initiate an emergency stop due to their integrated sensors for 
automatic shut-down at too high energy illumination. Warning lights, key switches, 
warning signs, and safety training complement a safe laser handling.
Secondary risks like burning of material or creation of fumes and toxic gases 
must be considered when creating the setup, and suitable protection mechanisms 
need to be in place, e.g., exhaust systems, shielding, and protection gases.

3.3  SURFACE HARDENING
3.3.1  Overview
Laser surface hardening is a process within the category of surface treatment, where 
the material is heated to temperatures typically below the melting point to initiate 
phase transformations that can alter the mechanical properties of the surface volume. 
No additional material is needed for this process. The laser beam is used as the heat 
source to initiate the surface heating. Since usually no melting is involved, shielding 
gas to protect the processing zone from the environment is not always mandatory. 
For some materials, oxidation effects need to be avoided by applying shielding gas.
Typically, low laser beam intensities (~103 W/cm2) are sufficient to induce surface 
hardening. For this, CO2 lasers, solid-state lasers, and in particular, diode lasers can 
be used. The typical surface layer thickness that can be hardened is usually in the 
range of 0.5–1.5 mm. The main process parameters are laser power (typically in the 
range of 1–5 kW) and processing speed (typically in the range of 0.5–10 m/min), 
while at higher laser power and lower speed, there is a general tendency to wider 
and deeper hardened surface layers. Typical hardened surface regions are shown in 
Figure 3.3.
Since the laser beam is absorbed by a solid flat surface (Figure 3.4), the absorp­
tivity is comparably low. The laser beam can be inclined in order to increase the 
energy absorption due to the general trend of increased absorption at higher incident 
angles. When using a polarized laser beam, this effect can be even enhanced (see 
Section 3.5.2). Additionally, surface preparation can increase absorptance, e.g., addi­
tional coatings or sand blasting. In general, rougher surfaces increase the possibility 
of laser rays to be absorbed and reflected from the surface to another area on the 
surface. Such multiple reflections and absorptions increase the energy input.
The shape of the hardened zone is mainly defined by the heat conduction of the 
absorbed energy on the material’s surface. Therefore, the hardened zone typically 
shows a round shape following the isotherms created in the material. The appearance 
of hardened zones can be altered by changing the energy input or varying the inten­
sity (laser power and process speed). Another way of influencing the shape of the 
hardened zone is beam shaping (see Section 3.4.4). Beam shaping in hardening is a 
FIGURE 3.3  Cross sections of hardened surface regions at different laser powers and pro­
cessing speeds.

55
Laser Material Processes
common way to increase the hardened area, when wider hardened zones are desired. 
Since low intensities are needed, a simple defocusing widens the laser spot on the 
material (typical used spot diameters are in the range of 1–10 mm) and increases the 
hardened zone dimensions if the intensity or line energy can be increased enough 
to still induce the hardening process. In addition, beam shaping using diffractive 
or refractive optics or oscillation mirrors can tailor the local energy input. High-
intensity peaks should be avoided in static beam shapes to avoid local melting. In 
dynamic beam shaping using oscillation optics, path planning often needs optimiza­
tion. During the acceleration and deceleration of beam oscillation pattern, the laser 
beam illuminates sections for varying time durations. Therefore, in particular, at the 
turning points, melting can occur.
The laser beam enables a local energy input. Comparable effects in the material 
are induced during conventional hardening methods (e.g., induction, flame, or oven 
heating), but faster processes are possible using the laser beam technology. The local 
energy input leads to lower distortion effects compared to conventional methods, 
where the whole part or large sections are heat treated. The disadvantage can be 
comparably low hardening depths. Applications of hardening tasks can be found in 
tools, inside of cylinders, or for drilling holes.
3.3.2  Martensite Hardening
The main principle of hardening a surface is to induce phase changes in the sur­
face-near area. In steels, martensite (transformation) hardening is typically applied. 
Carbon-steels with carbon contents between 0.4% and 1.5% work well to induce this 
effect. Thereby, the austenization temperature is aimed to be reached during the pro­
cess in combination with self-quenching or induced quenching to form martensite 
(Figure 3.5) [Sch10]. The carbon in the ferrite structure leads to distorted microstruc­
tures that show high hardness. Compared to conventional hardening processes, the 
laser energy input can be tailored to reach temperatures just below the melting point.
The locally reached temperature and holding time define if phase transforma­
tion happens from face-centered-cubic (ferrite) to body-centered-cubic (austenite) 
FIGURE 3.4  Principle sketch of a laser hardening setup.

56
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
and during cooling to the body-centered tetragonal structure (martensite) without 
significant carbon diffusion. Martensite has a higher volume compared to ferrite and 
austenite, which leads to residual compressive stresses during its structure forma­
tion. In addition to the martensitic hardness, those stresses can increase the hardness 
even more.
3.3.3  Laser Martensite Hardening
Hardening processes are in general well known and examined. However, the short 
thermal cycles during laser processing can lead to different behaviors compared to 
the regularly used slow cooling hardening processes. At the typical short thermal 
cycles when using laser processing [Gar19], fast cooling can induce martensitic phase 
transition and strengthening in carbon steels. Fast heating occurs in the range of 
~100 K/s [Wis85], which also induces an increase in the transformation temperature 
(Ac1 and Ac3, start and finish of austenization). Time-temperature-transformation 
(TTT) diagrams help to describe changes due to faster heating compared to equilib­
rium heating (Figure 3.6). In laser beam processes, the cooling rates are typically so 
high at and around the processing zone that martensite hardening is induced.
Martensite hardening is based on the availability of carbon, which needs to be 
homogeneously distributed in the surface region to achieve a surface layer of homo­
geneous properties. However, the homogenization of carbon in the lattice takes time. 
Such a diffusion process is related to the carbon gradient in the material and expo­
nentially to the temperature (see Section 3.6.3). Due to the induced short thermal 
cycles, even after reaching temperatures above Ac3, carbon may not be homoge­
neously distributed, which can lead to inhomogeneous microstructures and poten­
tially lower hardness values than expected, since martensite transformation cannot 
be induced everywhere (Figure 3.7). In such cases, depending on the base material, 
austenite or retained ferrite grains can remain in the material. On the one hand, this 
effect can be considered unwanted since the intended homogeneously hardened sur­
face is not achieved, and on the other hand, the creation of mixed structures opens

typical maximum temperatures of conventional and laser treatments.

57
Laser Material Processes
new possibilities of tailoring the hardness and potentially other properties directly 
by applying the needed temperature field using the related laser parameters.
Fast cooling is typically induced by self-quenching. The hardened surface areas are 
typically small compared to the part dimension. Therefore, heat is efficiently and rapidly 
transferred away from the processing zone. Cooling rates of ~10 000 K/s are possible 
during laser processes. In order to further increase the cooling rate, external quenching 
can be applied. Using oil or water to rapidly decrease the temperature of the whole part 
or locally of certain volumes can support the hardening process. The complete thermal 
cycle defines the resulting hardness in every volume element (Figure 3.8). This includes 
the heating time, the holding time at high temperatures and the cooling rate.
A main difference of laser hardening compared to other hardening processes is 
that not the whole part or large sections are heat treated with the same temperature 
FIGURE 3.6  Principle sketch of a TTT diagram with different exemplary cooling curves.
FIGURE 3.7  (a) Calculated thermal cycles in the respective areas: Microstructure after 
laser surface treatment at the (b) transition, (c) middle, and (d) overlapping areas [Dew22].

58

profile. The temperature history of each volume element of the heat-treated material 
can significantly vary in depth and distance from the heat source center. Therefore, it 
is necessary to consider that each volume element has a different thermal experience. 
Depending on the thermal cycle at the local volume, different microstructures can form 
at different locations (Figure 3.9). This can lead to complex hardness profiles in depth.
3.3.4  Precipitation Hardening
Besides martensitic hardening, precipitation hardening is an additional effect that can 
increase surface hardness (e.g., [Har95]). Thereby, addition of alloying elements, 
FIGURE 3.8  Examples of thermal simulations in top view including the related hardened 
tracks (a, b) and thermal cycles with heating, holding, and cooling times (c, d) [Dew22].

hardness values in depth.

59
Laser Material Processes
e.g., titanium, vanadium, and niobium, to the chemical composition can create fine 
precipitates (nitrides, carbo-nitrides) on mainly grain boundaries and suppress grain 
growth, which induces a higher hardness after cooling.
3.3.5  Beam Shaping for Surface Treatment
Beam shaping methods can be used for homogenization of the temperature field on the 
material’s surface to use, e.g., higher laser powers without melting local surface and 
still reaching high enough temperatures on a large area. Typical beam shaping equip­
ment include kaleidoscopes, mirrors, diffractive optical elements (DOE) including axi­
cons or transmissive lenses for refractive beam shaping. Furthermore, beam oscillation 
optics are flexible tools to change the intensity profile with temporal variation, while 
a comparably small spot is moved over a large area at high speed by moving mirrors. 
Thereby, the oscillation frequency and amplitude define the spot movement and the 
heat input. The laser beam can be moved fast enough not to melt the surface, while the 
accumulated heat input is high enough to reach surface heating. In practice, mechan­
ical limitations of the mirror movement need to be considered, since programmed 
patterns might not always be reached due to too high necessary accelerations. Beam 
shaping mainly changes the geometry of the hardened zone. A Gaussian-like, a square 
top-hat, and a 4 × 4 DOE spot distribution are compared in Figure 3.10.
Beam shaping technologies offer the possibility to produce different widths 
of the hardened zones and different temperature fields on the material’s surface 
(Figure 3.11). The strong variations in the hardness values indicate that islands of 
retained ferrite with lower hardness values are present, in particular, in the transi­
tion zones from the hardened zone to the base material.
3.3.6  Practical Issues
While hardening curved surfaces, different absorption values must be expected in 
different areas due to different incident laser beam angles relative to the surface. 
Reflections from part surfaces can lead to unexpected local heat inputs. In particu­
lar, multiple reflections and additional absorption spots are possible that can locally 
FIGURE 3.10  Hardened surface areas in cross-sectional view at (a) Gaussian beam, 
(b) square top-hat beam, and (c) 4 × 4 spot beam illumination [Dew20b].

60
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
increase the heat input, which in turn can lead to local melting. Such heat accumula­
tion can happen, e.g., at crankshaft hardening, where the laser beam has to be trans­
ferred into the fillet with a steep angle. Beam shaping in combination with temperature 
monitoring and possibly control can counteract the problem of local overheating.
Another typical effect in laser hardening occurs while hardening large areas that 
require several hardened tracks next to each other. The previously hardened surface 
area is affected by the heat input of the subsequent tracks. Every subsequent heat input 
induces thermal cycles in the already hardened area that might not lead to the desired 
martensitic hardening again. Therefore, a soft zone can be created that locally reduces 
the hardness and can be a weak section where, e.g., fatigue cracking can be initiated. 
A similar effect occurs when one track is applied with the same start and end point, 
where the already hardened starting area is heat treated again by the process end.
3.3.7  Laser Shock Peening (for Hardening)
A special way of inducing deformation of a material to increase its hardness is 
laser shock peening. The hardening is induced by a laser pulse of high inten­
sity (>1 GW/cm2), which creates a shock wave on the material’s surface. Air or 
other gases are ionized. The so-created plasma expands and induces a surface 
pressure, which induces plastic deformations in a few millimeters depth and 
the related residual stresses. Hardness and strength of the treated volume typi­
cally increase and often corrosion resistance can be improved along with fatigue 
behavior. Laser shock peening processes are used for many purposes such as 
hardening turbine blades or plane structures.
3.4  LASER FORMING
Laser forming is a highly flexible thermo-mechanical process. The laser energy input 
is used to induce thermal distortion to shape the part. No additional hard tooling or 
FIGURE 3.11  Hardness profile from the center of the hardened zone in horizontal direction.

61
Laser Material Processes
external forces are needed to be applied. Solely the locally induced thermal field in 
the sheet produces the necessary deformation.
The laser beam caustic shows a small radial dimension, and the processing plane 
can be positioned far away from the laser optics. Due to these features, the laser 
beam can even reach part locations that are not accessible with conventional bending 
tools. The good accessibility of laser beams enables the complex shaping of many 
parts and components. All materials that can absorb the used laser beam can, in prin­
ciple, be processed for laser forming. This enables a wide range of usable materials 
for forming procedures, e.g., the bending of otherwise hard-to-form materials.
The laser beam is typically defocused on the material’s surface using low inten­
sities that do not melt the surface. The creation of mushy zones or even melting 
destroys the bonds in the lattice and cannot lead to the desired controlled plastic 
forming. In a solid material, the induced thermal gradients into the material create 
the necessary stresses to lead to the plastic deformation needed to form sheets. The 
introduced thermal stresses in the material’s surface induce plastic strains that bend 
the material along this path. Typically, the laser beam is moved along the bending 
line over the part to be shaped. 
Depending on the induced temperature field in the material, different bending 
effects occur. The temperature gradient mechanism is initiated when mainly the 
upper part of the structure is heated (Figure 3.12a). This effect occurs when the 
sheets are thick compared to the impacted surface by the laser beam. The thermal 
expansion first leads to elastic deformation (counter bending) and partly plastic 
deformation. After turning off the laser beam, heat conduction induces contraction 
heating of the lower structure part and plastic deformation. During the remain­
ing cooling time, the structure bends slightly back, releasing the elastic thermal 
deformation. Some typical surface occurrences and bended sheets are shown in 
Figure 3.13.
The buckling mechanism is induced when the laser beam leads to an expansion of 
the heated area and thermally induced contraction and the related material reaction 
(Figure 3.12b). In case of an inhomogeneous heating where heat is accumulated in the 
lower parts of the sheet, a bending of the sheet in the opposite direction can be achieved.
FIGURE 3.12  Forming mechanisms using a laser beam.

62
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
When the induced heat impacts the whole thickness of the sheet nearly homo­
geneously in depth, mainly an elongation of the sheet can be achieved. The plastic 
deformation is initiated along the sheet and after cooling and release of the elastic 
deformation, the sheet is elongated (Figure 3.12c).
Due to the complex stresses that may already exist in the sheets from the 
sheet production process, the result after laser bending is difficult to predict. In 
addition, complex stress fields can be induced due to variations in heat input or 
accumulations of heat at the beginning or end of the sheets or at cut-out parts in 
the sheet. Corrections after laser bending can be necessary. Based on the actual 
geometric measurements of the sheet after the process, counteracting laser treat­
ments can be calculated and initiated in the next forming steps [Tho20]. The 
laser forming process is easy to control and can show good energy efficiency. It 
is, in particular, suitable for rapid prototyping and low-volume manufacturing 
processes.
3.5  LASER BEAM MARKING
Laser beam marking is a technique to create fine structures on material’s surfaces to 
label parts or imprint barcodes or other information on products. Typically, pulsed 
lasers are used; however, a surface variation in the micrometer to millimeter range 
is produced. Marking can be initiated on materials such as metals, plastics, and 
ceramics.
Two main processing strategies can be distinguished (Figure 3.14). On the one 
hand, the masking method is usually conducted using an excimer laser and is highly 
FIGURE 3.13  Processing setup including bended sheet and surface appearances at different 
single treatments at different processing speeds.

63
Laser Material Processes
efficient in mass production for printing the same information multiple times. On 
the other hand, beam oscillation is highly flexible and enables printing of custom­
ized information. The possibility of producing multiple markings next to each other 
enables larger area treatments.
When using pulsed laser beams, the pulse overlap needs to be considered as an 
important parameter that defines the resulting surface quality. Rippled structures 
might occur, which requires post-treatment to enable high-quality surfaces.
Three principal material reactions can be initiated by laser marking: (1) Removal 
of material creates grooves that can be distinguished from the rest of the material’s 
surface, due to different reflections of the surrounding light; (2) color changes can be 
initiated either by thermal or oxidation effects on metals or by pigmenting in plastics; 
and (3) volume changes by forming voids can be induced mainly in plastic materials 
(Figure 3.15).
FIGURE 3.14  Laser beam marking processing strategies using (a) a mask or (b) beam 
oscillation.
FIGURE 3.15  Material marking effects to create a marking track.

64
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Removal of material requires typically high laser powers to evaporate the material 
and/or eject the melt as spatters. The main advantage of color and volume changes 
is that no grooves exist after processing. This can be a desirable feature, e.g., when 
marking medical devices that need to be properly cleaned, which is harder to achieve 
when grooves exist.
3.6  LASER BEAM BRAZING
Laser beam brazing is a joining technology. The joining partners are metallurgi­
cally joined using additional brazing material. In laser beam brazing, the energy 
to melt the brazing material is provided by the laser beam. In contrast to welding 
processes, the joining partners are not brought to or above their melting tempera­
tures. Only the added brazing material is melted and wets the joining partners. 
Thereby, the connection of the joining partners is achieved. Therefore, the melting 
point of the joining partners should be higher than the one of the added material. 
Wire is typically used as feedstock for brazing. The wire is fed by the wire feeder 
to the processing zone. The laser beam provides the energy to melt the brazing 
material and also pre-heat the base material. Pre-heating can improve the wetting 
behavior and thereby increase the connecting area between the joining partners and 
the brazed material.
Shielding gas is typically used to avoid oxidation of the material. The heat capac­
ity of the added material should be high and the heat conductivity of the joining 
materials should be low to enable an efficient process. These characteristics will 
ensure not to lose energy to the surrounding volume.
The bonding between the joining partner and the brazing material is achieved by 
diffusion and the initiated place changes of molecules and atoms, which is called 
cohesion bonding. It is typically not adhesion bonding when molecular bonding 
is initiated. For achieving a good bonding, the wettability and thereby the wetting 
angle θ play an important role (Figure 3.16). Material combinations with good wet­
tability show small wetting angles and those with poor wettability show large wet­
ting angles.
The Young equation describes the relation between the wetting angle θb to 
the surface energies γ between the solid (S), liquid (L), and gas (G) components 
(Figure 3.14)

Laser Material Processes
The surface tension of the liquid material is often known from literature or can be 
measured. The surface energy of the solid material of the joining partner can be typi­
cally also found in literature (e.g., [Kee88]). However, in order to derive the surface 
energy between the liquid and the surrounding gas, a wetting experiment is neces­
sary. Typically, the wetting angle is measured in tests letting material drop and wet 
on sample base material. With the known surface energy of the solid and the surface 
tension of the liquid, the interface tension can be calculated.
Wetting requires a certain time until a stable shape is created. Since in laser pro­
cessing, typically the time until solidification is relatively short, full wetting may not 
be achieved. Therefore, the calculated wetting angles might differ from the actual 
brazing wetting angles. Due to the induced temperature fields in the joining partners’ 
material, wetting can be reduced or even stopped, when the base material is not 
warm enough for the liquid to continue spreading.
Wetting can be and often must be supported by applying flux in order to locally 
remove the oxide layer from the surface of the solid material. Fluxes typically consist 
of non-metallic material, e.g., silicates, carbonates, chlorides, which contain acids or 
build acids when heated that enable the mechanical removal or chemical reactions. 
Such fluxes have a low melting point (~50°C). Therefore, the temperature and time 
intervals of fluxes are limited. Alternatively, plasma cleaning supported by the kinetic 
energy of ions that break the oxide layer is possible. Thereby, the plasma process can 
be installed right before the brazing process in order to minimize the available time 
for re-oxidation. The integration of the plasma process is an additional investment 
and limits the processing flexibility due to intrinsic direction-dependence.
Typical applications of laser beam brazing can be found where an appealing 
appearance and moderate strength of the joint is necessary. Disadvantages of braz­
ing compared to welding are
•	 the comparably low tensile strength due to the bonding type, since the joint 
is based on atomic movement and diffusion instead of mixing of molten 
materials,
•	 the possible cracking due to inhomogeneous cooling of materials and the 
creation of thermal stresses that do not release during cooling and lead to 
cracking,
•	 the tendency to higher corrosion probability due to the joining of dissimilar 
materials and the possibility of creating intermetallic phases that are prone 
to corrosion. In addition, microcracks from inhomogeneous cooling denote 
access of corrosion supporting liquids,
•	 the need for flux that denotes an additional process step for its application 
on the surface, while fluxes are often unhealthy for humans and special 
care needs to be taken during the mixing of components and also during 
the processing,
•	 the often-required preparation of surfaces before joining to enable sufficient 
wetting and bonding, and
•	 the formation of brittle intermetallic phases in the material transition zone, 
which can occur due to the different material chemical compositions and 
the related increased risk of fatigue cracking during use.

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Advantages of brazing are
•	 the possibility to join different base materials. As long as the brazing mate­
rial enables sufficient bonding between each joining partner, multi-material 
joints can be achieved. This also includes the joining of metal/non-metal 
parts,
•	 the low heat input and the related low distortion, which lead to little or no 
need for correction measures to release stresses or geometry corrections,
•	 the low oxidation of the joining surfaces due to comparably low tempera­
tures and minimum time to enable oxidation at high temperatures,
•	 the low line energy, showing a minimum energy input and high process 
efficiency, and
•	 the possibly good electrical conductivity of the connection due to metal­
lurgical bonding.
3.7  LASER BEAM WELDING
Laser beam welding is a well-established joining technology, which is largely used 
in industry due to its fast and precise processing. It includes basically two modes, 
namely the heat conduction mode and the deep penetration or keyhole welding mode. 
The laser beam is used as heat source while moving relative to the specimen. In gen­
eral, the local heat input at high intensity enables a lower energy input compared to 
conventional welding heat sources and therefore faster processing and decreased 
thermal impact.
Laser beam welding has many applications including the industrial ones, reaching 
from thin sheet welding (electronics, micro-technologies, etc.) to tooling or automo­
tive industry, where nowadays more than 60 m laser welding is applied per vehicle, 
e.g., Volkswagen AG (Wolfsburg, Germany) installed the first hybrid Nd:YAG laser/
MIG welder for aluminum door parts in 2002.
In general, most metals can be laser-welded, while steel, aluminum, copper, and 
titanium are the most typical materials used. Joining different materials, in par­
ticular, dissimilar materials with different properties, can lead to challenges, e.g., 
regarding the formation of brittle intermetallic phases and increased risk of delami­
nation due to inhomogeneous deformation.
3.7.1  Heat Conduction Welding
3.7.1.1  Process Characteristics
Most conventional thermal welding methods aim to heat up the surface of the join­
ing partners to create a melt pool. The incorporated energy is transferred by heat 
conduction from the surface into the material. The shapes of the melt pools are usu­
ally wide at comparably small depths. The ratio of the depth to the width of the melt 
pools is typically much smaller than one. In conventional welding, the heat-affected 
zones (HAZs) can become large. The comparably high heat input in the material can 
induce heat effects around the molten material and affect the microstructure of the 

67
Laser Material Processes
heat-treated volume. Most materials experience phase transformations and micro­
structural changes at temperatures far below the melting temperature. Since the heat 
source is placed on the material’s surface, volume elements in the melt pool and HAZ 
experience different thermal cycles. Depending on the locally induced thermal cycle, 
different phase changes or diffusion processes can be induced. Therefore, besides 
the weld seam characteristics, the properties of the HAZ must be always considered 
as part of the welded zone in order to fully describe the joint characteristics.
Such a heat conduction-based welding mode can also be realized by a laser beam 
as a heat source. The process is called “laser heat conduction welding”. Thereby, 
the laser beam is directed and absorbed on the flat surface of the joining partners’ 
materials. Laser energy absorption takes place on the material’s surface partly on 
solid and/or liquid material depending on the process speed. At low process speed, 
the laser beam is mostly absorbed by the liquid surface, since the energy input is suf­
ficient to form a large melt pool that reaches large enough dimension to pre-heat the 
material in front of the laser beam. At very high processing speeds, the laser beam 
can move faster than the melt pool can form, and the laser beam can be partially 
absorbed by the solid material. Due to the laser beam illuminating a flat surface, a 
single laser beam ray is absorbed only one time. In order to avoid back reflections of 
the laser beam into the optical system, often the laser optic is slightly tilted by a few 
degrees. The reflected portion of the laser beam from the processing zone is scattered 
into the surrounding space and is lost for the processing. This means that according 
to the Fresnel equations, based on the laser wavelength, material parameters, and the 
surface and temperature conditions, the total energy transfer from the laser beam 
into the material can be comparably low (e.g., at 1 µm wavelength, for steel ~30%, 
aluminum ~10% and copper only ~5%). A high reflectivity of the material leads 
to the necessity that reflective material such as copper requires higher initial laser 
power (at otherwise constant conditions) in order to generate a melt pool and enable 
welding. In general, decreasing the laser wavelength increases the absorption (see 
Section 3.5.2).
Precautions must be taken to avoid unwanted heating or destruction of equipment 
in the surrounding area of the processing, since the reflected energy can still reach 
high values. Personal safety equipment is required to avoid injuries, in case there is 
no protection wall or housing around the processing area.
The absorbed energy on the material’s surface is transferred into the material by 
mainly heat conduction. A quasi-static condition is reached during welding at a con­
stant process speed, which implies that isotherms form at constant distances from 
the surface heat source. In a cross-sectional view, virtually cutting the material at the 
position of the heat source, the temperature isotherms define the shape of the melt 
pool and HAZ. At the melting temperature, the melt pool ends and the HAZ begins.
Typically, a high laser beam intensity is used for achieving the local heating and 
melting of the joining partners to form a melt pool in both materials. In order to 
achieve the required high intensities, often the laser beam waist (focal position) is 
typically positioned on the material’s surface or slightly below. The induced melt 
pool dimensions are therefore relatively small due to the small laser spot sizes. Due 
to comparably small melt pool dimensions, a large possible gap between the joining 
partners for making a butt joint must be avoided using suitable clamping and proper 

68
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
edge preparation. In addition, during welding, deformations can occur, which need 
to be considered when designing the clamping setup to avoid an opening of the gap 
and welding failures.
The laser beam is used to heat up the material above the melting temperature of 
at least one joining partner. In heat conduction mode, heating is aimed to induce 
temperatures below the vaporization temperature of the material. This means 
that a negligible amount of vaporization losses occur. However, fume and vapor 
from low-melting alloying elements and remaining dirt or oil on the surfaces can 
still be created. These emissions require protection of optics using protection 
windows and cross jets. In certain cases, it may be necessary to install addi­
tional gas streams to avoid interactions of laser beam with the produced vapor 
to avoid absorption losses in the vapor and a resulting reduced energy input into 
the material.
The heat conduction welding process is typically quite stable. It shows moderate 
melt convection and can therefore lead to smooth surfaces, low number of melt ejec­
tions and achieve high-quality weld seam appearances that fulfill the requirements 
for customer-visible applications.
Due to the low and local heat input, distortion is very low and little or no post-
treatments for geometrical corrections are necessary. The relatively fast processing 
of 1–200 m/min can reduce the processing costs compared to those of conventional 
processes, and the short thermal cycles can help to avoid the creation of extensive 
HAZ and the related unwanted phase creations. In order to avoid effects related to 
chemical reactions of the molten material with ambient gases (e.g., oxidation), often 
a shielding gas is applied to cover the processing zone with non-reactive or low-
reactive, non-soluble gases, e.g., argon, nitrogen, and helium.
The heat conduction welding can be done with or without applying filler material. 
It is typically aimed not to use additional welding wire to utilize the fast-processing 
possibilities and direction-independent remote welding. An additional setup for wire 
application with a lateral wire feeding system would reduce the processing speed 
and path freedom. However, for some applications, it may be necessary to add addi­
tional material to fill gaps or for altering the chemical composition of the weld seam. 
Beam shaping guiding the laser beam within the processing optics around a central 
wire feeding system enables coaxial wire feeding also.
3.7.1.2  Melt Pool Appearance
In general, during heat conduction welding, an energy balance occurs equating the 
input energy from the laser beam to the losses due to thermal radiation, heat conduc­
tion, vaporizing material, temperature increase, and melting (latent heat). Typically, 
thermal radiation and vaporization effects are small compared to heat conduction 
effects in heat conduction welding mode.
Assuming the creation of the melt pool by only heat conduction of a surface heat 
source, a typical model [Röm10] can be used to estimate the depth of the melt pool z

 leads to a higher necessary energy 
input to reach the same melt pool dimensions.
3.7.1.3  Melt Pool Movement
In addition to the energy transport by heat conduction, melt convection determines 
the weld seam geometry in the heat conduction welding mode. Convection transports 
energy and material, and can therefore alter the processing and geometrical dimen­
sions of the melt pools. Melt pool movement in heat conduction welding is mainly 
initiated by density differences, the surface-tension-driven Marangoni flow, shield­
ing gas application, and with typically minor impact also by electromagnetic forces, 
e.g., silicon in aluminum.
Melt flow is induced when density differences occur in the melt pool. Melt pools 
typically show highest temperatures in the center on its surface with a temperature 
gradient to the melting temperature at the melt pool border. Therefore, the molten 
material shows density gradients accordingly. Volumes with smaller density (lower 
temperatures) experience buoyancy forces and a tendency to upward movement in 
the melt pool.
In addition, surface tension is temperature-dependent. Therefore, different local 
temperatures in the melt pool lead to different values of surface tension. When 
the thermal energy of atoms increases at higher temperatures, in general, surface 
energy/surface tension is reduced. An area of lower surface tension tries to expand, 
which induces a melt flow from a high to a low temperature region. This effect is 
called the Marangoni flow. The effect depends on the properties of a material, in 
particular the temperature dependence of surface tension, chemical phases, and 
alloy compositions. The effects of surface tension can be influenced by the sur­
rounding gas impacting the temperature and surface conditions, e.g., by oxidation. 
Created oxides can slow down the flow and change the local surface tension val­
ues. Contaminations (e.g., addition of sulfur to steels) can alter the temperature-
dependence of surface tension and even turn around the melt flow under certain 
conditions (Figure 3.17).
In the moving direction of the laser beam, the melt pool shows similar tenden­
cies that are influenced by the Marangoni flow. Those flow fields can lead to slight 
bulging effects in the front and rear part of the melt pool (Figure 3.18). Due to the 
process velocity, the melt pool appears to be elongated toward the rear. This asym­
metric appearance can induce complex melt flows and eddies that impact the weld 
seam geometry and process dynamics.
The effect of temperature gradients on the melt pool can be reduced, e.g., by pre-
heating of the base plate. The intention is to decrease the thermal gradient between 

70
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
the melt pool and the base plate. Thereby, the base plate receives a higher tempera­
ture, which is closer to the peak temperature in the melt pool. The smaller thermal 
gradients lead to less heat transfer in the melt pool and thereby melt flow is reduced.
Depending on the length of the weld seam, intrinsic pre-heating can occur. The 
heat from the processing continuously heats the base plate by the induced energy of 
the laser beam (if no active cooling devises are installed). On the one hand, such pre-
heating conditions can stabilize the process. On the other hand, varying pre-heating 
conditions can alter the process. This can occur when welding parts and heat accu­
mulation occurs at edges or varying material thicknesses that can conduct the heat in 
different ways. This effect can also be the reason for the widening of welding tracks 
during the welding process. Countermeasures can be needed, such as a control of 
the laser power or active and controlled cooling, in order to avoid process variations.
Typical applications of heat conduction welding can be found in welding of pre­
cise features that demand high surface finish, thin-walled components, hermetical 
closing of structures, and multi-material joining. The heat conduction melting of 
surfaces (without the aim of joining two materials) is also used for re-melting, which 
is a form of surface treatment by changing surface properties without additional

melt pool including melt flows.

71
Laser Material Processes
material. A side-effect of re-melting can be an increased hardness of the track, while 
cracks can be avoided by pre-heating (e.g., induction). The method can also be used 
for repair of cracks, surface smoothening, or increasing mechanical properties.
3.7.2  Laser Deep Penetration Welding
Modern laser systems enable very high intensity values on the material’s surface. 
Such local high intensities can even induce vaporization. When used for welding, 
this mode is called “laser deep penetration welding”. The total energy input increases 
and weld seams with depth to width ratios above one can be achieved. Conventional 
welding methods cannot reach such high local intensities. Electron beams and partly 
plasma setups can achieve a similar effect of local vaporization and deep impacts 
inside the material.
3.7.2.1  Deep Penetration Threshold
At increasing laser beam intensity by using higher laser power or smaller laser spot 
sizes, the energy absorption on the surface initially shows only a slight increase. In 
the heat conduction mode, absorption mainly increases due to higher absorptivity 
of the material’s surface at higher temperatures, while still only one absorption pro­
cess happens for each incoming ray (Figure 3.19). However, at the deep penetration 
intensity threshold Ith, a significant increase in absorption can be observed. At this 
threshold, a vapor channel inside the melt pool is created. The vapor channel occurs 
when the local intensity is high enough to induce vaporization and create an indenta­
tion and then a vapor hole. The vapor channel is also called keyhole, and is typical 
for the deep penetration process. After its creation, the keyhole is (in optimal case) 
kept open during the processing and is surrounded by the melt pool, while the laser 
beam and work piece are moved relative to each other to create the weld seam.
The shape of the keyhole leads to an increased absorptance of laser light. The 
incoming rays experience multiple reflections and absorption on the keyhole walls 
FIGURE 3.19  Absorptance depending on laser intensity including deep penetration Ith and 
plasma threshold Ipl.

72
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
before the rays exit or are completely absorbed [Dau95]. Absorption values of up to 
80% can be achieved [Fab05]. This special process feature enables the energy input 
deep into the material and thereby the deep weld seams.
At even higher intensities, ionized vapor or plasma can form, which can shield the 
laser beam from transferring energy to the processing zone. Laser energy is thereby 
absorbed to ionize vapor or gas, which can decrease the total absorption into the 
work piece.
In the deep penetration mode, laser energy is transported and absorbed into 
deeper regions of the material. Therefore, typical deep penetration weld seams show 
a comparably large, melted volume and the typical deeper than wide cross-sectional 
shapes. Due to significantly higher energy input, the weld seam cross sections are 
typically also wider than those in conduction mode. Figure 3.20 shows the schematic 
sketch of a laser deep penetration process and a typical weld seam cross section, with 
a pore in the center of the weld seam.
The intensity threshold to reach deep penetration welding modes mainly depends 
on the properties of a material and wavelength of laser. When using CO2-lasers at 
10.6 µm wavelength, the threshold is in the range of 1–2 × 106 W/cm2. At wave-
lengths around 1 µm, the threshold can already appear in the range of 104 W/cm2. On 
the material’s side, a high heat conductivity of the material leads, in general, to less 
available energy for the process due to energy losses into the bulk material, which 
leads to a higher required threshold to reach deep penetration. Aluminum or copper, 
with their comparably high heat conductivity, show this effect. Also, the absolute 
value of the boiling temperature and the difference between melting and boiling 
temperatures as well as latent heats of fusion and vaporization can influence the total 
absorption and thereby the intensity threshold. In general, a higher absorption of the 
material at the used wavelength increases the energy input and therefore can lower 
the intensity threshold. For welding, the relative movement of the specimen and the 
laser beam affects the energy input in addition. A low line energy (low laser power or 
fast welding speed) leads to a decreased energy input and even at high beam intensi-
ties, the deep penetration threshold might not be reached.
FIGURE 3.20  Principle sketch of the laser deep penetration welding (left) and a cross-
sectional view of a typical weld seam.

73
Laser Material Processes
The most significant thermal properties of materials impacting the total absorp­
tion are:
•	 Absorption coefficient,
•	 Thermal conductivity (W/(m·K)),
•	 Heat of fusion (J/g),
•	 Specific heat capacity (J/(kg·K)),
•	 Heat of vaporization (J/g), and
•	 Heat of phase transformation (J/g).
3.7.2.2  Parameter Impact
The laser welding process can be modified by several process parameters to adjust 
the energy input and design the weld seam shapes. Figure 3.21 shows typical ten­
dencies when welding at different processing parameters with increasing molten 
volume at lower processing speeds, higher laser power, and a focal position slightly 
below the material’s surface [Web10]. A higher reflection (lower absorption) is 
expected at higher processing speeds due to an increased illumination of flat, cold 
material.
In practice, it is advised not to weld in the transition zone around the deep pen­
etration threshold to avoid instabilities due to varying welding modes. Already slight 
absorption variations can lead to the shift from heat conduction to deep penetration 
mode within one weld seam.
Although the word “deep” is in the mode description, the main characteristic for 
distinguishing the welding modes is the reaching of vaporization. Therefore, the 
deep penetration mode can be achieved in foils of ~20 µm thickness as well as in 
sheets of >30 mm thickness. Micro-welding applications can result in small weld 
seam depths but can still be produced in the keyhole mode.
Since energy input is increased in the deep penetration mode due to multiple 
reflections and absorption, the process is more energy-efficient compared to heat 
conduction processes, where most of the laser beam energy is reflected. In addition, 
the process enables welding of materials that are considered difficult to be welded 
and material combinations of multi- or even dissimilar materials.

varying process parameters from the reference (ref) parameters.

74
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
3.7.2.3  Keyhole Energy and Pressure Balances
Inside a stable keyhole, the energy input from the laser beam by multiple reflec­
tions and the related multiple absorption inside the vapor channel is balanced by 
energy losses. Energy losses mainly contain heat conduction into the bulk material 
and emission of vapor (e.g., [Vol16a]). Typically, melt pool convection and thermal 
radiation play a minor role in deep penetration welding.
The pressure balance consists of the two main components of the laser-induced 
recoil pressure due to vaporization counteracting the surface tension pressure of the 
surrounding melt that tries to close the keyhole. The permanent illumination of the 
keyhole walls induces vaporization and the increased pressure inside the keyhole 
that keeps it open. The created vapor recoil pressure and the increased pressure push 
the keyhole walls open acting against the surface tension pressure (Figure 3.22).
Two mathematically possible stable conditions can be found (S1 and S2, Figure 3.22), 
while only S2 is physically stable, which is the local keyhole radius appearing when 
no other disturbances appear. It was shown, however, that keyholes are intrinsically 
dynamic changing depths and widths at high frequencies, even in cw laser mode, e.g., 
in high-speed X-ray measurements (e.g., [Hei13, Kat02]).
3.7.2.4  Beam Shaping Opportunities
Although the deep penetration welding mode offers the advantage of creating deep 
and narrow weld seams, the process can become unstable. The process stability can­
not be guaranteed yet for all processing conditions [Bro08]. The interaction of solid, 
liquid, and vapor phases can induce dynamic behavior. The keyhole can collapse and 
entrap surrounding gas, which can form pores, melt pool ejections (e.g., [Vol18a]), 
or cracks.
Therefore, beam shaping approaches are largely used in order to stabilize the 
process. Multi-beam arrangements showed indications to stabilize the keyhole (e.g., 
[Vol19a]). Also, dynamic beam shaping offers advantages when welding, e.g., alu­
minum (e.g., [Pri20]). The stabilization of keyholes can be achieved by creating a 
wider keyhole opening. This helps the vapor to escape without ejecting melt mate­
rial. Ring beams can achieve the energy input to create a wider keyhole opening 
(e.g. [Wan22]).
FIGURE 3.22  Pressure balance inside the keyhole [Vol16a].

75
Laser Material Processes
A typical challenge for laser welding processes is the appearance of a gap between 
the joining partners. Due to comparably small dimensions of the laser beam, a gap 
can lead to a partial or even complete laser beam transmission through the gap with­
out energy transfer to the material. In order to still use the advantage of a local 
high-intensity energy input and avoid thermal effects like extensive distortion, beam 
shaping can be used to guide the energy to the locations where needed. For enabling 
gap bridging, the energy input is required to be transferred to the joining partners. 
Therefore, the distribution of laser beam energy to two or even more single spots can 
be advantageous [Vol23b]. The initiated melt pool flows can even support the closing 
of the gap with the available melt. In addition, rapid beam movements induced by 
deformable mirrors can support the bridging of the gap [Gug23].
3.7.2.5  Energy Absorption in the Keyhole
The keyhole geometry is a result of the energy and impulse balance. The photonic 
energy from the laser beam is absorbed multiple times due to multiple reflections on 
the keyhole walls, which denotes the energy input. The main energy losses from the 
keyhole walls are the heat conduction into the melt pool and then into surrounding 
bulk material and the convection in the melt pool with a typical minor loss due to 
thermal radiation. In many cases, mainly the front of the keyhole wall is directly illu­
minated by the laser beam, which can result in downward movement of melt on the 
front wall by the induced recoil pressure. The rear wall is pushed backward by the 
extensive vapor produced on the keyhole walls and the related increased gas pressure 
inside the keyhole. In addition, recoil pressure is induced due to multiple reflections 
of laser light to the rear, side, and front keyhole walls. However, the keyhole can be 
unstable and can even collapse during continuous illumination. There are several 
possible reasons for these instabilities:
1.	The keyhole front is inclined due to the energy distribution in depth. 
Therefore, the energy input into the lower keyhole sections is low. In addi­
tion, the process velocity defines the keyhole inclination, while a higher 
process velocity leads in general to higher inclination angles. The angled 
keyhole front and the induced wavy keyhole front surface can lead to vary­
ing absorption and in particular reflection angles. Reflected beams can 
strike the rear wall at different positions over time, which can induce key­
hole rear wall fluctuations. A second effect is the angle-dependence of the 
Fresnel absorption, which denotes that at different keyhole wall angles, 
absorption can vary and thereby the local ablation pressure.
2.	Vapor and plasma absorption effects can occur that can temporarily absorb 
parts of the laser light before being used for absorption in the keyhole and 
thereby induce depth and radial keyhole fluctuations.
3.	Even at continuous energy input, the keyhole shows intrinsic fluctuations. 
Natural spiking has been observed [Bol13], denoting high-frequency depth 
variations, which, however, not necessarily result in bad weld quality.
4.	Melt pool induced melt pool waves can transport melt toward the keyhole, 
which can induce and support temporary closing of the keyhole. This phe­
nomenon was mainly observed to close the keyhole’s top section partly or 

76
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
completely and in the middle sections of the keyhole [Fab10], disconnect­
ing the lower keyhole part from laser irradiation. Those collapses are often 
harder to identify with visualization methods and can entrap gas, which can 
form pores.
5.	In an industrial environment, impacts of vaporizing dirt or inclusions can 
also lead to process discontinuities and quality reduction.
6.	Material-specific characteristics can lead to energy absorption variations 
such as created oxide layers that show different absorptivity than the base 
material. This effect is pronounced when processing, e.g., aluminum alloys, 
where the high-melting oxide layer can change the surface of the melt pool 
geometry and melt pool flows as well as the related melt pool waves, laser 
beam energy absorption, and even hinder gas bubble escape from the melt 
pool.
3.7.2.6  Plasma Absorption
Besides the absorption of laser energy by the materials of the joining partners, 
plasma can be formed during laser welding at high intensities (cw at ~109 W/cm2) 
in free space, which denotes the upper limit of manufacturing with lasers. In dirty 
environments, the intensity threshold can be even lower.
On the one hand, the absorbed energy in the plasma is not transferred to the pro­
cess zone directly, which hinders the establishment of the keyhole and the desired 
deep penetration process. On the other hand, the energy in the plasma can be further 
radially transported to the keyhole walls when the plasma burns inside the keyhole 
and increases the energy input that way to widen the keyhole.
Plasma develops due to the “inverse Bremsstrahlung”, which occurs when a pho­
ton is absorbed by an electron during collision with a nucleus and thereby directly 
accelerates ions. This kind of absorption can be very efficient. Hot gas (surrounding 
gas or produced vapor during the process) is ionized by the photonic energy and 
forms plasma when the material-dependent threshold ionization energy is overcome. 
In general, plasma formation is more likely at high ambient pressure, higher laser 
wavelength, and lower ionization potential of the gas/vapor. The presence of free 
electrons makes the plasma conductive, but neutral to the outside. Plasmas show very 
high temperatures and can change the refractive index, which can result in different 
path lengths of the laser beam rays in plasma. As a result, increased beam spot sizes, 
a related lower intensity, and defocusing occur. This can impact the laser processes. 
Often the transferred laser energy is reduced or fluctuates.
Plasma absorption is (in a simplified estimation) proportional to the (laser wave­
length)2, which means that the ~10 times higher wavelength of a CO2 laser (10.6 µm) 
compared to a typical solid-state laser (~1 µm), plasma absorption is ~100 times 
more efficient [Zel66]. In turn, this also means that plasma formation is less likely 
when using 1 µm lasers, reducing the plasma shielding effects, and shielding gas 
selection becomes less significant in this respect.
3.7.2.7  Vapor Outflow
While initiating vaporization of a surface by a laser beam or also during pulsed 
processes, a shock wave is created, which initiates a rapid build-up of a high vapor 

77
Laser Material Processes
pressure on the surface. When the vapor expands from this zone, the surrounding gas 
is pushed away, and a recoil pressure is created that indents the melt pool. This leads 
to a geometrical deformation and the creation of the keyhole when the intensity of 
the laser beam is high enough. A special non-equilibrium state on the surface is cre­
ated, since more particles leave the surface than condensate. This thermo-dynamical 
imbalance in the near-surface region is called the Knudsen layer, where both pres­
sure and temperature jumps occur (e.g., [Fin90]).
The vapor of high pressure created inside the keyhole by laser ablation needs to 
escape the keyhole. If the keyhole is only open toward the laser impact direction, 
the process is called partial penetration and the exiting vapor fully expands into 
the upward direction toward the laser beam. At full penetration, the keyhole has an 
additional opening on the lower part of the sheet, which enables the vapor to escape 
in two directions. Typically, full penetration processes are intrinsically more stable.
When the vapor is created on the keyhole walls, it exerts the recoil pressure on 
the wall and exits perpendicularly from the local wall surface. Depending on the 
inclination of the keyhole wall, the vapor can be pushed out of a keyhole opening 
or impact other parts of the keyhole and deform those elements. However, when the 
vapor tries to exit the keyhole, there are shear forces created on the keyhole walls 
when the vapor passes. These can counteract the typical downward movement of 
the melt pool waves on the keyhole front and lead to complex surface forces on the 
vaporizing melt.
The exiting vapor can reach speeds of 100–200 m/s, which is why in practice, a 
cross jet (gas jet horizontally applied) is used below the optics to protect them from 
contamination. The mass loss has been shown to be minor compared to the typical 
melt pool volumes ([Bec96, Dul99]). At smaller keyholes, the probability that the 
vapor produced at the keyhole front condensates on the rear keyhole wall is higher 
and reduces the mass losses in general. The ejected particles have been shown to 
be in nanometer dimensions (aluminum: 200 nm; steel: 70 nm, [Vol18a]), which 
condensate and slow down after exiting the keyhole opening(s). The small particles 
can lead to laser beam scattering and absorption effects [Hul57]. If the particle size 
is much smaller than the wavelength, Rayleigh scattering occurs, which means that 
small particles are forced to oscillate with the frequency of the incident light and 
emit radiation, which is visible as scattering. If the size of particles is in the range 
of the wavelength or larger, Mie theory can be applied to describe the scattering. 
In contrast to intuition, larger particles allow, in general, more energy propagation 
in laser axis direction. For particles much larger than the wavelength, geometrical 
optics calculations can be applied. Additional effects can occur when dirt or water 
vaporize that are not fully removed before processing. Similar effects are seen when 
coatings or claddings are present on materials.
3.7.2.8  Melt Flow
In the melt pool, similar to the energy balance, the mass balance must be fulfilled, 
which is relevant when describing the melt pool behavior during laser deep pen­
etration process. In addition to the temperature-dependent, surface-tension-driven 
Marangoni flow, in the deep penetration welding mode, additional melt flows are 
induced due to the formation of the keyhole. The keyhole is a vapor channel and is 

78
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
therefore an obstacle for the melt flow (Figure 3.21). On the keyhole front side, the 
melt pool is typically comparably thin due to the high processing speed and is pushed 
downward by the recoil pressure. The keyhole front has been seen to show a wavy 
structure [Kap13]. It has been shown that the keyhole front waves move downward 
by the increased local absorption on the waves, which induces a locally high recoil 
pressure. This additional effect increases the velocity of the melt and can induce 
additional flow patterns. This effect is complex to mathematically describe and is 
counteracting the impact of shear forces due to the exiting vapor, which mainly 
pushes the melt upward.
In addition, the melt created at the front of the keyhole must move around the 
keyhole when the laser beam progresses. Since the keyhole contains no melt, it is an 
obstacle for the melt movement. Due to the long travel distance around the keyhole 
instead of taking a straight path, the melt is accelerated (Figure 3.23). The reached 
velocities can be much higher than melt pool velocities observed in heat conduction 
processes. The melt moves in the typically thin melt film around the keyhole. In the 
larger melt pool behind the keyhole, the melt can decelerate and induce complex 
melt pool movements as well. Due to the large differences between the melt pool 
velocities from the keyhole region and the region behind the keyhole, complex eddies 
are typically formed. Local high melt pool velocities or accelerations can lead to 
melt pool instabilities. These can be caused by surface waves that combine to larger 
waves or impulses inside the melt pool pushing melt material in different directions. 
These instabilities can induce melt movement on the surface that can overcome the 
surface tension and create melt pool ejections.
In order to influence the melt pool appearance, several strategies can be applied. 
In general, more space for the melt pool to move can stabilize the process. A higher 
material heat conductivity or a slower processing speed can increase its sizes and 
stabilize the processes. Also beam shaping approaches can support the widening of 
the melt pool in two possible ways. On the one hand, the melt pool can be directly 
illuminated by additional heat sources to increase its width, e.g., using a second 
defocused laser beam. On the other hand, the energy input into the keyhole can be 
varied, e.g., by increasing the local intensity on the keyhole side walls to widen the 
energy input locations. It is also possible to actively influence the melt pool move­
ment, e.g., by applying volume or surface forces by using gravity or electro-magnetic 
FIGURE 3.23  Qualitative sketches of melt pool dimensions and melt flow directions, and 
velocities at low (left) and high (right) processing speed.

79
Laser Material Processes
stabilization [Lin01]. Lorentz forces can also be active, e.g., during arc or hybrid 
processes. Gravity forces can influence the melt dimensions and flows, in particular, 
at larger melt pools.
The melt pool must, however, be seen as a system. When altering the melt pool 
dimensions, the mass and energy transport are changed as well [Miy03]. Depending 
on the created melt pool flows, the melt pool mixing is changed. This can possibly 
lead to inhomogeneous element distribution in the weld seam, when mixing is not 
sufficiently induced. In addition, the melt pool movement and related conductive 
energy transport define the local cooling rates and thermal gradients. They, in turn, 
define the formation of cracks and also the development of microstructures. In addi­
tion, the induced temperature distributions in and on the melt pool will induce dif­
ferent melt flows and also different shear forces from vapor and gas flows. Material 
properties such as surface tension counteracting the spatter ejection formation, are 
defined by the melt pool temperature and therefore can impact the melt pool dynam­
ics as well.
Melt flows on the melt pool surface can be observed by visual monitoring (e.g., 
high-speed-cameras). Many flow features can be observed by visual monitoring such 
as the Marangoni flow patterns, oxide movements, or spatter ejections. This informa­
tion can often help to validate numerical models already.
However, the melt flows inside the melt pool cannot be directly observed by con­
ventional visual methods. There is a possibility of using X-ray observation tech­
niques to learn about the melt movement inside a melt pool. By placing high-melting 
particles (e.g., tungsten) as tracer particles in material, their travel paths and speeds 
can be observed. While 2D observations give indications of the melt pool movement 
[Rei21], 3D systems are used to get a full picture of the geometrical movement of the 
melt pool flows. Another possible observation technique is the welding behind high 
melting glass. Although the properties of glass will not fully represent regular weld­
ing process conditions regarding heat conductivity or absorption, melt flow patterns 
can be observed (e.g., [Hua18]).
Element losses due to vaporization can be an additional factor to locally change 
material properties (e.g., surface tension or viscosity), which can alter the melt flow. 
In addition to the recoil pressure induced by the laser beam, the exiting vapor can 
induce friction forces on the keyhole walls, which can induce melt pool momentum.
3.7.2.9  Gas Flows
Most laser processes are conducted with a surrounding gas atmosphere at ambient 
pressure and temperature. Vacuum is seldom used due to the additional effort to 
clamp parts in the pressure chamber and evacuate the chamber before processing. 
However, it has been shown that some advantages can be observed when welding 
with reduced ambient pressure. Since a reduced amount of gas is available, porosity 
from incorporated gas is reduced (e.g., [Jia19]). In addition, the vapor plume has been 
seen to exit more straight and less dynamic from the keyhole opening, leading to a 
calmer process (e.g., [Ols16]).
However, one advantage of laser beam processing compared to, e.g., electron 
beam processing is that vacuum is not necessary to achieve processing, which makes 
part handling and processing, in general, much easier. However, it means that the 

80
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
gas around the processing zone is an influencing factor on the process results. Both 
the kind of gas and the gas flows must be considered an interacting medium during 
welding. Due to comparably low energy transfer between the melt pool and the sur­
rounding gas, typically the energy loss by gas convection can be neglected. However, 
a directed gas flow can decrease the surface temperature of the melt pool. This effect 
can be desired to induce, e.g., rapid cooling or an additional heat transport to enable 
higher energy inputs. In addition, the local variation in surface temperatures can 
influence the surface tension and lead to additional Marangoni flow effects. The melt 
flow can in turn affect the melt pool geometry development.
Often, shielding gases are applied through gas nozzles to cover the process area. 
The nozzle outlets are either round- or oval-shaped, with a variety of variations to 
optimize the gas flow tailored to the process zone size and the purpose of the gas 
application. Typically, the gas flow rates operate at moderate flow rates. Too low flow 
rates can lead to insufficient coverage of the process zone, while too high flow rates 
can induce turbulent flows and eddies that can lead to a gas mixing with the ambient 
atmosphere and therefore to unwanted gases in the processing zone. In addition, high 
gas flow rates can impact the shape of the molten surfaces. The inertia can indent the 
melt pool and change its shape and flow fields, which is typically not desired.
Typical welding gases used are argon, nitrogen, or helium. The purpose of gas 
application is mainly the separation of oxygen in the ambient air from the melt pool 
to avoid surface oxidation. Therefore, low reactive and inert gases are often used. 
However, some gases alter the chemical composition in some materials, e.g., steels 
form nitrides when using nitrogen as shielding gas. Such in-situ alloying effects are 
typically not desired and other alternative gases are used. However, it is possible to 
tailor the chemical composition that way and alter the material during processing. 
Then, the gas even defines the metallurgy and, in the end, the mechanical properties 
of the welded zone. This approach is not widely used due to the complex and partly 
unpredictable amount and location of the reactions. In addition, the mixing of the 
new phases in the melt pool is difficult to control and can form undesired microstruc­
tural features or brittle phases.
The kind of gas used is of particular importance when ionization and plasma for­
mation are possible. The ionization possibility of the gas between the laser optic and 
the processing zone defines (1) if ionization or plasma formation occurs and (2) at 
which laser energy levels the laser energy absorption is high enough to initiate the 
ionization of the gas.
In addition, there is a metal vapor outflow from the keyhole that mixes with the 
shielding and surrounding gas. On the one hand, the additional vapor flow can induce 
complex gas flows when interacting with the shielding gas flow and lead to turbulent 
flows. On the other hand, metal vapor can also form plasma. This can either even 
occur inside the keyhole, where the vapor pressure is high and many metal particles 
are present or above the processing zone. Plasma formation is most relevant to con­
sider when using large wavelengths, e.g., 10.6 µm produced by CO2 lasers. Plasma 
can lead to scattering of the laser beam, which can decrease the transferred laser 
beam energy to the processing zone and increase the beam diameter on the material, 
denoting a reduction in the local intensity. Plasma energy absorption can lead to par­
tial or even full transfer of the laser energy by plasma, reducing the energy coupling 

81
Laser Material Processes
into the material. The decreased power and intensity can interrupt the process or 
change welding modes from keyhole to heat conduction welding.
An additional gas flow that is typically applied is the cross jet. The cross jet 
is installed below the laser optics to protect them from vapor and spatters moving 
toward the optics. The cross jet is a high-pressure gas flow perpendicular to the laser 
beam axis. This high-velocity gas flow can also impact the gas flow field around 
the processing zone and might interrupt the low-pressure shielding gas flow. This 
effect is more pronounced when the focal distance of the focusing lens is short, and 
the laser optics must be positioned close to the processing zone. When testing new 
processes or running highly dynamic processes, it is often necessary to install addi­
tional cross jets.
3.7.2.10  Solidification
The solidification process in welding is, in general, similar to the ones during cast­
ing processes, but some additional effects can occur. In welding, the cooling of the 
process zone happens due to the self-quenching effect since the heat source moves 
further from the previous heat input position and heat is further conducted into the 
base material. In many thermal welding processes, the cooling rates can be moder­
ate leading to moderate thermal gradients and solidification comparable to casting 
effects. However, in laser welding, high thermal gradients from either the overheated 
melt pool or the keyhole process having temperatures at or even slightly above the 
metal boiling temperature to the melting line are present.
Due to the relative movement of the laser beam and the work piece, the melt pool 
is typically elongated toward its rear part. This also means that the solidification 
front on the rear and side sections of the melt pool can be different. The typical 
fast cooling during laser treatments leads to, in general, a comparably increased 
grain growth speed since there are many crystallizing centers on the melt line. 
Grain growth is often seen to be dendritic but cellular growth can also be possible. 
The direction of crystal growth is usually parallel to the heat flow (Figure 3.24). 
The diffusion speed and the nucleating agents are therefore inhomogeneous, and 
FIGURE 3.24  General trends of grain growth directions during laser welding at different 
processing speeds.

82
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
crystallization starts at certain grains or contaminations, which increase the risk of 
cracking. In order to achieve fine grains, grain refining elements can be added to the 
alloy.
3.7.2.11  Weld Monitoring
Monitoring of measuring equipment and the laser process during welding is an 
important part of the processing to guarantee continuous reliable process conditions 
and weld quality. Laser power is typically observed by the laser machine itself and 
time-resolved protocols can be extracted for documentation or the search for origins 
of failures. External power measuring systems can be used to identify how much 
power is actually transferred to the processing zone. This is, in particular, important 
to identify potential power losses in the optical system from the laser machine to the 
processing zone. Such power measurements can be done during production cycles 
to check for power variations. This is recommended to perform on a regular basis to 
ensure that, e.g., contaminations like spatters on the protection window are identified 
and do not lead to equipment damage or part failures.
Apart from power measurements, it is recommended to perform caustic measure­
ments to ensure that the laser beam shows the expected profile. In particular, the 
focus position must be correctly positioned for welding processes. Caustic character­
istics are possible to change when the optical system is contaminated, or optics are 
misaligned. In addition, beam measurements can be used to verify the correct spatial 
intensity distribution in the working plane.
For detecting the gap between the joining partners, it is possible to mount laser 
triangulation sensors to the laser optics that identify the gap position and give feed­
back to the positioning machine/robot to adjust the laser movement to ensure the 
correct laser position for welding. Laser triangulation sensors measure the surface 
topology along a line, which offers the possibility to use it for even post-measure­
ments. For that, the triangulation sensor is mounted to measure the geometric shape 
of the produced track. This information can give indicators about the success of the 
welding process. Even open pores, spatters, or misalignment can be identified.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is increasingly used for weld process moni­
toring. When scanning the measuring beam across a surface, gaps between the join­
ing partners can also be identified and the laser beam positioning is guaranteed. Like 
triangulation sensors, cracks, pores, or undercuts can also be identified when used 
as post-process sensor. OCT offers the additional possibility to be used as in-process 
sensor. The distance measurement has been shown to be feasible inside the key­
hole [Web14]. That way, a direct possibility to measure the welding depth is given. 
Although there is a melt pool of small thickness below the keyhole, the measure­
ments of keyhole depths are close to the actual welding depth. The high recording 
frequency of the OCT systems enables the detection of the keyhole depth fluctua­
tions as an indicator of process dynamics and possible pore creation. In addition, 
drop-outs as well as holes in the weld seam can be identified.
Visual cameras are an important, comparably cheap, and robust way of the laser 
welding process monitoring. Cameras can be mounted externally or even coaxially 
on the laser optics. Coaxial camera mounts are often provided by laser optic produc­
ers. These cameras use the optical path of the laser beam to record the processing 

83
Laser Material Processes
zone. Visual cameras are typically used to observe melt pool dimensions and dynam­
ics. Changes of melt pool width or length indicate process inaccuracies or defect 
creations. Automated analysis tools can help to identify the melt pool shape in the 
recorded frames and inform the operator at significant deviations. Depending on the 
amount of data and data transfer speeds, the frame analysis can either be done after 
or even during the process. The evaluation during the process gives the opportunity 
to install closed-loop control systems that automatically change process parameters 
to counteract a recorded tendency. More expensive recording equipment are high-
speed cameras. These offer the possibility to identify many processing details and 
are therefore mostly used in science and research.
Photodiodes are used when the brightness in a certain spectral range indicates 
process conditions, e.g., photodiodes recording in the IR range can indicate changes 
in the surface temperature. Often diodes are used to identify the exact laser on/off 
times or to trigger other equipment accordingly.
Thermal monitoring is a widely used technique for identifying process variations 
and even defects. Although it seems intuitive that thermal processes are monitored 
with thermal measurement systems, the derivation of reliable quantitative values is 
difficult. The main challenge is the variation in emissivity of the material both with 
temperature and at phase changes. This would require the adaption of emissivity in 
temperature recordings to the correct state and temperature of the material at every 
point. However, one-color thermal imaging is used, e.g., to measure solidification 
characteristics such as the so-called t8/5 time. In addition, thermal images can give 
indications about the weld seam dimensions as well. Two-color thermographic imag­
ing gives the possibility to get emissivity-compensated temperature data as well but 
requires additional calculations. Thermal imaging is feasible to use to identify pro­
cess changes. Even when the exact temperatures are not correctly given, temperature 
changes can be often visualized well. At local overheating, connection problems can 
be the reason, e.g., false friends or crack occurrence. In both cases, heat conduction 
into the material is interrupted, leading to a visible increase in surface temperature; 
even larger pores can be found. Also, fluctuations of the laser power can be poten­
tially seen and identified before process interruptions occur.
X-ray monitoring techniques offer a wide range of observation possibilities dur­
ing laser processes. During welding, X-ray radiographic monitoring is used to iden­
tify keyhole dimensions and melt pool movements. Synchrotron facilities offer the 
possibility to install scintillators that translate X-ray images into visible images (e.g., 
[Kau23]). These can be recorded with high-speed cameras, which give new insights 
into the process behavior. Tracer particles of high-melting materials can be used to 
track the melt pool flows. In addition, diffractometry measurements are used to iden­
tify phase change kinetics in the material during welding (e.g., [Oli16]).
Recent monitoring of the keyhole process using X-ray imaging of laser polishing 
has revealed some new features of the keyhole behavior [Fau23]. An experiment was 
designed in which the laser beam polishes a metal surface. However, the surface 
showed an applied surface structure that the laser beam had to pass. A relatively sta­
ble keyhole was created, and the laser beam approached the surface feature, denoting 
an obstacle. After the surface feature, the keyhole changed shape. It became deeper 
and thinner without changing the process or material parameters. It is typically 

84
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
assumed that one set of process parameters leads to one particular shape of keyhole. 
However, the history of the keyhole seems to play an important role as well. It was 
hypothesized that while the laser beam was illuminating the surface feature, the 
keyhole dimensions changed and thereby the internal multiple reflections altered 
as well. Based on this initial shape, which differs from the regular keyhole creation 
process from a flat surface, the keyhole shape develops in a different way leading to a 
different keyhole shape. Such knowledge can be used to tailor the process to achieve 
the desired polishing or welding outcomes.
3.7.2.12  Comparison with Other Welding Processes
Laser beam welding can be used as a complementary welding method to other weld-
ing processes. In general, autogenous laser beam welding is used for automated pro-
cesses, where fast processing, high precision, and little heat input are advantageous. 
Metal inert gas (MIG) welding, metal active gas (MAG) welding, and tungsten inert 
gas (TIG) welding are beneficial due to the requirement of little and cheap equipment 
and reduced effort for protection equipment and personal safety measures. In addi-
tion, comparably high heat input into the processing zone easily bridges the gap due 
to, in general, wider melt pools (Figure 3.25).
Electron beam welding can reach similar dimensions of the keyhole and melt 
pool sizes compared to the laser beam welding processes. Weld seams produced by 
electron beam welding show, in general, less porosity and can be more dynamically 
stable compared to laser weld seams. However, the process requires vacuum, which 
needs additional effort in part handling due to increased lead times during creation of 
vacuum in the mandatory chamber. In addition, the dimensions of vacuum chambers 
can restrict the sizes of parts and components possible to join. Attempts are ongoing 
to generate a local vacuum to enable the processing of large structures as well.
General advantages and disadvantages of laser welding are summarized in 
Figure 3.26. The investment in a laser machine can be higher compared to that in 
equipment for other welding methods. However, in the long run, the investment 
in lasers can show benefits due to their fast processing possibilities, which reduces 
FIGURE 3.25  Comparison of bridgeable gap sizes and typical welding velocities between 
several welding methods.

85
Laser Material Processes
lead times and costs for processing. In addition, the costs for maintenance are com­
parably low since the laser machines usually have long lifetime. Since the laser beam 
is a remote tool, there are no direct tool wear issues. However, gas consumption and 
the regular need to change protection glasses add some maintenance costs and work.
For laser beam welding, joint preparation is often necessary. Due to the small 
dimensions of laser beam, the gap must be typically small and constant during weld­
ing to avoid interruptions or failures. Therefore, an effort into a proper clamping 
system is needed to keep the material in place. However, the effort can be justified 
when welding similar parts and components multiple times.
The low heat input is advantageous for avoiding extensive distortion. Laser 
machine producers continuously improve the energy efficiency of their laser 
machines to enable a need of minimum energy for processing. In principle, all mate­
rials that absorb the laser light of the used laser wavelength can be processed. High-
reflective materials absorb less energy of the laser beam and show challenges for 
processing and low energy efficiency.
The laser shows advantages in the achievable welding speed and possibility to 
form a keyhole leading to the deep weld seams. The low heat input minimizes the 
creation of the HAZ and the risk of deformations.
3.7.3  Weldability
Weldability defines how easy or feasible the welding process is in different circum­
stances and conditions. The main three aspects that influence the weldability are the 
material properties, the construction/design, and the welding method (Figure 3.27).
FIGURE 3.26  Laser welding evaluation.
FIGURE 3.27  Impacts on weldability.

86
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
The welding method defines weldability due to energy source, process speed, and 
the related energy input properties. The method also includes the necessity that the 
welded material is conductive for some welding methods such as in MIG welding. 
The welding setup as part of the welding method such as shielding gas application, 
the kind of gas, and the possibly applied additional feedstock material (typically 
wire) influences the weldability as well. Welding of a certain material might be pos­
sible when using one type of gas but not when using another one.
Welding with wire leads to different laser energy input mechanisms. Due to added 
material, the surfaces appear in a different shape, typically higher melt pools at more 
spherical shape are found. On the one hand, this will change the energy input due 
to the changed incident laser ray angles on the surface. On the other hand, melt pool 
dimensions will change or higher laser energy input is needed to achieve the same 
weld seam dimensions.
In addition, the clamping has a significant impact on the welding results. Clamping 
defines the positioning accuracy and gap sizes. In addition, the small, but existing 
deformation, needs to be compensated by the clamping setup. Clamping induces 
stresses before welding to maintain the joining partners in place. During welding, 
stresses can increase due to thermal impact. In the worst case, after removing the 
component from the clamping device, the residual stresses can lead to deformations 
of the component or even to cracking. The clamping procedure can therefore exclude 
welding methods usable for a certain task.
Material properties define the weldability. The material defines if laser energy 
can be transferred into it. The laser energy input must be possible when, e.g., the 
absorption of the material must be high enough to initiate laser melting. In addi­
tion, heat conductivity, defining the heat transported away from the processing zone, 
defines the creation of the melt pool dimensions and the HAZ. If too little energy 
is absorbed or the heat is removed too quickly, welding might not be possible. The 
chemical composition of the welding material can influence the weldability in many 
ways. The welding material can be the base material (if the same material is used for 
both joining partners), the mixing of the base materials (if multi-material joints are 
made), or the mixing of the base materials with the filler material (e.g., when welding 
with wire addition). It is possible that elements lead to chemical reactions within the 
melt pool and create new phases and/or are an additional heat source (at exothermic 
reaction) or heat sink (at endothermic reactions). In addition, the elements on the 
liquid surface can react with the ambient gas or integrate as alloying elements or 
reaction products into the melt pool. This effect can be desired to create certain 
carbides or nitrides but is usually not wanted. Element vaporization can occur, while 
elements with low boiling temperatures evaporate first. Those element losses lead 
to changes in the chemical composition of the melt pool. In addition, local element 
variations can occur that can lead to diffusion processes and additional melt flows. 
This can lead to the related induced melt pool dynamics or even induce spatter ejec­
tions. The additionally created recoil pressure of the evaporating elements can also 
induce indentations on the melt pool, with the consequences of a deformed surface 
with respect to absorption and restrictions or initiation of melt pool flows.
The construction and design of components or parts define the accessibility of 
tools used for different welding methods. When using methods that require the 

87
Laser Material Processes
access of welding zone with a welding torch (e.g., MIG, MAG, TIG) and a wire, it 
must be possible for the torch to be in a position close to the processing zone includ­
ing the enabling of the mandatory movement during welding. A laser beam with 
a good beam quality used at a long focal distance can show advantages related to 
accessibility. Together with the possibility to automize the process, the accessibility 
can define how well the construction is suitable for the welding method and how 
efficiently the path planning can be done.
Additionally, errors can reduce weldability. Three error types can be distin­
guished. Constant errors do not depend on the number of manufactured pieces but 
are caused by, e.g., wrong use of tools or clamping. In contrast, systematic errors are 
known errors, e.g., due to wear of tools and are predictable since they can be cal­
culated from one piece to the other. Random errors (e.g., between different batches, 
temperature variations, impacts of dirt) are difficult to avoid or predict.
Furthermore, following expressions are defined:
•	 Welding suitability: “Is the material suitable to be used in combination with 
the intended welding method for this particular part design?” On the mate­
rial’s side, the general tendencies are that more alloying elements lead to 
worse welding results. Typically, intermetallic phases that can occur lead 
to brittle phases in the weld seam when using, e.g., steel. Many alloying 
elements also lead to an increased melt interval, e.g., in aluminum alloys 
and increase thereby the risk of hot cracking. Alloying elements can form 
inclusions and lead to more available gases and particles in the vapor, which 
can lead to more spattering and increased pore formation. In addition, hard­
ening effects are typically more pronounced at higher carbon content in 
steels, which can reduce the strength of the welded zone, when carbides are 
formed. As a rough rule of thumb, welding steel with carbon content below 
0.22% is suitable (see also Schaeffler Diagram for the impact of alloying 
elements on weldability).
•	 Welding possibility: “Is it possible to weld the part with the chosen method?” 
In case the process works for the chosen material or material combination, 
welding possibility must be given. The accessibility of the joining region 
must be guaranteed by joint design and the correct clamping or pre-joining. 
The joining zone should be cleaned from, e.g., oil, water, and oxides and if 
needed pre-heated in an oven or with the help of another heat source such 
as a burner, a plasma source, or another laser beam. Further equipment 
might be needed to track and control the weld position to enable welding. 
It must also be checked if the necessary post-processing is possible, e.g., 
if the parts are suitable for being heat treated in a furnace with respect to 
the required temperatures and geometrical fit of the component in the fur­
nace. In addition, spatter removal must be considered in the post-processing 
and accessibility to the relevant surfaces with the removal tools need to be 
guaranteed. Similarly, distortion correction must be possible as well as the 
release of residual stresses.
•	 Weld safety: “Will the weld quality be achievable with the chosen setup?” 
The requirements of the welded zones and the HAZ must be fulfilled in 

88
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
relation to the maximum allowed imperfections and material properties 
such as strength, hardness, or fatigue life properties. This can require pro­
cess control, destructive or non-destructive testing, fatigue testing, and 
material simulations.
3.7.3.1  Weld Seam Quality
The quality of a weld seam is typically evaluated after the welding process. There 
are a variety of methods for evaluating several aspects of weld quality, while only 
a few most common methods are mentioned here. Depending on the application, a 
certain number of parts are taken from one batch to perform quality checks. Parts 
from the same batch are assumed to show comparable quality features. In critical 
applications, it is possible that all parts need to be tested.
In general, there are destructive and non-destructive evaluation methods. 
Destructive testing is necessary to derive certain parameters, whereas non-
destructive testing is of course preferred in order not to waste the tested parts. Parts 
tested with destructive testing methods will not be usable even if they pass the test. 
Destructive testing is often costly and time-consuming. However, it can be useful for 
design purposes.
Destructive testing includes tensile and three-point bending tests that induce the 
part to fail while the load is recorded at which the failure occurs. These values can 
give indications about the strength of the part and weld seam. The Charpy impact 
tests are often used in order to measure the impact toughness of weld seams. The 
crack initiation and development can be recorded, while the cracked surface gives 
indications about the crack propagation mechanism. Furthermore, peel, pressure, 
and fracture tests are used. On a large scale, whole components are tested in crash 
tests. For some applications, it is necessary to evaluate the long-time stability. This 
is done in fatigue tests, where cyclic loads can be applied.
Besides mechanical destructive tests, chemical tests are also necessary, when the 
part is used in aggressive environment. Due to the thermal treatment and develop­
ment of the HAZ in and around the weld seams, the material behavior can devi­
ate from the bulk material’s typical reaction on environmental impacts. Therefore, 
several environmental impact tests using aggressive fluids are developed. Corrosion 
tests using fresh or salt water are a prominent example. Hydrogen tests can indicate 
the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement during the use of the material.
For a deeper evaluation of the microstructural development in and around the 
weld seam, cross-sectional analyses can be performed. These are particularly neces­
sary and used during material and process development to identify the weld seam 
microstructures and geometrical dimensions, and areas. The preparation includes 
cutting of the weld seam, grinding, polishing, and often etching in order to make 
the features visible. For a general analysis of grain sizes and metallurgical charac­
teristics, visual microscopic analyses are used. For weld seam analyses, the hardness 
is often measured as a relatively simple method to gain information about material 
properties giving indications about the performance. Depending on the purpose of 
the evaluation, cross sections can be prepared in both longitudinal and perpendicular 
directions of the weld seam. Perpendicular cross sections show weld seams at one 
particular position, while longitudinal cuts show variations during the processing.

Laser Material Processes
Certain etching techniques enable visualization of grain growth directions. This 
information gives insight into grain development and solidification characteristics.
Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) are particularly useful in order to gain 
information about detailed surface structures in higher resolution and a higher 
degree of detail. E.g., weld seam cross sections as well as fractured surfaces can 
be evaluated. Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray or wavelength dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy (EDX/WDX) methods offer the possibility to derive the local chemical 
compositions. Often line scans or area scans are used to map the material properties.
Non-destructive testing (NDT) includes methods that gain insight into the mate­
rial properties, while the welded part can be used for its intended use afterward. 
NDT methods include ultrasonic NDT, radiography NDT, eddy current NDT, and 
magnetic particle NDT. Most commonly used for weld seam analysis are probably 
ultrasonic or X-ray computer tomography (CT) analyses. Ultrasound can be applied 
by an emitter at a certain location on the part to be tested. At another position located 
behind the feature to be measured, the receiver collects the spatially resolved ultra­
sound transferred. Based on the recorded data, conclusions about weld seams can 
be drawn. Since ultrasound transmits differently in different medium, the existence 
and locations of voids, pores, or even cracks can be evaluated. X-ray CT can be used 
to create 2D frames that show density differences in the material. When illumi­
nating the part from different angles, even 3D recreations can be achieved. These 
3D frames can show, e.g., inhomogeneities of mixing in the weld seam when mate­
rial with different densities is used. In addition, porosity is well visible with the 
additional information of pore dimensions and sizes.
3.7.3.2  Governing Welding Parameters
The process efficiency also defines the economic efficiency. On the one hand, this 
means that a fast process with low energy and material need is, in general, desired. 
On the other hand, the weld quality must be achieved, which is defined by the pro­
cess window of each welding task. The process window is the range of parameter 
sets usable to achieve the desired welding result. Individual parameters have an 
impact on the result, but in most cases, the interplay between parameters must be 
considered that the process is feasible and shows acceptable results. Due to relatively 
large number of parameters for laser welding processes, the impact of many parame­
ters is needed to be known to find a robust parameter set from the multi-dimensional 
impact possibilities.
However, often some parameters are pre-defined or restricted from technical rea­
sons, e.g., the kind of gas to be used or the maximum or minimum available laser 
power or robot movement speed. The most important window for laser processing, 
in general, and laser welding, in particular, is the relation between the laser power 
and the processing/welding speed (Figure 3.28). This relation defines the line energy 
which mainly defines the energy input into the material and thereby the dimensions 
of the resulting weld seam. For deep penetration welding processes, the lower energy 
input threshold is the energy needed to reach vaporization and the upper limit is the 
plasma formation. Another common upper limit for the achievable processing speed 
is, e.g., the humping that occurs at high welding speeds and can create increased 
numbers of pores or spatters.

90
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
The main welding parameters in laser beam welding are:
•	 Laser beam properties
•	 Wavelength: The wavelength is one factor to define the absorption of 
laser beam energy on the material’s surface.
•	 Laser beam spot size: The spot size on the material’s surface defines the 
interaction area and thereby the intensity of the laser beam.
•	 Divergence: The divergence defines the opening of the laser beam and 
thereby the sensitivity to misalignment on surface variations.
The impact of defocusing the laser beam during deep penetration 
welding is shown in Figure 3.29.
•	 Spatial intensity distribution: The intensity distribution within the laser 
spot defines the energy input distribution into the material.
•	 Polarization: Polarization can influence the direction-dependent absorp­
tion. However, many laser beams for macro-processing are randomly 
polarized.
FIGURE 3.28  Visualization of impacts of selected laser welding parameters.
FIGURE 3.29  Cross sections of deep penetration weld seams at varied focal position.

91
Laser Material Processes
•	 Inclination angle: In order to avoid back reflections of the reflected 
laser light back into the fiber, the laser optic is often slightly tilted. 
Depending on the process sensitivity, the asymmetry must be consid­
ered during process design.
•	 Laser power: The laser power defines the laser beam intensity on the sur­
face and the line energy. In a first approximation, the keyhole diameter 
during laser deep penetration welding is of similar dimension as the beam 
diameter on the surface.
•	 Welding speed: The welding speed is the relative movement between the 
laser beam and the work piece and defines the line energy. At low welding 
speeds, a higher energy input and, in general, wider/deeper weld seams are 
created.
Typical weld seam cross-sectional views are shown in Figure 3.30 at varied 
laser power and welding speed values. 
•	 Shielding gas:
•	 Type of gas: The kind of shielding gas can influence the protection 
possibilities of the processing zone against the ambient air and can also 
alter the process due to chemical reactions with the melt pool or by 
changing surface tension properties.
•	 Gas flow rate: Shielding gas flow rates should not be too weak and not 
too harsh as well. Too little flow can limit the shielded area and too high 
flow rates can create turbulences and thereby entrapment of ambient 
gases.
•	 Nozzle arrangement: Coaxial nozzles enable the direction-independent 
gas application, but require more effort for integration into the setup, 
FIGURE 3.30  Cross sections of deep penetration welded seams at varied laser power and 
welding speed values.

92
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
since the laser beam needs to be guided through its center. Lateral noz­
zles are more common, while different outlet shapes can be used that 
must be directed toward the processing zone.
•	 Material properties: Material properties define, among others, the absorp­
tion of laser energy and the weld seam geometry.
A comparison between two steels and an aluminum alloy is shown in 
Figure 3.31.
•	 Joint type and tolerances: The laser beam positioning and path planning 
depend on the joint type. Due to comparably small laser beam dimensions, 
the laser beam and the processing zone require correct and precise clamp­
ing for a robust and proper alignment throughout the processing.
3.7.4  Laser-Hybrid Welding
One variation in the laser welding technology is to combine heat sources and utilize 
their respective advantages in a combination. Laser-hybrid welding combines the 
laser process with an arc process (Figure 3.32). The laser can be either positioned 
leading or trailing to the arc. Typically, a trailing laser beam leads to better mix­
ing of the filler material applied by the arc process but requires more attention to 
positioning accuracy. Often, it is recommended to use a leading MIG or MAG 
process to avoid overheating of the melt pool and trailing if high material rates are 
necessary. Gas protection is used to avoid contamination with ambient gas from the 
arc nozzle.
Since the laser beam provides the possibility to create a local high energy input 
into the keyhole, deep weld seams can be achieved. The comparably wider heat input 
FIGURE 3.31  Cross sections of deep penetration weld seams at different welding speeds 
and materials.

93
Laser Material Processes
induced by the arc process decreases the sensitivity to joint tolerances and enables 
an easier bridging of gaps, but solely to relatively flat heat conduction melt pools 
(Figure 3.33). Therefore, the combination of both advantageous features is used.
In addition, the two processes have synergetic effects. Since the energy is coupled 
into the same melt pool, the energy input can be very efficient. At higher arc power, 
the melt pool temperature is in general higher, which typically increases the absorp­
tion of the laser beam and leads to a reduced laser energy needed to achieve the 
desired weld seam. At the same time, the energy for the phase transformation from 
solid to liquid (latent heat) is not required to be transferred by the laser beam since 
the melting has already been achieved by the arc energy input.
From another perspective, the local high temperatures created by the laser beam 
in the melt pool can increase the process stability. Since the arc searches and burns 
at the path of lowest resistance from the burner to the specimen, it typically finds 
varying entry points on the specimen or the melt pool. The induced hot areas by the 
local laser heating typically show the lowest resistance and provide a stable arc posi­
tion and process [Möl16].
Besides the mentioned advantages, compromises are necessary. Hybrid laser 
welding can be conducted at higher process speeds compared to conventional arc 
FIGURE 3.32  Sketch of a laser-hybrid welding arrangement.
FIGURE 3.33  Schematics of the weld seam appearances at different welding methods.

94
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
welding processes. However, the achievable processing speeds are lower compared 
to comparable laser welding processes. In addition, due to the use of two separate 
processes, the process is direction-dependent and requires additional effort for align­
ment and control.
Since two heat sources are active at the same time next to each other, the amount 
of variable process parameters increases, which influences the melt pool and process 
characteristics. The laser parameters include laser power, beam diameter, incident 
angle, polarization, and wavelength. The arc parameters are mainly voltage, current, 
and stick-out. They must be seen in combination with the typical welding parameters 
like gas properties and application, welding speed, material properties, and joint 
design. The increased number of variable parameters makes the process, in general, 
more complex and an additional effort to find working process windows is necessary. 
In addition, the use of two systems requires higher investment in the respective sys­
tems. Those systems must be usually automated, which can add costs for installation 
as well. The accessibility of the welding zone can be reduced when adding an arc 
torch to the process setup.
However, the method enables many process variations. It is possible to enable, 
e.g., two-sided welding and most joint configurations are possible to perform. Often 
a better weld quality with reduced spattering can be achieved using hybrid process­
ing compared to single processes. The larger penetration depths and welding speeds 
compared to arc processes in combination with reduced effort for edge preparation 
can lead to higher productivity (more melted volume per time compared to single 
processes), reduced lead times, and less distortion and post-treatment requirements. 
In addition, the application of filler wire enables the active influence on the weld 
metal composition and the more efficient gap bridging compared to the sole laser 
welding process.
3.7.5  Imperfections and Defects
The weld seam quality is of high importance for most welding tasks and must fit the 
standards applied. Standards define which and how many imperfections at which 
dimensions are acceptable. There are many imperfections that can occur during and 
after welding in the weld seam, and also in the surrounding base material due to the 
effects of heat conduction. Imperfections denote the existence of features that are 
irregular or inhomogeneous. They can become defects in case they are not acceptable 
with respect to the required properties. Typical imperfections include (Figure 3.34):
•	 Cracking (hot or solidification cracking and cold cracking),
•	 Porosity (process pores or gas pores),
•	 Inclusions (coatings, dirt, local element accumulations),
•	 Melt-driven shape changes (undercuts, lack of fusion, drop through, suck 
back, lack of penetration),
•	 Deformation (residual stresses), and
•	 Metallurgical transformations (in the weld seam and the heat-affected 
zone HAZ).

95
Laser Material Processes
Imperfections are commonly identified after the process either using destructive 
or non-destructive quality assurance methods. Probably the most common method is 
the preparation of cross-sectional cuts of weld seams that can be done perpendicular 
or along the welding direction. After grinding and polishing, microscopic visualiza­
tion can show the weld seam geometry, porosity, and cracks. A more detailed picture 
of the surfaces and surface chemical compositions can be achieved by scanning elec­
tron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), just to name a few possibilities. 
Non-destructive testing (NDT) can also include micro-CT analysis, while depending 
on the resolution of the system, even porosity distributions can be visualized.
Nowadays, online process monitoring is gaining more acceptance, which can rec­
ognize imperfections during the process. However, the acceptance in industry needs 
to be gained to trust the online monitoring data to guarantee the seam quality for 
the customer even without post-process testing. Typically, visual welding cameras 
are used to identify geometrical variations in the melt pool or to identify spattering. 
Thermal monitoring is used to recognize changing heat flow conditions that are vis­
ible in the surface, which can indicate the occurrence of, e.g., porosity formation or 
lack of fusion.
Imperfections can have many and often different origins. Some imperfections 
originate from phenomena occurring in the molten phase of the weld seam. These melt 
pool and keyhole dynamics can cause, e.g., spatters and initiate pore formation. This 
makes prediction of their occurrence from the sensor data often difficult. Machine 
learning, being more advanced, analyzes what indicators in the sensor data can lead 
to imperfections. In many cases, several sensor data in combination can support 
the decision-making of the machine learning algorithm to predict and potentially 
suggest counteractions by adapting the process parameters. Due to partially large 
amount of data produced by the single sensors, the data streams need to be reduced 
and analyzed immediately. Sensor fusion techniques that only process and analyze 
FIGURE 3.34  Typical imperfections and defects in and around a weld seam.

96
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
selected features from each sensor data are used. These techniques can support the 
acceptance of industry when imperfections are robustly and reliably detected and 
even healed without additional manual effort.
3.7.5.1  Spattering
Spatters are melt ejections originating from the melt pool that can be initiated by 
melt pool or gas dynamics. Depending on their origin and formation mechanism, 
spatters can have very small dimensions of nanoscale. They are formed, e.g., by 
shear forces of the exiting vapor on the keyhole walls and are transferred within the 
vapor until they slow down and distribute in the ambient atmosphere or condensate 
and accumulate to larger particles. On the other hand, spatter can show comparably 
large dimensions of milliscale. These ejections originate from melt pool instabilities 
due to the induced melt flow patterns that can overcome the restoring forces from the 
surface tension of melt pool. Melt pool instabilities can also be caused by chemical 
reactions, e.g., oxidation at insufficient gas protection or surface pollution. Typical 
causes for spatters can be, e.g., a too high energy input due to a high laser power or 
low welding speed (Figure 3.35).
Within the keyhole, the melt detachment mechanisms releasing small melt pool 
drops from the keyhole walls are assumed to originate from the pressure difference 
between the inside and outside of the keyhole and the induced shear forces due to the 
high-speed vapor striking the keyhole walls (Figure 3.36).
In a melt pool, surface waves are assumed to be able to build up inertia to over­
come surface tension and extract melt pool spatters, e.g., when eigenfrequencies 
are initiated. Local melt pool accelerations can be initiated also from sudden pres­
sure changes in the keyhole or keyhole movements, e.g., a keyhole collapse or local, 
temporary, directed vapor flows toward the rear melt pool. Due to the, in general, 
decreasing surface tension and viscosity at increasing temperatures, the detachment 
of melt drops becomes easier at higher temperatures. A lower surface tension leads to 
less counteracting forces to the melt pool inertia. Similarly, low viscosity encourages 
the melt flow, and less energy is needed to move the melt to form a drop or droplet.
Strategies to avoid spattering mainly aim to calm down the melt pool and avoid 
dynamic and high-velocity gas flows. This can be achieved with different methods 
FIGURE 3.35  High-speed image of a welding process.

97
Laser Material Processes
that provide more space to the melt to flow at lower speeds in the melt pool or give 
the vapor more space to expand. One possibility is the use of an additional gas flow 
directed toward the keyhole to widen the keyhole opening. The increased area and 
often the smoother keyhole opening can reduce the ejection speed of the metal vapor 
and even prevent the keyhole from collapsing. The smoother vapor outflow can 
reduce the shear forces and the vapor impact on the keyhole wall. Applied gases 
can also alter the surface tension of the melt pool surfaces. Higher surface tension 
can help to limit the melt dynamics. In addition, electromagnetic volume forces can 
be induced by electromagnets (e.g. [Gat12]) to stabilize the melt pool movements by 
inducing flow fields against the ejection direction of spatters. A simple mechanical 
method to suppress spatters is a melt support (e.g., ceramic plates) that are typically 
positioned on the root side of the welding sheets to form a barrier and can help to 
avoid root melt ejections.
Another possibility for process stabilization is laser beam shaping, which is 
largely available for high-power laser processes. Using multiple spot laser beams 
can induce wider and in turn calmer melt pools that create slower melt flows and 
thereby avoid ejections, e.g., double focus [Vol16b] or circular spots with additional 
rings have been shown to provide this effect. Refractive beam shaping promises 
reliable high-power beam shaping with mirrors or lenses [Las14]. Diffractive opti­
cal elements can be used as well [Liu04]. However, the impact of different beam 
shapes on welding processes is not yet completely understood since multiple effects 
are induced at the same time. When the energy input is changed, the keyhole shape 
must adapt, leading to varied energy absorption in depth and temperature distribu­
tions that alter the temperature-dependent material properties and the induced melt 
and vapor flows.
Several investigations have been performed to learn about the relation between 
the keyhole and melt pool characteristics and the melt ejections, e.g., the spatter 
amount has been evaluated in high-speed videos using a spatter tracking routine 
[Vol17]. Refractive beam shaping optics have been used to generate different spatial 
FIGURE 3.36  Sketches of spatter origins and ejection effects.

98
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
laser intensity distributions on the material’s surface, namely top-hat and donut pro­
files. Figure 3.37 shows the occurrence of spatters at different parameters, while the 
Gaussian beam shape shows the least number of spatters.
Beam shaping can also be done in beam propagation direction. A bifocal optic 
has been used to produce two beam waists along the laser optical axis (Figure 3.38a), 
while the additional high intensity of the second beam waist inside the keyhole can 
FIGURE 3.37  Spatter occurrence at different laser powers and welding speeds at different 
beam profiles.
FIGURE 3.38  Spatter occurrence at (a) bifocal beam shaping and (b) multi-focal beam 
shaping compared to a standard-optic welding process [Vol19a].

99
Laser Material Processes
stabilize the process [Vol16b]. In addition, a multi-focus optic (foXXus, Adloptica) 
has been used to produce either a two-waist laser beam with waists close to each 
other, four waists and two-waists close to each other (Figure 3.38b). Promising stabi­
lization effects have been observed when high-intensity regions are positioned inside 
the keyhole. It is assumed that the additional energy input increases the vaporization 
and helps avoiding the collapse of the keyhole that induces intense melt flows and 
ejections [Vol19a].
Another method to induce a melt pool stabilizing effect has been found when 
creating a so-called buttonhole. A buttonhole is a melt opening, which is larger com­
pared to a typical keyhole. The buttonhole is solely maintained by surface tension 
effects instead of the effect of vapor pressure in a keyhole. When the hole expands, 
it can form curved surfaces showing a catenoid shape. Such a shape is stable due to 
the surface tension contributions of the two curvatures. It has been shown that beam 
oscillation patterns [Cho20a] and static beam shaping [Vol21b] can initiate a keyhole 
elongation and create buttonhole. Calm melt pools and limited impact of vapor have 
been seen when welding in the buttonhole mode. A buttonhole is self-maintaining 
and can therefore form a hole in the material when the process is stopped.
3.7.5.2  Humping
The humping effect is a phenomenon where melt pool accumulations occur regularly 
on the weld seam surface. This phenomenon is typically created when long and flat 
melt pools are present during the processing. This is typically the case at very high 
welding velocities (e.g., [Tan20]). The effect is reproducible and is based on the sur­
face tension effect that accumulates melt to humps. The initiated melt flows toward 
the rear sections of the melt pool support melt accumulation. At high welding speeds, 
the melt pools can elongate and show very low depth. When a melt section in the rear 
part of the melt pool is separated from the melt provision from the processing zone, 
the remaining melt forms a droplet driven by the surface tension. After breakup, the 
melt pool elongates again until another droplet is formed. This process repeats regu­
larly and forms the droplet appearance in nearly constant distances.
3.7.5.3  Undercuts
Undercuts denote missing material on the weld seam surface (Figure 3.39). They can 
appear at the top and also on the root side of the weld seam. Possible reasons can be
•	 melt that is pushed into the joint gap due to thermal expansion of the join­
ing partners,
•	 the misalignment of the laser beam and the joining gap,
•	 a too high process velocity relative to the power level and material thick­
ness, or
•	 surface tension forming a round weld seam shape including material from 
the weld seam sides.
Undercuts can be accepted to a certain extent though they mark a reduction in weld 
seam thickness. The lack of material can reduce the weld seam strength compared 
to the expectations during load application. More importantly, sharp transitions and 

100
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
edges can be a structural notch. These are critical when applying dynamic load and 
can initiate, e.g., fatigue cracks. In addition, notches can be initiation and starting 
points of corrosion.
In general, undercuts can be avoided by providing enough material to fill the 
gaps and form rounded edges. This can be achieved by using enough filler material. 
When reducing the processing speed, the additional time for the melt to form round 
melt pools and wet edges can help avoid undercuts. When one-sided undercuts occur, 
realignment of the laser beam might solve the issue. In addition, magnetic support 
can help to hold the melt in place and avoid wavy melt pool surfaces. In order to 
increase spreading and wetting of the melt, surface active elements can be added as 
part of the filler wire to reduce the melt surface tension.
3.7.5.4  Incomplete Penetration
Incomplete penetration is a lack of material bonding, which reduces the weld seam 
cross-sectional connection. Some of the most typical joint configurations with incom­
plete bonding are shown in Figure 3.40. Even though the top view of the weld seam 
can look acceptable, a lack of material connection can occur underneath. These weld 
seams are also called “false friends”, since they appear to be sufficiently done, but 
the failure is not immediately visible. This is particularly critical when the lower 
sides of the weld seam are not visibly accessible or not tested, e.g., by NDT methods.
Possible reasons to initiate incomplete penetration can be changed melt flows 
that avoid the melt to flow into lower melt pool regions. This can be caused by oxi­
dation effects that change the surface tension and the Marangoni flow. Often, the 
energy input is too low to reach the required melting for full penetration or to create 
FIGURE 3.39  Schematic sketches of undercuts due to (a) thermal expansion and high pro­
cess velocities, (b) misalignment, and (c) surface tension.
FIGURE 3.40  Incomplete penetration defects at different joint configurations.

101
Laser Material Processes
sufficiently large melt pools. This can be caused by fluctuations of the laser power 
or a focal shift. Contaminations of the optics or in the shielding gas can be other 
reasons.
3.7.5.5  Porosity
Pores denote a lack of material and can therefore alter the mechanical properties of 
welded joints. However, often a certain number or a certain volume of small, spheri­
cal pores can be accepted to a certain extent depending on the material, application 
case, and used standards. Porosity can be categorized in two main categories based 
on the formation mechanisms, namely metallurgical and process pores.
3.7.5.5.1  Metallurgical Pores
Metallurgical pores are formed by the changing solubility of gases in the melt at dif­
ferent temperatures of the material. Typically, during cooling from the high process 
peak temperatures, the gas solubility decreases, and gas is extracted from the melt 
forming gas inside the melt pool. The gas bubbles can accumulate and form pores. 
Typically, they appear at the liquid-solid interface, where a lower gas pressure is 
required to start the formation of gas bubbles. Such metallurgical pores are typically 
comparably small and are often not critical toward global weld seam properties. 
Typical gases in the melt that induce pore formation during the cooling time are, e.g., 
nitrogen in austenitic steels or hydrogen in aluminum alloys (Figure 3.41). Sources of 
such gases are the ambient air including moist, oxides, or other surface layers on the 
material, and already trapped gas in the previously existing pores.
3.7.5.5.2  Process Pores
Process pores consist of trapped gas from the environment that is included in the 
melt pool during the processing. Compared to metallurgical pores, the gas that forms 
FIGURE 3.41  Example of hydrogen solubility in aluminum.

102
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
process pores does not come from the material solution but from the ambient atmo­
sphere. The entrapped gas forms gas bubbles inside the melt pool. In case, the gas 
cannot escape from the melt pool until solidification, a pore remains in the weld 
seam. Gas inclusions arise when a gas bubble can form and is surrounded by solidi­
fying material. Spherical pores (<0.2 mm diameter) exist in most fusion weld seams 
and usually spread homogeneously all over the weld seam. Small, spherical pores 
are often tolerable according to the standards. Critical pores are long, non-spherical, 
and large. These characteristics significantly reduce the connecting cross sections of 
the weld seams. Pores that solidify right on the material’s surface can also be seen as 
critical, since the material response to mechanical load can be affected, e.g., crack 
initiation can be caused.
Since entrapped gas bubbles in the melt pool have a lower density than the melt, 
gas bubbles can escape due to buoyancy forces and melt pool flows that can trans­
port the gas bubbles to the surface. In case there is enough time, and the melt flow 
patterns are not hindering their rise, the gas can escape. At higher density differ­
ences between the gas and melt, gas bubbles can rise faster. Since the density ratio is 
higher for iron compared to, e.g., aluminum, the probability of gas bubbles escaping 
is higher. In addition, oxide layers can hinder the bubble escaping. In general, larger 
gas bubbles can rise faster at lower melt viscosity.
Gas entrapment can happen when the melt is able to entrap and surround ambi­
ent gas. This can happen during heat conduction welding as well but is more likely 
to happen in deep penetration welding. In deep penetration welding, the keyhole is 
present and melt pool dynamics occurs.
Keyhole collapses support the creation of gas bubbles. Due to the pressure fluc­
tuations based on the keyhole dimension oscillations, ambient gas can be sucked into 
the keyhole for a short time even against the exiting vapor flows. Two basic effects 
of keyhole collapses are known that can surround the entrapped gas: (1) Keyhole 
collapse in a middle section and (2) bulging of the rear keyhole and detachment 
(Figure 3.42). In both cases, gas bubbles are formed in the melt pool, which can be 
trapped as pores after solidification.
FIGURE 3.42  Pore formation mechanisms within a keyhole during laser deep penetration 
welding.

103
Laser Material Processes
Further aspects that can impact the pore formation need to be considered. The 
type of shielding and ambient gas define the probability and severeness of poros­
ity, e.g., due to oxidation effects. Furthermore, surface contaminations, alloying ele­
ments, or coatings can change the process dynamics and can even provide gas to be 
entrapped. Zinc coatings can affect the process. Zinc has a lower vaporization point 
as the steel base material and forms additional gas pressure in the melt pool that can 
lead to increased dynamics, pore formation, and also spatter ejections. The produced 
gas is an additional source for gas being entrapped.
Also, the applied shielding gas flow can impact gas entrapment mechanisms. 
Effects and material properties that increase the process dynamics typically support 
creation of pores. A low viscosity of the material at high temperatures (e.g., alumi­
num alloys) or the vaporization of alloying elements increases temporal fluctuations 
of process dynamics, increasing the probability of a keyhole collapse. Porosity is 
most commonly found in aluminum or nickel alloys. Also, steels with medium and 
high C-content are affected.
Prevention mechanisms are based on
1.	enabling gas bubble escaping by
a.	 creating long melt pools to encourage the gas bubble movement to the 
melt pool surface,
b.	 a second treatment for re-melting (e.g., another re-melting with the laser 
beam).
2.	decreasing keyhole collapses by
a.	 laser power modulations,
b.	 filler wire use,
c.	 a gas flow directed toward the rear keyhole wall, and
d.	 magnetic stabilization.
3.	eliminating gas availability (e.g., by welding in low-pressure or vacuum 
conditions).
3.7.5.6  Cracking
Cracks are material separations that occur during (hot cracking or solidification 
cracking) or after the process (cold cracking). Their occurrence can reach from 
micro to macro dimensions and are typically not tolerated from a quality perspec­
tive due to their negative impact on the properties of a material. Cracks can occur at 
different positions within the weld seam and heat-affected zones. They can occur as 
inter- (through grains) and trans-crystalline (along grain boundaries) cracks.
3.7.5.6.1  Cold Cracking
Cold cracks occur after solidification of a material when local stress fields separate the 
material. They form due to three main factors: (1) Presence of hydrogen in the mate­
rial, (2) a brittle microstructure, e.g., martensite, and (3) stress concentration. This can 
happen right during the cooling phase but can also occur days after welding. Cold 
cracks can appear in the weld seam and the HAZ. Due to the formation mechanism, 
the surfaces of the cracked material parts appear to be rugged.

104
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Cold cracking can often be reduced and avoided by
•	 pre-heating the material in order to reduce thermal gradients in the mate­
rial, thereby decreasing the creation of high stress concentrations,
•	 controlled cooling conditions (e.g., slow cooling by controlled temperature 
decrease),
•	 filler material addition to alter the chemical composition for grain refine­
ment or viscosity reduction (e.g., TiB2 in aluminum),
•	 widening the temperature field by increasing the line energy to lower the 
cooling rates and reduce the development of thermal stresses, or
•	 multi-layer welding to induce intrinsic pre- and post-heating.
3.7.5.6.2  Hot Cracking
Hot cracking appears during melt solidification in the mushy zone, where thermal 
stresses can lead to a separation of partly solidified material. Hot cracks typically 
show a smooth, round surface since the separation happens in partly liquid state and 
final solidification happens thereafter.
The mushy (partly melted) zone occurs due to constitutional undercooling induced 
by chemical elements in the alloy. For pure materials, there is one single melting 
point, while for alloys, solidification can happen within a temperature range. The 
alloy elements can increase the range between the liquidus and solidus temperatures. 
Therefore, a mushy zone can form, where parts of the mush is solid and some parts 
are still liquid. This means that grains start growing and form the lattice during solid­
ification. At the same time, the low melting elements accumulate in the remaining 
liquid. This leads to the effect of constitutional undercooling, continuously increasing 
the solidus temperature in the remaining melt. In addition, this leads to an inhomo­
geneous distribution of the elements in the weld seam after solidification. Therefore, 
alloying elements are mainly found on the grain boundaries. Due to thermal shrink­
ing of grains from liquid to solid state, cavities form between the solidifying grains. 
These cavities create low-pressure volumes that the liquid tries to fill by back feeding 
(Figure 3.43). However, the permeability of the already existing solid grain struc­
ture can be low and it avoids the back feeding to fill the cavities. Small grains sup­
port permeability, while larger grains tend to block back feeding. In case the loads, 
e.g., from clamping or thermal stresses due to shrinking are high enough, the partly 
FIGURE 3.43  Schematics of the grain growth in the mushy zone.

Laser Material Processes
solidified material can separate. Since the material is still partly liquid, the crack sur­
faces appear rounded due to surface tension.
The mushy zone dimensions and grain growth characteristics depend on the mate­
rial alloy and the local temperature gradients and solidification rates (Figure 3.44). 
Small grains can be initiated when grain initiators are present in the alloy, when the 
temperature gradient is high and the solidification rate is low.
When the difference between the liquidus and solidus temperatures and the vis­
cosity are high, cracks are more likely to occur. Hot cracks can occur as central weld 
seam cracks and as macro and micro cracks between dendrites.
Carbon, sulfur, and phosphorous as alloying elements in steel increase the risk of 
hot cracking, while manganese decreases the risk. Due to the typically larger range 
between solidus and liquidus temperatures in aluminum alloys, there is a high risk of 
cracking. High amounts of silicon and magnesium increase the crack susceptibility 
due to increased amounts of low melting phases.
Hot cracking can be reduced or avoided by
•	 changing the metallurgy (e.g., addition of grain refiners like titanium in the 
alloy),
•	 changing the geometry of the structure to avoid stresses, or
•	 thermal design by lowering the cooling rate and shrinking tensions (e.g., by 
pre-heating the specimen or local heat sources) or energy input design by, 
e.g., beam shaping (e.g., beam oscillation to create a wider melt pool).
3.8  LASER BEAM CUTTING
3.8.1  Introduction
Laser cutting has been already invented at TWI, Cambridge (UK) in 1967 and is 
categorized into the separation processes. Laser cutting is still the most industrially 
used high-power laser technology since it is comparably easy to use and can be used 
for many materials. High process velocities and good cut quality can be achieved. 
Due to low-energy input compared to competing cutting processes, a small heat-
affected zone can be achieved. The laser cutting heads are typically mounted on 
robot or CNC-machines, while cutting of sheets is the most common application for 
various industries. Both CO2 and YAG lasers are possible to be used. Conductive

top view.

106
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
sensors are often installed to measure and control the distance of the gas nozzle and 
the material to be cut. All materials that absorb the used laser beam and can establish 
a local melt pool are, in general, feasible to be used for laser cutting. Materials for 
laser beam cutting in industrial production are mainly metals (40%) and polymers 
(30%), followed by ceramics (18%) and ceramic composites (12%). The ejection of 
the melt is achieved by an impulse using gas pressure directed toward the melt pool 
or the laser-induced recoil pressure. In gas cutting, the directed gas outflow from 
a gas nozzle is used to create pressure on the melt pool, which is positioned close 
above the material. Inert gases and oxygen are typically used as cutting gases.
3.8.2  Process Principle
The principle of laser cutting is based on the local melting of a material and exhaust 
of the molten material by either a directed gas jet or laser ablation (Figure 3.45). 
Typically, high intensity laser beams, often in focal position, are used to generate 
melt pools. The high intensity of laser beams enables the creation of deep and narrow 
impacts, similar to deep penetration welding processes. This mode can be achieved 
when overcoming the deep penetration threshold of the material. However, during 
cutting, the molten volume does not remain as a trailing melt pool as it is intended for 
laser beam welding. The typical cut front is formed that is illuminated by the laser 
beam. Similar to keyhole welding, during laser cutting, a downward movement of 
the melt on the vaporizing front is observed. This melt flow can support the ejection 
of melt when gas supported cutting is applied or can be the main driver and force to 
expel molten droplets from the cut front root side.
The cut front allows a high-energy input and the creation of a deep melt pool to 
achieve the cutting of even thick sheets. The energy input must balance the main heat 
loss due to heat conduction, while the process velocity enables the movement of the 
laser beam relative to the material and a continuous exhaust of the material.
The energy input into the material takes place due to Fresnel absorption on 
the created cut front and side walls. Multiple reflections can occur and increase 
FIGURE 3.45  Principle sketch of the laser cutting process.

107
Laser Material Processes
the total absorbed energy depending on the keyhole shape. When the cut front is 
shaped to enable the laser beam rays to reflect toward a side wall of the molten 
pool, multiple reflections and absorption can support the energy input. However, 
the multiple reflection and absorption effect is less efficient compared to laser deep 
penetration welding since there is no rear wall that can absorb the reflected rays. 
The created melt film governs the process behavior. The melt film thickness is 
defined by the absorption of the laser beam, which defines the downstream speed. 
The cut front inclination angle mainly depends on the processing speed; however, 
the angle is steeper at slower process velocities. Due to the steep inclination of the 
cut front, parts of the laser beam can miss the material, which decreases the pro­
cess efficiency.
In addition, the selection of gases as a cutting gas to remove the molten material 
can change the energy balance. Passive gases, which are typically inert or at least 
low-reactive gases, do not chemically react with the melt pool components. These 
gases can have a minor cooling effect. However, when using active gases, such as 
oxygen, the induced chemical reactions induce additional energy to melt the mate­
rial. This reduces the laser energy needed to create the necessary melt pool dimen­
sions, which can be more cost-efficient due to typically lower price for O2 compared 
to the cost of laser energy. The impact of the reaction can, however, increase the 
process dynamics and the risk of burning. Using oxygen can support the formation 
of oxides that can remain on the cut kerf and alter the surface appearance and kerf 
properties.
The overall energy input must be sufficiently high to heat the material and over­
come the latent heat of melting. In sublimation cutting, in addition, the melt must be 
further heated, and the latent heat of vaporization needs to be overcome, which is 
typically ten times higher than the one for melting [Pop11].
When the melt pool was formed due to the energy input, the created melt film at 
the cut front is then forced by a gas jet or laser recoil pressure to downstream. The 
induced melt flows typically lead to ripples on the cut kerf. The roughness of the 
solidified cut kerf is one of the quality criteria of laser cutting results.
On the root side of the cut front, melt is ejected. Depending on the flow rate and 
material properties, the separation of the melt from the melt pool happens from a 
liquid film or direct droplet formation and detachment. The downstream inertia in 
the melt pool must overcome the local surface tension to create a detachment into 
droplets.
Another important quality factor in laser cutting is the formation of dross. Dross 
is the material that is transferred in the cut front but solidified on the lower side of 
the sheet. This happens when the induced gas or recoil pressure guiding the melt is 
not sufficiently directed or not strong enough to detach the material. Dross can form 
if the molten drop’s inertia is not sufficient to overcome the surface tension.
The introduced heat from the laser beam into the process zone is balanced by 
energy losses occurring due to heat transfer via conduction into the base material as 
well as via convection within the melt pool. Convective melt pool flows are mainly 
induced by laser ablation on the cut front. Melting and evaporation occur, includ­
ing re-condensation and re-solidification, after the laser beam is passed. Chemical 
reactions and element vaporization can lead to changes in the chemical composition 

108
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
of the material. In combination with the thermal cycles induced, microstructural 
changes need to be considered in the vicinity of the cut kerf.
3.8.3  Process Modes
Three main process modes can be distinguished, namely inert gas cutting, oxygen 
cutting, and vaporization cutting:
•	 In laser inert gas cutting, typically nitrogen and argon at pressure in the 
range of 2–20 bar are used to induce material ejection. The process can lead 
to shiny edges and no burning damage but is comparably slow and a high 
laser energy is necessary.
•	 Laser oxygen cutting uses the energy created by surface oxidation as addi­
tional energy input. Therefore, a reduced laser energy is possible to be used 
compared to inert gas cutting. The cut kerf must be expected to be oxidized 
after the cutting process. The process velocity is comparably high or high 
thickness material can be cut. High pressure in the range of 6 bar is used to 
remove the melt. Cutting of material of 40 mm thickness is possible.
•	 In laser vaporization cutting, no cutting gas is used to remove the material. 
The laser-induced recoil pressure on the boiling cut front directly induces the 
melt downward flow and ejection. This setup enables remote cutting, where 
oscillating optics can control the laser beam position rapidly without the lim­
itation of moving the whole optic including the gas nozzle. Remote cutting 
is typically used to cut metals as well as non-metals (e.g., plastic and wood).
One process variation is laser waterjet cutting, where water is used for melt 
removal. In addition, the laser beam can be efficiently guided inside the water stream 
comparable to the light transfer inside a glass fiber. The water supports the cool­
ing of the material, which can reduce the cracking and can avoid the attachment of 
ejected particles. Very good cut quality can be achieved but the process velocities 
are comparably slow.
3.8.4  Process Parameters
Typically, high-power laser systems (CO2 and YAG lasers) are used for laser beam 
cutting in cw mode. For micro-cutting applications, the pw modes are also used. 
Both bell-shaped and top-hat beam shapes can be applied; beam shaping can help 
to direct the energy input on the cut front and increase the homogeneity of the melt 
pool downward movement.
Laser beam polarization can have a significant impact on the cutting result due to 
varying absorption when cutting in different processing directions. Linear polariza­
tion can lead to varying cut quality and cut appearances. Linear p-polarized beams 
in moving direction have the highest absorption on the cut front and when turning 
the moving direction by 90°, absorption happens mainly on the cut front side walls. 
Therefore, circular polarization or multi-mode beams with no preferred polariza­
tion are used to avoid direction-dependent effects. Typical material thicknesses 

109
Laser Material Processes
range between 0.1 mm and 20 mm. Cutting parameters range from below 1 m/min 
to 100 m/min processing velocity and 1 kW to 8 kW laser power. Typical tendencies 
of parameter impact on the cutting speed are shown in Figure 3.46.
The pressure of either the assist gas or the recoil pressure from the laser beam 
changes the melt pool geometry and melt film movement. In general, a higher pres­
sure leads to a fast melt film downward movement and a steep melt pool front angle 
(Figure 3.47).
The laser wavelength influences the process as well. At high wavelengths (e.g., 
from CO2 laser systems), the laser beam absorption is typically low. However, these 
laser systems can reach high power levels and are reliable. High-quality results can 
also be achieved with lasers at 1 µm wavelength. Many systems installed in industry 
use the reliable CO2 lasers, but fiber and disk lasers become more popular in particu­
lar because of the possibility to guide the laser beam in fiber optics to the processing 
zone. In addition, the absorption is, in general, higher for most materials using YAG 
lasers compared to CO2 lasers.
In addition, laser beam caustic parameters influence the process result. When 
using a laser beam with small beam diameter on the material’s surface, a higher 
intensity can be reached, which enables, in general, higher process velocities. The 
FIGURE 3.46  Example of the tendencies of process parameter impact on maximum cutting 
speed (mild steel).
FIGURE 3.47  Melt film appearance at different gas or recoil pressures.

110
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
positioning of the beam waist slightly below the material’s surface enables the high­
est possible process velocities and best quality due to the increased absorption at 
lower parts of the cut front.
3.8.5  Quality Criteria and Imperfections
Typical quality criteria applied to laser cutting results are geometrical characteristics 
like
•	 width of the cut kerf,
•	 surface roughness,
•	 rectangularity of the cut edge corners,
•	 parallel sides of cut surface walls, and
•	 sharpness of the corners.
Imperfection criteria are
•	 low dross attachment at the bottom edge,
•	 low oxidation of the cut surfaces,
•	 small HAZs,
•	 no cracks at the cut surface, and
•	 low loss of alloying elements by vaporization.
The dominant dynamical features of the process are ripple formation on the cut 
kerf [Fri00] and adherent dross on the root side of the sheets ([Mak92, Nem97]). At 
least three different ripple patterns exist, namely ripples of first, second, and third 
kind. Ripples of the first kind appear at the top of the cut edge, while nearly no re-
solidified material evolves near the top of the cut edge. The ripple frequency linearly 
increases with cutting speed up to a value of about 500 Hz at 4 m/min. Second kind 
ripples show the doubled ripple frequency compared to the first kind and appear in 
the middle section of the cut kerf. When increasing the cutting speed, they appear 
closer to the top surface (Figure 3.48). Ripples of the third kind show re-solidified 
molten material.
Dross is solidified material that is not blown out of the processing zone but 
attached on the lower part of the cut sheets. Reasons for dross formation can be the 
dynamic movement of melt in the form of cut front oscillations ([Dew21, Poc17]), too 
high pressure gradients compared to shear forces [Vic87], or supersonic gas move­
ment [Sch87].
Due to direct accessibility of the cut surface after cutting, a first quality inspection 
can be done visually. Ripples and dross are immediately visible. Thermal effects in 
the HAZ are not directly visible and require, e.g., the preparation of cross-sectional 
cuts to identify the microstructures and grain distributions.
For academic purposes, the melt flow patterns are interesting to observe and 
explain at different process parameters. Process simulations can help describe the 
melt flow patterns. Cutting behind glass has been shown to efficiently visualize the 
melt flows [Dew21]. Some limitations due to different material properties of glass 

111
Laser Material Processes
compared to other material need to be considered that alter material properties such 
as heat conductivity.
3.9  LASER DRILLING
Laser beams can be used for drilling operations. Laser drilling uses high-intensity 
laser beams in continuous and pulsed modes. In order to achieve the removal of 
material, local melting and/or vaporization is induced by the laser beam. Drilling 
methods with conventional mechanical tools with defined shape form the drill holes 
based on the geometry of the tool. The laser beam has no mechanical geometry. 
Therefore, the geometry of the drill hole depends on other factors related to the 
laser beam parameters and processing characteristics in correlation with the laser 
beam-matter interaction. The laser drill holes are in the dimension of the laser beam 
diameter, but additional effect from melting and vaporization or beam movement 
can shape the drill hole geometry. Therefore, on the one hand, the process becomes 
complex compared to drilling with conventional tools. However, on the other hand, 
the laser beam parameters open new possibilities, such as drill holes with opening 
cone geometries, which are very difficult to achieve with conventional methods.
For creating drill holes, local laser melting or vaporization is induced. During laser 
drilling, the material is always melted to a certain extent, even when mainly the vapor­
ization mechanism is aimed for. In continuous laser operation or long pulse applica­
tions, melting is the dominating mechanism. An upward melt movement is induced by 
the laser recoil pressure in the drill hole, and the melt is ejected upward. Since the melt 
during solidification reshapes, e.g., based on the surface tension effects, the final drill 
hole shape can show unwanted deviations from nicely shaped straight walls.
FIGURE 3.48  Cut kerfs with ripples, dross, and burning at different laser powers and pro­
cessing speeds.

112
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Therefore, high-intense short pulse laser modes are often used to induce vaporiza­
tion of the material as the main material removal mechanism. This mode reduces the 
amount of melt and still removes material as vapor. The vaporized material volume 
forms the drill hole. The melt vaporization or ejection is initiated by the laser beam. 
There is no additional gas jet used as in gas-assisted laser cutting for melt removal. 
Instead, the ablation pressure created by the laser beam performs the ejection of the 
material, which is either directly vaporized or melt accelerated and separated.
During laser illumination, the photonic energy is mainly transferred from the 
photons to the electrons within nanoseconds to picoseconds after the impact of the 
laser photon. This is followed by the energy transfer to the lattice material. When 
using short, high-intense laser pulses, the energy can be directly transferred to a 
large extent to vaporize the material. In laser drilling, the direct vaporization is an 
advantage since the material is removed with minimal melt creation. In principle, in 
the vaporization mode, there are more exiting atoms leaving the bulk material than 
can re-condensed, which denotes the material removal. The material vapor removal 
is, on the one hand, the goal of the process, but is also a source of energy loss and 
reduces thereby the surface temperature.
However, even when aiming to vaporize the material using short pulses, classical 
heat conduction happens in the drill hole as well, which creates a thermal gradient 
from the drill hole surface to the surrounding material. This induces the creation of 
a thin melt pool (Figure 3.49a). Extensive melt appearance is one of the main reasons 
for imperfections and inaccuracies of the resulting drill hole geometry. The melt film 
thickness varies with illumination times. At very short pulses (<100 ps), it is possible 
to almost avoid melting and just remove material by vaporization (Figure 3.49b). 
These two drilling modes are often used as theoretical models to simulate and pre­
dict material removal.
The pulse length of the pulsed lasers and the total absorbed energy define the sur­
face temperature of the drill hole during its formation. The optimum pulse lengths 
are material-dependent, e.g., ~1–10 ps (Fe) and ~5 ps (Al). In general, most metals 
and some ceramics and plastics can be laser drilled.
The drilling speed is defined as the material removal per pulse in depth direction. 
The intensity on the more or less flat drill hole ground mainly defines the removal 
FIGURE 3.49  Theoretical models of laser drilling (a) melting and vaporization and (b) sole 
vaporization.

113
Laser Material Processes
rate. In general, at high intensities, more vapor is created and a higher ablation pres­
sure results, which can lead to a smaller melt film. However, small melt films can be 
accelerated by the recoil pressure impact and can move at speeds of several 10 m/s 
[All87]. Such dynamic melt movements can be the reason for process imperfections. 
There is a possibility that the expanding lower part of the drill hole and the upward 
melt movement toward the solidifying upper drill hole part can even lead to melt 
pool closure (Figure 3.50).
Dross imperfections can occur when melt remains at the drill hole exit or on the 
walls after the laser pulse. Such drill hole shape changes can also induce craters at 
the lower part of the drill hole or roundness and concentricity changes and variations 
in depth. In addition, metallurgical changes and cracks can appear. Although heat 
input into the surrounding material is limited, a HAZ still occurs, which means that 
the microstructure can be altered within and beside the melt film. Cracks can be 
initiated due to the thermal impact and related stress fields induced. In particular, 
the high thermal gradients are a potential source of thermal stresses. Another fac­
tor that can alter the energy input and thereby the dynamics of the process is the 
absorption of laser energy in plasma or ionized gas. Plasma or ionized gas occur 
at high laser energy input, which can be provided during the high intensity of the 
short laser pulses. Therefore, such absorption mechanisms can limit the pulse peak 
intensity and the repetition rates that can be used. In addition, such inhomogeneous 
and potentially scattered energy input can deform the drill hole and reduce the drill 
depth per pulse. When using polarized laser beams, influences of angle-dependent 
variations need to be considered.
Laser drill holes can be produced in different ways. A single pulse can produce 
a drill hole with only one step, while percussion drilling methods remove material 
FIGURE 3.50  Schematic sketch of melt pool movement during drill hole closure.

114
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
stepwise in depth during multiple laser pulses (Figure 3.51). More complex laser 
beam movements can be used for trepanning and helical drilling to remove material 
stepwise and shape the drill hole at the same time. In order to limit the creation of 
imperfections, in general, shorter pulses at high intensity are advantageous, which 
also reduce the energy needed per pulse.
Single pulses are usually used in the range of 10 µs–1 ms pulse duration, reaching 
drilling depths between 0.02 mm and several millimeters. A single pulse process 
can manage to create around 1000 holes per second, which shows, in general, a high 
productivity at comparably low quality.
Percussion drilling uses laser pulse lengths in the dimension of ~10 ns at a laser 
energy input of 10 J–0.1 mJ. Compared to single pulse drilling, percussion drill­
ing can achieve deeper drill holes at a more homogeneous diameter. The pulsing 
controls and limits the creation of melt and resulting burr to some extent. However, 
in this mode, the melt creation and flow influence the process result. The removal 
rate depends on the material depth due to varying removal rates along the drill hole 
creation in depth.
Trepanning and helical drilling use a pulsed laser beam, which moves relative 
to the substrate using beam oscillation optics. That way, in many removal paths, 
the drill shape is created with many single pulses. The advantage of minimum melt 
creation per pulse is combined with the flexibility to create nearly arbitrary drill 
hole shapes. Also, angled beams for varying diameters of the drill hole can be used. 
Trepanning is typically started with a statically created drill hole, while helical 
drilling is immediately started with the moving beam. High depth and quality are 
FIGURE 3.51  Categorization of drilling modes.

115
Laser Material Processes
possible to reach due to the possibility of adapting the focal position during drilling. 
The adaption to the actual drill depth enables the processing with the intended laser 
beam spot size in every depth.
The resulting drill quality is usually defined by the ratio between melt and vapor 
material ejection. The more melt is created, the less precise and less costly the drill­
ing process is. Less melt can be achieved at shorter pulses, requiring however higher 
beam intensities.
Laser drilling is a non-contact, fast process. No direct wear of tools during the 
process is created. The use of remote laser beams offers a good accessibility to guide 
the laser beam to the surface of the part or component that needs to be processed. 
The process can be fully automated, which enables drilling of a huge number of 
holes in a short time. Laser drilling reaches large depth to width ratio (>1) and cov­
ers a large range of achievable drill hole diameters with the same laser system. Holes 
at small angles can be drilled with no burr at high accuracy. Many materials can be 
laser-drilled, e.g., hard diamond, ceramics, or hardened steels.
3.10  LASER ALLOYING AND DISPERSING
The category “laser surface treatment” contains several processes (Figure 3.52) that 
use different effects to alter material’s surfaces. Hardening (see Section 3.3) uses 
comparably low laser energy input to avoid melting and focus on inducing harden­
ing effects, while other surface treatment processes require melting. The re-melting 
process of the surface can be applied, inducing a melt pool on the surface. This 
process can be used, e.g., to decrease porosity of a previously produced weld seam, 
to enhance material mixing, or to create a certain surface structure. When applying 
additional material to the created melt pool, laser alloying, dispersing, or cladding 
can be realized. The processes are very similar since they all contain the addition 
of material. The differences are the kind of material applied and the purpose of the 
material addition.
Alloying, in general, follows the purpose of adding additional alloying elements 
to the base material and thereby altering the chemical composition. That way, it is 
possible to balance element vaporization that occurs during the surface treatment or 
change material properties to achieve, e.g., better wear resistance of the surface. In 
addition, metallurgical changes can be induced that help to avoid imperfections like 
cracking by refining the grain structure.
FIGURE 3.52  Process variants of laser surface treatments.

116
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
In dispersing, the added material in the liquid metal melt pool is aimed to stay in 
solid phase. Typically, carbides, borides, or other high-melting materials are added 
for surface wear resistance or hardness improvement. The additional material can 
be added using powder nozzles, while a gas flow directs the powder particles onto 
the melt pool. Also, a two-step process, where the powder is pre-placed on the mate­
rial before melting is possible to use to incorporate the powder material. The added 
material is aimed to distribute homogeneously in the surface area to provide the 
intended surface properties in the whole depth and width of the treated surface vol­
ume. In principle, gases can also be used for alloying, e.g., nitrogen reacts with alloy­
ing elements in the melt pool that create high-melting phases.
For the mentioned surface treatment methods that include the creation of melt 
pools, typically, melt pools in heat conduction mode are intended to be produced. 
Parameters are usually in the range of 1–3 kW laser power, 0.1–10 m/min process 
velocity, 1–5 mm laser spot diameter on the surface and 5–30 g/min applied material 
flow rate. Also, the initiation of the deep penetration mode is possible, leading to the 
process called “laser deep alloying” [Par07]. This process mode can enable a more 
efficient energy absorptance, wider and deeper tracks, and more rectangular cross-
sectional appearance of the tracks. The challenge arises to enable the added mate­
rial to distribute within the comparably large melt pool during the short duration of 
its existence. The powder particles are distributed by the melt pool convection into 
deeper material sections. Beam shaping techniques, such as beam oscillation, have 
been shown to support the melt mixing and distribution [Vol14].
Large surfaces are treated using multiple tracks next to each other. The hatch 
distance (distance between two tracks) must be chosen to re-melt the desired vol­
ume and to keep the overlap of tracks to a minimum for higher process efficiency. 
Quality criteria applied to evaluate the surfaces are typically the homogeneity of the 
distribution of the elements/particles in the melted surface volume by convection and 
diffusion and mechanical or chemical properties, e.g., wear resistance or corrosion 
resistance.
3.11  LASER CLADDING
Laser cladding is a technique within the surface treatment methods (Figure 3.46). 
The purpose of the process is to locally add material to create a surface layer with 
certain properties. This can be required to change surface properties by adding 
a layer of material or for locally adding material for repairing of worn surfaces. 
Typical surface properties that are intended to be influenced are the hardness, wear, 
and corrosion resistance. Therefore, cladding is typically done as one-layer applica­
tion consisting of multiple tracks next to each other.
The process is based on material addition onto the base material. However, parts 
of the base structure or already-built structure below are melted during processing in 
order to achieve metallurgical bonding. This effect is called dilution. The additional 
material can be applied in the form of wire or powder. Wire application is compara­
bly easy to control. The amount of material incorporated, and the related chemical 
composition of the melt mixture is predictable. However, the wire feeding system can 
make the process direction-dependent, if the wire is not applied coaxially. Powder 

117
Laser Material Processes
can be pre-placed or more typically applied by deposition systems. The powder or 
wire is fed into the melt pool and it liquefies.
Often, surface cladding methods do not require surface preparation before process­
ing. Comparably large laser beam spots on the material’s surfaces are used (1–5 mm 
diameter). Such spots can be either produced by using suitable laser beam guiding and 
forming optics or by using the beam in defocused position. Moreover, beam shaping 
techniques are used to increase the treated surface area per time by increasing the 
molten track width or to avoid local overheating by distributing energy within the spa­
tial intensity distribution to decrease the risk of local overheating, or to create a more 
homogeneous heat input into the materials. Furthermore, process velocity, material 
parameters (powder flow, base material properties), and the hatch distance between the 
tracks define the melt pool dimensions and solidification behavior. The hatch distance 
between the tracks is typically optimum around 50% of the track width. It mainly 
defines the surface waviness of the resulting clad layer. In case the hatch distance is 
too close, bulging can occur, leading to large material accumulations and clad layer 
height variations. At too large distances between the tracks, the material might not fill 
the gaps sufficiently and height variations and even gaps can remain on the surface.
Typical track heights are in the range of 0.05–2 mm per layer at a single-track 
width of 0.1–45 mm using laser powers used in the range of 0.5–6 kW at process 
velocities in the range of 0.1–10 m/min (Figure 3.53). In order to achieve the desired 
surface geometry, post-treatment can be necessary, such as milling.
For powder application, powder feeding systems are used. The systems consist 
of a powder feeder, tubes, and the nozzle at the processing zone. A powder feeder 
has a powder hopper that can be filled with the powder material and spreads the 
powder onto a rotating disk. From those disks, the powder particles are taken and 
guided into the transferring tubes by inert or low-reaction gases to the nozzle at the 
processing head. The tubes and the powder nozzle define the maximum possible gas 
and powder flow.
Powder nozzles can be positioned externally from the side, which is an easy way 
to fix and align the particle flow in relation to the melt pool. The use of coaxial 
powder feeding systems are more typical. Thereby, the laser beam is transferred 
through the center of the nozzle to enable direction-independent and flexible pro­
cessing. The powder speed and divergence of the powder flow define the powder 
capture efficiency and incorporation behavior of the particles into the melt pool. 
The melt pool size on the material’s surface should be larger compared to the par­
ticle flow dimensions to enable the efficient incorporation of powder particles within 
FIGURE 3.53  Geometry of a cladding track.

the whole powder stream. Often, additional shielding gas is used for shielding the 
process zone from the ambient atmosphere. Modern nozzle systems have this option 
already included into the nozzle system. Well-feedable powder sizes in common sys­
tems are in the range of 20–150 µm. Smaller particles can agglomerate and clog the 
tubes and the nozzle. Larger particles are often not foreseen to be guided through the 
nozzle system with its fine internal channels.
From a practical perspective, direct back reflections of the laser beam from shiny 
flat surface into the beam guiding system should be avoided. Back reflections can 
easily occur and go back straight along the laser beam axis, and in worst case, melt 
the fiber ends or even damage the laser machine. Angling of optics, e.g., as done in 
welding operations would decrease the risk of back reflections but can lead to single-
sided effects during the processing due to the related angled powder application. 
When powder is applied, the laser light is typically absorbed and scattered enough to 
avoid back reflections. Therefore, it is recommended to start the process only when 
the powder is flowing to absorb and scatter some of the laser light.
General trends during the cladding process are:
•	 The more powder is applied, the higher is the front inclination angle of the 
melt pool.
•	 Melt pool flows can be directly influenced by the shielding and transport 
gas due to the induced flow momentum or indirectly by altering the surface 
temperature and surface tension gradients and thereby the Marangoni flow.
•	 At too high powder flow rates, the laser beam can be absorbed and scattered 
by the particles [Gas93]. Limited melt pool sizes and the resulting lack of 
fusion can occur due to decreased energy input to the melt pool.
•	 At low powder application (e.g., when the powder flow is interrupted or 
reduced), the laser energy transfer to the base material’s surface can be 
higher than expected. This can induce back reflections from the flat reflec­
tive surface.
•	 Cracks can occur between the substrate and the track during cooling. Stress 
release by thermal cycle control can reduce thermal gradients.
Typical quality criteria of cladded layers are the resulting track geometries, imper­
fections, bonding strength, wear and corrosion resistance properties, and the amount 
of dilution. Dilution denotes the amount of melted base material required to achieve 
the bonding of material to the clad track. There are also clad tracks attached on top 
of a surface similar to brazing processes without melting the base material’s surface 
with the disadvantage of typically lower bonding strengths. Dilution is aimed to be 
minimum for reaching a high-energy efficiency and minimum contamination of the 
added track with base material contaminants that can change the chemical composi­
tion and thereby material properties. Dilution is mainly influenced by the properties 
of a material and laser-material interaction time.
Porosity and notch formations are aimed to be avoided since they can be start­
ing points of cracking at dynamic load. When applying multi-materials or dissimi­
lar materials, brittle intermetallic compounds can be created at the transition zone, 
which can decrease the bonding properties.

119
Laser Material Processes
With improved laser characteristics (e.g., higher power, better focusability, and 
beam shaping) and equipment development (e.g., powder feeding systems), cladding 
in one layer could be expanded to build 3D structures as one technology within AM. 
Complex multi-layer structures have been enabled, which were first used for rapid 
prototyping and later in regular production.
3.12  LASER BEAM ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING OF METALS
Traditionally, manufacturing methods to form the final geometry are mainly based 
on subtractive methods. These include milling, drilling, turning, cutting, or sawing. 
Thereby, material is removed from a bulk material to derive the final shape of the 
part. Larger components are joined combining single subtractive parts. Complexity 
of parts is often limited due to accessibility challenges of subtractive tools. Formative 
processes like forging, forming, or injection molding are rapid methods to create 
a final part shape and are practical for mass production, where the same shape is 
needed to be produced many times. However, there is a very limited possibility to 
customize parts or create complex shapes.
AM is a generative approach to iteratively create the part layer by layer or sec­
tion by section. Thereby, material is only applied where needed. This can reduce 
the material waste and cost for material purchase. Instead of buying a large block 
of high-value material, it is possible to only purchase the material needed for actu­
ally building the part. Parts and components are produced in a generative way with 
“access” to all material steps and the opportunity to include internal structures and 
functional features during the production steps. Such an addition of material as pro­
cess principle can be achieved in many ways using liquid, wire, or powder mate­
rial with different bonding methods. The principal idea of AM is the creation of 
the final part from feedstock material. Different methods have been developed that 
are able to produce parts fulfilling the three Fs: The “form” needs to be correct, 
followed by the “fit” in relation to other parts in a component, and the “function” 
must be fulfilled. Most current methods cannot fulfill these aspects completely, and 
often post-processing is necessary to reach the desired material properties, shapes, 
and functionalities to homogenize the metallurgical structure, remove stresses, or 
achieve the required surface finish.
The first basic functions were already described by the science fiction author 
Arthur C. Clarke in 1964. In 1987, the first stereolithography printer was presented. 
Starting in the 1990s, many technologies arose including fused deposition model­
ing (FDM) for plastic material and selective laser sintering (SLS) for prototyping. It 
took until 2009 when market introduction of desktop printers was achieved. Metal 
printers also appeared in the market and they have been showing high and increas­
ing demand since then. In addition, related businesses appeared focusing on material 
development, powder production, post-heat treatments, surface finishing technolo­
gies, and many more.
The possibilities of metal 3D-printing increased from being a prototyping method 
to direct printing of parts, for repair or even to add functionalities to convention­
ally built structures. Due to decreasing costs for the AM machines, heat sources, 
and feedstock materials, the cost per additive part decreases and it becomes more 

120
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
attractive to produce additive parts compared to conventional subtractive or forma­
tive processes. The main drivers to use AM are:
•	 Possibilities to produce advance geometries including lightweight designs,
•	 Minimizing waste production, less inventory, shorter supply chains,
•	 Part consolidation, combining multiple parts into few, and
•	 Mass customization.
The AM procedure includes many steps from different disciplines, which makes 
the industrial implementation more complicated. It takes time until all experts agree 
on partly revolutionary new procedures and work together. Usually, it is not pos­
sible to produce an additive part the exact same way that a conventionally manufac­
tured part appears. There is usually a new design needed. Depending on the printing 
method, support structures may also be needed to enable printing. Then, there is pre-
processing needed, e.g., to digitally slice the part into different layers and create the 
G-code for machine movement to create the part. Often, printing requires process 
knowledge and adaption of process parameters. After printing, the material must be 
typically heat-treated either for binder removal, homogenization of the microstruc­
ture, or stress relieve. Sometimes, the heat treatment can or must be done during the 
process. In order to achieve the desired surface finish, local machining of surfaces 
is often needed. Layer heights and material properties vary depending on the used 
method and materials.
AM is categorized in seven main categories. The seven principal categories have 
multiple sub-categories and process variations.
1.	Material extrusion: The material application for extrusion-based 3D-printing 
works similar to inkjet printers, while a thermoplastic filament from a coil 
or plastic pellet is fed into a heating system to liquefy. The plastic is then 
extruded through a nozzle. By moving the nozzle and table relative to each 
other, parts can be built layer by layer. Support structures are needed when 
building overhang elements with large angles. Such support structures can 
be built using a second extruder nozzle with a separate support material to 
apply material in the later hollow parts after its removal. This enables the 
printing of the final structure onto material in every layer, even when the 
final part has left out sections. Other possible materials that can be used 
are food or even live cells. Good material properties can be challenging to 
achieve. The applied material usually shows gaps and voids between lay­
ers and tracks. Therefore, tensile strength can be sufficient along the track 
direction but can be very low perpendicular to it. Often crisscross raster 
material application is used to minimize heterogeneity of properties in dif­
ferent directions. Due to thermal treatment, internal thermal stresses can 
occur during the process. Local thermal extension is followed by thermal 
shrinkage. If the shrinkage induces too high stresses in the material, the 
material can bend upward and lead to warping. The print must be inter­
rupted. The process produces little waste and material changes are easy by 

121
Laser Material Processes
just changing the coil or granulate material. Due to the low accuracy and 
surface finish, this process has some disadvantages to be used for critical 
parts. In order to increase bonding strength and reduce anisotropy, layer 
heating is done just before applying the next layer that can improve the 
bonding. A laser beam can be used as a local heat source for pre-heating. 
The part strength can be improved using the local layer pre-heating.
2.	Sheet lamination: This process is based on adding thin metal sheets layer 
by layer. The older method is based on gluing sheets to each other, which 
is called laminated object manufacturing. Ultrasonic consolidation is the 
more common process today. The clamping happens using a sonotrode, 
pressing the sheets together. In addition, the sonotrode rapidly moves with 
ultrasonic vibration, which induces the necessary heat to join the material 
sheets. Due to surface waviness and roughness of the sheets to be con­
nected, the bonding can show voids and gaps that can reduce the mechani­
cal properties. Due to relatively high costs and comparably high effort for 
post-treatment to achieve the final shape, this method became less popular.
3.	Binder jetting: For binder jetting, pre-placed powder is necessary, which 
is prepared layer by layer. The structure is created by jetting a plastic 
binder over the powder layer to locally glue the powder particles together. 
The powder material is typically metal but ceramic or even sand can be 
used. The printing process is done at room temperature, which reduces the 
impact of thermal issues during printing. However, after drying the binder, 
the binder needs to be removed later in the post-processing. The related 
shrinkage during binder removal needs to be considered during the design 
phase to achieve the desired geometry and tolerances. Parts are cured in 
a furnace to become the green part before removing the powder mate­
rial around. This is followed by de-binding of green parts and sintering, 
where the part shrinkage occurs, to reach the final part. Binder jetting is an 
upcoming AM technology. More research and understanding are currently 
necessary before a potential larger implementation in industry. Limitations 
in part size, material availabilities, and low mechanical properties are to 
be overcome.
4.	Vat photopolymerization: A liquid container of resin (thermosets) is used 
as feedstock material. Local illumination with, e.g., an ultraviolet laser 
induces polymerization, a chemical reaction, of the photo-sensitive resin 
and the material becomes locally solid to form the final part layer by layer. 
Plastics and some ceramics are possible to use. Three main process varia­
tions exist: (a) The vector scan or point-wise technique uses a scanning laser 
to create the layers, (b) mask projection can create one whole layer with just 
one illumination step projecting the individual pattern to be solidified in 
one layer through a mask using a laser beam or lamp source in combination 
with an optical element, and (c) the two-photon approach uses the interfer­
ence between two laser beams to locally induce the necessary heat for the 
chemical reaction. The process is relatively fast and accurate with good 
surface finish at a high degree of automation. Support structure design and 

122
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
removal and the correct resin selection limit the possibilities to some extent. 
Material properties are moderate and can even degrade with time.
5.	Material jetting: Using the principle of 2D inkjet printers, materials can 
also be printed in the third dimension by particle deposition. Deposition 
can be achieved using continuous inkjet deposition or particle on demand 
techniques.
6.	Powder bed fusion: The structures are built in a powder bed of pre-placed 
powder particles. Plastics, metals, and sand can be used as feedstock. A 
laser beam or an electron beam scans over the powder layer to locally 
sinter or melt the powder. For plastic sintering, surface tension, viscosity, 
and particle size mainly define the sintering kinetics. Low viscosity and 
low ­particle size encourage the sintering process in general. Challenges 
occur due to thermal impact during the process that can lead to warping 
and material shrinkage. During plastic sintering, no support structures are 
needed in contrast to the metal melting process. Little post-processing is 
typically required if surface finish is not the main quality factor. Powder 
reusability is still a big challenge due to limited knowledge about the deg­
radation of powder, impact of spatter, and accumulation of powder particles 
during the process.
7.	Directed energy deposition: Metals and some ceramics are possible to print 
by blowing powder into a created melt pool. The energy source is typically 
a laser beam or an arc source.
3.12.1  Principles of Laser Additive Manufacturing
In this book, the focus of additive methods will be on the laser-based approaches for 
metal printing. The main principle of AM is the iterative application and melting of 
material, usually layer by layer. Metal-AM is commonly done using powder or wire 
as added materials, while a heat source creates a melt pool in which the material 
incorporates. Thereby, complex structures can be produced that contain, e.g., inner 
structures, overhangs, or undercuts [Bru17]. Every part can be practically custom­
ized. In the design stage, the specific additive requirements need to be considered 
in order to make the part printable. AM enables new designs possibilities, while at 
the same time, the design needs to be adapted in order to use the advantages of the 
new technologies and consider machine and processing constraints. Thereby, com­
ponents that enable the combination of several parts can be manufactured in one 
component and lightweight designs are possible. In addition, multi-material designs 
are possible by applying desired material mixes. Typical materials used for AM are 
Titanium alloys, stainless steels, or Ni- and Co-based alloys.
After the computer aided design (CAD) model development, the part is sliced into 
layers for fabrication (computer aided manufacturing, CAM). In order to translate 
the design information into machine movement, digital twins are used. Advanced 
modeling software is able to include machine and part digital twins. Machine digital 
twins can simulate the movement during the process and enable the detection of 
incorrect robot or CNC-machine movements. In addition, the detection of collisions 
is possible to identify during the design and path planning phase, which can avoid 

123
Laser Material Processes
expensive or even dangerous situations in the real world. When inserting the part 
to be produced in the digital model, the exact path can be visualized, and potential 
mistakes can be identified before printing by experienced users. Detailed knowledge 
about the machine and material behavior is necessary in the design phase, e.g., the 
shrinkage and wetting of the material needs to be correctly included in the path plan­
ning to avoid failures due to wrong nozzle-part-distances due to mistakes in layer 
height assumptions. Advanced slicing software is already available that provides 
adaptive path planning based on in-situ measurements of the actual height and can 
add or remove layers during the process and still achieve the designed part. After the 
design and slicing of the part, the machine-readable code is produced and sent to the 
machine, where the printing happens. Sensors can increase process stability and can 
detect failures. This is particularly of interest when building large parts. Either the 
production can be stopped when the failure occurs, saving time and money to print 
the entire part or the operator has the possibility to repair the failure before continu­
ation of the automatic program.
The big advantage of AM is that geometric complexity can be added to the 
design at no extra cost. There is no tooling required (little starting costs) compared 
to, e.g., casting (molds are expensive). Reduced material need can be achieved by 
the new design possibilities, where material is placed and added only where needed 
from the load constraints of the structure. Repair applications can enable the reduc­
tion of metal waste, while often, the added structures show even higher perfor­
mances than the original part. The main advantage of additive processes compared 
to subtractive methods is that there is a minimum waste material produced since 
the material is positioned and built where needed, while unused powder can (par­
tially) be reused.
The main processing quality criterion is the production of defect-free volumes. 
However, porosity and material losses due to spattering can occur during processing 
and need to be avoided. Another challenge in multi-layer processing are the multiple 
thermal treatments of the volume elements in the structure that lead to complex 
microstructural developments and locally varying material properties.
For metal printing, both SLS and melting-based approaches can be used. For the 
sintering approach, a multi-component system is applied consisting of a high melt­
ing metal component in the form of powder and a low melting binder. During the 
process, the binder melts and the non-melted metal material sinters. Most applied 
metal additive methods based on laser illumination are the directed energy deposi­
tion (DED) and laser powder bed fusion processes, which are based on material 
melting and adding material to a melt pool.
3.12.2  Directed Energy Deposition
DED, also known as direct metal deposition (DMD), direct laser deposition (DLD), 
or laser metal deposition (LMD), uses powder or wire material for local incorpo­
ration into the laser-induced melt pool and thereby iteratively building structures. 
In this chapter, the DED process with laser beam for metals (DED-LB/M) will be 
described as one of many DED processes. This technology finds its main applica­
tions in building large structures or in repair works.

124
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
3.12.2.1  Processing Setup
Material is applied in the form of powder or wire, while the laser beam energy melts 
the additional material and partially the base material to create bonding. The mate­
rial feedstock is typically applied continuously. The principle is close to a weld­
ing or re-melting process, while adding material into the created melt pools. Dense 
coatings, which are metallurgically bonded to the substrate can be achieved. When 
applying multiple tracks next to each other and on top of each other, complex 2D and 
3D structures can be created. A large spectrum of materials can be used. Typical 
examples of powder materials used in DED are titanium, Inconel, stainless steel, 
copper, and aluminum alloys.
Different material application systems are possible. Lateral nozzles are easy-to-
build and to use. Therefore, such a setup can be cheap, but is direction-dependent. 
This means that when building in different axial directions, the powder flow is 
applied onto the melt pool from different angles, which can influence the powder 
incorporation and thereby the track quality and height.
Therefore, usually coaxial nozzles are used for powder-DED (Figure 3.54a). They 
enable the direction-independent powder application and more efficient powder 
incorporation. The powder is guided and focused onto the material’s surface by a 
powder nozzle. Complex inner designs of powder guiding inside the nozzle have 
been developed in order to provide a radially homogeneous powder flow. The laser 
beam is guided through the center of the nozzle and produces the melt pool in which 
the powder particles incorporate (Figure 3.54b). In many nozzles, a protection gas 
flow is used in addition to the transport gas flow that guides the powder. This addi­
tional shielding protects the process zone from oxidation.
The achievable building rates and related building speeds depend on several fac­
tors. The amount of material that the powder feeding system can provide through 
the equipment can be a limiting factor. In addition, the size of powder or wire 
material and the properties of the laser sources used can limit the achievable build 
rates. The laser power can be set to over 20 kW for high deposition rate processes 
with large spot sizes (over 10 mm in diameter). Other processes require only a few 
FIGURE 3.54  (a) Setup for blown powder processing and (b) sketch of the powder-DED 
process.

125
Laser Material Processes
hundred Watts for precision deposition processes using small spot sizes (few hun­
dred µm) [Dem18].
The DED process requires several equipment to enable the processing. A laser 
system is needed, including fiber optics, to control and guide the laser beam to the 
processing zone. The feeding nozzle transports the powder or wire. Coaxial nozzles 
also leave the space to transfer the laser beam through its center. The powder or wire 
feeder transfers the feedstock material to the nozzle. Powder feeders typically use 
filled hoppers that release the powder onto a rotating table with a groove. From this 
groove, the powder is collected, and the transport gas leads it through the tubes to the 
powder nozzle. Multiple hoppers in combination with multiple inlets into the nozzle 
enable the mixing of different powders for in-situ alloying or creation of graded 
structures. A CNC or robot system enables the relative movement between the optic 
with nozzle and the part. Typical particle speeds used to transfer the powder particles 
are between 1 m/s and 4 m/s [Pra18].
3.12.2.2  Laser Energy Absorption and Material Interaction
Laser beam absorption during the DED process is still difficult to predict. Depending 
on the laser beam size and the induced size of the melt pool, the laser beam can illu­
minate the powder material, the liquid melt pool, the structure underneath, or the 
solidifying track. All these surfaces have a different surface roughness and atomic 
structure. Therefore, the absorption is different. In addition, absorption varies with 
temperature as well, while different dependencies can occur. The temperature 
dependency of most materials is still unknown, in particular, at high temperatures 
as they are reached in metal melt pools. Since the melt pools and also the resulting 
track surfaces show rounded shapes, the angle-dependence of the absorption needs 
to be considered as well. Although typically unwanted, local vaporization can occur 
on the melt surface, which can induce dynamic melt pool behavior leading to spat­
tering or pore formation or even reduce the laser light transmission due to laser light 
absorption in the vapor.
In general, the knowledge about material properties of the used materials for 
DED is essential but is still not fully available. The material defines not only the 
absorption of laser energy, but also thermal conductivity of the heat being trans­
ferred. The higher the thermal conductivity, the less energy is available to create the 
melt pool, e.g., when depositing copper powder on copper base material, the melt 
pool is comparably small due to the excellent heat conductivity of the copper base 
material. Copper applied on steel substrate shows larger melt pools [Pra20]. The 
material also defines the melt pool size, melt flow, and the incorporation behavior.
3.12.2.2.1  DED Materials and Transfer
The diameter size range of powder materials used for DED processes is typically 
between 50 µm and 200 µm. The processing results can vary depending on the used 
powder size distribution and powder feed rate (Figure 3.55).
The powder is transferred through powder nozzle, while the powder stream focus­
ing depends on the powder nozzle and powder material. For efficient powder delivery 
and the avoidance of clogging the powder feed system, good powder flowability is 
required, which makes the use of spherical powders preferable. However, the use of 

126
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
used powder containing, e.g., agglomerates is explored to a great extent in order to 
minimize waste production and enable efficient material re-use. Often, powder can 
be re-used for applications with lower requirements on the chemical composition 
or part performance. However, used or recycled powder can influence the process 
behavior and process outcome, in particular, the formation of porosity (Figure 3.56).
The powder particles are released from the nozzle being directed toward the pro-
cessing zone. In conventional powder DED, the powder particles only interact with 
the laser beam for a short period of time and are slightly heated but do not reach 
melting temperatures. Therefore, powder particles are solid when they arrive on the 
melt pool. There are process variants for high-speed cladding, where the powder 
particles are liquefied in a laser beam of high intensity and then sprayed onto the 
structure.

distributions and (b) powder feed rates.
FIGURE 3.56  Cross-sectional views of DED walls with differently treated powder.

127
Laser Material Processes
The deposition rates for the laser DED processes can vary depending on the 
process setup and deposited material from less than 100 g/h to several kilograms 
per hour [Pra20, Zha10]. High-speed laser cladding could achieve 2 kg/h [Zho15]. 
When using combinations of heat sources, like laser-arc-processes, build-up rates of 
18 kg/h have been demonstrated [Now15]. The lateral resolutions cover the ranges 
between 30 µm and 5 mm, while the part sizes are, in general, not limited.
3.12.2.3  Impact of Process Parameters
Process parameters need to be adapted to the material used and the required dimen­
sions. The energy input can be varied using laser power, process speed, or focus posi­
tion. The laser power is one of the main parameters to alter the laser beam intensity 
(Figure 3.57).
The process speed defines the energy input per time or distance (Figure 3.58).
Together, the laser power and process speed define the line energy input. A high 
line energy leads to larger and deeper melt pools. In general, a faster incorporation 
of powder particles can be expected due to more rapid powder heating when they 
landed on the melt pool and a reduced surface tension of the melt pool at higher 
surface temperatures. Low energy input can lead to lack of fusion and production 
of voids. The powder feed rate mainly defines the height of the tracks produced. 
However, indirectly, the depth of the clad track is affected since the applied laser 
energy is needed to melt the powder, which reduces the available energy for dilution. 
A laminar flow from the powder nozzle is typically desired to avoid oxygen con­
tamination of the processing zone. Both too high and too low flow rates can induce 
turbulent flows leading to an increased oxygen content around the melt pool. Another 
important parameter in DED is the hatch distance. The hatch distance defines the 
overlap between the applied tracks. A certain overlap is needed to create a proper 
structure. Too low distance between the tracks, or small hatch distances, can lead to 
wavy occurrence of the applied structure, while too high chosen hatch distances can 
lead to melt accumulation due to the strong surface tension effect leading to balling 
of the added tracks. Often a good starting point is a 50% hatch distance to create 
surfaces with minimum waviness.
3.12.2.4  Powder Particle Incorporation
Figure 3.59 shows high-speed images of the melt pool and the incorporation of pow­
der particles. The transported particles from the nozzle are directed toward the melt 
pool. It should be aimed to have the powder focus positioned on the material melt 
pool surface in order to make particles hit the molten material. Some particles will 
collide during the path from the nozzle to the melt pool and change direction. They 
might be directed to solid surfaces such as the base material structure or the solidi­
fied track, and will be lost for the process. In addition, the loose particles need to be 
caught by an exhaust system to avoid air contamination and humans inhaling such 
particles. The catchment efficiency of the process can be high up to 98%. This is 
possible, when the melt pool is large enough, particles are correctly directed onto the 
melt pool, and the melt pool shows minimum oxide coverage that might avoid the 
incorporation. Most steels show a limited oxide layer appearance on the melt pool 
surface, while, e.g., on aluminum alloys, continuous coverage is possible that limits

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
the amount of material to be added. It can be seen that all particles that land on 
the melt pool are incorporated. Depending on their landing zone, the particles float 
on the melt pool before incorporation [Vol18b]. The densities of powder material 
and melt pools define the incorporation duration and characteristics. Some alloy­
ing elements can increase the wettability, and a rapid incorporation is possible. The 
Marangoni flow induced by the temperature-dependent surface tension is the main 
melt flow generator and defines the floating path of powder particles. In case of land­
ing in the mushy zone of a melt pool, the particles can remain as surface roughness 
on the track.
Besides powder material as a feedstock material for laser-DED, a wire can be 
used to add material to the process zone. Wire can be fed by a lateral wire feeding 
or coaxially. In a coaxial setup, the laser beam needs to be guided around the wire 
feeding system using beam shaping optics. The use of a wire enables a reduction in 
material waste compared to powder feeding where powder particles can ricochet and 
are lost for the processing. Another reason of using a wire is the good availability 
of wires. Basically, all welding wires can be used for DED. However, not all wire 
materials show good processability in DED due to the more complex heat treatment 
compared to welding processes. Nowadays, wire materials are increasingly devel­
oped that are better suitable for DED.
3.12.2.5  DED Heat Sources
Laser beams are not the only possible heat source to be used for DED. Arc welding 
machines provide the possibility to generate tracks using metal wire application. The 
wire is melted by an electric arc and transferred into a melt pool. The process is very 
similar to arc welding but is called wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) when 
used to build structures. WAAM is therefore a well-established and relatively robust 
process. Typically, the metal inert gas (MIG) process is used, along with the use of the 
tungsten inert gas (TIG) or plasma processes, e.g., when processing titanium. When 
using the MIG process, where wire is used to produce electric arc, the process is 
direction-independent. Using a robot system, very complex structures can be pro­
duced. Compared to laser-DED, WAAM shows typically higher deposition rates and 
lower investment due to relatively cheap heat source equipment. However, the built 
structures show rougher surfaces, which require post-processing like milling of the 
edges. Arc sources also introduce a comparably high heat input, which can lead to 
distortion and overheating issues of the structure. Wider tracks are usually produced, 
and slower processing speeds need to be used. Similar to welding, DED can also be 
conducted using combined heat sources of laser and arc, resulting in a hybrid process.
3.12.2.6  Imperfections and Monitoring
The typical imperfections occurring during DED are similar to the heat conduction 
welding defects. Since no keyhole is produced, the DED melt pools are usually calm 
with limited dynamics. However, local ejections can occur, e.g., from gases of low-
boiling elements that form in the melt pool and escape, local overheating and ejec­
tion of oxide skin parts, or sudden melt flow accelerations. Such spatters can induce 
a material loss and even damage equipment. In addition, spatter can land and solidify 
on the previously built structure and form unwanted surface structures.

131
Laser Material Processes
As in most thermal processes, hot cracks can occur during cooling in the mushy 
zone. They can form along or perpendicular to the track deposition direction and 
depend on the material properties. Residual stresses induce such cracks supported 
by alloying elements that form intermetallic compounds. Oxide skins can reduce the 
bonding strength between layers [Hau21]. The heat input can lead to deformations 
(Figure 3.60).
Due to the complexity of the process, results can vary, which makes the pro­
cess monitoring relevant and partly mandatory in order to achieve the part quality 
requirements. Until now, process monitoring is often used for the detection of irregu­
larities and a manual adaption of the processing. Control systems are increasingly 
developed that can alter the processing parameters when certain sensor data detect 
irregularities. Immediate adaptions of process parameters during the processing can 
directly heal a pore or lack of fusion. Process parameter adaption for locally adapted 
energy input during the next layer can compensate for the defects as well.
The processing zone offers multiple emissions that can be used for monitoring 
and control. Acoustic emissions provide information about the melt pool dynamics, 
while light emissions contain melt pool and track dimensions as well as temperature 
data. Even vapor emissions can give indications about the process stability.
•	 Acoustic emission measurements have started to become more popular for 
process monitoring. The challenge of typically noisy environments needs 
to be solved or considered in the measurements to avoid false alarms. Air-
borne or structure-borne acoustic emissions can be recorded using micro­
phones [Hau22].
•	 Light emission detectors are often used. Visual cameras can detect and 
monitor the melt pool dimensions over time and warn about dimension 
changes that can indicate defects. Increased dimensions can, e.g., indicate 
overheating due to a lack of fusion. Due to high costs, high-speed cam­
eras are common for research purposes and give insight into the melt pool 
FIGURE 3.60  Sheet deformations at single-line DED track deposition at different values 
of laser power.

132

behavior, spattering, and vapor characteristics. Spectral analysis offers the 
possibility to detect temperature and radiation intensity peaks that can be 
related to certain ionization lines of elements. Thereby, e.g., the composi­
tion of the vapor can be monitored [Vol23a].
•	 Optical coherence tomography has become more attractive for monitor­
ing purposes [Kog20]. High-frequency recording of distances enables the 
online detection of height variations. This can be used for melt pool height 
monitoring. When scanning the measuring system, the pre-measurement 
of the appearance of the structure before applying the next layer can be 
detected, which enables the adaption of the path planning in-situ. For qual­
ity control purposes, topology of the solidified track can be performed.
•	 Thermal monitoring becomes very relevant in additive processes due to 
intrinsic and partly complex thermal developments. For a sufficient heat 
management, thermal process data are needed. Thermal data can indicate 
melt pool behavior and even pore formation or lack of fusion to the layer 
underneath. When heat dissipation changes, the temperature field on the 
material’s surface will change.
Sensors can be mounted in different ways. Height detection systems or thermal 
imaging cameras are typically fixed off-axis, while visual and some thermal imag­
ing can be done coaxially.
Production is still organized in the way that quality control of parts is done after 
the production process. Either selected or even all produced parts go through quality 
control and testing. In AM processes, it is now also possible to monitor and check 
the quality during the process. Such procedures take some time until implemented 
but show high potential for saving quality control time. Current research efforts aim 
to make the monitoring and control systems reliable and robust. That way, control 
systems can be developed to ensure part quality by process monitoring and in-situ 
corrections. For detection of defects in sensor data and enabling control loops with 
rapid decision-making, machine learning algorithms can be useful to include.
After completion of the part production, often post-processing is necessary to 
achieve the final part shape. For post-processing, advanced machines offer the pos­
sibility to process the additive part in the same cabin to produce the final net shape 
using subtractive methods [Kar10].
3.12.2.7  DED Applications
Typical applications of laser DED can be found where functional features or struc­
tures are needed to be added to the existing parts in order to avoid machining of 
larger blocks. Furthermore, in the field of part repair and remanufacturing, DED 
shows advantages and high potentials, in particular, with regard to limited available 
material sources and sustainability goals. In particular, high-value material repair 
shows the highest user potential and economic benefits. DED also offers the possibil­
ity to place different materials in the same part by changing the feedstock material. 
This can be done, e.g., using multiple wire feeders or several hoppers for powder 
feeding or combinations of both. Due to typically rough surfaces of the built struc­
tures, often post-processing is needed in the form of machining selected surfaces to 

133
Laser Material Processes
achieve the required surface finish. In addition, heat treatment of the material might 
be needed to relief stresses and homogenize the material due to possibly occurring 
undesired local microstructural developments during multiple heat treatments.
3.12.3  Laser Powder Bed Fusion
Powder bed fusion (PBF), also known as selective laser melting (SLM) or laser metal 
fusion, is a powder bed-based additive technology. The PBF process with a laser 
beam of metals (PBF-LB/M) is described here.
3.12.3.1  Process Principle
The pre-placed powder is locally melted and fused to the structure underneath. By 
applying powder layer by layer and local melting of the material, complex structures 
can be produced (Figure 3.61).
Here, 3D CAD-models of the parts are needed. The design must fulfill several 
criteria to be used for building in PBF machines, e.g., support structures are needed 
when building complex overhang elements. After design, a digital part needs to be 
virtually sliced in layers. This information is used by the machine to calculate the 
laser paths for each individual layer.
After application of the powder layer of a defined height, the laser locally melts 
the material, before the powder bed is lowered, and the powder application starts 
again. This procedure is repeated until the whole part is produced. The powder sizes 
used for metal PBF are typically in the range of 20–60 µm. These particles are 
FIGURE 3.61  Principle of automated powder bed additive manufacturing (AM).

134
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
very small and can cause damage in human bodies when entered the lungs. Some 
of those particles can even enter the body through skin pores. Therefore, sufficient 
safety measures are needed to handle the powder in a safe way. In particular, alloys 
containing hazardous elements should be treated with care. For better spreadability 
during the powder layer filling, spherical powders are usually preferred. However, 
these powders are often expensive, and the use of non-spherical powders is under 
investigation.
Powder layers are automatically applied by most industrial machines. Thereby, 
the build plate is lowered, and new powder is added on top of the previous layer. 
The build plate lowering can be defined by defining the layer height. However, it 
needs to be considered that the actual height of the produced tracks is not the same 
as the programmed layer height. Due to powder material loss as well as track wet­
ting and shrinkage, the track height is lower than the previous powder layer height. 
Due to melting of powder particles, gaps between the powder particles disappear, 
which reduces the volume. Therefore, the powder layer height varies between the 
layers. The very first layer has exactly the programmed height. After processing 
the first layer, the build plate is lowered but the new layer height plus the distance 
from the track surface to the intended first layer height needs to be filled as well. 
Theoretically, every layer should be programmed with different laser parameters 
to account for the different amount of available powder. This is typically not done 
in actual PBF machines, and conservative parameters are used to guarantee the 
powder melting even when more powder is available. This variation also explains 
some machine producer recommendations. Sometimes, the powder layer height 
is recommended to be smaller than the larger particles in the powder size distri­
bution, e.g., if 40 µm powder layer height is programmed, the particles >40 µm 
should be removed by the scraper during the application of a powder layer. Due to 
the described effects of requiring larger powder layers, larger powder particles can 
be used as well.
3.12.3.2  Laser Energy Absorption and Material Interaction
The laser light absorption can be complex due to variation in surface properties the 
laser beam illuminates. In DED, the main absorbing surface is the melt pool. In PBF, 
the laser beam is scanned very quickly over the powder bed, which forms much 
smaller single tracks. Therefore, the laser beam can also be absorbed by the structure 
in front or the powder. Powder material is known to absorb more laser light due to 
the effect of multiple reflections and absorption on the surface consisting of many 
powder particles [Kho22]. These absorption variations can be one cause for the vary­
ing heat input and process dynamics.
Figure 3.62 illustrates that the powder bed processes show an inherent dynamic 
behavior leading to powder particle ejections and a redistribution of powder on the 
powder bed.
During processing, extensive spattering and powder particle movement was 
observed (e.g., [Yad10]). Figure 3.63 shows the PBF process in a detailed high-speed 
imaging sequence. Accumulations of powder particles occur in front and on the sides 
of the melt pool, which can incorporate into the melt pool when moving forward but 
can also remain on the material’s surface. Thermally induced gas flows can initiate 

135
Laser Material Processes
the powder particle movement on the powder bed surface toward the melt pool. This 
denudation effect leads to a redistribution of powder and varying powder amounts 
for the subsequent tracks in the actual layer.
Material ejections from the processing zone may involve non-melted particles that 
are accelerated by gas or vapor flow [Bid18] or melt ejections. This effect can also 
lead to a redistribution of material on the powder bed surface. Since accumulated 
powder particles are partially ejected, not only the amount of powder particles on 
the powder bed surface can vary but also the size distribution can differ. In addition, 
the comparably large agglomerates can lead to difficulties for the scraper to add the 
next powder layer. Both agglomerates and spatters that land on the powder bed can 
show different properties. Laser light absorption of, e.g., oxidized particles can vary, 
leading to variations in energy input and increased process dynamics. In addition, 
the previous heat treatment can lead to unwanted oxide inclusion into the subsequent 
tracks when those particles are incorporated into the next tracks and layers.

High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
3.12.3.3  Track Appearances
The geometry of the single tracks depends on several factors. In general, the tracks 
show cross-sectional shapes comparable to heat conduction welding tracks. Some 
PBF machines operate at higher laser beam intensities and can induce keyholes, which 
lead to deeper and wider tracks. Depending on the conditions, the track dimensions 
and positions can vary. When powder is available, the tracks appear at a higher posi­
tion, since most of the energy input is needed to melt and add the powder material. 
Denudation effects can lead to variations in powder availability. Denudation during 
the application of one track reduces the available powder around the track. This can 
happen due to induced gas and vapor flows during the processing, which induce the 
powder to move. It could be shown that the powder material availability influences 
the processing and the track dimensions [Vol19b]. It is possible that some tracks have 
no powder available to incorporate. These tracks appear mainly in the base struc­
ture and just re-melt the already processed part without adding material. Therefore, 
the track dimensions can vary within the same layer (Figure 3.64). Of course, such 
energy input without adding material is inefficient and should be avoided. However, 
re-melting can also heal defects that occurred in previous layers, e.g. porosity.
These variations usually lead to the use of conservative processing parameters 
in order to avoid inclusions, lack of fusion, and porosity. The high-energy input has 
been shown to lead to several re-melting cycles of the same material when build­
ing a structure [Mis18], which increase the energy used for the process. It has been 
seen that the same material can be re-melted up to seven times with typical process 
parameters.
In order to avoid irregularities, different laser beam scanning methods are used in 
powder bed processes. Thereby, the scanning direction can be changed in each layer, 
e.g., linear in one direction, zig-zag, or in spirals [Win17]. Xu et al. [Xu17] dem­
onstrated, e.g., uniform 5 × 5 (tracks × layers) block samples. The change in such 
processing directions in each layer can reduce the influence of directional defects or 
inhomogeneous material properties.
Another important factor is the overlapping of the single tracks. This hatch distance 
has been found to induce variations in the track geometry and surface morphology 
FIGURE 3.64  (a) Calculated track dimensions in one layer depending on varying powder 
availability and (b) cross section of an additively built cube [Vol19b].

137
Laser Material Processes
[Yad11]. Also, the scanning speed and power density of the laser beam impact the 
final metallurgy, part geometry, and accuracy. Sufficient energy is required to melt 
powder particles and enable bonding to the previously built structure, while exces­
sive energy input can lead to turbulences and heat accumulations. For comparison 
of energy input, in PBF-LB, the energy density is often used relating the laser power 
(in Watt) to the scanning speed (in millimeter per second), hatch distance (in mil­
limeter), and layer thickness (in millimeter).
3.12.3.4  Material Properties
The material and part properties after printing depend on most material and process 
parameters. Part properties can significantly vary when using different build direc­
tions and energy densities. Material properties are defined by cooling conditions 
and multiple thermal cycles. Laser-related parameters are primarily the laser power 
(typical range from a few Watts to 500 W), laser spot size on the material (around 
80 µm), and pulse parameters (pulse duration and frequency if pulsed lasers are 
used). Scanning parameters are the scan speed, hatch distance, and the used scan 
pattern. Powder type and material properties are main influencing factors on part 
appearance. Particle shapes, sizes and size distributions, the powder bed density, and 
the layer thickness need to be optimized for successful processing. Furthermore, the 
pre-heating temperature of the powder bed can influence the processing and result­
ing material properties.
3.12.3.5  Powder Recycling
In order to provide high-quality parts, often virgin powder is preferred for produc­
tion. However, the used powder can be re-used. Due to the thermal character of the 
process, the powder material that does not become part of the structure can be ther­
mally influenced. Also spatters or agglomerated particles can remain in the powder. 
Since oxidation can happen during heating of powder particles and microstructural 
changes can be induced, the characteristic of the used powder is often not completely 
clear. Standard procedures often include the mixing of used and fresh powder for 
a few times until the powder is considered to be waste. Both the effect of different 
heat treatments of powder particles and the impact of those particles on the process 
and part quality are ongoing research fields. It has been shown that used powder 
contains more oxides, which are transferred into the melt pool and can increase the 
melt pool oxide coverage, leading to reduced material incorporation and increased 
defect occurrence.
3.12.3.6  Process Monitoring and Defects
Process monitoring can help to limit defect production. Most industrial machines 
have multiple monitoring systems integrated, e.g., the gas composition and flow in 
the build chamber are well-controlled, which avoid many contamination effects and 
transport spatter immediately away. Often, the build plate temperature is controlled 
as well to maintain constant conditions during the building.
However, in order to get immediate feedback on the track quality, additional sen­
sors are needed. Some systems allow the coaxial visual observation during the pro­
cessing. A visual camera can observe the melt pool during the processing and detect 

138
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
variations in its dimensions. Thermal imaging is highly desired to detect overheating 
or defects that induce surface temperature changes. Such systems are typically more 
difficult to integrate into industrial systems at the moment. Thermal measurements 
can also be conducted between the processing of the layers to check for unexpected 
temperature fields of the whole powder surface. These systems can also be integrated 
as coaxial systems.
In order to alter the process and minimize defect creations, beam shaping meth­
ods are increasingly investigated. Certain beam shapes offer a more homogeneous 
energy input and potentially less spattering and denudation effects. Some PBF 
machines allow the integration of beam shaping equipment into the laser beam path. 
However, the field of beam shaping for PBF is under investigation.
3.12.3.7  Systems and Post-Treatments
The industrially available machines use similar parameters for processing. These 
are based on applying comparably small powder size distributions and illuminating 
with low laser power ranges using fast scanning. However, it has been shown that 
PBF-LB/M at very high laser power is also possible, e.g., at 16 kW [Lei21]. Such new 
ideas and process variations can support the flexibility and range of applications for 
AM methods in the future.
For some applications, post-treatment using subtractive methods is necessary to 
achieve the final part shape. Due to the extensive and repeated heat treatment, post-
heat-treatment can be necessary.
Although PBF is widely used and has been proven to be a promising technology 
to build parts and structures of complex designs at high build-up rates or high preci­
sion, the process must be further understood and optimized for increased material 
and energy efficiency. Compared to DED, in general, PBF shows higher accuracy at 
lower building rates.
3.12.4  Powder Sheet Additive Manufacturing
In the field of AM, many process variations are continuously developed solving 
drawbacks of the original idea with advanced technical ideas, e.g., the process dura­
tion can be decreased when using multiple laser heat sources in PBF-LB/M at the 
same time.
One variation in laser-based AM is the MAPS (metal additive manufacturing 
using powder sheets) approach [Lup22]. The process uses powder sheets instead of 
loose powder as feedstock. Since powder particles used for metal powder AM tech­
niques are comparably small, precautions are necessary to protect human health. 
When using powder sheets, the powder is fixed in the sheet and the workers are not 
exposed to the powder.
In order to create powder sheets, powder needs to be embedded into sheets. 
Therefore, a polymer binder is used. The powder particles are pre-mixed with the 
binder and a solvent. This way, the slurry can be deposited on a flexible teflon sheet to 
form the sheet. The solvent quickly vaporizes and the binder acts as a glue to join the 
powder particles. This is an additional process step in the powder feedstock produc­
tion but is expected to add minor costs. The advantage of the provision of the powder 
material incorporated in the sheet is that the powder flowability plays a minor role 

139
Laser Material Processes
in the delivery of powder for laser processing. Therefore, nearly all kinds of powder 
size distributions and powder shapes can be used. During powder atomization, lots 
of efforts are needed to create the desired powder size distributions. Often, the pow­
der sizes that are produced in the atomizer and do not fit the size requirements are 
sieved and even denote waste. The integration into powder sheets offers the possibil­
ity for increasing the ranges of powder size that can be used for AM processes and 
reduce waste. In addition, there is the possibility to use non-spherical powders from 
cheaper atomization processes, e.g., water atomization instead of gas atomization 
[Fed20]. The sheets can be produced as long stripes.
The powder sheets show a specific appearance due to the production process. 
During the vaporization of the solvent, the binder sinks within the powder sheet and 
accumulates on the lower part of the sheet. Therefore, the bottom sheet side appears 
relatively smooth, while the top side is dominated by the roughness due to sticking 
out of the powder material. Using the powder or binder side up during the processing 
can influence the processing.
When powder sheets are produced, they are placed on top of the base material 
sheet, similar to adding a layer for the PBF process. When one layer is processed by 
the laser beam, the sheet is moved by a roller system to the next position to provide 
the material for the next layer. The principle is similar to sheet lamination processes 
with respect to feedstock provision. Two variants using the laser beam are possible. 
On the one hand, laser beam scanning can be used, similar to the layer produc­
tion during PBF systems, which requires the programming of the scan pattern for 
each layer. On the other hand, a new variant opens new processing possibilities. 
When using larger laser spots at high power, thick sheets can also be processed. 
This enables the application of more material at a time and therefore higher build-up 
rates. In both cases, shielding of the process zone is recommended to avoid oxidation 
effects. When a laser beam illuminates the powder sheet, the binder vaporizes at low 
temperatures, releasing the powder particles. These are then molten and incorpo­
rated into the created melt pool.
As mentioned, the decision of using a binder or powder side being illuminated 
by a laser beam can alter the process. A larger vapor plume is created toward the 
illuminated powder sheet direction when the binder side is on top. Since the binder 
creates vapor, vapor pressure is created that needs to escape from the processing 
zone and can eject powder particles as well, which are then lost for processing the 
additive track. Binder residues have been found on the powder sheets after process­
ing [Vol23f]. These are condensed binder material from the laser illumination. In 
general, the powder sheets can be easily re-used. Adding solvents enables the for­
mation of slurry again and a new deposition of sheets. The impact of the remaining 
binder residues might need to be considered when re-using the powder sheets with 
respect to their possible impact on the processing.
3.12.5  Part Disassembling Using Laser Beams
Parts and components produced with additive methods become more complex. 
However, the complexity is not limited to the geometrical shape, moving elements, 
or inner structures. Multi-material designs become more feasible, and many material 
combinations are possible. Due to the nature of AM having access to basically every 

140
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
volume element, different materials can be integrated into parts. This can help in 
reducing weight by just having more material or material of higher strength at criti­
cal sections or enabling a graded transfer of properties using graded structures from 
one material to another.
However, when using multi-materials or even dissimilar materials in one part, 
the disassembling after the part’s lifetime becomes challenging. When dissimilar 
materials are used, the materials end up in the same recycling route, which can lead 
to contaminations that are difficult to separate. In order to enable the separation of 
additive parts before sorting and melting, a laser-based process has been developed 
that basically enables “reverse” AM [Sam17]. The CYCLAM (reCYCling by laser 
ablation to feed additive manufacturing) process uses a high-intense laser beam to 
locally create a melt pool and recoil pressure from vaporization similar to the remote 
cutting process. That way, material can be gained from a larger part or component 
by controlled ejections. Powder particles can be either collected for further use in 
powder-based processes or even be transferred to a new track for directly building a 
new additive part (Figure 3.65).
3.12.6  When to Use AM?
AM methods are beneficial when high geometrical complexity is needed and cus­
tomized parts are in focus of manufacturing since every part can be produced in 
different ways. When the number of parts to be produced is high and the complexity 
of the parts is low, conventional methods are often the better economic choice. Some 
additive methods are limited to the maximum build volume. However, these building 
possibilities increase all the time, e.g., DED processes show the capability of produc­
ing large freeform parts.
The main drivers that push the AM technologies forward are as follows:
•	 Design opportunities: Engineers and designers value the possibilities of part 
integration/consolidation. Fewer parts are needed for building components, 
while less inventory is necessary. Faster assembly at shorter supply chains 
FIGURE 3.65  Sketches of the direct recycling approach used (a) for powder production 
for easy separation of multi-materials and (b) for direct part production from waste sheets to 
avoid recycling steps.

141
Laser Material Processes
is possible, leading to reduced costs and lower chances of making mistakes. 
Lightweight design and the possibility to add features and functionalities 
enable improved products. Rapid adaption to changed demands is possible 
due to flexible processes.
•	 Business opportunities: From a business perspective, the reduced supply 
chain, reduced inventory, and reduced downtimes due to increased reliabil­
ity can lead to significant cost reductions. In addition, typically less labor 
cost is needed for printing parts and less material needs to be purchased. 
The reduction in complex production methods limits the risk of failures and 
customer complaints also that can lead to costly replacement or even court 
cases. Flexibility also offers an access to very different markets using the 
same AM technologies.
•	 Customers: Customers benefit from individualized and customized parts 
and reduced costs of products.
In the medical field, AM shows large potential. For visualization, body parts, e.g., 
organs or arteria can be modeled, surgical tools can be optimized, prothesis can be 
customized to the person, and implants can be individually created. There are even 
biodegradable implants that disappear, e.g., during the regrowth of a bone, reducing 
the number of surgeries necessary.
The aerospace industry was one of the first drivers of AM due to comparably 
small number of parts to be produced and high level of customization of parts. 
Additively created satellite parts are already flying; engine parts are consolidated 
and made more efficient and lightweight.
The automotive industry started a bit later with AM, since for mass production 
often conventional methods are more efficient and economical. However, additive 
parts are increasingly produced with AM. The main challenge is the certification of 
those parts.
Prototyping and product development can benefit from rapid manufacturing and 
testing of parts with low costs. In addition, AM can be beneficial when special mate­
rials are needed that are hard to process other ways, e.g., high heat resistance materi­
als or materials embedded with metal, ceramic, wood, or carbon fibers. A wide range 
of properties are possible to create, e.g., high strength, stiffness, or biocompatibility.
Additive processes can still take more time compared to conventional manufac­
turing methods. Therefore, AM is mainly used when high precision is necessary, 
designs are not possible to be produced with conventional methods, or high-value 
material needs to be processed. Processing speed can be increased, e.g., by using 
several lasers for parallel working on one powder bed.
It needs to be considered that constraints can occur regarding the direction depen­
dence of properties due to the building strategy. The process is comparably slow 
and can show restrictions in mass production and high costs for the parts, although 
high quality can be achieved. Depending on the process and feeding material, the 
accuracy and tolerances can vary. Often post-processing is required, which is an 
additional cost factor.
Research efforts are in progress to learn more about the properties of the final 
parts that have been produced by additive methods. For industrial implications, 

142
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
relevant material analysis is often missing for a reliable prediction of the lifetime 
behavior of the part.
The cost of AM parts depends on the consumable time to print and post-process­
ing (support removal, surface finishing). The cost per part for different manufactur­
ing approaches is shown in Figure 3.66.
3.13  RESEARCH TOPICS
Research is conducted in most fields described in this book. Based on new advances 
in laser developments and process understanding, process improvements and new 
processing possibilities can arise. This last section gives a brief overview of the cur­
rent research topics and developments without claim of completeness.
3.13.1  Laser Developments
Pulsed laser developments are opening new possibilities. Ultrashort pulse lasers 
are getting more compact and easier to use, and integrate into production facili­
ties. Industrial applications can be shock peening [Zan23], foil cutting, drilling 
[Sun24, Zha23a], and biomedical applications include micromachining medical 
stents [Cha21]. Advances in solid-state lasers such as the use of passive mode lock­
ing (e.g., [Ken23]) and robust pulse amplification systems enable highly reliable and 
low-maintenance systems.
Developments toward higher peak powers during the ultrashort pulses are ongo­
ing to increase the ablation rate per pulse. Femtosecond systems compared to pico- 
or nanosecond pulse systems promise reduced thermal impact on materials, and 
reduced HAZ and defects. The limits and phenomena in these regimes need to be 
further investigated to enable processing of temperature-sensitive materials. Above 
the material-specific ablation threshold, saturation can occur, and plasma may absorb 
the laser energy of even the subsequent pulse [Zha23c].
FIGURE 3.66  Comparison of costs per part with different manufacturing strategies.

143
Laser Material Processes
However, new possibilities can arise, e.g., producing two- or multi-photon absorp­
tion in materials and manufacture of 3D parts [Gon23]. In marking applications, 
ultrashort pulse processing of metals can induce precise periodic structures in nano­
meter scale [Rat22] and enable more efficient and minimum impact on the surface, 
e.g., for medical tools. During welding, new possibilities to join advanced technical 
materials [Pri23] and brittle materials such as glass can be a potential new field for 
femtosecond laser processing [Cho20b].
3.13.1.1  High-Power Cw Lasers
The efficiency and maximum power of cw lasers are permanently improved and 
increased. Many effects of the increasing laser intensities on the material are still 
unknown and the potentials for materials processing need to be explored. For materi­
als processing, the highest publicly reported material processing laser output power 
was 100 kW [Kaw18], while recently a 120 kW system has been installed [Rei23]. 
At high laser powers, simulations show that for aluminum, energy absorptance is 
constant at ~10% independent from the laser power, while for steel, the absorptance 
is simulated to decrease at higher laser power. Furthermore, new optical systems are 
in development that promise an increased laser power output of fiber lasers without 
losing beam quality [Che23]. Future investigations will show the underlying effects 
of such extreme laser-matter-interaction phenomena.
3.13.1.2  Lasers at Different Wavelengths
Advances in using different wavelengths compared to the typical ~1 µm wavelength 
are in progress to be established for high-power laser materials processing. Green 
lasers and frequency-doubled IR lasers are already established in the market and 
show advantages when processing, e.g., copper materials. Blue systems are increas­
ingly developed. An all-solid-state 100 W scale blue-laser system has been shown 
to be stable and robust to be usable for precise copper applications [Jay24]. Such 
developments are based on laser-diode arrays. Current systems emit 40–100 W cw 
at λ = 452.2 ± 2.5 nm with 98% power stability and ∼24% wall-plug efficiency,
achieving multiple kilowatt per square centimeter intensities. Further advances in 
laser developments can open more possibilities for a more efficient processing and 
increased materials processing possibilities.

In DED-LB/M, the creation of the desired properties of a material is an ongoing 
research field. The control of alloying elements in combination with reactions with 
gas and temperature control is a topic of research for tailoring materials for AM, e.g., 
Zhang et al. [Zha23b] reported that Si-Cr-Mn oxides are formed in 316L process and 
have poor bonding with the deposited material. With a large size (0.36 ± 0.31 μm)
and volume fraction (1.4%) of the oxides, the bonding strength of 316L is weak, lead­
ing to a low ductility. Adding TiC particles has been found to effectively change the 
oxides into uniformly distributed TiO2 and decrease the size (0.24 ± 0.13 μm) and

144
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
volume fraction (0.6%) of the oxides. With the refinement and decrease of the oxides, 
the bonding strength of the deposited materials is obviously strengthened, leading to 
a significant increase in ductility (25.4%, increased by 54.1%). Meanwhile, the yield 
strength and ultimate tensile strength have increased by 5.6% and 11.4%, respec­
tively. DED offers many possibilities but the equipment is mainly used in production 
environments. However, a portable system for performing DED has been presented 
by Pang and Nellian [Nel22]. First successes have been reported of a repair applica­
tion on rail steel components using Stellite 6 powder.
For PBF-LB/M, path planning optimization in combination with multi-laser 
machine coordination is a relevant current research field. An optimization strategy 
for laser scan paths is highly relevant to avoid, e.g., overheating or undesired temporal 
thermal developments. In PBF-LB/M, scan strategies are used in the layer-by-layer 
build-up of the workpieces that are pre-defined by machine producers. However, 
these are naturally not optimized procedures and can lead to heat accumulation and 
thermal stress as well as long laser off-times for multi-scanner systems. However, the 
optimization of scan paths for each layer is computational expensive and is difficult to 
solve on conventional computers within reasonable time. The recent rise of quantum 
computers promises to solve optimization problems in highly reduced computational 
time with increased solution quality. To exploit these advantages for PBF-LB/M, an 
adaptation of the multi-vehicle routing problem has been already presented [Bus23]. 
This procedure allows reducing the overall scan time while accounting for the inter­
action of multi-scanner systems, reducing heat accumulation, avoiding laser-plume 
interaction, and accounting for the direction of the shield gas flow.
Unfortunately, most AM processes require time-consuming and costly post-­
processing. Examining and optimizing these techniques is an increasingly important 
research topic to provide methods that reliably produce the required part quality to 
achieve the industrial acceptance, e.g., laser polishing as a post-processing technique 
for polyamide 12 samples generated by DED (DED-LB/P/PA12) has been inves­
tigated [Kut23]. The effects of laser power and number of runs on surface rough­
ness as well as mechanical properties have been analyzed. The results show that 
laser polishing can effectively reduce surface roughness and improve the mechanical 
performance of DED-LB/P/PA12 samples. Welding has also become an important 
post-process after AM. Brunner–Schwer et al. [Bru22] presented results of welding 
structures of Inconel 718 produced with PBF-LB/M. No extreme overheating, and 
melting of flanges of these structures were observed. Despite the local heating of the 
flange, the cooling rates are notably faster ( ̴12°C/s) on the AM side.
In order to reach the global sustainability goals, the knowledge, investigation, and 
improvement of the ecological footprint of industrial processes become even more 
relevant. Therefore, calculation methods are developed to gain insight into the value 
chain of laser processes, e.g., Michel Honoré [Hon23] started asking the question 
if laser AM is really a green technology. The resulting CO2 emissions are observed 
to be strongly dependent on the choice of alloying elements in the alloy as well as 
on the regional origin of the sourcing of materials and energy. In addition, the alloy 
chosen in the AM repair affects the lifetime of the component. A few selected sce­
narios have been already examined, reversing the carbon footprint balance in favor 

145

of AM, with an advantage to AM of up to 26% in terms of CO2 emissions in the most 
favorable scenario.
3.13.2.2  Fundamentals about Laser Materials Processes
Regarding laser-material interaction fundamentals, high-temperature material data 
is, in general, difficult to obtain and to find in literature due to the multitude of chal­
lenges related to measurements. The measurement of absorption values of liquid steel 
surfaces at high temperatures is challenging. However, a radiometric measurement 
setup has enabled the derivation of laser absorption values at high temperatures. 
The data show a general trend of increasing absorption at increasing temperature 
with an absorption drop just above boiling temperature [Vol23h]. It is suspected that 
the vapor above the material’s surface absorbs laser energy that reduces the laser 
energy transferred to the metal’s surface. At even higher temperatures, the absorp­
tion increases again. However, the measurements still include uncertainties about 
the actual values of temperature and surface tension at those extreme conditions and 
require further investigations.
Fundamentals about the interaction between laser light and the metal vapor plume 
are examined [Wah23]. This phenomenon is, in particular, relevant to laser processes 
that include the formation of a keyhole such as laser deep penetration welding. The 
ejected vapor plume from the keyhole opening interacts with the laser beam in terms 
of scattering, photon absorption, and phase front deformation. A measurement setup 
has been introduced that helps to characterize the vapor plume. A high-speed camera 
in combination with spectral measurements has been used to define the interaction 
locations and the related spectral responses to determine the underlying interaction 
mechanisms at different distances and regions from the keyhole opening. The ther­
mal emissions and the scattered light of the incident laser beam have been captured. 
The use of different optical filters allows the distinction between scattered light and 
thermal emission. The average images of the high-speed camera show zones with 
different optical emission behavior. This in turn indicates locally different mecha­
nisms of interactions between the vapor plume, the particle cloud, and the incident 
laser beam. Additionally, spectrometer measurements have confirmed the source of 
optical emissions. The thermal emission and therefore the temperature of the vapor 
plume decreases with the increasing distance to the keyhole. Particle formation leads 
to increased scattering of laser light reaching its maximum in this case at around 
100 mm above the keyhole.
3.13.2.3  Monitoring and Control
X-ray observation facilities have become more attractive to observe laser material 
processes. For laser materials process observations, mainly two monitoring tech­
niques are used, namely diffractometry and radiometry. Diffractometric measure­
ments aim to observe the grain structure inside the material, which can be observed 
after processing or even during laser interaction [Sil23]. Diffraction rings can be 
related to the internal structure of the volume illuminated by the X-ray or neutron 
beam. When recording the diffractometric data during laser impact, the phase trans­
formation kinetics can be observed [Heg21]. This can give indications about the 

146
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
microstructural development during cooling and can help to control and influence 
the material properties.
Radiometric observations help in visualizing the phenomena during melting 
and vaporization processes. Current X-ray beams at synchrotrons can penetrate a 
few millimeters of steel material. By moving the metal sheet during the melting 
process, the melt pool and vapor channel can be observed. The temporal resolu­
tion possible today enables a detailed observation of the melt pool dimensions and 
flow fields, e.g., Schmidt et al. [Sch23d] used in-situ X-ray monitoring of the laser 
welding process for analyzing the impact of ambient oxygen on the appearance 
of the weld seams. Due to the effect of gas-induced dynamic pressure, the shield­
ing of oxygen is also highly relevant to melt pool dynamics and spatter formation 
due to the growth of oxides and the influence of surface tension. Therefore, the 
effect of locally supplied argon on oxide growth and seam topography during deep 
penetration laser beam welding of high-alloy steel AISI 304 has been evaluated. 
High-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging has been performed to separate the effect 
of the gas-induced pressure and the gas-induced shielding of a local gas supply on 
keyhole geometry. The results show that a local supply of argon contributes to a dif­
ference in oxide growth, affecting melt pool convection and weld seam geometry. 
It has been further shown that the effect of local gas flows at low flow rates is pri­
marily because of oxygen shielding, as no significant difference in keyhole geom­
etry has been found by high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging. Further, Schricker 
et al. [Sch23c] used a similar X-ray monitoring setup observing the welding of a 
lap joint of AISI 304 high-alloy steel sheets (X5CrNi18-10/1.4301) with the abil­
ity to adjust different gap heights between top and bottom sheet (up to 0.20 mm). 
A time-resolved description of the “false friend” formation has been provided by 
visualizing the interaction between keyhole and melt pool during laser welding and 
solidification processes within the gap area. The bridging of the joining gaps has 
been limited due to the gap height and insufficient melt supply leading to the solidi­
fication of bridge. The distance between the solidified bridge and the keyhole has 
increased with time, while the keyhole and melt pool dynamics have initiated the 
formation of new melt bridges whose stability has been defined by melt flow condi­
tions, surface tension, and gap heights.
Vapor channel observations are possible as well for gaining a more detailed 
understanding of the keyhole processes. Chung et al. [Chu23] demonstrated an X-ray 
keyhole observation at a frame rate >19 kHz of an aluminum sheet at 0.5 mm thick­
ness and showed the expansion and evolution of the keyhole inside a melt pool, 
which can enable the more precise calculation of keyhole wall temperatures and 
pressure balances. In addition, understanding of pore formation is an ongoing topic. 
In copper hairpin welding for battery applications, high-quality weld seams are, in 
particular, necessary. X-ray imaging can help in identifying pore formation mecha­
nisms. It has been seen that static beam shaping can reduce the pore volume pro­
duced during keyhole welding. When a central spot and a ring spot around are used, 
a reduction of 60% has been achieved [Oml23]. A reduced dynamic keyhole can be 
observed when using steel material [Kau23b]. In addition, the newly developed high-
power lasers at different wavelengths are tested. At keyhole welding of copper and 
steel, a tendency to reduce dynamic process behavior has been observed [Kau23b]. 

147
Laser Material Processes
Volpp et al. [Vol23g] also used an X-ray observation to observe melt pool impacts 
on the root instabilities in thick sheet laser beam welding. It has been observed that 
pore formation at lower laser power occurs at the keyhole tip through keyhole bulg­
ing and separation. At increasing laser power, the bulging and separation happen at 
higher zones of the keyhole. After separation, the gas bubbles remain at the height, 
where created at low laser power, but are pushed downward in the melt pool at higher 
laser power. The low resistance of the melt seems to increase the possibility of gas 
bubbles being pushed downward. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the keyhole bulg­
ing can impact the melt flow. This has been shown by relating the bulging events to 
the slightly delayed root dynamic increase.
The influence of alloying elements on the keyhole stability is also an ongoing 
research topic, e.g., the impact of magnesium on the melt pool behavior during key­
hole welding has been examined, showing that there is a reduced laser beam energy 
absorbance at a higher content of magnesium in the aluminum alloy [Wag21]. This 
knowledge can be further developed to provide methods to alter the process behavior 
using material modifications.
Furthermore, it has been shown that the keyhole geometry also depends on the 
way it is produced. It has been observed that a keyhole forming from a flat sur­
face can change into deeper, narrower shapes after passing a surface hump without 
changing any other process parameters [Fau23].
Improved process understanding can be gained by process simulations. Fluid 
dynamic simulations benefit from more detailed knowledge about material proper­
ties at high temperatures and, in return, can provide additional information about 
melt pool and imperfection mechanisms [Zen23].
3.13.2.4  Process Emission Monitoring
Further details of the relation between process emissions and process behavior are 
necessary to better understand the process and further developments of optimiza­
tion routes, e.g., an investigation of the impact of different laser wavelengths on 
the keyhole during laser processing has been presented by Möbus et al. [Möb23]. 
Laser beam deep penetration welding experiments have been carried out on 2.4068 
pure nickel using an infrared laser source and a blue laser source with comparable 
beam properties. The experiments have been monitored and compared by a multi-
sensor setup and metallographic analyses. This setup includes measurements of 
airborne acoustic emissions and two high-speed video cameras for spatter track­
ing and tracking of the keyhole area. The use of a blue laser beam has led to a 
lower spatter quantity, an increase of porosity, and a significant change in acoustic 
emissions.
An innovative temperature measurement method has been developed aiming to 
gain access to temperatures in the vicinity of the keyhole front wall [Por23]. The 
measurements have been performed at different depths for each combination of pro­
cess parameters to record an axially resolved temperature profile. Supplementing 
the temperature measurements with OCT-based keyhole depth measurements and 
high-speed recordings of the process zone surface has allowed the determination of 
the time, when the refractory probe has been destroyed, identifying the valid regions 
of measurements.

148
High-Power Laser Material Processing for Engineers
Spectral data from the processing zone can provide increased insight into the 
process. Therefore, line-intensity ratios are under investigation (e.g., [Sch23a]), com­
paring the line-intensities of substrate and filler-material elements during DED to 
correlate them with the metallographic results (dilution and chemical composition). 
An increased degree of dilution leads to a surge in the mixing levels of the substrate 
and the filler-material within the deposition tracks. Accordingly, line-intensities of 
elements inside the substrate increase relative to the filler-material elements.
Robust monitoring methods are in development. Track dimension measurements 
during DED give valuable information that can be used to control process param­
eters online in the future. A novel in-process monitoring approach for DED-LB/M 
has been presented with a new developed and robust laser triangulation sensor from 
Falldorf Sensor GmbH [Sch23b]. It is characterized by having a low height deviation 
compared to a confocal microscope. The results show that the layer height and width 
with their peaks and valleys can be monitored even in harsh environments and with 
a small distance (10 mm) to the process zone. These aspects provide a solid basis for 
a further control of the layer topology.
Increasing the process stability to prevent spattering and pore formation remains 
a challenging aspect to be solved in the future.
3.13.2.5  Artificial Intelligence Integration
The potentials of artificial intelligence methods for laser materials processing are 
an upcoming field of research. Machine learning opportunities are seen in (1) inline 
monitoring of sensor data and immediate interpretation to enable efficient and reli­
able process control and (2) parameter prediction based on the desired process 
results. These methods often require a lot of training data, which is often practically 
not possible to provide. Therefore, attempts have been made to improve the methods, 
e.g., a physics-informed hybrid model for the prediction of threshold of deep-pene­
tration laser welding has been presented [Jar23]. A “residual model” approach has 
been used where a machine learning model is applied to learn and compensate for 
the deviations of an analytical model to the experimental results. The results show an 
increase in model accuracy by using such a hybrid model compared to only using the 
analytical model. In comparison to only using a black-box machine learning model, 
the amount of required training data can be reduced, and the extrapolation capability 
can be improved. This indicates that using a hybrid model can significantly reduce 
the amount of required training data, and hence the number of experiments required 
to train the model. This is especially beneficial when acquiring the training data is 
very expensive, as can be the case in laser materials processing.
3.14  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
The laser is a powerful and useful tool for laser materials processing, having applica­
tions in all production technologies. Laser beam processing is based on local heating 
by simply transferring the right energy to the right position. This offers achieving a 
high process flexibility and efficiency. Beam shaping potentials for influencing and 
stabilizing the processes are not fully explored and will support the processing in 
the future when better understanding of the impacts will be gained. In addition, 

149

monitoring and control aspects will gain importance. Sufficiently convincing pro­
cess quality data as a measure for the quality of the parts is a mandatory require­
ment. Monitoring and control tools incorporating machine learning approaches can 
help in enabling robust and self-adapting processes. Laser processes are increasingly 
integrated into multi-processing machines to enable several processing steps in one 
machine for decreasing lead times.
