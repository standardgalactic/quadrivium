ently released a new game for the C64en-
titled Paradroid,
The player ﬁnd himself in an inter-
galactic freighter using a n  Inﬂuence
Device to suppress a mutinous android
crew.
Full colour high resolution graphics
depict 20 decks on the freighter, which is
equivalent to 400 screens, according to
Hewsons.
Andrew Hews on s aid: " W e ' r e
bringing our original games style to Com-
modore owners and they're liking it"
The game costs 0,95 and is available
from Hewson Consultants, 568 Milton
Trading Estate, Milton, Abingdon, Oxon
OX14 4RX.
THE NEW COMMODORE 128 COM-
puter is to be offered complete with a disk
drive for E499.99.
The Commodore 1570 is a  single
handed 0.5 Mega byte 51/4 inch ﬂoppy disk
drive designed speciﬁcally for the 128.
However, it is fully compatible with all
other Commodore home computers.
The drive supports sequential, relative
and user ﬁles in Commodore Standard
format, w it h 340K formatted storage
capacity.
Explaining the rationale behind the
package, Commodor e's  mark eting
manager, Chris Kaday said: "In order to
get the best out of the 128 and run CP/M
effectively, a de facto industry standard
51/
decided t o  subsidise part o f  the cost
involved. Al E499.99, the result is one of
the mos t competitive small business
systems on the market."

A bulging mail bag has given
Flippo plenty of reading
matter this month. Read on
to meet the ghostbusting
• xperts.
ONCE MORE INTO THE BREACH, DEAR
friends. Hey, sorry I've been absent, but a
lot of things have been happening. I went
on my hols (even an arcade wiz has to take
a break sometime!) and as well as that I've
had a pile of mail from you guys that would
choke a cow. So, enough chewing the
cud, let's chew into the mailsack.
Ghostbustedl
Since I spoke to you last. I've had a big
wodge of mail about Ghostbusters, taking
up the challenge to beat the S1,000,000
mark. Hmmm! Well, it didn't take you
long, so here is the upshot of all your
scores.

Phew! What a great showing from my
beloved readers! Well, guys and gals, I'm
proud of you. Here's what some readers
added to their hi-scores.
Miss Tai Ling Wu, Edgbaston: "I'm
afraid I have bad news for Chris Rogers of
Rhyl, his hi-score has been broken. My
next goal is to become an Elite!" Happy
shooting, Tai Ling!
Kevin Cheetham, Newcastle Upon
lyne: "Here is my hi-score.. .does this
make me a mega-ghostbuster?" Could
be, Key!
Alec Harkness, Newbury: "I am also
trying for the $1,000,000 mark, so if Chris
Rogers reads this, I challenge him to a race
to get that amount of money..." Here
that, Chris?
John A Morrison, Shefﬁeld. "I reached
this ﬁgure a couple of months ago, and
since I could go no higher, I stopped
playing. I always used the 1963 Hearse and
ignored the marshmallow sensor."
Phil Truscott, Oldham : "This score was
achieved over about four months. The
score mentioned b y  David Crane
($999,999) must be wrong, as the last two
digits are always 00". Ok, so I misquoted
him, so shoot me... (BANG' AAaaaaa!)
Chris Mansell, Gloucester: " I  tried
typing a $18,000 code into the computer.
instead of the $18,000 it gave me this:
$999.999. Over one million! When I tried
to use it again it told me very rudely there
was no such account number!" Dash it!
Simon Holden, Belgium. "I devised
several rules for adding together account
numbers, which enabled me to increment
my score from $20,000 to $60,000 in one
go. The rules are quite complex, but one
of the simplest, to add £10,000, is add one
to the third digit, and add two to the ﬁfth.
This will work especially when the ﬁfth
digit is less than six." It's cheating, Simon,
but I love it! Full marks!
Impossible Mission?
In Arcadia regular, Chris Rogers wrote to
me about Impossible Mission. "I believe I
have done the impossible with Impossible
Mission — I have completed it without
losing a life! It took 29 mins 52 secs, giving
me a score of 30708!" Nice one, Chris.
How about sending us a few tips on how
to ﬁnish the game? I'm sure there are a lot
of folks out there who would love to join
you in the hi-store table. Well, everyone
except Stephen Auernigg. He says "My
highest score is 30560, i.e. not one life lost
on Albatross. The other pass words I have
completed are Niigata, Cormarant,
Crocodile, Asparagus, Artichoke,
Butterﬂy.. and I  think t h e o n e I' m
working on is called Swordtail." Hmm!
No problems there, I think. Except I think
the password you're looking for i s
Swordﬁsh!

sequels to previous chart successes, but in
all cases they are better than the originals,
with zippier graphics and more complex
game-plays. I'll be featuring tips from all
these games as and when I can sort them
all out.
Oh, by the way, I've been waiting for a
letter from you, about your favourite
game. I've got one from everyone else,
where's yours? It's OK, but don't let it
happen again!

Rescue On Fractalus and Ball Blazer are
the ﬁrst two releases, on the Activision
label, by lucastilm Gaines, the compute!'
games wing of the movie company that
brought you Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost
Ark and all their sequels. The games are
brilliant. The graphic quality of these
games really makes them stand out as
coming from the George Lucas stable, and
I confortably predict they will become
ﬁrm favourites. I've heard a whisper that
the next release from this ﬁrm will be the
most advanced computer game on the 64
ever made.. .but then again, aren't they
always?

Sound
THIS CHAPTER EXPLAINS
how to operate the C-16's two
channel s o u n d  gener ator
outside the standard SOUND
and VOLUME commands. First
we deal w it h  t h e  c ontrol
registers and then go on to
discuss interrupt driven sound.
The Registers
Volume — Bits 0-3 of address
65297 (SFE11) a r e  us ed t o
control t h e  volume. I t  w ill
accept all numbers between
zero ( off)  a n d  1 5  (max).
However values from eight to
15 are all maximum volume.
Bits four to six of this register
must remain unchanged, so to
set the volume in  Basic the
following in s t r u c t io n  i s
necessary:
LDA
AND
OR
STA
Sound reload value — Bit seven
of address 65297 controls the
sound reload value. When this
bit is set, sound is cut off in a
way similar to VOL 0, until the
bit is reset. This bit is used in the
C-16 SOUND command when
changing notes and appears to
be the reason why there is an
audible 'click between notes
— both sound channels are
turned o f f  m o m e n t a r ily
between notes.
To turn the sound reload
ion', i.e. disable sound, use:
POKE 65297,PEEK(65297)AND

Channel Select — The three
voices are selected by bits four
and six of the register at 65297
(SEE11) as follows.
Bit 4 (the 16's bit) selects voice
1 for music (1 on,0 off).
Bit 5 (the 32's bit) selects voice
2 for music (1 on,0 off).
Bit 6 (the 64's bit) selects voice
2 for noise (1 on,0 off).
All other bits must remain
unchanged, therefore t o  set
voice 1  to music and voice 2
to noise enter:
POKE,(PEEK(65297)AND143)=
64+16

MASTERING
THE C  1
Note: As all the POKEs dealing
with volume, channel select
and sourld reload are all to the
same address, it is possible to
set up all three with a single
POKE.
e.g.: POKE 65297,55
Which resets the sound reload
bit, selects voice 1  and voice
2 t o  music, and volume t o
seven.
Or try: POKE 65297,0
which resets the sound reload
bit, turns off voice 1  and voice
2, and sets the volume to zero.
Frequency: Voic e #1 -  t h e
frequency is held in a 10 bit
number. Address 65294 (SHOE)
contains bits zero to seven and
address 65298 (SFE12) holds
bits eight a n d  nine. I t  is
important that bits two to seven
of register 65298 remain un-
altered when setting bits zero
and one. For example, to set
the frequency of voice #1 to
516:
POKE 65298,(PEEK(652981AND
252)+2
to set the multiples of 256 —for
516 there are two multiples
hence the +2. Then
POKE 65294,4 t o
remainder.

Frequency: Voic e #2 -  The
address 65295 (SFIOF) contains
bits zero to seven, and bits zero
and o n e  o f  address 65296
(SEE10) hold bits eight and nine
of the frequency of voice #2.
Unlike voice # 1, bits two to
seven of register 65296 do not
have t o  remain unaltered,
hence to set the frequency of
voice#2 to 516,

Duration —  the duration is
c ontr olled b y  t h e  I R Q
(interrupt reques t) t o  b e
explained later. The duration
of each voice is controlled by
two registers each increment-
ing once per frame, or 1/50 of
the second, until they both
reach zero when that voice is
turned off.
The registers:
voice #1: 1276 ($04EC) l o w
byte,
1278 ($04FE) high
byte.
voice # 2: 1277 (04E1) low byte,
1279 (WOE) high
byte.
The general equation for each
voice is therefore,
A =  65536 -  no. o f  1/50ths

Play Command
Many commercial arcade
games have a tune which plays
while the game is running. This
section shows how this can be
done on the C-16 by using the
hardware interrupt.
Every 1750 of a second (or
jiffy) the computer executes a
service routine which reads the
keyboard, handles the interna
jiffy clock and the duration of
sound. Locations 788 4314)and
789 ($315) hold t h e  vector
pointing t o  this routine, T o
make the computer access an
additional routine every jiffy,
these v ec tor s  s h o u ld  b e
changed to point to the new
routine which in turn ends with
a jump to the service routine.
When us ing t h e  PLAY
command t h e  n e w  routine
plays a series of notes from a list
in memory. The routine senses
when each note is ﬁnished by
ex amining t h e  d u r a t i o n
registers looking for the value
SFIF in both registers. However,
it does not wait for them to be
reset and the note subsequently
turned off, in order to avoid the
annoying clicking sound which
occurs between notes. It then
switches smoothly to the new
note.
ﬁgure 2  shows a  C-16
Assembler listing of the PLAY
command. Lines 10100 to 10290
contain t h e  r outine whic h
switches o n  t h e  P L A Y
command. First it disables the
hardware interrupt (SEI) t o
ensure that ther e ar e n o t
interrupts while the interrupt
vector v alues  a r e  b e in g
changed —  otherwise t h e
machine may  crash. I t  also
turns off any notes playing at
that time and sets the start of
the list o f  notes t o address
$3E00 (15872). The interrupts
are then enabled by the CLI
instruction.
The routine at lines 10300 to
10370 tur ns  o f f  t h e  PLAY
command r e s t o r in g  t h e
interrupt vectors to the normal
routine at $CEOE (52750). Lines
10500 to 10290 begin the PLAY
routine by checking whether
the last note has ﬁnished; if it
has it gets the next note values
(three bytes) from the table and
after checking to see if they are
special commands (e.g. to set
the volume) i t  loads these
values into the frequency and
duration registers.
The complete routine can
be relocated by changing the
ORG command at lines 10110
and 10510 and making the
switch-on r outine s et t h e
interrupt vector t o  its  new
value. The internal registers
used by the PLAY command are
stored between $00 and $09
(208-217). As explained in the
ﬁrst article, this is a free area of
zero page.
The list of notes is stored in

memory as follows: the ﬁrst
byte is the duration which may
be one jiffy (1/50 sec) to 247
jifﬁes (about ﬁve secs). The
next two bytes are the low and
high bytes of  the frequency
which can be between zero
and 1024, as for the SOUND
command. T his  int er r upt
driven routine plays Voice #1,
which leaves Voice #2 free to
be u s e d  f o r  a d d it io n a l
explosions and so on.
Instructions
The PLAY command has its own
special instructions which are
stored i n  t h e  table being
identiﬁed o n l y  b y  t h e i r
duration values. Numbers
between SFI3 a n d  SFF ar e
reserved f o r  these special
instructions.
The new commands are:
5FC (252) volume: This can be
used t o  change the volume
inside a tune. The low byte of
the frequency contains the
new volume setting, zero to
eight. The high byte should be
present but is unused.
$FD (253): This is a type of
GOSUB instruction. It jumps to
the address stored i n  t h e
frequency bytes. Also it stores
the o ld  pointer address i n
memory allowing the tune to
return, so that tunes can have
subroutines although nesting is
not allowed. This can also be
used as a GOTO instruction.
SIFF (254): This is the return
instruction which makes the
PLAY command resume after
the last GOSUB instruction.
The two frequency bytes must
be present but can have any
value, preferably zero.
$1F (255): This completely turns
off the PLAY command.
Figure 3  shows a  demo
program p la y in g  Lar go's
famous Hovis advertisement!
The machine code for the PLAY
command is stored from line
1000 to 1100 and the data for
the tune is stored from line 200
to line 260 in  the form o f
duration and frequency values.
The data i s  wr itten f r o m
address $06B0 (1712). Line 100
POKES this number into the
tune pointer. The SYS 1536 at
line 170 executes this routine.
it is possible to improve the
E
command by  simulating the
attack, decay, sustain a n d
release functions of a sound
synthesiser. T his  w i l l  b e
explained next month.

THOSE OF YOU WHO OWN
C64s may be fascinated by ihe
effects which can be created
using t h e  machine's sprite
graphics features. However
you may not have attempted to
play with sprites yourself due to
the complexity o f  handling
them from Basic. This article is a
simple tutorial on playing with
sprites and takes you step-by-
step through mos t o f  t h e
functions c onnec ted w i t h
them, explaining h o w  each
works, and giving a demon-
stration o f  each stage. The
demonstration is handled by a
program which you type in one
section at a time, adding on
new features as you go.
Creating Sprites
A sprite is  a  user-deﬁned
graphic block which is 24 pixels
wide by 21 pixels high (a pixel is
a picture element i.e. t h e
smallest single dot available on
the screen). Sprites can b e
moved around very easily as a
block, rather than b y  r e -
plotting a ll t h e  indiv idual
pixels. Other functions are also
available, as we will demon-
strate.
The pixels are arranged in
three a d ja c e n t  p a r a lle l
columns o f  21 bytes ( one
byte=eight bits). Each bit can be
zero or one, corresponding to
a pixel on or  off. Thus, for
example, if all bits are off, the
byte will have value zero, and if
all bits are on, it will have value
255 (1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128=255).
The Commodore manuals
explain how to create sprites to
your own designs but for our
purposes, we will use a solid
sprite with all bytes set to value
255. The bytes are arranged as a
consecutive block in memory,
and must start at an address
which is a multiple of 64 (e.g.
we will use 1 3
sprite is said to be in block 1301
P r o g r a m m i n g

•
a
memory, w h it  h is  a n  area
unused by other functions).
The sprites are controlled
by a  n u mb e r  o f  c ontr ol
registers, each being one byte
of memory. In general, each
sprite (eight are available at
once) is controlled by one bit in
each of these bytes e.g. bit 0 of
all the registers corresponds to
sprite 0, etc., and if this bit is 1,
the function is "on", or if it is 0,
the function is  "off". Each
control r egis ter  w i l l  b e
explained as we go on.
Starting the Program
The program has been kept as
simple as possible so that you
can see exactly how the sprites
are controlled. I t  w i l l  b e
introduced in sections, so after
reading the description, type in
the next section of the program
and RUN it. This will let you see
what t h e  n e w  section o f
program does t o  affect the
sprite's behaviour. Do not type
NEW after each section.
REM statements have also
been included in the program
to detail its functions, but these
may be omitted if you like to
save typing, and the program
will function normally. If the
sprites a r e  obstructing
screen when you want to type, ,
then enter "POKE 53269,0" and
press RETURN.
Section 1 -
Introduction (Lines 10-
80)
Most o f  t h e  sprite control
registers are i n  a  block o f
memory c ommenc ing a t
address 53248. To avoid using
these large numbers, we will
set a variable V to 53248 (line 40)
and access the other registers
by adding on numbers e.g. V+1,
V+8, V+20 etc. Lines 50 and 60
set up two strings for printing
messages during the program.
Screen Colour Registers: The
registers which hold the screen
colours are in  this memory
region a t  V+32(border) and
V+33 (screen background).
POKEing values from zero to 15
into these registers will change
the colour of the screen. In this
program, they are both set to
colour six (blue) at line 80.
Section 2 -  Setting up
the Sprites (Lines 99-
140)
Lines 100 and 110 set the 63
bytes of sprite data to 255 to
give a solid sprite, starting at
memory address 832. T r y
experimenting with different
values of BYTE (line 100) to see
the effect on the shape of the
sprites.
Sprite Dat a Pointers: T h e
computer knows where you
have put the sprite shape data
by looking at the date pointers
at locations 2040 (for sprite 0) to
location 2047 (for sprite 7). The
value to be POKEd to these
registers is  t h e  data bloc k
number, in this case 832/64-
(line 120).
Sprite Position Registers: Each
sprite has an X (horizontal) and
Y (Vertic al) pos it ion c o -
ordinate, measured from an
original at the top left of the
screen (actually, this origin is
underneath the screen border,
the actual top left of the visible
screen being at X=24, Y=50).
These positions are stored in
registers V+0 to V+15 as follows:
V+0 Sprite 0 X co-ordinate
V+1 Sprite 0  Y co-ordinate
V+2 Sprite 1 X co-ordinate
V+3 Sprite 1 Y co-ordinate
Line 130 sets the positions of
the sprites (only sprites 0-3 will
be used in this demonstration
program) so that they will be
diagonally across the screen.
Sprite Enable Register: Each
sprite can be turned on and off
(visible or not) by setting (on)
or clearing (off) its correspond-
ing bit  in  the sprite enable
register at V+21. We are using
sprites 0-3 so this register is set
to 1+2+4+8=15 (line 140).
Section 3  -  Colouring
the Sprites (Lines 149-
-
Sprite Colour Registers: Each
sprite has a one byte register
which contains its colour as a
number from zero to 15, in the
same way as the screen colour
registers. T h e s e c o l o u r
registers are at V+39 for sprite 0.
V+40 for sprite 1, and so on up
to V+46 for sprite 7. Here, the
colours have been set so that
the sprites are clearly visible on
the background, (lines 150-180)
but by changing the numbers
after the comma, the sprites
may be changed to any other
colour you wish.
Section 4 - Moving the
Sprites [11 (Lines 200
210, 900-1180)
The sprite position registers
have already been described.
Making the sprites move is
simply a case of changing the
number held in these registers,
so that t h e  sprite changes
position. Subroutine 1000 is
called (line 200) to move the
sprites across the screen (X-
direction) and subroutine 1100
is called (line 210) t o  move
them down the screen.
This paragraph describes
subroutine 1000. Subroutine
1100 is similar in structure, but
operates on different position

We save you time with our
A i r  —
new monthly competition.
When you are designing a game one or the longest jobs is de-
signing the sprites. If you are good at art then ﬁne, if not your
next monster will probably end up looking like a square box
with legs.
Now, Your Commodore comes to the rescue once again
with Sprite Ideas. If you have designed any sprites for games
and you don't mind other people seeing your masterworks
then why not send them into us. Each month we will be offering
E10 for the best entries.
Your sprites can be anything at all (within reason), if you've
designed a series of animated characters then send in the lot.
We'd love to have a look at them.
So, next time you are after an Ogre to put in your new game,
have a look in this section of the magazine and you may ﬁnd
just what you are looking for.

programming project
shows how to draw 1
contour maps for
representing tables of
numbers. By Carry
Marshall.
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
how to write a program to draw
a contour map? They crop up
all over the place and, most
recently, have been seen on
the new, computerised BBC
weather forecasts. A contour
map is always a good way to
represent a  large table o f
numbers, whether they record
meteorological data o r any-
thing else, in a way that is easy
to understand.
The uses of contour maps
include the maps showing the
heights of the terrain as found
in an atlas, and the stress
contours g en erat ed  b y
computer-aided design
programs that can provide a
guide t o  t h e  structural
integrity of a building or an
aeroplane. T h i s  month's
project is to write a program
which, when given a table of
numbers can draw the corres-
ponding contour map.
Figure 1. Contour map
To give an example of what
we want to do, the contour
map shown in Figure 1 was
produced from the numbers in
the following table.
P r o g r a m m i n g
PROGRAMMING
PROJECTS
When related to a weather
map, this rectangular array of
numbers corresponds to data
collected f r o m  w eat h er
stations positioned neatly in a
rectangular grid. This is the
situation which our program
will d eal w ith. Naturally,
weather stations a r e  n o t
positioned reg u larly i n
practice, and have to be placed
wherever it is suitable and con-
venient. The program we shall
develop in this project can be
generalised readily so it draws a
map for a set of numbers each
of which h as a  position
associated with it.
The solution
The program w ill start b y
reading a square array of even
numbers. Then it will draw the
contours for the odd numbers
lying in between these even
numbers in such a way as to ﬁll
the screen.
The even numbers are
restricted so that, for every
number, the number next to it
must be the same as it or the
next even number above or
below it. By restricting the
numbers in this way, we can get
on with drawing the contours
as quickly as possible. If  we
allow the table to contain any
type of number, then we must
spend a  great deal of  time
computing such things as the
range of the numbers and the
values for the contours. This
only obscures the point of the
project, which i s  t o  draw
contours. Once you have seen
how the program does this it is
not at all difﬁcult to start to
draw contour maps for less
restricted tables of data.
Restricting the numbers so
that a  neighbouring number
can only b e one o f  three
possibilities corresponds t o
dealing with situations in which
the data is 'smooth', and this is
how it is in the majority of sit-
uations encountered i n
practice. Most terrains are
smooth, with cliffs occuring
quite rarely, and meteoro-
logical data is mostly smooth,
with only something like a
hurricane providing the
exception.
We can illustrate the way in
which o u r program ﬁnds
contours with the aid of Figure
2. We  start with a  table of
numbers, such as:
We then ﬁnd a value for each
point marked in Figure 2a that
is mid-way between t h e
numbers i n  each ro w  and
column. The table in Figure 2b
is obtained by working out
these values b y taking the
average of  the numbers on
either side of it. The contours
can then be drawn, as in Figure
2c, by joining any of these
points that has an odd number
to an adjacent point with the
same number.

Figure 3.
The joining lines can be
horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
A little experimentation will
show that there are only a few
ways in which these lines can
be drawn. From the mid-points
in the top row, row 1, or in any
odd numbered row, the lines
can b e drawn diagonally or
vertically as shown in Figure 3a.
From t h e  points i n  even
numbered rows, the lines can
be d raw n  diagonally o r
horizontally, a s shown i n
Figure 3b.
This is exactly how the
program for drawing contours
will work. It reads a table of
E
at the mid-points between the
data points, and then joins up
any adjacent points t h at
contain the same odd number,
In this way, the program gives
the contours for all the odd

numbers lying between the
highest and the lowest (even)
numbers in the original table.
The program
To make the program deal with
a table of numbers of any size,
it begins by reading a value for
N, the number of rows and
columns in the table. Then it
dimensions the array, A, into
which the table is to be read,
and the array B. which is to hold
the numbers of the original
array a n d  t h e  numbers
between them, as shown in
Figure 2b, This gives:
10 INPUT N
20 DIM A(N, N), B(2*N, 2*N)
Strictly speaking, if A has N
rows and columns, then B will
have N + (N-1), that is 2*N-1.
But by dimensioning B so that it
has 2*N rows and columns, we
can place zeros in row and
column N ,  and in row and
column 0 as well, to create a
surround f or the important
part of the array, and so avoid
some nasty edge effects in
subsequent calculations.
Next, the table can be read
into A, its entries copied into
the appropriate elements of B,
and the surround for B created
with:
30 FOR Y=1 TO N: FOR X=1 TO
40 READ A(Y, X)
50 B(2*Y-1, 2*X-1)=A(Y, X)
60 NEXT X: NEXT Y
70 FOR X 4  TO 2*N
80 8(0, X):1: 8(2*N, X)4
90 NEXT X
100 FOR Y0 TO 2*N
110 B(Y, 0 )
120 NEXT Y
Here, as elsewhere i n  t h e
program, Y is used to number
the rows in the arrays and X the
columns. The values at the
points mid-way between the
original data points can now be
computed. ﬁrst along the rows
and then down the columns,
and placed in B by:
130 FOR Y=1 TO 2*N-1 STEP 2
140 FOR X=2 TO 2*N-2 STEP 2
150 B(Y, X ) 4 . 5
X+1))
160 NEXT X: NEXT Y
170 FOR X=1 TO 2*N-1 STEP 2
180 FOR Y=2 TO 2*N-2 STEP 2
190 B(Y, X)::1.5*(B(Y-1, X)  +
B(Y+1, X))
200 NEXT Y: NEXT Y
With the data entered and
the preliminary computations
complete, we can prepare the
high-resolution graphics
screen b y calling our usual
routine with:
210 GOMA 500
When the contours are plotted,
we could use the row and
column numbers o f  t h e
elements of B as screen co-
ordinates. But, to ensure that
the contour map ﬁlls the screen
and is as large as possible, we
shall scale these numbers up by
multiplying t h e  co lu m n
numbers by 320/(2*N) and the
row numbers b y 200/(2*N).
These factors are calculated by:
220 XS=INT(160/N): YS=INT
(100/N)
Now we are ready to plot
the contours, and the lines
starting from any points in the
odd numbered rows of B can
be dealt with by ignoring all but
the values that are odd and, for
them, testing to see if one of
the diagonal lines or a vertical
line needs to be drawn. When a
line is to be drawn, it is only left
to place the necessary values in
Xl, X2. Y1 and Y2 and to call the
line-drawing subroutine
starting at  line 2000, which
draws a line from (X1 , Y1) to
(X2, Y2). This can be done by:
230 FOR Y=1 TO 2*N-3 STEP 2
240 FOR X=2 TO 2,N-2 STEP 2
250 IF B(?, X)=2*INT(B(Y, X)/2)
THEN 290
260 IF B(Y, X)=B(Y+1, X-1) THEN
Z1X*XS: Y1=Y*YS:
X2=(X-1)*XS: Y2=(Y+1)*
YS: GOSUB 2000
270 IF B(Y, X)=B(Y+1m X+1)
THEN X1=X*XS: Y1=YS:
X2=(X+1)*XS: Y2=(Y+1)*
VS GOSUB 2000
280 IF B(Y, X)=B(Y+2, X) THEN
X1=X*XS: Y l l
X2=X*XS: Y2=(Y+2)*YS:
GOSUB 2000
290 NEXT X: NEXT Y
In similar vein, t h e even
numbered rows of B can be
dealt with by:
300 FOR Y=2 TO 2*N-2 STEP 2
310 FOR X=1 TO 2*N-1 STEP 2
320 IF B(Y, X)=29NT(B(Y, X)/2)
THEN 370
330 IF 13(Y, X)=13(Y+1, X-1) THEN
X1=X*XS: Y1=Y*YS:
X2=(X-1)•XS: Y2=(1+1)*Y5:
GOSUB 2000
340 IF B(Y, X)=B(Y+1, X+1) THEN
X1=X*XS: Y1=Y*YS'
X2=(X+1)*XS: Y2=(Y+1(•YS:
GOSLI B 2000
350 IF X=2*N-1 THEN 370
360 IF B(Y, X)=B(Y, X+2) THEN
X1=X*XS: Y1=Y*N
X2=(X+2)
2000
360 NEXT X: NEXT Y
line 350 must be included
to avoid exceeding the array
limits for B. If we had not given
B its surround of zeros, we
should have had far more
worries of this kind.
The complete program,
with data and subroutines, is
listed as Figure 4.

Further developments
As already suggested, there are
a number of developments that
can extend the program. To
begin with, they will centre on
ways o f  r e d u c i n g  • the
restrictions on the data initially
accepted by the program. At
present, t h e  data mus t b e
smooth enough that not more
than o n e  c ontour  passes
between any pair of the initial
points. If the data is less smooth
than this then the array B must
be m a d e  correspondingly
larger so that it can hold more
points in between the initial
points to allow more contours
to pass between them.
The w ay  i n  whic h o u r
program draws contours is
sufﬁciently robust to be used
with tabulated numbers of any
kind and, indeed, any numbers
each with their own associated
position.
Finally, a way of labelling
the contours would improve
any contour map.

to bring you this review.
HOLD ONTO YOUR JOYSTICKS FOR A
thrilling contest amid the snow and ice, in
the follow up to Summer Games I and II,
with Winter Games.
All the old familiar graphics remain,
the white doves ﬂying across the screen as
the t o r c h  g lo w s  br ightly  i n  t h e
foreground, o n l y  t h i s  t i m e  t h e
background is  realistically covered i n
snow.
Prior to commencing battle against the
wintery conditions you ﬁrst choose the
country y ou wish t o  represent, then
decide t h e  number  o f  participants,
between one and eight, and go for gold.
The wise athlete will practice before
commencing i n  competition against
other human opponents. Spend time
preparing for an assault on the World
record.
The excitement begins with the Hot
Dog Ariels. You start perched high up on
a s k i slope d a d  i n  y our protective
clothing, which is a must to prevent bodily
damage, and a pair of skies. The aim is to
dazzle the judges with your artistry as you
ﬂip through the air  attempting such
manoeuvres as a 'Daffy', 'Back Scratch' or
'Mule Kick'; to name just three. Or, if you
really want to score high try combining a
'Stunt' and 'ﬂip' in mid-air. The main
problem is that you have to land on your
feet. Tearing the skin off your bottom only
rates as a third degree burn.
If you survive the Hot Dog Ariels
without getting too much mustard on
your face and without breaking a leg you
move onto the Biathlon. Armed with a
.22 calibre riﬂe you ski uphill and downhill
until you are confronted with the targets.
Quickly, you arm your gun, pull the
trigger and ﬁre -  bullseyel But, beware
because although speed is of the essence,
if your heart beats too fast it will affect
your accuracy. So, keep an eye on your
pulse rate and don't get too overheated.
Something everyone will enjoy is the
compulsory one-minute ﬁgure skating.
You have 60 seconds to complete seven
movements as  y ou gracefully whir l
around the ice rink. Skate forwards and
backwards attempting such delights as
double axel jumps and sit spins. Falling or
moving awkwardly will not impress the
judges; can you emulate Torvil and Dean
and score a row of perfect sixes?
The music changes dramatically as you
crouch low at the top of the ski jump.
Speed, timing and joystick control are of
the essence in this very exciting event.
G a m e  O f  T h e  M o n t h
Then, you gather speed in a crouched
position travelling d o w n  t h e  slope,
prepare for take-off and soar through the
mountain air. While in mid-ﬂight you
hastily re-adjust your position to gain
maximum distance and reduce wind
resistance. Practicing this event while you
strain every muscle to achieve an extra
meter will while away many a happy
winter evening.
Alter the exhiliration of the ski slope
comes the 30mph speed skating. Race
against the clock with either computer or
human opposition. This has a  similar
setting to the cycling in Summer Games II
so the split level screen allows you to view
how far your foe is lagging behind as he
tries t o  compensate rhythm for brute
strength.
Calm your pulse rate and get your
blood pressure down by re-entering the
ice rink for two minutes of free ski I f
you over spin your skater will become
dizzy and unceremoniously fall on the ice
- painfull
The last event y ou start o n  your
bottom instead of ﬁnishing on it as in most
of the other events. Sit back, shut your
eyes, say a very quick prayer and off you
career down a very fast bobsleigh track. I
advise valium before you attempt the
hair-raising turns before entering the ﬁnal
straight at 90mph. Go too fast and you
land up in hospital. One last bit of advice
don't drink and drive, it is dangerous for
your health.
Again US Gold has come up with a
winner. I eagerly await a Winter Games II
in the hope it will contain a downhill
slalom, by then I might have regained my
balance.

Not content with studying
other people's adventures,
Runecaster has now been
creating his own. Read on to
ﬁnd out how.
Do-It-Yourself.. .Almost
WE HAVE SEEN PROGRAMS To ENABLE
the non-programmer t o write text
adventures, some of which even allow
reasonable graphics to be added. We
have also had a  selection of games
creators that can be used to put together
fairly rudimentary arcade games.
Now, into this games creator arena for
the C64, sweeps Ariolasoft, with a very
comprehensive package for the graphics
adventure buff. Only available on disc.
the Adventure Construction Set at 114.95,
gives the user a veritable host of ready-
made characters, objects and facilities
from which to build a dream adventure!
Not only can you create the whole
adventure yourself but, if you get bogged
down, lazy or just inquisitive, then you
can hand over the completion of the
game to the Adventure Construction Set

— just Si, back and let it take over where
you left off and it will create a working
adventure from your bare bones! Mind
you this can take anything up to 40
minutes.
Although large numbers of characters.
objects etc. have already been created
and are at your beck and call, all of them
may be altered to your speciﬁcations.
either graphically or  their attributes
(strength, weight. associated text etc.)
changed.
The basic format for any of these
adventures consists of a 'world map' that
your players explore (up t o  four
characters may be chosen — each taking
turns to move). Within this area there will
be access points (doors, castles etc.) to
further regions where the majority of the
action will take place.
The world map is 40 x 40 squares, of
which a 10 x 15 area is visible — the map
scrolls as your players move across it.
There may also be isolated 'events areas'
in addition to the main regions.
Two to Start With
Two adventures are included on the disc,
one, The Land of Aventuria, contains a
tutorial adventure plus six other mini-
adventures to help the newcomer 'get the
feel' of what is possible. The second.
Rivers of Light, is a complex adventure set
On the Track
in ancient Egypt, that should keep even
the hardened adventurer busy!
When you start using the Adventure
Construction Set, you will have to create a
working 'adventure disc'. This involves
quite a lot of disc swapping (the ACS disc
and your 'adventure disc'), so do not
expect to be playing an adventure in just
minutes — allow yourself time.
Before creating this work disc, you
must decide what options you want on
the disc. You will need a separate work
disc for each adventure — either one you
are about to construct or one of the two
already on the ACS disc. It is probably
wise to start with The land of Aventuria.
Playing and creating adventures is
mainly carried out by using a joystick (or
joy-pad/card) and all the on-screen
operating instructions are clear and well
explained. The program is well thought
out a nd appears t o  b e  almost
foolproof.. even at this stage this is
apparent, i f  you have inserted an
unformatted disc (for your working disc),
it checks, and formats it if necessary!
Once you have a working disc with
The land of Aventuria on it, you can play
the game, learning as you go. Or you can
practise editing what is already there.
Playing the adventures will initially
present you with the choice of creating or
adding a new player. Again one is quite
impressed with the vast number of
options you are given for the graphical
representation of your character.
Admittedly these are in fact all the
characters/objects that may appear
within the framework of the game but
even so, given a hundred odd icons to
choose from does tend to leave one a little
stunned!
Having chosen a nd named your
character(s), the screen displays part of
the world map. complete with trees.
mountains, seas, castles, deserts etc. Bars

I .

A d v e n t u r e s

display how much time for movement
your player has left on this turn and also
his/her current 'power' and 'life force'.
Four lines beneath the map are used
for text messages, instructions and further
menus. You may now either move, using
the joystick, or 'select other options' by
pressing the 'ﬁre button'.
Other options, displays 12 possibilities,
including: use object, drop object, use
power (spells), ready new weapons or
armour, quit, save, ﬁre (missile weapon)
and proﬁle. Most of these have fairly
obvious uses, the last — proﬁle — gives
you a  complete inventory of  your
character. Not only will it tell you what is
being carried but also a full breakdown of
their constitution, wisdom, strength,
dexterity, missile skill, melee skill, life
force, parry skill etc! All of which may
assist in helping you decide what course
of action to take next.

Watch Out
As you move around one of two things
may happen: First, you can 'fall upon' one
of the 'map creatures', these may be
friendly and have something to give you,
so be wary of launching an unprovoked
attack! Should you do this they may then
understandably change. from friend to
foe.
Secondly, you may enter a 'square'
(castle, portal, door etc), that will
transport you somewhere else, or to one
of the many regions within the game.
These regions consist of a number of
interlinked 'rooms', where you will ﬁnd
all the major puzzles that you have to
solve, to win through to the end.
There are weapons, artefacts and
spells to be found — all graphically
portrayed — just move your character as
though you want to stand on top of them
and they are yours. Some you'll wish you
never found!
There are plenty o f  creatures
wandering around but you must try and
identify which are worth attacking. If you
have a suitable weapon you may attack
from a distance, although how well you
aim, is dependent upon your character's
prowess with missile weapons (check
your proﬁle).
lust as each player has a certain time
each turn to move or take any other
action so too do all the creatures you
meet! You may choose to ignore them but
they may be more aggressive and choose
not to ignore you! If battle is joined, then
the results of each blow are shown in the
text window below the  display.
Objects initially seen as you enter a
location may not be all that is there, often
further items are hidden underneath! As
in most adventure games there is plenty of
treasure around but carry too much and
movement may become difﬁcult.
With each complete adventure there
is a ﬁnal goal i.e. some object/character
that has to be found and taken, rescued
etc. Needless to say, this goal should not
be one that can be achieved without
completing other parts of the quest.
Indeed, there are conditions that can be
set on whether doors or portals will or will
not operate, dependent upon items
carried.
Roll Your Own
The instruction booklet (40-odd closely
printed pages), draws the comparison
between this program and making a
movie. There are many similarities, you
have to choose your cast, your locations
and all sorts of interesting props.
Although the presentation of menus
and instructions 'on-screen' are usually
clear and explicit, read the written
instructions ﬁrst! At the ﬁrst read they
may seem too much to grasp but as you
become more familiar with the program,
they will all make sense!
•
C  =
Also, even if you don't understand a
particular action very clearly, at least the
vague memory of a certain possibility may
well trigger off something useful later!
The initial stages require you to create
a new working disc (or you could practise
by editing the game already on your
adventure disc above). For your own
adventure you will probably wish to start
from scratch. Here is your ﬁrst of many
hundreds of decisions.
There are three types of adventure
construction sets available: Fantasy.
Science Fiction or Spy/Mystery. The basic
concepts of all three are similar with
world maps, regions, portals etc. but the
sets of ready made characters, objects and
terrain possibilities, are tailored to suit the
subject.
Having chosen the set you want just
follow the on-screen instructions — you
now have the basic tools of the trade.
Although there are plenty of 'things' with
which to create the map and the creatures
and the objects to be found and used,
there is no substitute for plenty of forward
planning!
You must have more than a rough idea
of what you want your adventure to
achieve.
First, the world map — think carefully
of what you want to represent. What areas
should characters be able to travel across
freely? What obstacles do you wish to put
in their path and, having put them there,
what is their purpose? Does the placing of
your special regions make any sort of
sense?
Secondly, the regions — presumably
at least some of these will need to be
visited in the correct order (items found in
one required to ﬁnd items in another
etc.). Think carefully about the overall
concept of your game before you start
creating regions willy-nilly!
Thirdly, consider the objects and
creatures that are going to be found —
both in the vital regions and also as one-

A d v e n t u r e s
off encounters whilst wandering around
the world map. Does their placement
make some sort of sense? If
Anyone using this package can create
a working adventure -  it's almost fool-
proof - but only with careful planning and
attention to detail, can you produce a
game with that added something that
others are really keen to play and solve.
Do Your Own Thing
You may think that because all users are
given the same terrain, objects and
creatures, all ACS adventures would have
a certain similarity...not so! Not only may
you alter the graphical representation of
all the current graphics, you can also
create new creatures and objects (up to a
maximum of 128 in each case).
Each creature, object and terrain
option has certain conditions and
attributes (a  creature has the most
options: 20 different basic attributes —
not counting variations on each of these
or which of umpteen objects they may
possess!). These attributes may be
modiﬁed to suit your adventure.
Having altered the name, shape, and
attributes for a creature in the master list,
you may then alter them again when you
place him/her/it actually in the location
of your choice! So although, you may
have a general basic giant. speciﬁc giants
may be stronger, faster or better armed
than others elsewhere!
Each of these attributes is explained
fully in the instruction booklet, so really
what appears in your adventure is solely
limited by your imagination. You can
even have a creature attack until the
player hits it — it then turns tail and keeps
out of the way!
If ﬁxed events are not enough then
facilities exist to have random creatures
appearing you choose the creature and
the percentage of time that you wish it to
be present.
There are of course a range of spells
available. You may well ask how these are
applicable to Spy/Mystery or Science
Fiction adventures. Spells basically affect
either the players or their surroundings,
so a spell of 'decreasing life force' from
the fantasy world could be likened to a
poisoned drink in a  dubious bar in
Marseilles.
There are similar parallels to be drawn
in other contexts. Think about it, there are
some interesting philosophical questions
raised by this line of thought.
'Doorways' between locations can
come in a variety of forms, from simple
two way passages open to all to locked
doors to portals only accesible to those
1 3 8  w i t h  certain objects in their possession.
Finally
Throughout your use of this program you
will probably be changing discs at fairly
regular intervals — do not be tempted to
be lazy, remember to put the disc that is
not in the drive, back in its sleeve! The law
of cussedness is bound to come into effect
and damage the exposed disc...you have
been warned!
There is just not enough space here to
list all the  variations possible with
Ariolasoft's Adventure Construction Kit.
The only real snag for those to whom it
appeals is  likely t o  be: will their
computers have worn out before they
have explored all the possible 'alternative
realities' available from ACS?
Exodus Update 
4
Those of you who read and believed my
rave about US Gold's Exodus: Ultima III,
will have sought out a copy for yourselves.
You will either feel I over-reacted or will
be hooked, and deep in the wilds of
Sosaria...
First, for those of you that did not get
copies of the booklets explaining the
Wizard's Spells or the Cleric's Spells — all
is riot lost. lust send a stamped addressed

software and the missing books will be
sent to you.
Secondly, how are you progressing?
Have you realised that if you visit Lord
British in his castle after a character has
increased in 'Level', that your maximum
hit points increase? Have you found a
boat and sailed the seven seas? No? Then
try attacking one of those pirate ships! But
time your attack to coincide between
cannon-ﬁre and always approach the
pirates along a vertical or horizontal line
— rapidly.
Talk to those you meet, especially in
far-off places a nd write down what they
say. Powders enable a party to 'negate
time' — exceedingly useful if there are
dragons about! Has anybody found the
town of Dawn?
What form of 'party' do you ﬁnd best?
Do you change the members of the team
for special missions? Are you able to heal
your companions regularly with SANCTL
(Cleric Spell 'C')? Long may the spell of
wonder and exploration last.

[pave Crisp looks at a
wordprocessing package and 1
[gives a run down of printers I
l
A Wordprocessor Package
WORD PROCESSING AGAIN? WELL, IT
may seem so but apart from games this is
what you will ﬁnd most computers doing
most often.
After trying many printers, countless
interfaces and almost every wordproces-
sor, I think I am now in possession of the
most versatile package available at this
time.
I am not going to go over the pros and
cons of wordprocessor software, because
I want to have a look at the new word pro
from Precision ﬁrst in case it's even better
than the Vizawrite which at the moment is
the best I have seen. That will be in a later
issue. Instead I will, very brieﬂy, mention
the Wordpro software and then go onto
the other end of wordprocessing, the
printer.
There ar e basically t w o  types o f
wordpro. Pre-formatted a n d  pos t-
formatted. T he post-formatted ty pe
works o n  t h e  principle that format
characters typed into the document take
effect only when the document is printed
or when the document is viewed. This
means that you cannot see the document
as it will be printed without leaving the
text e d it o r .  Pr e- for matted w o r d -
processors allow you to 'see' the effect
that the formatting symbols will have as
you type.
Easyscript is an example of a post-
formatted type, and Vizawrite is of the
pre-formatted variety.
Personally I prefer the pre-formatted
software though it seems that opinion
between users is split 50/50.
The problem with the C64 is that it can
only display 40 characters of text at a time.
This means that i f  y our page is  set
anywhere over 40 characters you have to
scroll over the page in order to see exactly
what it looks like. A disadvantage but one
that I have learned to live with.
There are many functions involved
with text editing and so it is important to
choose one which has logical commands
as nothing slows down typing more
effectively than constant referral t o  a
manual to ﬁnd out how to insert a tab and
so on. For this reason I go for Vizawrite.
Hardcopy
Going onto printers and printing you
come across the problem o f  printer
compatability. The Commodore range of
printers is not too bad, indeed over the
BUSINESS
IIE
last 12 months Commodore has brought
out some nice machines. However it
seems that a lot of people want a printer
from the Epson stable or one similar. This
is a good choice though the ﬁrst problem
is that it is not compatible.
There is now a massive range of inter-
faces available in order to run centronics
printers from the Commodore. They start
at about EIS and go on up to around 1200.
Before you rush out and buy one, stop
and see what your needs will be. If you
only seem to use a printer for listing
programs and simple jobs then a simple
lead and driver software may be all you
need. This should cost between 05 and
[20. It is simple, cheap and does the job. If
you use the more popular commercial
software you may ﬁnd that software is
built in which will drive the printer with
just the lead so think - before you spend -
before you print.
If you are in a position where you use a
lot of varied software and are never quite
sure what you may need, it may be worth
splashing out and getting a more versatile
interface. These do not come cheap but
can save hours of frustration when trying
to re-locate machine code driver software
in or der  t o  avoid conﬂict w ith a n
expensive piece of new software.
The best of these 'HARD' interfaces
plug i n t o  t h e  serial p o r t  o f  y our
Commodore. This means that you can
keep your user port free and use your
printer in  exactly the same way as a
Commodore printer.
Some months ago I wrote about the
GT Turbopoint interface. I raved about it
and said i t  was the best thing since
wholemeal bread. It was brilliant, it still is
but I now use something even better. It is
the Micro Control Systems Interface, It
consists of a circuit board and live pin to
ﬁve-pin lead.
This board ﬁts inside the printer and
on some versions allows twin din-sockets
to ﬁt in the printer case so you can daisy
chain your peripherals as though it was a
Commodore printer. Excellent. Versions
are available for Epsons, Kaga, Canon and
more.
There is a small built in buffer which
frees your computer quite quickly with
smaller documents and it can be switched
either with jumpers or through software
to allow you to choose different modes.
These are full Commodore emulation,
transparent, plus more depending on the
version you have,
Commodore graphics are supported
and for the ﬁrst time I am now able to get
good screen dumps from software such as
Koala and doodle.
Fitting t he board into the printer
ranges from easy to ﬁddly depending on
which printer you have so if in doubt ask
someone who knows what they're doing
as printers tend to be fussy about where
you poke wild screwdrivers.
Because these boards offer you ﬁve-
pin sockets it means there is a centronics
port spare. For those of you with more
than one machine it means that you can
have both plugged into one printer. By
the side of my printer I have a 64 and on
the other there is a Sirius. If one is printing
and you try to print from the other it will
just wait. At ﬁrst I  thought I may get
printed garbage but that is not the case.
Once the Micro Control Systems inter-
face is in place you can forget about it. It
does not get in the way, it  does not
require constant switching in order to
make it work and it does not clog up your
user port or require a 5V power supply
from the cassette port.
This interface is the best thing since
sliced wholemeal bread!
The choice of printer depends a lot on
ﬁnance. Prices are dropping but you
should still expect to pay E200 plus for a
versatile and fast dot matrix printer. That is
not to say that anything costing less is sub-
standard. It may be just slower and have
less facilities such as elite, proportional
spacing, underlining, double strike, italics
and near letter quality type etc. etc.
I am stuck on my Canon. It's fast, MO
cps) quiet, (compared t o  m y  Smith
Corona daisywheel) and cheaper (than an
Epson fx-80).
It will cope with friction fed-single
sheet paper. fanfold and r oll paper.
without having to buy a roll holder as an
extra. Its near letter quality is as good as
anything I have seen on a matrix printer. It
seems bulky but the space it takes up on
the desk is about the same as most, it is just
unusually high. Paper jams are rare and
loading paper whether roll, sheet or fan-
fold is simplicity itself.
In the End
If I were popping down to the local to buy
a printer set up to go with a 64,1 would not
hesitate a n d  I  w h o l e  hear tedly
recommend the Micro Control Systems
Printer Interface and in the printer dept
the CANON PW-108A. Not cheap but
very impressive.

THE SECRET
BEHIND
THE NEW
COMMODORE 64
Vi,e'rl like to let you into a secret.
Plug a RObcom TurboSeries cartridge
into the back of your Commodore. and you'll
have the ultimate 64.
More speed, the Turbo 50 above loads
and s a t  least 10 times as quickly as
normal from cassette and like times as
quickly from disk.
More poAer: there are 16 new tape and
disk commands (including ﬁle copy) plus
8 new function keys: and a Centronics
interface means you can use non-
Commodore printers
Its easier to use. too— Toolkit• simpliﬁes
Basic writing, and there's a poAerful
machine language monitor aid.
There's a Reset button, too, that puts the
computer back to square one without

ponth he deals w a l l
he Exclusive-or
routine.
Exclusive—or Routine
THIS MONTH, I AM GOING
to explore the workings of an
Exclusive-or routine which is
often used in cases where there
is a need to 'encrypt' or to code
the data in some form,
Obviously this i s  most
useful when one wishes to
protect data or programs and it
should prove useful if you are
already thinking along these
lines. But ﬁrst it is necessary to
explain how an exclusive-or
works and how it differs from
an inclusive-or.
To understand both w e
need to look at the bit patterns
of a  couple of  numbers to
visualise the operations that are
performed.
two numbers and this is why
200 inclusive-or 100 gives the
number 236. You may conﬁrm
this by typing in direct mode
PRINT 200 OR 100 and this is
the answer provided by  the
third row of the table. On the
other hand, an exclusive-or
will only return a bit pattern of
one if either (but not both) of
the bit patterns is a one and
therefore row four gives 200
exclusive-or 100 as 172. This is
actually quite complicated to
demonstrate in Basic and is one
of the few instances where
machine-code is actually much
easier than it s high-level
equivalent — all you need to
code i n  machine code i s
WA Sat followed by EOR $64
to get $AC (= 1721 In Basic you
will need to type the following:
PRINT (2OO OR 100) AND NOT
(200 AND 100)
Having got o u r 'coded'
number, what are we going to
do with it? We could save the
data in this encoded form. The
really interesting thing is to
observe what happens when
we exclusive-or o u r 'new'
number with the second of our
original numbers. The second
half of the table shows that

The ﬁrst two rows of the
table are the decimal numbers
200 and 100 converted into
their b in ary pattern. A n
inclusive-or is performed i f
there is a one in either of the
performing an  exclusive-or
with the number we derived
with the second number gives
back the original number.
In order to encode a section
of data, o r  even a  whole
program, all we need to do is
encode the bytes that form our
program with a sequence of
numbers. The result is apparent
gibberish b u t  technically no
information has been lost. If we
can generate the sequence of
numbers used to encode the
program this can be used as a
key to 'unlock' or 'decode' the
encrypted code.
Some exclusive-or routines
make use of the fact that the
data in ROM is ﬁxed in silicon.
as it were, and therefore use
the RO M data to provide a
sequence o f  number s  t o
encode the original. However
this is alright so long as you
stick to your own machine but
it i s  n o t  u n kn o w n  f o r
Commodore to make small and
unannounced changes t o its
ROMS and this might create
difﬁculties for the future. The
approach I have taken in the
sample program is to make use
of a simple algorithm which
generates a  s equenc e o f
numbers in the range 0-225.
These are used for encoding.
In the sample program, you
will see that line one is a SYS call
followed b y  a  REM, quote
marks and then exactly 65
asterisks ﬁnished with a ﬁnal
quote. Type in this line with no
spaces at all and it will just ﬁt on
to 80 spaces. To operate the
program type 'RUN 2' and it
will read the DATA statements
for a machine code routine
into the space provided by the
asterisks. T h e  res t o f  t h e
program is of no consequence
but- merely a way of doing
something.

, ONE 6 F  M Y  GREATEST DREADS IS
waking up on Christmas morning to
discover that some kindly relative has
given one of the children a trumpet or
drum-kit. It's not that I'm anti-music. In
fact, I believe that music is an important
part of  life and the playing of  an
instrument is a great skill. However, there
are lots of computer packages that are
more versatile than the aforesaid
instruments and are quieter. The
programs range from a  pre-school
package through to one which offers the
capabilities of a synthesiser.
You may be aware that there are a
rarige o f  powerful systems using
keyboards driven by the MIDI interface.
Most o f  these systems are rather
expensive and outside my ﬁeld of interest.
All of the packages discussed here cost
less than BO and only one offers a MIDI
facility. Notwithstanding their lower
prices, many of these programs offer
useful facilities.
I have carefully chosen a range of
software which encompasses a range of
age groups and prices. Since you may wish
to use this article as a possible shopping
list, I have used price to categorise the
software.
Under £10
Make Mu sic w ith Mistertronic b y
Mastertronic is the cheapest of the
packages I  want t o  describe but
notwithstanding this, it's very good value.
The program provides a n a id t o
composing music. The complexity of
music possible is a little limited by the fact
that a  single stave is offered with a
maximum of one voice. Up to seven
screen lengths of music may be written
and saved to tape as required.
Five different sounds are provided —
piano, guitar, trumpet, recorder and
trombone. The actual sounds are only
approximate but sound passable. The full
range of simple note values and rests are
provided and a useful option is provided
to enable you to make hard copies of the
score.
Overall this is a  cheap and very
cheerful program which works well and
provides a simple but effective means to
create music.

Fisher-Price's Song Maker is one of a
series of high quality cartridge based
packages from this toy maker ﬁrm. The
child is presented with a list of music titles
to chose from. This selection is made with
a joystick. The musical pieces range
through well known nursery rhymes such
as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and Pop
Goes the Weasel, Play School favourites
such as Row Your Boat and Farmer in the
Dell and songs such as Here Jacques and
Campdown Races. Overall there are 20
titles plus an option for the child to create
an original tune.
Though at ﬁrst sight this program may
seem to be purely a play item, it does have
an element of education. As the tune is
played, a simple score is shown on the
screen. Initially each note is represented
by the normal notation allowing the child
to see the relationship between the pitch
of a note and its position on the musical
stave. The child can then overprint any
note by an animal shape. Each animal
actually represents a different voice or
sound. Danny the Duck quacks a note,
Betsy Bee buzzes, Oliver Octopus rings a
bell, Marty Monkey uses his tail as a violin
and Wilbur Whale plays a note on his
water spout. Using the joystick, the child
can change the voice playing any speciﬁc
note.
This game offers hours of fun whilst
subtly reinforcing the educational aspect.
The Music Machine cassette by
Longman Software is joystick or keyboard
controlled and is aimed at the over eights.
It is, however, simple enough for younger
children to use. The program allows the
child to compose tunes using a cartoon
man who holds the note and is guided
into the correct position on the chosen
stave. Rather than allow random music,
however, the program forces the use of
the constituent notes of simple chords.
Not only does this allow interesting
compositions, but a feel for the tonal
structure of music is given. Only two
sections of stave are given but by use of
the ternary form of repeat (i.e. AABA
where A is stave 1 and B is stave 2) but
options are given to chose the key (C,F
and G) and the tempo (march of waltz).
There is a basic teaching element in
this program and a  test sequence
provided, but in spite of this, the game
gives hours of fun.

AllerPrice'
The Music Studio by Activision movel,
away from the strict teaching angle
towards composition and musical theory.
This package provides the environment
for t h e
three voices and their incorporation in
musical scores. Two distinct options are
offered. For the semi serious user, there is
a versatile music editor. For those seeking
to simply create tunes without emphasis
on musical accuracy, there is the music
paint box.
In keeping with modern trends, the
program uses icons with a pointer to
select options. This system is simple to use
and easy to understand.
Up to 15 preset sounds are available,
each denoted by a colour. These are
selected by  simply pointing at the
corresponding colour on the note pallet.

use the full note shapes, notes are simply
shown as coloured blocks with iizes
. proportional to the duration. You can edit
or change the composition and readily
, pla y  it hack.
The music editor is similar in many
respects to the paint box but offers many
of the facilities of music. Full notation is
used and there are options for the full
range of note values, accidentals (sharps,
ﬂats etc.), tieci notes, dotted notes and
rests. The system acts rather like a word
processor with commands to copy and
move phrases.
The value of both sections is that the
music scrolls as it plays showing how
sequences of notes sound — always a
difﬁcult step when trying to read music. A
sound engineer section allows the
manipulation of almost all aspects of the
voices enabling you to create almost any
sound. Finally, options are given to save
music, include lyrics and make a hard
copy on a printer.
This is an excellent and complex
package which will appeal to users of all
ages.
Music Construction Set fr om
• Electronic Arts is a disk based package and
is similar in  many respects t o the
Activision program. Again an icon driven
system is provided by which you take
notes and place them on the musical
• slaves. There are 13 preset voices
provided ranging from harpsichord and
oboe thorugh to drum and ﬂute. There is
no facility to edit the sounds but the
presets provided are useful and effective.
The general feel of this package is of
greater musical accuracy with a more
serious ﬂavour. Several time signatures
are supported and a counter lets you
know if you try to stuff in too many notes
per bar,
The disk is  full o f  excellent
demonstration pieces. To test the brain, a
mystery quiz is provided.
Both this package and the Activision
program offer more limited educational
facilities in themselves. Where they do
,( ore, is as supplimentary tools for use in
connection with study of musical theory.
As such, they are really of most value for
children above eight years old.
Music Master by Supersoft returns to
the idea of using the computer as a
musical instrument. In effect the program
turns your CM (and C16) into a synthesiser
with a rhythm generator and a sequencer.
Graphically this package isn't as strong
as some of the others, but in many ways
it's more powerful, Most operations are
n i n
performed by  speciﬁc screens with
instructions provided at every step. There
are also three help screens.
The package comes in two main
sections, First you have a  real time
synthesiser where the keyboard can be
used to play notes on up to three voices.
Full control over the voices is provided
with the ability to make them interact in
an almost inﬁnite manner. Using this
facility you can create the most mind
boggling sounds, A rhythm is provided
which will drive up to two of the voices
allowing y o u  t o  p l a y  t o  a n
accompaniment. This is great fun.
In a manner similar to the Activision
and Electronic Arts packages, the
program can be used to compose music,
True musical notation is not used but the
system acts more like a  sequencer
remembering a sequence of notes.

Commodore M us ic  M a k e r  b y
Commodore SFX is marketed as a music
maker for beginners and musicians alike
It comprises of a plastic keyboard which
clips over the computer. The keys actuate
the top two rows of the computer
keyboard providing the  means of
generating sound. The package also
includes some software and a tutor.
The software effectively turns the M
into an electric organ rather than a
synthesiser. Using the function keys you
can control the octave used, select
monophonic or polyphonic and alter the
sound of  the voices. The means of
changing the voices isn't very easy to use
but it works after a fashion. A simple
sequencer is provided to allow you to
create and save compositions.
A keyboard tutor is provided in the
package. This gently eases the learner
through the stages of learning about
music, the relationship between the
keyboard and the score and musical
notation. The tutor consists of •V' tunes
starting with a very simple A u
Lune and ﬁnishing with Amazing Grace
with its key changes and accidentals.
There is a series of tutorials to go with
the Music Maker keyboard covering a
variety of musical tastes — everything
from the Beatles to Classics.
Another piece of software to go with
the keyboard is the Playalong Series of
Albums. These are cassette and booklet
sets which allow the user to play along
with programmed tunes. One album is a
selection of popular classics ranging from
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik to the March of
the Toreadors. Others include Beatles hits
and Bruce Springsteen.
Summing Up
I
on the cost but what you want from it. The
majority of the software described allows
the creation of musical scores albeit to
differing degrees of complexity. The best
course of action is to try them out at your
local shop, if possible, and weigh up the
facilities against your needs.
The play along types of program are in
the minority but they offer more for those
who simply want to have fun at the
keyboard without the need to learn
music. These also have an educational
a value since by playing with the notes, the
hild will pick up a feel for tonal and the
inter-relationships between notes.
Surprisingly, only the Supersoft

Since the daw n o f  the
computer age the prices of
home computers have been
steadily falling.
But, remarkably, the price
of a genuine, full-blooded disk
drive has  remained almos t
constant.
Constantly expensive.
You'll be lucky to pick up a
decent one for less than E200
in the shops.
Now, however, y ou c an
have one delivered t o  your
doorstep for only £119.95 (in-
cluding VAT and postage and
packing).
The new Triton Quick Disk
from Radoﬁn.
Its speciﬁcations are every bit the equal
of a E200 disk drive, as a glance at our card
above will conﬁrm.
Quick Disk uses the very latest tech-
nology to store up to 100K on high quality
Hitachi Maxell double-sided 2.8" disks.
Its disk operating system (DOS) uses
standard commands so it is truly easy to use,
as any computer novice will be glad to hear.
While the price will b e
compatible with most wallets,
there is aTriton Quick Disk com-
patible with most computers
-Commodore 64, Spectrum
(16K, 48K and Spectrum plus),
Aquarius, Dragon 64 and all
MSX Systems.
And, naturally, included is
an interface box plus all con-
necting cables and instructions.
In short, what we deliver
is a  complete, genuine disk
drive. Not a tape or wafer in
sight. All for only E119.95.
And w hen it  c omes  t o
speed o f  loading, the Triton
Quick Disk more than lives up
to its name.

APPRECIATE
FROM 0 TO READY IN 7 SECONDS.
To put the Triton Quick Drive through its
paces we used an ordinary computer game
-J et Set Willy.
From tape it took 170 seconds to load.
When loaded from theTriton Quick Disk
it took a mere seven seconds, That is 163
seconds less than the tape and certainly as
quick as most disk drives on the market.

STEALTH IS ANOTHER ARCADE OF-
fering from Ariolasoft in collaboration
with Broderbund.
You are in command of a Stealth star-
ﬁghter sent from Earth to destroy one
Dark Tower which is the nerve centre of a
formidable force governed b y  t h e
mysterious and evil "Council of nine".
You have been sent to this strange and
forbidding planet to destroy this tower
so as to protect the Earth , as our green and
sometimes not so pleasant land is to be
their next target of domination.
After loading the game you will see a
screen ﬁlled with the baddies you will
have to face if you are to succeed in your
mission, with their respective points for
their decimation. One of the good things
about this game is that you don't have to
read the inevitable twaddle on the inlay
card and if you do I'm sure, like me, you
will also ﬁnd said twaddle to be not too
short of misleading, but I suppose Ariola-
soft'would argue poetic licence.
The game starts with the rear end view
of your Stealth starﬁghter hovering just
above the surface o f  this forbidding
planet, which is a lovely vivid green and to
my mind doesn't look at all forbidding. To
make the ship go faster you just push the
joystick forward and as you do so you will
notice that the distance read out display
counts down faster. This, as you have
probably already worked out, is how far
you have to go before you are in a
position to deal the ﬁnal blow on the
tower which you can see on the horizon
and which doesn't appear to get any
closer even though the read out tells you
that it should.
As you hurtle towards it, the council of
nine (presumably) chuck every piece of
destructive hardware at their disposal in
your direction. In addition to this there
are certain "natural" hazards which you
must contend with, like anti-energy
clouds and on the higher levels active
volcanoes. A s  yo u  a re  h it  b y  t h e
defending ﬁre-power and you ﬂy through
the anti-energy clouds, your power level
is reduced. I t  also diminshes as you
proceed and shoot back. The state of your
energy is displayed on the screen at all
times and when it gets to a terminally low
level the read out ﬂashes, which unless
you can ﬁnd a positive energy ﬁeld to ﬂy
through, heralds your demise.
If you have been able to avoid all these
malignant forces you will notice that the
distance reading will eventually ﬂash at
zero and all you have to do is blast the
tower which, if you're successful will
disappear in  a  cloud o f  smoke and
spewing rubble, whereupon you lose
control as your starﬁghter glides off into
the somewhat bizarre sunset warping to
the next level where you regain control
and the nasties are nastier.
In short, Stealth is b y and large
(what a stupid expression but  you know
what I mean) a good game. It is very
"playable" and to the beginner ideal as an
introduction to the shoot-'em-up world
but I can't see it holding the attention of
any seasoned campaigner for too long.

WIZARD IS YET ANOTHER PLATFORM,
jump and collect game to hit the streets
and it will undoubtedly appeal to those of
you who appreciate a little strategy in an
arcade game.
As t h e program loads yo u  are
welcomed to Wizard and told to" prepare
to wield tue joystick" and attempt to
explore the various levels within. The
tools are your agility, cunning and magic.
You are ﬁrst given a  choice o f
demonstration, playing t he game o r
constructing your own game -  which
gives you full control of everything from
the placement of your wizard to the
amount of meanies and walls you're up
against. All very clever stuff, but I would
advise looking at the demonstration and
playing the game before you start creating
your own havoc because things do get
just a  shade weird as you progress
throughout the various levels.
Before play starts you are asked to
select level, number of players and speed
once done a mere ﬂick of the ﬁre button
brings your wizard to life. The basic idea
of this game is indeed a simple one. You
must proceed along the platforms, up and
down rope ladders and lifts, collecting
goodies while hunting for a key which
you must take to a lock to get you through
to the next level.
This ﬁrst level completed, you are next
introduced t o your ﬁrst ghoul which
chases you around in the -effort to end
your mystical life. A nice touch here is that
when you do expire and tumble to the
base of the screen your wizard's hat falls
off and he ends up on his butt with stars
ﬂoating above his head.
The graphics are quite simple but
effective and the levels of play do get
harder as there are more baddies to
contend w it h  which present new
problems as you go.
At £9.99, I think it's a bit overpriced for
what it is especially since, if it was less
expensive, I think it would be worth a
look.

EVEN A  SUPERLATIVE HOME CO M-
outer such as the C64 has limitations and
this game demonstrates its graphics cap-
abilities to best advantage but at the
inevitable cost of speed. The animation is
by far the best I have seen but these
movements are reminiscent of the slow
motion sequences in a Bruce Lee ﬁlm.
As a karate expert (the karateka of the
title) you have undertaken the task of
releasing the imprisoned Princess Mari ko
from the dungeon deep inside the castle
of Lord Akuma. Each section of the game
is loaded separately from tape and the ﬁrst
sequence shows the imprisonment of the
Princess in a sequence worthy of any
cartoon on television.
The ﬁrst action screen takes up the
story from the point where the karateka
hauls himself up over the edge of the cliff
upon which the castle stands. I mmeditel y
before him is the gate to the castle court-
yard and a guard readied for combat.
Fortunately for our hero this henchman of
Akuma is relatively unskilled in the art of
karate and soon you are on your way past
his huddled corpse, running through the
courtyard prepared to ﬁght your way to
the side of the princess.
There are two modes for our ﬁghter in
this game, one is the ﬁghting position and
the other is running. Woe betide the
karateka who inadvertantly runs into a
guard unprepared for battle; the ﬁrst
blow is always fatal and with only one life
to lose his years of training will prove
fruitless.
After gaining entry to the castle more
guards are encountered but these battles
are often preceded by an attack from Lord
Akuma's trained bird of prey which will
deplete your stamina unless you kick or
punch your way out of trouble.
Successfully ﬁghting your way through
the main hall brings you to a challenge
which helps to set this game above the
plethora o f  karate simulations which
appear to be ﬂooding the market at the
moment. You are faced with the problem
of passing a bamboo curtain which acts
like a portcullis. The unwary karateka
meets a sticky end and at this point under
the sharpened stems of the curtain and a
little thought is required to pass this
barrier.
The next phase lies still deeper in the
castle. Even the Princess has heard the
stirrings outside her prison and hope
springs anew. The next opponent is a grim
faced man, a karateka of immense ability
whose defeat leads you to a doorway
which is apparently impenetrable. Each
attempt to rush through results in a loss of
stamina and much thought and forward
planning is required t o  breach this
barrier.
For my money Karateka far outstrips
any karate game which I have played,
including Melbourne House's highly
successful Exploding Fist. Despite the slow
reaction of the main character, I found
myself too involved in ding dong battles
to notice. If I were to suggest a top 10 of
C64 games essential t o  anyone's
collection this would certainly feature if
only for the quality of the graphics.
E.D.
IT HAS TAKEN SOME TIME FOR THE
authors of Hampstead to come up with
their next offering but I can assure you
that Terrormolinos i s  a t  least a s
sarcastically annoying as its predecessor.
The object o f  this "well crucial"
adventure is to survive two weeks in the
God-forsaken hole called Terrormolinos
and take 10 (good) holiday snaps to prove
you've suffered it, cos believe me when
you've only got to the front door you're
going to need a holiday!
The game starts with you as husband
and father (the authors are obviously
chauvanistic) at home doing the packing
which you've left till the last minute while
the taxi is on its way to take you to the
airport. Simple, you may think, but there
are certain things you have to ﬁnd before
you will even be allowed in the taxi, which
presents a problem as the arrival of the
taxi, to a certain extent, heralds the end of
your packing time, and if you haven't
ﬁnished your packing or, conversely, if
you've packed too much, the taxi will
drive off and leave you and that will be the
end o f  y o u r  horrorday. As y o u
proceed through the game you will
experience some quite funny pictures
which are displayed when either you have
made a fatal mistake or you want to recall
one of your snaps to ﬁnd out if its a good
one. This is important as you only have a
ﬁlm with 12 exposures and, as already
mentioned, you've got to take 10 pics to
win the game - that is if you accept that
there are any winners in a game like this.
in short this adventure is everything
you would expect from the chaps that
created Hampstead and I ' d  like t o
congratulate them on not only a great
follow up but allowing us all into the
secret of what a good holiday is not about.

HENRY'S HOUSE AND FRIENDS
English Software £6.95
HENRY'S HOUSE AND FRIENDS IS, AS
the n a m e  suggests, a  c ompilation
package, f r o m  Englis h Softwar e,
comprising four of the old favourites.
Three are arcade games and the last
one, Stranded, is  an adventure with
graphics not too dissimilar to Level Nines'
game, but unfortunately that's where the
similarity ends.
They have been presented on one
cassette with two games on either side.
Side one carries Henry's House and Jet-
Boot Jack, both of which are platform
games which are even at the lower levels
quite difﬁcult.
In Henry's House you ﬁnd yourself as
little Henry in the clothes cupboard of the
royal household. I wonder if ol' Di knows
what the little horror is up to, bless his
little spun-gold socks, but if she doesn't
you'll ﬁnd out when you play the game.
Your task is to guide Henry round the
screen collecting various goodies and
avoiding some really gruesome obstacles,
like boots which, if  you're not quick
enough, stamp on the little chap, so you
(and HRH of course) can proceed to the
next level. It's a good game with really
good graphics b u t  i t  needs  s ome
perseverance as the collision detection
can only be described as ﬁerce, which is
something I found with all three arcade
games in this bundle.
Next is Jet-Boot Jack. It's much the
same as the previous game but I didn't
think it was as good, although it is quite
difﬁcult to get used to, and therefore well
worth playing.
'
Jack is a musical ﬁend and with jet-
boots ﬂaming he zips up and down lifts
and along slides in an attempt toamass the
largest music collection in the galaxy. This
you can safely assume is not without its
obstructions, namely bugs and gremlins
who are bent on stopping the intrepid
Jack. These little blighters are disposed of
by jumping up and down on the platform
above them till they lose their gripand fall
to their doom.
That's one side of the tape done. On
the other side is the adventure Stranded
and anot her  ar c ade g a me  c alled
Neptune's Daughters.
The adventure is n't t h a t  good,
basically due to its complete lack of any
atmospheric des c r iptions  a n d  i t s
infuriatingly small vocabulary. It is to say
the least completely uninspi ing, but
suppose its a good break from all that
climbing, collecting, and zapping you get
in the other three.
Neptune's daughters is a sub-aquatic
maze game where your task is to rescue
the daughter who has been captured by
the evil Sea Serpent. To do this you must
face various hazards such as deadly sucker
plants, swarms of amoeba, monster crabs
and an indestructable octopus. This, as
I'm sure you can imagine is all great fun.
H.H. and friends is as a package well
worth looking into. It will give hours of
fun at a reasonable price. An ideal family
entertainment substitute for those boring
ﬁlm repeats at Christmas time -  besides
with four games on one tape it'll save
space.
ONTY ON THE RUN
remlin Graphics/C64/f8.95
Monty's out! After breaking jail in Monty
Mole, this game picks up the story of his
life on the outside.
As you might imagine. Monty's world
is jus t a s  f u l l  o f  hazards a s  h is
imprisonment was and a nimble joystick
will be needed if you are to help him
complete his escape.
Each screen is  ﬁlled with crashing
clocks, bouncing beasts and tumbling
terrors. Add to this the accompaniment of
some of the best music I have heard in a
game and the stage is set for fun and
excitement.
One feature which lifts this out of the
humdrum melee of platform games is
Monty's Freedom Kit. At various points in
the game Monty will reach impassible
barriers, impassible that is if the correct
item is not in Monty's Kit.
The list of objects for use in the kit
consists of over 20 potentially useful items
but only ﬁve of them can be used. Mv
favourite choices are the ladder and the
barrel of rum. With these items you can at
least guarantee that if Monty gets stuck he
can always climb the ladder, jump into the
rum and go out smiling. The graphics for
the game are quite varied but it is obvious
that it is a conversion from the original
Spectrum version though a few extra
trimmings have been added to improve
the look of it.
The animation of Monty is rather cute.
Instead o f  jumping h e  somersaults
everywhere throughout this fascinating
game.

ORM AND CHEEP: THE BIRTHDAY PARTY/NARROW
SQ UEAKS M a c m i l l a n  Software 
e
a
c
h
ORM AN D  CHEAP HAVE QUICKLY
established themselves as ﬁrm favourites
on 1TV's children's programmes and their
adventures are ideal for a computer game
or two.
These two cassettes from Macmillan
Software bring the whole cast to the
computer screen in a series of games
which should hold a child's interest for
quite some time. The games are by no
means simple to play and require quite.
sophisticated mental abilities. O n  the
other hand the control of all the games is
the same and one key is all that is needed.
This can be on the keyboard or joystick so
anyone can play,
The Birthday Party is  Orm's cele-
bration but the guests have to be found.
This is Cheep's job but ﬁrst he must help
Orm t o ﬁnd the ingredients for  the
birthday cake.
As Orm crawls under a shelf or jars a
symbol appears whic h indicates t h e
content of each jar in turn. When Orm
reaches the edge of the screen a speech
bubble appears w it h  a n  ingredient
symbol and Cheep hovers over each jar in
turn_ When you think he is over the
correct jar, a keypress will reveal if you are
right. If you are not all of the jars crash to
the ﬂoor one by one and the game starts
again.
The next challenge is  t o  wander
through a simple maze to ﬁnd the other
party goers; Mouse, Hedgehog and Snail.
Mole is in his underground tunnels which
form a second, more difﬁcult maze to
explore.
Finding the ﬁrst three is quite easy
except that Hedgehog tends t o  b e
trapped by one of the villains of the piece:
Crow, R a t  o r  C a t .  I f  C h e e p  i s
accompanied by the correct combination
of friends, each of their enemies will
disappear.
Each junction has a signpost whose
arms change colour one by one. When it
points in the right direction you press a
key and off Cheep goes.
Eventually the entrance t o  Mole's
home is found and Cheep must enter
alone, ﬁne mole and get out again. At this
point I would strongly advise mapping the
maze because it is difﬁcult to keep track of
where you are,
Each tunnel leads to a small chamber
with more tunnels leading from it. When
you enter a new chamber the tunnel you
have just used is always at the bottom of
the screen so even using a map you have
to turn it  this way and that to follow
Cheep's progress. To add to the compli-
cation, some of the tunnels are blocked
by Rat, Cat and Crow.
Returning to the outside world the
group makes its way back to Orm's house
for the party_ Orm is a little fusspot and
insists that everyone sits down i n  a
particular place. As you move each guest
around the table Orm twitches his head
and a beep is heard for each place which is
correctly ﬁlled by a guest. Since Orrn's
empty space is also indicated by a beep
this game can be difﬁcult to play and even
I found it a challenge. It's a bit like playing
Mastermind,
Once you succeed, Orm disappears to
get his cake and Crow pops his head in
causing everyone to panic and change
places at the table. This does not suit Orm
when he returns and once again the
guests have to be rearranged into a new
order under his direction before the party
can at last proceed.
The second cassette, Narrow Squeaks,
has a different set of problems to be
solved. It begins with Cheep trying to
wake Orm by piling up crockery which
then crashes into a broken pile. This
certainly wakes Orm and I'm surprised
Cheep doesn't end up as Coq au Vin after
such appalling behaviour.
Next Orm is trapped by Crow and can
only b e  rescued b y  watching t h e
movements o f  his friends_ When the
pattern of movements change a keypress
will cause Crow to move further away
until h e eventually disappears off the
screen and Orm can escape.
The friends are then trapped in a tree
hollow by Rat and Hedgehog to protect
them as he guides them out. This means
keeping him between Rat and his friend
as they move across the screen.
Finally a ﬂood has ﬂoated Orm away
on his bed. As he is carried along by the
ﬂow he meets the enemies ﬂoating on
branches. He must steer his way so that he
just touches the edge of each branch,
spilling the enemy into the water.
After each section a scoreboard is
shown but, instead of giving a numerical
score, of sections of a picture is revealed.
Both packages are nicely illustrated in
graphics and sound but I did feel that one
or two o f  the games were extremely
difﬁcult for a young audience though
perhaps with parental advice this could
teach skills which would not be learned so
easily in any other medium.

DONALD DUCK'S PLAYGROUND
US Gold E9.95
)Ad'ALT DISNEY'S SECO ND M O S T
popular cartoon character paves the way
for the much heralded education series
distributed by US Gold.
Very American in ﬂavour, this is an
excellent vehicle for teaching children
about the relationship between work,
pay and spending in an ideal world. Well,
an ideal Capitalist world anyway.
After selecting one of the three levels
of play we ﬁnd Donald in the high street
with shops to the left and workshops to
the right. Using a joystick you can guide
him int o any o f  these buildings but
lacking money it's best to give the shops a
miss and try a bit of good honest toil
instead. No ducking the world of work,
Donald.
The choice is between working in a
signal box, a toy shop, produce makret
(fruit and veg market to us) or at an
airport.
No matter which option you select the
ﬁrst task is to decide how long the job will
last. Duration can be anything from one to
eight minutes and as each job is com-
pleted a  sum o f  money is added t o
Donald's earnings.
As a signalman, Donald must control
six sets of points on a railway network to
get the Amquack Express to its destination
by the shortest possible route. Each time a
journey is completed a new destination is
indicated and so on until the time runs
Out.
The toy shop tests a child's skill at
matching colours and shapes. A toy will
appear on the conveyor belt to the rig_ht
of the screen and Donald has to position a
ladder by the correct column of shelves,
collect the toy and then climb up and
place the toy on the correct shelf. To add
to the fun, the Amquack Express passes
when a clock ticks down to zero and if
Donald doesn't pull the shutters across all
of the toys will fall off the shelves and
smash to pieces.
Boxing fruit and vegetables is the task
at the produce market. As each item is
thrown from the back of a lorry. Donald
must catch it and drop it in the correct
box. If he misses a catch or drops the item
in t he wrong box  Donald's voice is
synthesised as he babbles his dissatis-
faction. Is he quacking up I thought.
The ﬁnal option is to be a porter at the
airport. A  conveyor belt carries boxes
with three letters on them which relate to
the letters on baggage cars being towed
across the screen. With the kind of care
and attention we've grown to expect from
baggage handlers world wide, Donald is
made to grab a box and throw it in the
general direction of the relevant truck. If
it lands in the correct one Donald earns

some money; if it lands in the wrong one
nothing is said. Just like the real world,
isn't it?
Once a  sum o f  money is  earned
Donald can go to the shop to buy various
items to add to the playground for his
nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie. The
three shopkeepers are Mickey Mouse,
Minnie and Goofy.
Each item for the playground has a
price and Donald can ﬂick through the
catalogue until he ﬁnds something he can
afford. The picture then shows Donald's
stack of money and a till. Using an arrow
cursor, coins can be moved one by one
into the transaction square until the value
is equal to or higher than the item he
wishes to buy. If he needs change the till
opens and you are invited to sort out the
correct amount.
Care must be taken to select a sensible
collection of items for the playground
because it is three ﬂoors high so at least
three ladders or cargo nets should be
provided so that the nephews can climb
up to play on the top levels.
One strong complaint I have to make
is that all the money is in dollars. Granted
the instructions state, rather feebly, that
this was maintained because o f  the
complexity of the program and that it's
good t o  learn about other people's
culture (is culture the correct word?). If
the des igner 's  a r e  a  g r o u p  o f
educationalists they ought to understand
that this kind of ploy can completely dis-
associate children from linking the game
with the real world around them. Please
US Gold request permission to change
this (and the questions to Monster Trivial
and you will increase your turnover.
Despite this niggle the game is ex-
cellent and well structured. Potentially a
useful learning tool.

FRANK BRUNO'S BOXING
Elite Systems E7.95 (cass) E11.95 disk
THE GLOVES ARE OFF IN THE BATTLE
for the boxing simulation market and I
predict that this is the one which will take
the championship_
The game is quite complex to play
requiring the use of either a joystick and
the keyboard or two joysticks. This means
that it would be best if you had a joystick
which could be held down by rubber
suckers but I'm sure that some of the
inventive minds out there will ﬁnd their
own solution to the problem.
PARADROID
Hevdson Consultants E7.95
A PARASITIC ANDROID, OR INFLUENCE
device as it is more correctly called, has
been sent in to suppress or destroy the
renegade androids o n  a  large space
freighter. Its  communication system
beams out a signal to your computer and
from the image received it is possible to
clear the decks of danger and repossess
the ship.
As a  follow u p  t o  the ultra-cute
Gribbly's Day Out, this game displays the
same smooth scrolling screen when the
paradroid is moved around the decks.
of both ﬁghters, below the line is the
boxing ring itself.
At ﬁrst the range of movements are
limited to ducking, dodging left or right,
head punches and body punches. As each
of Bruno's punches makes contact, a line
moves across t h e  b o t t o m  o f  t h e
scoreboard towards a KO symbol. When
this symbol is reached the meter ﬂashes
giving Bruno the ability to use his strong
right hook  and uppercut to ﬂoor his
opponent.
Each bout is a one round ﬁght and if
either of the boxers hit the canvas three
times within the round they are out for
the count and the bout ends. This is the
only way t o  decide a ﬁght, a  points
decision is not catered for.
The view of the ring is an interesting
one from behind Bruno. This makes a
pleasant change from the usual lateral
view that other versions use and is visually
more dynamic. T he opponents ar e
monstrously large sprites and the quality
of the game is very high indeed.
A parasite needs a host as an energy
source and this hi-tech device is  no
exception. When a droid is encountered
the decision must be made whether to
blast it with a burst from the twin laser
guns or to suppress it. If the latter option is
selected then the host droid will resist and
the screen changes to show a circuit inter-
face with the pa radroid. At the top of the
printed boards is a square which must be
changed to the correct colour of your
inﬂuence device if you are to succeed in
gaining control. Failure results in  an
Playing the role of Frank Bruno, there
are eight opponents to be defeated on
your way to the World Championship.
Each new ﬁghter has an amusing name
according t o  his  nationality and they
become progressively more skilled and
difﬁcult to beat as you rise in status. Each
ﬁghter must be beaten before you can go
on to meet the next one_ This is because of
the security system. On winning a match
you are given an Elite Video Boxing
Association Membership Code which is
calculated according to your initials. On
selecting the load option from the menu,
you ar e asked f o r  this code before
loading will take place.
The game is found on side one and the
data for the boxers is located on side two
of the cassette version. The only problem I
found with this system is that the code is
difﬁcult t o read but perseverence will
eventually bring success.
The screen display is split horizontally
and above the middle line you can see the
score chart ﬂanked by a cartoon portrait
explosion which will destroy both host
and parasite, taking you back to the start
of the game_
Limited energy reserves mak e i t
essential to change host regularly or an
alternative is to recharge at the power
points scattered around the ship. To ﬁnd
these places often means logging on to
one of themany computer links found on
every deck. From here it is possible to call
up a small scale map of the current level to
see where the recharging stations are
situated. It is also possible to display an
overview of the arrangement of levels
within the ship to plan your next move or
gain information about the other droids.

Although the programming is of a high
standard and the concept is sound, I
found the game to be a little monotonous.

What you get for your money is a twin
cassette pac k  containing t h e  master
program and plenty of questions to keep
you busy but more than this, there is an
editor program which allows y ou t o
create your own questions on tape.
The appearance of the game is fairly
uninspiring and it is obviously written in
a  I IS S a n
4t.
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE I  SAW AN

fact the last one I remember which was as
frantic as this was Gridrunner.
Arcade fanatics will be familiar with
the scenario. A three dimensional grid
Basic with no trimmings. This does not
detract too much from the game and
there are two redeeming features over
any other version which I have seenn.
Firstly, the questions are tailored for
the British market though they are not too
demanding, more like a junior version of
pursuits. F or  example, whic h player

geometrically shaped objects work their
way quickly towards you. You have a gun
which runs along the near edge of thegrid
and y o u  hav e t o  tak e everything
that's thrown at you.
In this version a small spider appears
on the grid and weaves cross webs before
the game starts. Then all hell breaks loose
as various creatures hurtle along the grid
switching lanes as they go. Some are
intent on making it up to the edge that
you are patrolling whilst others weave
more cross webs.
If you ﬁnd yourself in a sticky situation
with one or more 'things' on your base
line you can move down the grid turn
and ﬁre back at them, Although this kind
of activity can be totally absorbing, you

Secondly, instead o f  ty ping t h e
answers into the computer each player
must call out his answer and on pressing a
key the correct answer is revealed and the
computer asks if you got it right. This
eliminates problems such as entering
World War  I I  only  t o  ﬁnd that the
computer says that you are wrong and
that the answer is the Second World War.
Of course this does not eliminate the
work of nimble ﬁngered cheats.
The questions fall into one of  six
categories and the board consists of a
square ring of boxes each with a colour
corresponding to one of these subject
areas. The corner squares and the central
square on the top and bottom rows are
larger, bonus squares.
The computer rolls a dice to decide
how many moves the current player can
make, i f  t h e  question i s  answered
correctly, the player moves around the
board. lithe player is on a bonus square a
piece of pie is awarded and the ﬁrst player
to collect six pieces is declared the winner
on answering a question from a category
chosen by his opponents.
The one serious drawback to this game
is that it doesn't speed load the questions
and it takes ages to load each block of
questions (10-15 mins). Half way through a
game the computer may have to load up
another set which means another long
wait. I hope there is a disk version on the
way!

After a while, if you last long enough,a

new grid is drawn.
Each grid differs from the last in shape
and poses fresh problems. O n e  in

or you can use the monitor S

and 9C20 as ﬁlename, ﬁrst

should now have a copy of the
ﬁnished program.
Running t h e  Macro
Processor
The syntax o f  the external
command f o r  c alling t h e
Macro Processor is:
MACRO (sourceﬁle) (target-
ﬁle) (macrolibraryﬁle)
The macro libray ﬁle is optional
and can b e  the name of  a
library ﬁle up to 8K in length.
Note the spaces between each
entry. These must be included.
If ﬁle names are omitted from
the command, t h e  Mac r o
Processor will request them by
issuing t h e  pr ompt ENTER
FILENAME(s) whereupon you
should enter the names of the
ﬁles in  the same format as
above, without the command
MACRO of course.
Macros and their Uses
In a machine code program,
there may be sections of code
which are identical or nearly
identical differing only in the
operands. It can become rather
tedious having to type in these
copies o f  t h e  s ame tex t.
Wouldn't it be better to have
some sort o f  "in-line" code
generator which would accept
some parameters and alter the
text to suit?
This is  basically what a
MACRO is. A section of code
which can be altered to suit a
particular application. T h e
programmer gives the MACRO
a name and supplies parameters
and the processor generates
the code. MACROs may be
kept i n  lib r a r y  ﬁle s  o r
appended onto the end of a
program.
To make this a bit clearer,
c ons ider t h e  f o l l o w i n g
example. Suppos e i n  a
program, a sequence of three
almost identical lines repeats
itself o n  several differ ent
occasions. On one occasion it
may be:
DELAY1
DEL1
DELAY2
DEL2
DEL.SER
LDX
DEX
BNE
SEE
DEVI
and on another occasion it may
be:
LDX • $ 8 0
DEX
BNE D E L 2
As you can see, they are
very similar, differing only in
operands and symbols. For
reference only, I will call the
ﬁrst example DELAY1 and the
second DELAY2. These ar e
actually the symbols used and
not the name of the MACRO.
OK lees make this section of
code a  MACRO. To form a
MACRO we have to deﬁne it
by preceding the actual code
with a  c o u p l e  o f  lin e s
containing the name and any
parameters used. A MACRO of
our routine thus becomes:
MAC
: opening delimiter
DELCODE TIME
: deﬁnition line
LDX $ T I M E
actual code
DEX
BNE D E L S E R
MND
: closing delimiter
Every M AC R O  has  a n
opening a n d  a  c lo s in g
delimiter. The deﬁnition line
contains the name of the macro
and any parameters used in the
body of the routine itself. Here,
I is a formal parameter for a
label supplied by the MACRO
call, TIME is a formal parameter
for the actual delay amount
and DELCODE is the name by
which the MACRO is to be
called.
Note that I is positioned in
ﬁeld 2 beside the ﬁrst line of
the routine. If a parameter is
dec lared i n  a  M A C R O
deﬁnition, then t h e  actual
parameter must be supplied in
the call. An exception to this
rule is the symbol parameter in
ﬁeld 2 (here, this is the L). If this
is declared in the deﬁnition, it
may or may not be in the call.
However, if any MACRO call
contains more parameters than
are in the deﬁnition, an error
will occur.
One o t h e r  t hing here.
Notice the DEL,SER symbol. In
this format, each time the
MACRO is  called this  w ill
generate a unique symbol by
adding numbers onto the end
of the DEL.
This number is  a  serial
number which is incremented
for each MACRO call, Thus, if
the macro call is the ﬁrst, this
symbol w ill become DEL000
and if the call is the eighth, it
will become DELON'.
Right, our MACRO is ready
to be called. The format of the
calling line is, in these cases;
DEIAY1 D ELC O D E I F  and
DELAY2 DELCO DE 80
Now, a s s u m i n g  o u r
MACRO was to be called by
the ﬁrst of these two lines i.e.
DELAY1 then the generated
code would be:
DELAY1
DEL000
DELAY2
DEL001
LDX S F F
DEX
BNE D E 1 0 0 0
assuming that this was the ﬁrst
MACRO call.
Our s ec ond ex ample,
assuming it  was the second
MACRO call, would be:
LOX

Let's try a program. When
you have ﬁnished this example,
keep the ﬁles that are created
for next time when you will be
able to assemble the code.
A Programming
Example
Before s t a r t i n g  t h i s
example, make sure you have
the Monitor/Editor and Macro
Processor programs o n  t h e
same disk and that you have
made backup copies of them.
Having a "working disk" with
your utilities on it is by far the
most convenient arrangement.
If disaster strikes and y o u
corrupt the disk, at least you
will have a utility master disk as
backup although you should of
course backup any important
source ﬁles too.
Another convenient thing is
to have small loader program as
the ﬁrst ﬁle on your working
disk. Thus when starting out, all
you have to type is:
LOAD"*",8
RUN
and you'll load the Monitor.
A typical loader program, in
Basic, would be:
10 A=A+1:1FA=2THENSY5
33280
20 PRINT"LOADING MO NI-
TOR"
30 LOAD"MONITOR",8,1
Right n o w ,  o n  t o  t h e
example. First, we will create a
MACRO library ﬁle. MACRO
deﬁnitions may be held at the
end of a source program or in a
library ﬁle. T he latter is, I
believe, the most convenient
arrangement.
Load and enter the monitor.
Now is s ue t h e  c ommand
EDITOR to get into the Editor.
In response to the prompt, type
he ﬁlename MACLIB (short for
MACRO library) and hit return.
The message NEW FILE will
appear. Type the comand A.
The ﬁrst linenumber will be
pr inted a n d  t h e  c ur s or
positioned at the start of ﬁeld 2,
Type in the following program.
Remember that you can use
the Fl key to TAB to the new
ﬁeld. As a guide, there is a
heading g iv in g  t h e  ﬁe ld
numbers. Don't type it in!!
When the line number 130
appears, hit return to cancel
auto mode and type * to save

What this MACRO does is
to generate code which, when
assembled, w i l l  o u t p u t  a
prompt giv en b y  t h e  user
parameter PRO MPT  a n d
accept a line of input from the
keyboard. Wh e n  r etur n is
pressed. the start address of
the area of memory where the
input line has been stored by
the BASIC ROM routine $A560
is put into a pair of locations
given by the user parameter
POINTER.
Now we will deal with the
actual program. When i t  is
ﬁnally assembled, it will:
1 Clear the screen
2 Print a prompt
3 Accept i n p u t  f r o m  t h e
keyboard
4 Print out what was typed in.
It w ill us e t he MACRO
GETLINE for  steps t w o and
three. Don't worry too much
about the meanings o f  the
various instructions such as
ORG and EQU. These will be
explained when I deal with the
assembler.
Again, ther e i s  a  ﬁeld
heading to help you. Enter the
Editor and give the ﬁlename as
MACTEST. E n t e r  a u t o -
numbering mode and type the
following:
the MACRO is to generate a
subroutine and not, in  this
case, in-line code.
As you can see, the MACRO
GETLINE is called in line 140.
Notice the prompt parameter.
Instead of spaces between the
words, there are dashes. This is
an unfortunate restriction
imposed b y  t h e  M a c r o
Processor. Parameters must not
contain spaces. M u l t i p l e
par ameter s  s h o u l d  b e
separated b y  commas. T he
Macro Processor w ill only
allow characters whic h ar e
relevant to the assembler to be
passed through.
Right. Now we will process
the ﬁle MACTEST. Give the
following Monitor  external
command:
MACRO MACTEST MACOUT
MACLIB
Note that MACOUT is the
name of the output ﬁle, The
disk drive will activate and after
a few moments, the screen will
clear a n d  t h e  f o llo w in g
message will appear.
COMMODORE 6 4  UTILITY
SERIES.
MACRO PROCESSOR V1,0
(C) 1985 S.D.C.
Exit the editor using the •
command and type DIR. You
should now have two new ﬁles
called MACLIB and MACTEST.
To see them, use the TYPE
command in the form TYPE
MACLIB o r TYPE MACTEST.
The Monitor  w ill lis t them
directly to the screen, Note that
There will be much disk
activity and, if all is well, the
machine w i l l  re-enter t h e
monitor. Type DIR and you
should see that a ﬁle MACOUT
has been created. Use the TYPE
command to list the ﬁle to the
screen. You should see that the
processor has  inserted t h e
MACRO where the call was
and that the parameters have
been inserted in their correct
places. Note that, because the
Macro Processor performs a
renumber on the ﬁle, the line
numbers w ill b e  different.
Keep this program for  later
assembly.
Now, i f  y ou have been
given an error message by the
Error Summary
There now follows a summary
of error messages given by the
Macro Processor. When a n
error is detected, the message
is printed along with a  line
number, and the processing is
aborted_ The line number may
not be all that truthful, so watch
out!

UNLIKE PREVIOUS ISSUES IN WHICH I
have featured one language and reviewed
packages, this month twill concentrate on
one package — the ADA Training Course.
It's the only implementation of the ADA
language currently available for the C64,
but probably not the last.
The package is available from First
Software on disk only. Readers should
note that it is only a training course, and in
no way can b e considered as a  full
implementation of the language. Having
said that, it is possible to compile ADA
source into stand alone machine code.
The Package
You pays your money and gets the goods.
In the case of the ADA training course,
that's quite a lot. The documentation -
consists of a 77 page instruction manual
and tutorial which is packaged in a metal
ring binder. The system disk contains
numerous ﬁles including several ADA
source examples. an editor, assembler
and disassembler plus others.
At this point I must comment on the
documentation w hic h c an bes t b e
described as  poor . This is  probably
because since it was produced in West
Germany, it has suffered in the translation
to English. As it stands, it's very confusing
with parts that are crystal clear, and others
that are very hard to understand_
The documentation starts w it h a
description of how to use the (very good)
editor which is supplied with the package.
After that, a section is devoted to each
particular aspect of the ADA compiler i.e.
loops, decisions, assignment and so on.
There then follows some (not very well
written) tex t o n  h o w  t h e  compiler
operates. I t  takes several readings t o
appreciate (and understand) what the
author is trying to say, but it's well worth
the effort,
The ﬁnal part of the documentation
includes references to ADA grammer, a
list of keywords and soon. This is probably
the m o s t  c onfus ing p a r t  o f  t h e
documentation as there is no mention of
the ADA keywords that are implemented
in this version of the language.
The system disk contains 21 ﬁles in all,
Six of which are source demonstration
examples, plus a large ADA example in
source and object code form. An editor is
also supplied in the package. Unlike the
Commodore editor, the AD A editor
works on a line-by-line editing basis. The
user interface allows the colour of the

foreground/background to be changed
and several disk operations can be carried
out from within the editor.
Most of the compilation process is
controlled by the editor, with the user
being unaware that a lot is being done
'behind the scenes'. This includes the
initial c ompilation w h ic h  involves
performing t h r e e  c omprehens iv e
analytical tests on the ADA source code
(more on this subject later).
The other ﬁles on the disk include an
assembler which is used to produce a
machine code ﬁle from the ADA assembly
language ﬁle. A  nic e feature o f  the
assembler is that it can be used for your
own assembly programs as well. Also
supplied i s  a  disassembler, w hic h
although slow in operation is very handy.
Instructions on how to use the assembler
and disassembler are included in the ADA
instruction manual,
The AD A programming language was
designed by committee. That is, instead of
one man designing it, a working group
thrashed out proposals over a number of
years saying what the language should
and should not incorporate.
As a  result o f  this, the language
speciﬁcation is large — very large! And
ADA is  only  available for  mainframe
computers. This new language has been
adopted by the American Department of
Defence (DoD) as its ofﬁcial language so
ADA will probably become one o
primary programming languages of
near future. Anyone wishing to get
programming job in defence (or even ci
scientiﬁc programming) c o u ld  d
themselves a  favour by  learning th'
language.
ADA itself is a high-level structur
language which bears some resemblan
to Pascal i.e. it  is  a  block-structur
language. As with all languages, ADA ha
a number of keywords (table 1), but th
language also has packages. A packag
performs a speciﬁc set job. In the case
the ADA training course there are tw
packages, one for text handling (standar
ADA), and the other for machine speciﬁ
routines (non-standard). T h e  t w
packages are called TEXT-10 and CBM-
Here is a very simple example of a
ADA program.

The example itself achieves nothing, yet
does demonstrate some of ADA's features,
First, there are no line numbers used
in ADA. Although the editor creates them
for reference. Also notice that an ADA.

case — it doesn't matter which.
The program is called SIMPLE-PROG
and contains just one ADA statement

Notice how a package is declared before
anything else in the program.
Data types in ADA are numerous, and
the ones explained in the manual are real,
integer and string. Constants may be
declared from any of the types available.
Another aspect of the language is that
ADA is a strongly typed language and will
object if  you try to assign an integer
variable with a ﬂoating point value. There
are however, methods of type conversion
available.

with CBM-64; use CMB-64;

msg : string;
begin

end DECLAR;
This example shows how variables can be
assigned. Notice they can be assigned
with an initial value when they  are
declared. The example also points out
how indentation is allowed within the
source program.
Decision handling is quite simple yet
very versatile, T h e  IF , THEN, .ELSE
construct is supported in the following
manner.
if FRED > JIM then
set of instructions
else
another set of instructions
end if;
The example shows that a whole number
of instructions can be placed between the
IF and ELSE, or ELSE and END IF. If there is
no alternative set of instructions to be
executed, a simpler construct may be
used,
if TOM = HARRY then
do something
end if;
As is the case with Basic, a number of
logical operators may be used in the
comparison including; =, /= (meaning not
equal a n d > = .
Flow of control is catered for by LOOP,
and the more familiar FOR loop. Because
there are no line numbers in ADA, it is
necessary to reference by label.
FRED : loop
a sequence of instructions
end loop FRED;
The example demonstrates that the loop
has a label called FRED. The example
above is a bit silly as it is an endless loop. A
loop can be exited in  the following
manner.
FRED : loop
instructions
exit FRED when condition-is-met
end loop FRED;
It is a simple matter to include a loop
counter within the loop and exit when the
counter reaches the required value.
Another feature of ADA is that the
loops can be nested.
TOM : loop
instructions
DICK: loop
instructions
exit TOM when condition-is-met
end loop DICK;
end loop TOM;
From this you can see that it is possible
to exit any level o f  loops by  simply
specifying the loop name.
A far simpler method of using loops is
available by using the FOR loop.
for 1 in 1..10 loop
number of instructions
end loop;
Using the Compiler
The editor provided with the ADA tutorial
can best be described as comprehensive.
Not only does it allow programs to be
loaded/saved to disk, but a directory can
be displayed without disturbing any
program currently in memory.
One of the options in the menu-drive
editor is for compiling the source code,
and this is  where things start t o  get
interesting!
The editor will ask whether you are
sure, whether a trace will be required and
whether the code should ﬁrst be saved to
disk (a wise thing to dot).
There then follow three analytical
checks on the source code, which can
take a long time, depending on the size of
the source code, The ﬁrst check to be
performed is the lexical analysis which
'ﬁlters' the program and checks to see if
the program contains words that i t
doesn't understand.
The nex t check is  the syntactical
analysis checks to see if  the program
follows the rules of ADA grammar. Should
an error occur a detailed error message is
displayed together with an option o f
displaying the contents of the stack. (ADA
keywords have a value attached to them,
and by observing the stack it is possible to
see where the mistake has crept in).
When t h e  lexical a n d  syntactical
checks are being performed, the screen
displays the line number that is currently
being examined.
The ﬁnal 'check' is  t he semantic
analysis which performs two operations.
First it  checks to see if your program
makes 'sense', and secondly it produces
an assembly language version o f  the
source ﬁle. The assembly language is
saved to disk and displayed on the screen
or printer, together with the line number
currently being produced.
The ﬁnal stage of compilation involves
assembling the ﬁle produced b y  the
semantic analysis program. A  6510
machine code program is saved to disk
and displayed on the screen whilst this is
being done.
Summary
The steps involved in compiling an ADA
program may appear to be boring, but
they are not. The idea behind the ADA
tutorial i s  t o  g i v e  t h e  u s e r  a n
understanding of ADA as well as the low-
level aspects of compiler operation. The
package, in  my  opinion, succeeds in
doing this, and I can see many people
having hours of fun just poking about the
assembly ﬁles trying to match up the code
with the ADA source.
Having said this, I must criticise the
documentation that is supplied with the
package. For £49.95 I believe people are
entitled to expect a lot better than this.
The manual is so vagbue, that I still don't
know the number of keywords (listed in
listing 1) in this version of ADA. Because
of this, I would strongly recommend any
potential buyer to purchase one of the
ADA tutorial books which are now being

Title:
The Century Computer Program-
ming Course for the Commodore
64
Editors:
Professor Peter Morse and Brian
Hancock
Publisher:
Century Publishing
Price:
00.95
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A PROGRAMMER'S
book and is a very good one indeed;
although it is intended for those wishing
to learn Basic it is also a good reference
book f o r  t h e  m o r e  a d v a n c e d
programmer.
Peter Morse and Brian Hancock have
edited the programs in a constructive and
efﬁcient manner and, apart from an intro-
ductory section to get you acquainted
with your C64, the subsequent chapters
follow a logical pattern.
Part two contains the essentials of
Basic programming which are discussed
in some detail with particular reference to
'ﬂow c har ts ' w i t h  ac c ompany ing
programs based on such structural design.
Here you will ﬁnd a complete series of
programming methods involving control
with simple Basic statements.
Arithmetic functions are well handled
as are logical operations. At last we have a
section o n  string handling and loops
which will make sense to the beginner.
Subroutines, of course, are an integral
part of  Basic and good examples are
given. A l l  p r o g r a m s  a r e  q u i t e
unimaginative.
Part three is called the 'Complete Pro-
gramming Method and provides a great
deal of theoretical data for your consider-
ation involving design, control, decision
structures and error trapping.
Colour, sound and sprites are not
neglected and are adequately handled for
a book of this size. There is a good section
on high-resolution m o d e  w it h  b i g
mapping and colour control.
Lists, arrays and sorting ar e n o t
excluded and a brief resume of Machine
Code is given. In effect, this is quite
sufﬁcient, as MiC is a language of its own
r equir ing m u c h  m o r e  d e t a i l e d
instructions; perhaps the authors might
oblige i n  this  ﬁeld with a n  equally
instructive book!!
Last of all there is an Appendix Section
for reference plus a 'Program Library' - a
mixed dozen of routines including two
short games.
If y our interests lie  in  structured
programming then I would most certainly
recommend this book -  great value for
the price.

Title:
Commodore 64 Colour Graphics'
A Beginner's Guide
Authors:
Shaffer and Shaffer
Publisher:
The Reston Computer Group
Price:
£14.50
THIS IS A REASONABLY WELL STRUC-
tured book  whic h is  hidden amidst
excessive rambling; there is far too much
advice given o n how  t o type in  the
programs and muc h o f  the program
analysis is duplicated.
If you can ignore the superﬂuous 'chat
ﬂow' and get to the programs then you
will ﬁnd that y ou have, initially, a
complete system f o r  dr awing a n d
painting. Indeed the colourful frontpiece
can be reproduced; this will take you
through to chapter ﬁve with various side
issues on the way about drawing triangles,
squares etc.
However, let it be said that this is all
done in Basic and is painfully slow. Your
ﬁnal picture will take some 15-20minutes
to appear on the screen - as pointed out
by the authors.
A Toolbox is laboriously built up to
enable you to do this. Fortunately it is
listed in its complete form in Appendix B.
E
N
C
E
The ZAP procedure is quite ingenious and
will put you into drawing and painting
mode by retaining all the subroutines.
The Toolbox also has a sprite handling
routine which is fairly standard.
Gratefully, you can speed up all the
drawing and painting routines which you
have s o carefully listed by  going t o
Appendix D  where you will ﬁnd the
speedy machine code numerical data
listed with check-sum errors (six blocks of
data). A  routine is  included t o  save
pictures to tape or disk.
Well -  the choice is yours between
Basic and M/C. Obviously the latter is
preferable so read the bobk thoroughly
ﬁrst of all and then make your decision. As
the authors say 'stop, run the program and
you're done'. Agreed!!
All programs are functional but the
book is considerably overpriced.

THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ANY CM
user who is interested in the more serious
side of computing.
The authors will be familiar to Your
Commodore readers for their succession
of interesting and informative articles on
various aspects of C64 use.
The book, overall, is easy to read and
packed full o f  information. The style
makes it suitable for all levels of user from
novice to would-be expert. All but the
most knowledgeable can learn from it.
There ar e o n e  o r  t w o  "Michael
Caines" in it, such as - did you know that
"the ﬁrst stored-program computer was
constructed at Cambridge University in
1949?" and "we have to thank an IBM
engineer called Shugart for the develop-
ment of the ﬂoppy disk"? Not a lot of
people know that!
The Stephensons have extended user
friendliness to the text of their book and
provide enough diagrams, explanations
and examples to make a complex and
potentially d r y  subject very straight-
forward and interesting.
Example p r o g r a m s  a r e  us ed
throughout the book t o  illustrate the
various processes, becoming increasingly
sophisticated as you progress.

four you will know how a ﬁling system is

created and maintained. So much food
for thought is provided that you will be
tempted to get straight to the keyboard
and start creating. However, there are
more gems to come...
Avoiding d r y  academic analysis,
Chapter ﬁve deals very succinctly with
searches and sorts, culminating in  an
impressive machine code routine which
handles two-dimensional string array
sorts at a great rate of knots.
The ensuing Chapters give a good
description of ﬁle structures, explaining
the pros and cons of the various types -
again, in language which is plain enough
for a newcomer to grasp and sufﬁciently
in-depth to satisfy even the experts. Once
more, there are useful program routines
to expand upon the text.
The appendices incorporate a true
glossary and a list of 6502 mnemonics.
A nice touch is the self-test section at
the end of each Chapter. A good guide to
whether y ou hav e understood t h e
content.
All in all, this book should prove a
great asset to any CM user who wishes to
progress from playing games to making
serious home/business use of the C64 or
to anyone who wants to customise a
ﬁling/database system currently in use
but does n o t  f ully  appreciate t h e
intricacies of data handling in relation to
computer disks and tapes.
This book achieves all it sets Out to do -
a comprehensive prospectus of the basic
sort/ﬁle techniques available on the CM,
giving simple but instructive guides to
efﬁciency whether using 1541 units or
tape drives.
Thoroughly recommended! I n  my
opinion - great value, well presented, full
of useful hints, tips, and information. My
copy will remain in a prominent position
on my bookshelf alongside such weighty
tomes as "The Wilt Alternative" and "I,
Ian Cremer".

Title:
The Koala Pad Book
Author:
David D. Thornberg
Publisher:
Addison Wesley
Price:
02.95
THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY THE IN-
ventor of the touch tablet or Koala Pad.
He has an axe to grind in the sense of
wishing to promote the idea that that
Koala Pad is all things to all computer
users but in  keeping with his earlier
books, on graphics and LOGO, he has
resisted the temptation to follow this idea
through.
In the case of a peripheral like the
Koala Pad people buy one, plug it in, use
the pretty picture type software to do a
few scribbles on the screen, load some
pictures thoughtfully provided by  the
manufacturers to show what can be pro-
duced and then, if they lack a certain
tenacity, they put it away and never use it
again. This book will stop you doing that.
Clearly, Mr Thornberg is an enthusiast
and this enthusiasm is demonstrated on
almost every page, beginning with a little
history about Koala Pads.
Chapter Two is called "How to get the
most out of the illustration software". This
is the software which accompanies the
Koala pad and you immediately ﬁnd that
there is more to this than meets the eye.
The book is liberally illustrated with a very
large number  o f  pictures plus  t h e
occasional plug f o r  some additional
software and books which are available.
Chapter Three, "Getting pictures on
paper", is a useful one. It emphasises that
the choice o f  the correct or  at least
appropriate printer is all important in
getting a decent reproduction. The Epson
Series is rightly praised in this regard.
There is a substantial discussion about
interfacing and we even ﬁnd a section on
photographing t h e  pictures o n  y our
screen -  an inspired thought. Video-
taping your pictures is also covered.
Chapter F our  deals  w it h  o t h e r
applications for the Koala Pad other than
drawing pretty pictures. It turns out to be
nothing mor e than a  lis t o f  other
programs available for use with the Koala
Pad, These are available in the United
States but not here and as such this
chapter is  o f  little value. There is  a
tendency for these programs to be rather
expensive so their importation into the
UK seems unlikely. You can of course
arrange to import them yourself which is
not a particularly difﬁcult thing to do.
One of the programs involved is a LOGO
Design Master, and an interesting idea
demonstrated is the use of an overlay card
which clips on to the Koala Pad aiding
handling this.
I was a little disappointed to see that
COMAE was not covered since it can be
used with the Koala Pad. The procedures
to do this and indeed to print Koala Pad
pictures have been written and are in the
public domain and COMM. of course
contains t h e  entire Logo capabilities
anyway.
Chapter Five is particularly interesting
and is called "Replacing the Joystick, the
Koala Pad alternative". This is a very down
to earth and honest appraisal, I quote,
"You will ﬁn d  that the cursor o r game
piece under your control will drift to the
upper left hand corner of the screen
when you lift your ﬁnger off the tablet,
unlike joysticks Koala Pads transmit
special co-ordinates to let the computer
know when the ﬁnger or stylus hand is
lifted. Most joystick programs interpret
this lifting signal as a command to read the
upper left hand corner of the screen."
Well, you can't be fairer than that!
There follows a discussion on a variety
of games and their performance with the
Koala Pad. A  number o f  these ar e
available i n  t h e  UK, notably Pinball
Construction Set and Choplifter, plus
Droll and Lode Runner.
Chapter Six is interesting, covering the
use of the Koala Pad within your own
programs. I think it's fair to say that if you
do not use your Koala Pad within your
own programs then you must have been
wasting your money. This chapter shows
how to use the Koala Pad with Logo, Pilot
and Basic.
Chapter Seven is called "What Next"
and includes some ideas for your own
Koala Pad application. These include
using the Pad as a game board and as a
musical instrument. Many applications
can beneﬁt from the use of the Koala Pad
as a custom keyboard.
Then follow appendices of references
and resources. These include t he
suppliers of many of the programs listed.
There is also a glossary of terms, which
helps the novice to understand some of
the jargon which is thrown about and
there is a comprehensive index.
Summing up this book is difﬁcult. It is
extremely expensive so is the Koala Pad,
so presumably if you can afford the one
you can afford the other. It is something
of a privilege to have the designer of a
revolutionary piece of equipment sitting
at your elbow telling you how to get the
best out of it. Users of the Koala Pad will
ﬁnd this is a worthwhile purchase.

well known for the horrible little black

that explained exactly what the black
blobs were meant to be. Unfortunately
the graphic s  characters w er e n o t
documented and these still cause some
confusion. For this reason we are starting
to use a new method for marking the
control and graphic characters in our
listings.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT) means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT], All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.

This month our
graphics man, Allen
[Webb, shows you howl
là  get those
backdrops scrolling.
HELLO THERE, I THINK YOU'LL
ﬁnd this month's offering
rather useful if  you're into
graphical adventures o r
platform type games.
I'm sure you've come acros
titles such as Monty Mole,
Boulder Dash and Spelunker
which use a huge backdrop for
the game. The screen normall
shows a  small area o f  the
backdrop and the backdrop
scrolls as you move to a new
play area. Got the idea? This
article will provide you with the
technology to perform a similar
task. Whilst it doesn't use single
pixel movement a la Crowther,
it works well enough for most
purposes.
So what are w e doing?
Consider Figure 1. The normal
screen holds 1000 locations in
which we can store a picture.
Under the Basic ROM there are
eight kilobytes o f  memory
which can b e used to hold
pictures. If we also use the area
between the ROMs there are
12 kilobytes of memory. The
idea is to extract a portion of
the picture and put it on the
normal screen.
The window on the 5creen
can be any rectangle of WW
characters w id e an d  W H
characters high. The position of
the square can be speciﬁed by
the co-ordinates XY and YW of
its top left hand corner. We also
need to know which part of the
map to display. The top left
hand corner of the map data is
speciﬁed by X and Y. The width
of the map under the ROM is
P r o g r a m m i n g
Figure 1. The main variables
speciﬁed by MW. The width of
the map is up to you but is
limited to no more than 256
characters wide (MW=255).
Here are some examples of the
size of map possible using the
12K available:
Map width
256
80
Map height
48
150
From this you can see that it
is possible to have up to 12
screenfuls! The selection of the
map width really depends on
the type o f  map. You will
probably ﬁnd it easier to design
maps smaller than 80 characters
wide — I will explain why later.
The package uses t w o
commands. The ﬁrst has the
syntax:
SYS
YW
40192,WW,WH,MW,XW,
The routine sets u p  the
position and size of the screen
window and the width of the
map. This can be changed at
any time without corrupting
any map data. Obviously, this
command must b e  called
before any attempt is made to
display the map.
The second command
actually draws the map in the
window and has the syntax:
SYS 40195,X,Y
This command takes a
rectangle of data with top left
hand co-ordinates X,Y from the
map data under the ROM and
puts it in the window on the
screen.
AW
Since the map data i.e. the
characters put to the screen,
occupy a lot of space, it follows
that an equal amount of RAM
would b e  required for the
colour data. This is obviously
not on and I  chose another
approach to the problem of
colours. Starting at location
40489 is a table 255 bytes long.
This is used to hold the colour
that each character will adopt.
The position of each character
in the table is determined by its
POKE value. For example, the
character u s e s  t h e ﬁrst
position 40489_ As a general
rule, the position of a character
is given by:
Position in table = 40489 +
POKE value
Some further examples are:
To get red 'A's POKE 40489+1,2
To get blue '='s POKE 40489+6
Demonstration 1  gives a
simple idea of how to use the
routines. Lines 20-50 ﬁll the
area under ROM with a simple
sequence of characters offset
by one to give diagonal stripes.
Line 60 ﬁlls the colour table.
Line 63000 sets u p  a  1 0
character wide, 25 character
tall window, at the extreme left
of the screen. The map is set to
60 co lu m n s w i d e .  T h e
remainder o f  t h e program
allows you to scrolll the map in
all directions using the cursor
keys but without running off
the map horizontally.
The routine is set up with
the assumption that the screen
is at the normal position of
$0400 (1024). If  you want to
have the screen elsewhere, you
should include the following
line early in your program:
POKE 4  0 2 6 5,PEEK( 6 4 8):
POKE40401,216-PEEK(648)
This tells the routine the
current page of  the screen.

Nick Hampshire brings you
[four new commands to add
[to your extended Basic.
1
IN THE LAST TWO ARTICLES IN THIS
series I have given all the initialisation and
wedge routines needed t o  add extra
commands t o  t h e  Basic o f  a  C64
computer.
Also, I have now given the code to add
ﬁve new commands to Basic. These are,
CTL, APPEND, CHANGE, DUMP and
FIND.
This month I am adding a further four
commands. They are, AUTO, CHAIN,
DELETE and RENUMBER. These four
commands like the four given last month
are very useful 'toolkit' type commands
for e d it in g  a  p r o g r a m a n d  a r e
consequently all used in  direct mode
(except CHAIN which can be used in
program mode).
All four new commands require that
the wedge and initialisation code (given
in the ﬁrst article in this series) are present
in memory at the correct locations and
that their command names and entry
points are stored in the correct tables.
These four commands are independent of
the previously added commands and can
therefore be used without last month's
routines. To ensure that you have the
wedges a n d  n e w  routines correctly
positioned the Basic loader at the end of
this article is a repeat of last month's with
the four new commands added.
The programs in this series of articles
are modiﬁed extracts fr om the book
Advanced Commodore 64 Basic Revealed
by Nick Hampshire and published by.
Collins.
AUTO
Abbreviated entry: A(shift)U
Affected Basic Abbreviation: None
Token: Hex SEE$04, Decimal 238,4
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended Mode: Direct only
Purpose: To save time when entering a
program by providing the user with the
next line number t o  b e entered. T o
enable the AUTO line numbering, enter
AUTO followed b y  the line number
increment. To disable AUTO just enter
AUTO without a number. The next line
number is picked up from the previous
line typed in, so if you enter a line 10 with
the auto step at 10, the next line number
would be 20. If you changed this number
to, say. 100 and entered that line, the next
I E
line number displayed would be 110. A
new line number is not displayed if there
is nothing entered on the line.
Syntax: AUTO Istepl
Errors: Syntax error — if the step value is
greater t h a n  63999 (maximum lin e
number).
BUILU A BETTEL
Use: The command is used in direct mode
to e n a b le  o r  dis able AU T O  l i n e
numbering. When enabled, AUTO will
produce line numbers after entering a
line until it is disabled with AUTO without
an increment value. If you wish to exit
from t h e  AUTO facility when a  line
number has been displayed, either press
return (which will delete that line if it
exists), or cursor down off that line.
Routine Entry Point: $8537
Routine Operation: First, this routine
checks t o  see i f  there is  a  number
following it. If not it will disable AUTO,
otherwise it will read the number and
store as the step and enable AUTO. The
actual routine is wedged into the crunch
tokens link. It ﬁrst checks that the ﬁrst non
space character in the input buffer is a
numeric character and sets a ﬂag to say yes
or no. The line is then tokenised and if
there was no line number, or there was
nothing following the line number, the
routine exits. If the previous line typed in
had a  lin e  number w ith something
following it, the line number is read from
the pointer. The step is then added to it,
and the number converted to ASCII and
inserted into the keyboard
CHAIN
Abbreviation: CHA(shift)I
Affected Basic Abbreviations: None
Token: Hex SEE $07, Decimal 238,7
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended Mode: Either
Purpose: To load and run a Basic program
from tape or disk. After the program has
been loaded, variable pointers are set to
the end of the program.
Syntax: As in LOAD.
Errors: As in LOAD.
Use: CHAIN is used to load and run a
Basic program. It will work from another
program or in direct mode having the
same effect. I f  us ed f r om another
program, it  is  more convenient than
LOAD as LOAD does not set the variable
pointers and, if the program you load is
larger than the one in memory, when
variables are used they will corrupt the
end of the program.
Routine Entry Point: $8684
Routine Operation: The CHAIN routine
simulates the LOAD routine as far as the
program has been loaded. From there,
variable pointers are set to the end of
load, the run mode ﬂag is set, and then
three operations cause the program to
run:
JSR SAW ;perform CLR
JSR 5A68E ;set charger pointers to the start
of program
JMP SA7AE ;execute NEXT command
DELETE
Abbreviated Entry: DE(shift)L
Affected Basic Abbreviations: None
Token: Hex SEE309, Decimal 238,9
Modes: Direct and program
Recommend Mode: Direct only
Purpose: To delete a range of unwanted
lines from a Basic program.
Syntax: DELETE [start lme'-Lend line]] -
although all parameters are denoted as
optional, at least one of the parameters
must be given.
Errors: Syntax errors - if DELETE is used
without parameters.
Syntax error —  i f  either o f  the line
numbers is less than zero or greater than
63999.
Use: DELETE is used to delete a range of
lines in a Basic program. These can be
lines of, say, a data generating program
after the DATA has been created. For
example:
DELETE 100-150 — deletes lines 100 to 150
inclusive.
DELETE -1000 — deletes all lines up to line
number 1000.
DELETE 2000- — deletes all lines from 2000
to the end of the program.
DELETE 0 d e le t e s  the whole program.
Program lines that have been DELETEd
cannot be recovered as they have been
wiped from memory.
Routine Entry Point: $89AD
Routine Operation: DELETE ﬁrst gets the
range o f  the delete and then loops,
moving the memory above the range over
the top of the deleted area.

RENUMBER
Abbreviated Entry; R(shift)E
Affected Basic Abbreviations: READ - -
RE(shift)A
Token: Hex SEE,S16, Decimal 238,22
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended Mode: Direct only
Purpose: To renumber a Basic program in
even lin e  number steps. A l l  RUNs,
GOT0s, GO TOs. GOSUBs, and R U Ns are
renumbered if found.
Syntax: RENUMBER start, step — where
start and step are values between zero and
63999 (variables are not allowed).
Errors: Syntax error — it the syntax above
is wrong.
Syntax error — will occur in pass one if a
number following any of the commands
mentioned in 'Purpose' are 0  or 63999.
Undeﬁned xxxxx in old line yyyyy i f  a
line does not exist.
Syntax Error -  will occur to pass two if
the new line number is greater than 63999.
Use: RENUMBER is useful for opening up
program lines for the insertion of more

NIGH PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS

Choosing the right computer
is a good start — but can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 54 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it al works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
I o use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!
SUPERSOFT, Winchester House, Canning Road,
Wealdstone, Harrow, Middlesex HA3
Telephone: 01-861 1166
Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!) The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands, or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STD( QUINX
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
