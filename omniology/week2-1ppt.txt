Types of Glial Cells 
Peripheral Nervous System 
 
Schwann cells – one cell myelinates  
 
a portion of an axon 
 
Central Nervous System 
 
oligodendrocytes – one cell myelinates  
 
many different axons 
 
 
astrocytes – support neurons 
 
 
microglial cells – immune cells of CNS 

Key Concepts 
Neurons and glia are the principal cells of the 
nervous system. Neurons transmit information by 
ion conduction. Glia provide structural and 
metabolic support for neurons.
