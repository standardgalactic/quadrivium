Integrating SuccessFactors™ with SAP
®

Dear Reader,
SuccessFactors is on the rise. For HCM customers and consultants familiar with 
what SuccessFactors is and the advantages it offers, the question of how to jump on 
this bandwagon and address the best method of integration still remains.
As foreword writer David Ludlow states, the integration of cloud-based and on-
premise HCM systems is not just a technical issue, but also a business issue. 
SuccessFactors consultants, customers, and system integrators need to evaluate 
where each organization fits into the bigger SuccessFactors picture, and weigh the 
variables involved in each option for moving to the cloud. By addressing these busi­
ness issues, they can begin identifying what options meet their technical needs.
Written by experts with decades of SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors experience, 
this book walks through the different integration stages and enables you to make 
informed decisions about your company’s integration strategy. Delivering in-depth 
coverage on the packaged integrations for each deployment model and real-world 
case studies to provide a roadmap for implementation, this resource will help you 
make more educated choices and continue your SuccessFactors journey.
What did you think about Integrating SuccessFactors with SAP? Your comments and

1 Foreword
When SAP acquired SuccessFactors in 2012, SuccessFactors was—and now con-
tinues to be—a leading HCM solutions provider to organizations both within and
outside of the SAP install base. Many existing SAP customers showed immediate
excitement about the acquisition, but also had questions about integrating the
SuccessFactors cloud solutions with the SAP on-premise solutions. From day one
that we knew we would have to assume some responsibility of this integration by
identifying key scenarios and providing integration content to help our custom-
ers deploy these solutions quickly, with low cost and risk.
From my over 10 years’ experience gained by leading the HCM product manage-
ment team at SAP, and by meeting hundreds of customers over that time, I have
learned that integrations are not just a technical issue, but also a business issue.
Data mapping, data synchronization, real-time vs. batch, understanding the system
of records for each data element, creating end-to-end processes without regard to
the backend system, where to do reporting and analytics—these are just some of
the items to consider when thinking about integrations. Customers who pay early
and adequate attention to the topic of integration are far more likely to increase
their chances of completing their projects on time and on budget to deliver on the
needs of their businesses in an effective and timely manner.
Recognizing these needs, we have built and delivered packaged integrations, inte-
gration tools, templates, and application programming interfaces; which we con-
tinue to maintain and add more to all the time. This productized integration con-
tent and integration technologies help customers connect the SuccessFactors
cloud and SAP on-premise worlds, and determine when and how they will lever-
age cloud solutions while still maximizing their, often significant, on-premise
investments.
To date, these integrations have focused on three primary deployment models:
Talent Hybrid, Full Cloud HCM, and Side-By-Side HCM. Under the Talent Hybrid
deployment model, customers run core HR processes (such as Personnel Adminis-
tration [PA], Organizational Management [OM], and SAP Payroll) on-premise with
SAP ERP HCM, connecting it with cloud-based SuccessFactors talent solutions

(such as employee performance management, SuccessFactors Learning, and Suc-
cessFactors Recruiting) and, optionally, Workforce Analytics. Under the Full Cloud
HCM deployment model, customers run all of their HR processes in the cloud, but
need to connect HR processes and data with third-party systems and on-premise
SAP ERP. The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is for customers who use SAP
ERP HCM to deliver core HR processes for a subset of their employees and use
Employee Central to deliver core HR processes for another subset of their employ-
ees. These three deployment models have been carefully designed to meet the
varying needs of customers in their journey to the cloud.
The integration packages, timelines, technology, and roadmap have generated
many questions from our customers. We have also received many questions about
the real-world experiences of customers who have successfully implemented the
packaged integrations. In their book, Integrating SuccessFactors with SAP, Venki
Krishnamoorthy, Donna Leong-Cohen, Prashanth Padmanabhan, Chinni Reddy-
gari, Vishnu Kandi, and many more expert contributors provide valuable content
and insight that can guide consultants, customers, and partners through the evalu-
ation, design, and implementation phases of all three deployment models. The
authors and contributors are a combination of SAP employees, partners who cre-
ated best practices content for integrations, partners who implemented the vari-
ous deployment models for large global customers, and technical architects who
have implemented both packaged and custom integrations for thousands of cus-
tomers. I am sure that you will benefit from their collective wisdom.

1 Preface
In a January 2014 article in the Wall Street Journal, Marc Andreessen, an Internet
pioneer and venture capitalist, compared the cost of starting a technology com-
pany today to the cost of starting a technology company in the 1990s. He said that
if you wanted to build an Internet company in the 90s, you needed to buy Sun
servers, Cisco networking gear, Oracle databases, and EMC storage systems, and
spend a ton of money just to get up and running. Andreessen stated that today’s
companies can go to Amazon Web Services and pay per use to get the same ser-
vices for about 1,000 times cheaper. Such a reduction in cost is speeding up the
progress of technology and the pace of innovation. This innovation has revolu-
tionized the consumer software industry and is spilling over into the enterprise
software industry starting with customer relationship management, procure-
ment, travel and expense management, and HCM. Today, almost all innovations
in the areas mentioned above are being done by vendors who provide their soft-
ware as a service rather than as a package that can be installed behind the fire-
walls of an organization.
Book Goals
The journey to the cloud, for most areas of enterprise software, is inevitable.
However, unlike most consumer software, where the costs are low and switching
technology vendors is easy, enterprise software investments are huge and costly
to abandon. So, while the journey to the cloud for some customers will be swift,
for others it will be in stages. This is one area where integration plays an import-
ant role. Integration can help organizations start their journey to the cloud at
their own pace.
In this book, we attempt to explain the evolution of enterprise software and how
integration content and technologies from SAP and SuccessFactors can help with
the move to the cloud. Each chapter addresses the needs of a specific audience
and a specific set of topics. We’ll begin by looking at the target audience for this
book and the structure that can be expected.

Preface
18
Target Audience
The target audience of this book includes SAP and SuccessFactors functional con-
sultants, cloud solution architects, integration designers, and integration middle-
ware consultants who implement packaged integrations that connect SuccessFac-
tors to SAP and third-party applications, or create custom integrations to suit
their needs. In addition, this book can also be a valuable guide for senior execu-
tives such as chief information officers, chief HR officers, and chief financial offi-
cers who have the need to move their HCM software to the cloud.
How This Book is Structured
This book is divided into the following 3 parts and 11 chapters:
 Part I: What Does the Cloud Mean for You? 
This portion aims to introduce the current HCM environment in which custom-
ers are moving to the cloud and certain considerations that should be made in
getting there.
We begin with a discussion of the fundamentals in Chapter 1, introducing the
evolution of HCM architecture, the current trends in enterprise software, and
SAP’s strategy to respond to those trends. If you are a chief financial officer, chief
information officer, chief people officer, vice president of human resources, or
director of information technology, this chapter is for you. We also provide an
overview of what is happening in the HCM technology industry and describe
how the technology landscape is evolving. We then discuss SAP’s strategy to
respond to this evolution and talk about how SAP is helping you move to the
cloud with various software deployment options supported by integration con-
tent and tools.
Next, in Chapter 2, we look at how information technology teams within orga-
nizations and software technology service providers can help customers make
their journey to the cloud. If you are a chief information officer, director of infor-
mation technology, a partner in a software consulting firm, a solution architect,
or vice president of professional services in a technology service firm, this chap-
ter is for you. We start by discussing who is moving their HCM software to the
cloud and elaborate on the factors driving this movement. We then talk about
the three main stages that play out in the decision-making phase of cloud migra-
tion. These three stages include: the business architecture review stage, the
product review stage, and the solution architecture review stage. We end the
chapter by providing an in-depth case study of a customer’s journey to the cloud.

 Part II: SuccessFactors Deployment Models 
This part looks at the three SuccessFactors deployment models which provide
different pathways to the cloud. They include Full Cloud HCM, Talent Hybrid,
and Side-By-Side HCM.
Chapter 3 looks at the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, discussing its archi-
tecture, target audience, and technology options for integration. We then go
into detail about the supported packaged integrations for this deployment
model. We then cover the user experience integrations and rapid-deployment
solution related integrations that are involved with Full Cloud HCM. Finally,
we apply real-world application with the use of two in-depth case studies that
follow the implementation of this deployment model. Ultimately, this chapter
can tell you how you can take a huge jump in technology and user experience
innovation while reducing the total cost of ownership for HCM software at the
same time.
Chapter 4 discusses the Talent Hybrid deployment model. We start by looking
at its architecture, target audience, and the various technology options that can
be utilized during implementation. We then provide details about the supported
packaged integrations for this deployment model, followed by a look at the user
experience and rapid-deployment solutions related integrations. Finally, we dis-
cuss two case studies about customers who made their move from on-premise
talent management systems to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions in the cloud,
while keeping their core HR and payroll on-premise.
Finally, in Chapter 5 we look at the newest deployment model by SuccessFac-
tors and SAP, Side-By-Side HCM. We start by discussing the target audience for
this deployment model and the two available beta packaged integrations: con-
solidated and distributed. We then go into detail about the user experience,
process, and reporting integrations, along with the different business processes
that this integration supports. Finally, we end by discussing two case studies
about the packaged integrations supported by Side-By-Side HCM.
 Part III: SuccessFactors Integration Models 
Integration plays a critical part in the various deployment models. Chapter 6
through Chapter 8 explore the different integration scenarios, templates, and
applications that will need to be integrated. Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 then go
over instructions for various integration scenarios for the Full Cloud HCM and
Talent Hybrid deployment models. Finally, in Chapter 11, we address the data
migration concerns that may arise during integration.

Preface
20
Starting in Chapter 6, we introduce SuccessFactors’ integration layers and APIs.
After reviewing this chapter, you will better understand SuccessFactors’ logical
integration architecture as well as the capabilities of its various APIs to inte-
grate with SuccessFactors modules. If you are an integration designer, HR busi-
ness analyst, integration consultant from a customer or a partner organization,
you will find this chapter useful.
Chapter 7 then discusses the standard integration templates available with Suc-
cessFactors. This chapter also talks about the standard data imports available
which can be used to integrate with systems that don’t have a packaged inte-
gration.
Moving on to Chapter 8, we look at integrating an instance of SuccessFactors
Talent Suite with some of the leading cloud-based, third-party service provid-
ers. Providers such as PeopleAnswers, First Advantage, VLS, Questionmark,
and more will be discussed in conjunction with SuccessFactors Recruiting,
Onboarding, and Learning integrations.
The next two chapters look at applying the packaged integrations for Full Cloud
HCM and Talent Hybrid.
Chapter 9 starts by outlining the target audience for the Full Cloud HCM deploy-
ment model, where customers run all their HCM applications in the cloud and
connect them with on-premise business applications and other cloud service
providers. It then talks about implementing the packaged integrations that
support the Full Cloud HCM model. In this chapter, we discuss specific examples
of how SuccessFactors modules are integrated. The chapter will also contain
specific examples and best practices to following during implementation,
while providing sample code in places. This chapter is meant for HCM func-
tional consultants who configure SAP and SuccessFactors Employee Central,
technical consultants who configure middleware technologies to implement the
packaged integrations, and ABAP programmers who wish to extend the integra-
tions to suit customer needs.
Chapter 10 starts by outlining the target audience for the Talent Hybrid deploy-
ment model’s packaged integrations. It then walks through the step-by-step
process of implementing the available packaged integrations that support the
Talent Hybrid deployment model in the form of case studies. If you are an inte-
gration designer, HR business analyst, talent solutions integration consultant
from a customer or a partner organization, you will find this chapter very
handy.

Preface
21
Finally, in Chapter 11, we look at the procedures for proper data migration. All
cloud deployment models start with a one-time migration of foundational data.
Obtaining, cleansing, and migrating data to a core HR system is critical to the
success of an implementation and integration projects. The key to a successful
data migration is standardized and engineered rapid data migration content for
a fast and simple go-live with valid and clean data. In this chapter, we’ll explain
the migration of data from an SAP ERP HCM or third-party system into
Employee Central by leveraging the rapid-deployment solutions paradigm.
This chapter is meant for HCM functional consultants who configure SAP and
SuccessFactors Employee Central and technical consultants who migrate
employee data as part of an implementation. The chapter also provides insight
for implementation project managers who need to plan an Employee Central
implementation.
In summary, this is a good source of insight and information for executives who
are planning their journey to the SuccessFactors HCM suite in the cloud, partners
who are advising customers on such a move, HR professionals who want to
understand why integration matters, HR functional consultants who configure
the software, HR IT professionals who want to plan the integration between Suc-
cessFactors and other systems, integration architects who design integrations,
middleware consultants who configure the integration, and ABAP programmers
who extend the integrations to suit customer needs.

PART I
What Does the Cloud Mean for You?


27
 
Human Capital Management (HCM) customers are moving to the cloud to 
take advantage of its innovation, agility, and lower total cost of owner-
ship. SAP is responding to this by making the cloud central to its strategy, 
with integration as a key enabler.
1
SAP Cloud Integration Strategy
One major trend in the realm of HCM software is the transition that companies
are making by moving to the cloud. In this chapter, we provide an overview of
what is happening in the HCM technology industry and how the technology land-
scape is evolving. From there, we will look at SAP’s strategy to respond to this
evolution and talk about how SAP is helping companies move to the cloud with
various software deployment options supported by integration content and tools.
To begin, we will look at the current shift in software design that is changing the
IT landscape. Then, we will discuss SAP’s response to the growing needs of their
customers through integrations and cloud deployment models.
1.1
The Consumerization of IT
Consumerization describes the primary driving force behind product and service
design as catering to the needs of the individual customer. This concept represents
a major shift in the IT industry.
Most SAP customers who run SAP ERP on-premise are experiencing this shift in
employee expectations. Such organizations are adopting cloud solutions, among
other things, to take advantage of faster innovation, provide consumer-grade user
experience to their employees, and lower their total cost of software ownership.
Lines of businesses (LOBs) such as human resources, procurement, finance, sales,
service, and marketing are adopting the cloud to respond to changing customer
expectations faster without having to rely entirely on internal information tech-
nology teams and without having to undertake large, high-cost, high-risk, on-
premise software implementations. They are also turning to the cloud because of

SAP Cloud Integration Strategy
1
28
the superior user experience that engages all generations of employees who expect
enterprise software to function like consumer apps they use every day. For exam-
ple, an industry that is struggling to attract and retain new college graduates can
implement onboarding solutions that attract and engage a new generation of
employees during the critical new-hire onboarding period.
The cloud is an attractive option for information technology teams, too. IT teams
are adopting the cloud because it helps them deliver solutions to their internal
customers faster, at a lower cost, while freeing up time and money to invest in
projects that help the core business of their companies. For example, banking cus-
tomers that run SAP for Banking can move human resource management, pro-
curement, and travel management to the cloud while retaining on-premise soft-
ware to run their bank.
Executives such as CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs are moving subsidiaries or newly
acquired companies to the cloud and connecting cloud systems with their on-
premise SAP ERP systems to reduce the cost of information technology, gain bet-
ter insight into the business, and reduce the time it takes to integrate the systems
and cultures of newly acquired companies.
When LOBs move their software applications to the cloud, they sometimes incor-
rectly assume that these applications are self-contained and do not need to share
data with other business applications that may be on-premise and other support-
ing applications that may be in the cloud. Such an assumption is costly and may
lead to the failure of cloud implementations.
Many Critical Business Applications Need Employee Data
SAP product teams studied thousands of cloud implementations and learned that on
average LOB HR cloud applications are connected to over 15 critical business systems
using at least 60 integrations. For large businesses, this number could be in the hundreds.
SAP’s cloud integration strategy was developed in response to these challenges,
desires, and ground realities. Although SAP’s cloud applications are designed to
provide complete self-contained functionality, they are also well integrated with
a customer’s on-premise SAP systems to support an end-to-end business process.
SAP provides first the necessary technology and content to connect its cloud
applications to third-party cloud applications and second a set of tools and tech-
nologies that enables customers and partners to build their own custom integra-
tions. For customers who may not have the know-how, SAP provides fixed-price
professional services packages to implement the integrations.

SAP’s Response to Customer Needs
1.2
29
1.2
SAP’s Response to Customer Needs
SAP recognized that cloud solutions need to be a central part of the strategy
devised to meet the customer demands of faster innovation, consumer-grade user
experience, and lower total cost of ownership. Traditionally, the IT department
and executives made IT decisions with little or no influence from LOB managers
and users. Now, with cloud solutions that can be bought as subscriptions, LOB
managers have more say in enterprise software purchasing decisions.
Recognizing this shift in demand and buying patterns, SAP has developed or
acquired cloud solutions to meet the needs of LOBs. For human resource manage-
ment, SAP acquired SuccessFactors. For procurement in the cloud, SAP acquired
Ariba. For customer engagement, SAP developed an in-house cloud solution and
augmented it with the acquisition of Hybris. For travel and expense management,
SAP developed an in-house application called SAP Cloud for Travel. In 2014, SAP
announced its intention to acquire Concur, the leading travel and expense man-
agement provider in the cloud, becoming SAP’s go-forward solution for travel
and expense management in the cloud. For acquiring and managing contract
employees and projects, SAP acquired Fieldglass. For finance, SAP developed SAP
Cloud for Financials. It has extended cloud options to small businesses and sub-
sidiaries of large companies with Business ByDesign, SAP’s cloud business suite.
What’s the goal behind these acquisitions and developments? To have a unified
cloud platform for all LOB applications (see Figure 1.1).

However, to achieve this vision, SAP has to come up with workable solutions for
the over 35,000 customers using SAP ERP HCM solutions to run their businesses.
In many cases, these customers have invested tens of millions of dollars into their
on-premise solutions. Many of these customers have large teams of employees or
partners skilled in deploying and managing HR business processes using these
applications.
Such customers need a path to the cloud that does not require discarding all their
investment in on-premise LOB applications. They also need guidance and assis-
tance in retraining their IT teams to make the move from deploying and manag-
ing on-premise applications to deploying, configuring, customizing, integrating,
and extending cloud-based applications. Cultural barriers within organizations
and government regulations also play an important role in the journey of LOBs to
the cloud.
Keeping such factors in mind, SAP product managers have devised and executed
an integration strategy and direction that enables SAP ERP customers move their
LOB applications to the cloud at a pace that suits their needs and their organiza-
tions while respecting their company culture and the information security laws of
the countries in which they operate.
To this end, to help customers rapidly and flexibly integrate SAP’s cloud solutions
with other systems (whether they are SAP, non-SAP, or custom applications), SAP
has adopted the following framework:
 Identify and prescribe cloud deployment models for all products (see Section
1.3)
 Support each cloud deployment model through the following (see Section 1.4)
options:
 Packaged integrations (see Section 1.4.1)
 Standard integration templates (see Section 1.4.2)
 Professional services packages and rapid-deployment solutions for imple-
mentation (see Section 1.4.3)
 Application program interfaces (APIs) to enable custom integrations (see Sec-
tion 1.4.4)
 Integration middleware technology in the cloud and on-premise (see Section
1.4.5)

Cloud Deployment Models
1.3
31
Let’s walk through each of these pillars of the integration framework by first look-
ing at the three cloud deployment models offered by SAP and SuccessFactors.
1.3
Cloud Deployment Models
Cloud and on-premise products can be deployed in many different ways. To enable
productive conversations about architecture, meaningful decision-making, and
fast implementation, SAP has identified and documented the most common
deployment patterns of cloud and on-premise products that cater to specific sce-
narios. SAP refers to these patterns as cloud deployment models (see Figure 1.2).
Figure 1.2  Cloud Deployment Models
Some customers prefer to move all applications supporting an LOB such as human
resource management, procurement, travel management, customer engagement
or finance to the cloud while using their on-premise SAP ERP applications to run
their core businesses, such as banking, manufacturing, and retail. Such customers

can move applications supporting one or more one of more of their lines of busi-
nesses to the cloud and integrate them with their SAP ERP application on-prem-
ise. This deployment model is called the Full Cloud deployment model.
There is also a recommended path to the cloud for customers currently using LOB
software applications in SAP ERP. Such customers can move one or more applica-
tions to the cloud while continuing to use SAP ERP for the remaining applica-
tions. Business processes might cut across cloud and on-premise applications.
This deployment model is called the Hybrid deployment model.
A third set of customers might want to run business applications supporting a
subsidiary or a newly acquired company in the cloud while using SAP ERP to sup-
port the needs of LOBs in the parent company. In other words, they want to bring
together two systems of record side-by-side. For such customers, SAP has put
together a cloud deployment model called the Side-By-Side deployment model.
While engaging with a customer, SAP solution architects prescribe a deployment
model for the customer after studying their current business needs and system
landscapes. Once a customer picks a deployment model, SAP implementation
experts conduct a workshop to identify the productized integration components
and services available from SAP that could reduce the cost and risk of the overall
integrations.
For example, according to the SAP solution management team, there are over
14,000 customers using SAP ERP HCM for their employee administration needs.
Over 700 of those customers are using—and many others are debating using—
one or more SuccessFactors talent solutions in the cloud while keeping employee
administration (often known as core HR) on-premise. Solution architects have
designed the Talent Hybrid deployment model to help such customers.
The Full Cloud HCM deployment model is designed for another crowd. There are
over 35,000 SAP ERP customers using SAP ERP to run their businesses. Most of
these customers use HR management systems on-premise, and some of these sys-
tems are built on outdated technologies that cost a lot of money to maintain. Such
customers are choosing to move all their HCM applications to the cloud while
integrating them with SAP ERP, which they use to run their core businesses, such
as banking, retail, or manufacturing.

Cloud Deployment Models
1.3
33
Finally, many SAP customers who use SAP ERP HCM for core HR and SuccessFac-
tors talent solutions frequently grow their companies through acquisitions. Such
acquired companies most often use a different system for managing their employ-
ees. The cost of migrating employees of such acquisitions to the parent company’s
SAP ERP HCM system, while necessary, is expensive, disruptive, and time-con-
suming; in terms of HR, integration of core business systems such as finance,
supply chain, or customer relationship management systems always gets priori-
tized over integration of HCM systems. For this reason, organizations end up
maintaining tens of different HR management systems for the same organization.
This leads to inefficiencies, increased cost, decreased productivity, and poor talent
management.
Such customers are choosing to move their acquisitions’ HR management systems
to the cloud to migrate them faster, reduce operating expenses, provide a unified
employee experience, and perform integrated workforce planning. In many
cases, this model enables customers to try out the cloud for employee administra-
tion for a small number of employees and experience new ways to deploy soft-
ware before embarking on company-wide deployment of cloud software for
human resource management. The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is
designed to meet the needs of such customers and can act as a stepping stone to
the Full Cloud HCM deployment model. The packaged integrations supporting
the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model are designed to enable customers to
run core HR in the cloud and on-premise for different sets of employees at the
same time.
1.3.1
Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model
The Full Cloud HCM deployment model is applicable when an organization
wants to run all people management applications in the cloud. As shown in Fig-
ure 1.3, this means moving completely away from on-premise HCM and into
cloud HCM, even if other SAP ERP applications (Sales and Distribution, Plant
Maintenance, etc.) remain “on the ground.” All applications in the talent solu-
tions suite, employee administration applications, and payroll applications are
run in the cloud.
More information on the Full Cloud HCM deployment model can be found in
Chapter 3.

Consumers
The Full Cloud HCM deployment model is for customers who want to run all peo-
ple management applications in the cloud. Customers who run very old versions
of core HR systems are good candidates for the Full Cloud HCM deployment
model. Rather than invest in new on-premise SAP ERP HCM, they could invest in
moving all HCM software to the cloud.
Packaged Integrations
The Full Cloud HCM suite integrates with SAP ERP using multiple packaged
integrations. The following sections look at these integrations at greater length.
For more information on these integrations and how to integrate them, see
Chapter 9.
Employee Central Integration with SAP ERP
As shown in Figure 1.4, organizational data and employee data is sent from
Employee Central to SAP ERP. Cost center data is sent from SAP ERP to Employee

Another packaged integration connects Employee Central with SAP Payroll. In
this scenario (as illustrated in Figure 1.5), the SAP on-premise payroll system
receives cost center data from SAP Financials and employee master data from
Employee Central. As an optional integration, UI integration between SAP ERP
HCM and Employee Central is offered for selected country payroll versions.

Employee Central Integration with Third-Party Applications
Most organizations use one or more third-party applications for payroll, benefits,
and time management purposes. Sometimes, subsidiaries in different countries
use local benefits, time, and payroll systems. Employee Central can be integrated
with such third-party systems. You can connect Employee Central with third-
party applications with packaged integrations, standard templates, custom inte-
gration services, and a library of APIs (see Figure 1.6).

Party Applications
Integration Technology Options
The current integration technology for the Full Cloud HCM deployment model is
Dell Boomi AtomSphere. Figure 1.7 illustrates how Dell Boomi AtomSphere
works as the middleman for integration.
SAP is working on supporting SAP HANA Cloud Integration (HCI) middleware
technology as an alternative for Dell Boomi AtomSphere. No release dates have
been announced (as of spring 2015).

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
Simply put, the Talent Hybrid deployment model shown in Figure 1.8 comes into
play when customers use one or more SuccessFactors Talent Solutions applica-
tions in the cloud while using SAP ERP HCM for their employee administration
needs and payroll needs.

Consumers
The Talent Hybrid deployment model is for customers who want to run talent
solutions in the cloud while keeping employee administration on-premise. Usu-
ally, customers who run SAP ERP HCM for all their HCM application needs start by
moving one or more talent management applications to the cloud to access inno-
vation fast without a huge investment in implementation or custom development.
Packaged Integrations
As shown in Figure 1.9, the SuccessFactors Talent Solutions suite integrates with
SAP ERP HCM via multiple packaged integrations. Figure 1.9 shows all the cur-
rent and planned packaged integrations. These packaged integrations are part of
the Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and the SuccessFactors HCM suite.
Figure 1.9  Packaged Integrations for the Talent Hybrid Model

Integration Technology Options
As shown in Figure 1.10, there are three technology options for the Talent Hybrid
deployment model: FTP, SAP Process Integration (PI), and SAP HANA Cloud Inte-
gration (HCI). SAP PI is the most commonly used integration technology to imple-
ment the packaged integrations that support the Talent Hybrid deployment model.
This is because more than 4,000 customers have SAP PI in their organizations and
have skilled people to implement the integrations using SAP PI.
Figure 1.10  Technology Options for Talent Hybrid Model
1.3.3
Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is perhaps the trickiest to conceptual-
ize. In it, SAP ERP HCM on-premise serves as the system of record for employee
and organizational information for some employees, while Employee Central in
the cloud serves as a system of record for other employees, usually from a subsid-
iary company. Remember that some organizations use the Side-By-Side HCM
deployment model to begin migration to SuccessFactors before committing the
bulk of their existing workforce’s employee and organizational data.

Figure 1.11  Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
For more information on the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, see Chapter 5.
Consumers
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is for customers who want to adminis-
ter part of their employees in the cloud and part of their employees on-premise.
This model is suitable for customers who want to move certain countries to the
cloud while keeping their on-premise investment in core HR software in other
countries or geographies.
Packaged Integrations
The packaged integrations for the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model are
divided into two broad categories: Side-By-Side HCM consolidate and Side-By-
Side HCM distributed. These categories currently support an employee master
data integration.
Other packaged integrations supporting the Side-By-Side HCM deployment
model are planned for late 2015 (as of the writing of this book, spring 2015).

Productized Integration Components Provided by SAP
To support every deployment model, SAP delivers and maintains a set of produc-
tized integration components—the second pillar of the integration framework.
Moving from standard integrations to more custom integrations, as shown in Fig-
ure 1.12, productized components of integration include packaged integrations,
standard integration templates, custom integrations from SAP’s professional ser-
vices teams, and APIs. Although packaged integrations cover common integra-
tions needed by most customers and take very little time to implement (usually
about 20% of what it would take to build and implement a custom integration),
let’s take a look at the other customer integrations as well.
Figure 1.12  Productized Integration Components
1.4.1
Packaged Integrations
SAP has invested in identifying, developing, documenting, delivering, and main-
taining a library of functionally rich integrations that most customers need to con-
nect SAP cloud solutions to on-premise applications and third-party applications.
Such an approach makes it faster, easier, and cheaper for customers to implement

Each packaged integration is designed by SAP software architects utilizing data
gleaned by studying thousands of customer implementations and in collaboration
with dozens of co-innovation customers. Like any other software product, pack-
aged integrations are managed by SAP product managers and are subject to the
same product design, testing, documentation, and release rigor as any other SAP
product, with the goal of enabling success and reducing the risk of business inter-
ruption for customers. With packaged integrations, customers get access to SAP’s
deep domain knowledge and best practices for hybrid deployments of on-prem-
ise and cloud applications. Packaged integrations cover most foundational inte-
grations required by SAP’s applications in the cloud.
The packaged integrations from SAP and SuccessFactors fall into three main cate-
gories:
 Data integration 
Packaged data integration builds the data foundations required by SAP and Suc-
cessFactors applications. The employee master data, organizational data (such
as reporting relationships), and data used for workforce analytics are examples
of data integration.
 Process integration 
Packaged process integration supports system integration for end-to-end busi-
ness processes across the two systems. Such integration supports users execut-
ing business processes that span SAP and SuccessFactors systems when data
needs to flow back and forth between the two systems (e.g., maintaining salary
data in the SAP system, planning compensation in SuccessFactors, and then
making payouts for employees in SAP).
 User experience integration 
User experience integration focuses on providing access to both SAP and Suc-
cessFactors systems from one portal. Employees and managers using both SAP
and SuccessFactors systems will be able to access them via the Employee Self-
Service portal and the Manager Self-Service portal, respectively. They do not
have to switch systems or log into multiple systems.
The SuccessFactors home page could also act as a unified portal for both cloud
and on-premise systems from SAP, SuccessFactors, and other software providers.
Difference between Migration and Integration
Data migration is usually done once during the life of a software product. Integration
happens on an ongoing basis at regular time intervals during the life of a software
product.

1.4.2
Standard Integration Templates
Standard integration templates are built to connect SAP cloud products with
third-party software vendors in multiple categories. For example, there is a stan-
dard integration template to connect Employee Central with third-party time
management software vendors.
More information on standard integration templates can be found in Chapter 7.
1.4.3
Rapid-Deployment Solutions and Custom Integration Services
SAP recognizes that packaged integrations cannot realistically cover every inte-
gration scenario. To address this need, SAP provides best practices templates and
content for most packaged integrations that customers and partners can use to
implement the integrations in a predictable manner. SAP calls these best practices
rapid-deployment solutions.
SAP consulting teams provide custom integration services to build integrations
unique to customers. SAP consulting teams have deep expertise in connecting
SAP cloud products to third-party solutions and maintain a library of reusable
code that can be used to significantly reduce the risk and cost of implementation
for customers.
1.4.4
APIs for Customer-Specific Integrations
SAP has learned that customers and partners strive to build unique integrations
that differentiate themselves from their competitors. To help customers build
integrations that are unique to their needs, SAP offers a rich set of open stan-
dards-based APIs that customers can leverage to build custom integrations. SAP
customers and partners have already built thousands of custom integrations using
cloud APIs to meet their unique needs.
1.4.5
Enterprise Application Integration Technologies
Over a period of years, even decades, organizations buy business software (such
as supply chain management applications, enterprise resource planning systems,
customer relationships management applications, business intelligence applica-
tions, payroll systems, and HR systems) from multiple software vendors. Nor-
mally, such software applications typically cannot communicate with one another
directly in order to share data or business rules.

SAP Cloud Integration Strategy

44
Such systems that need to be linked together may reside on different operating
systems and may use different database solutions, programming languages, and
date and time formats. In some cases, they could also be older systems that are no
longer supported by the vendor who originally created them. Some of these sys-
tems could be single-tenant systems managed by the customers within their fire-
walls, and some could be cloud-based, multitenant systems delivered as a service.
All organizations using enterprise software today face this challenge every day,
irrespective of the software vendors they buy from. To address such challenges,
SAP has developed and delivered enterprise application integration technologies,
sometimes called integration middleware technologies. The on-premise version of
SAP’s enterprise application integration technology is SAP PI. The cloud version of
SAP’s enterprise application integration technology is called SAP HANA Cloud Inte-
gration. Some LOB cloud applications from SAP bundle third-party cloud enter-
prise application integration software, such as Dell Boomi AtomSphere.
What’s the takeaway here? Every packaged integration from SAP is built using
one or more of the enterprise application integration technologies shown in Fig-
ure 1.13. In some cases, the packaged integrations are delivered using FTP- or
SFTP-based technologies, in which a data file is generated and sent to the target
system via a simple periodic, automated file upload.
Figure 1.13  Integration Technologies Used by Cloud Products
Although using enterprise application integration technologies supported by the
packaged integrations from SAP will save customers time and money, customers
are free to use any enterprise application integration middleware technologies of

their choice, either on-premise or in the cloud. Almost all SAP customers who
integrate their applications use more than one enterprise application integration
technology to suit their business needs. Some customers choose to implement the
packaged integrations from SAP using a non-SAP enterprise application integra-
tion technology for business reasons.
1.5
Summary
The world of enterprise software is becoming consumerized, with the individual
consumer as the primary driver behind the design of products and services. Most
SAP customers are experiencing this shift in their organizations, particularly in
LOBs such as sales, human resource management, procurement, travel manage-
ment, and finance. Such LOBs are adopting cloud software, which is delivered to
them on a subscription basis, rather than purchasing software that is licensed
once and then having it installed on-premise.
SAP is responding to this shift by providing software as a subscription-based ser-
vice, sometimes referred to as cloud software, for all LOBs. Although SAP sees
cloud software as the direction for all LOBs, it also recognizes that not all customers
are able or willing to move their software to the cloud right away due to business,
cultural, or technology reasons. To help customers move to the cloud at a pace suit-
able to them, SAP has devised three main cloud deployment models. For the
human resource LOB, these models are called Full Cloud HCM, Talent Hybrid, and
Side-By-Side HCM. SAP supports every such cloud deployment model with produc-
tized integration components. SAP also provides the necessary integration technol-
ogies both on-premise and in the cloud to support these productized integrations.
In the next chapter, we will learn that the journey to the cloud is not the same for
all customers. We will also look at the cloud journeys of two customers and
understand why they chose their different paths to the cloud.


47
 
Choices made when moving to the cloud vary among organizations. Fac-
tors such as company culture, industry, government policy, business chal-
lenges, recent investments in technology, current landscapes, and in-house 
skills play an important role in shaping the journey to the cloud.
2
Journey to the Cloud
In the previous chapter, we looked at the various cloud deployment models avail-
able for SAP and SuccessFactors HCM suites. In this chapter, we will discuss
when, where, and how the cloud deployment models for SuccessFactors and SAP
are adopted by IT executives in customer organizations.
We will discuss the cloud migration of two customers and discover why they took
their chosen routes to the cloud. This chapter will also serve as a guide for enter-
prise architects, HR solution architects, and cloud technology solution engineers
on how to advise their HR line of business (LOB) colleagues on cloud adoption
and the effective use of packaged integrations.
In the next section, we will look at some of the drivers and business requirements
that arise when deciding to move to the cloud and the various scenarios that
come into play when choosing these different deployment models.
2.1
Business Architecture Review
Cloud application decisions are mostly driven by LOB decision-makers rather
than IT decision-makers. Cloud applications provided by SuccessFactors help cus-
tomers to start with any one application in the suite and expand to the entire
suite of applications. For example, a customer in the oil and gas industry facing
talent retention problems can start with recruitment management and then
adopt the SuccessFactors Performance and Goals Management modules. Another
customer who wants to promote employee development and engagement may
choose to start with SuccessFactors Learning and SAP Jam before adopting other

Journey to the Cloud

48
modules in the SuccessFactors suite of applications. Customers can do this irre-
spective of the core HR application that they are currently using.
This flexibility in business architecture provides a unique opportunity for LOB
decision-makers who want faster results and may have to show some successes
before adopting the complete suite in the cloud. Choosing the first application to
adopt and implement might be a challenge. This is where the business architec-
ture review workshop plays an important role. This workshop is conducted by
experienced HR professionals who uncover the business problems of an organi-
zation and map those problems with people management tools. This workshop
can be conducted by SuccessFactors or another HCM consulting partner to
uncover, understand, and document the business and associated talent manage-
ment challenges faced by the company.
If a full-fledged business architecture workshop is not feasible, then the next best
alternative is to ask the HR and human resources information technology (HRIT)
leaders to list the top three business challenges or opportunities defined by the
leadership of the company and the associated talent management challenges per-
ceived or anticipated by the HR and HRIT teams.
In the next three sections, we will look at the different scenarios that may play
out when an organization chooses a deployment model.
2.1.1
Scenario 1: Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model
Organizations looking to run all of their HCM applications in the cloud will
choose the Full Cloud HCM deployment model.
Customers choosing this option will move their HCM to the cloud in a large-scale
project, usually lasting up to a year. These are usually customers who are not
happy with their current core HR systems and tend to have multiple core HR sys-
tems or very old core HR systems. These customers will take advantage of the
packaged integrations associated with the Full Cloud HCM deployment model.
Figure 2.1 illustrates a current scenario landscape, with the resulting future land-
scape of the Full Cloud HCM deployment model.
Customers who move talent management and core HR applications to the cloud
have two choices when it comes to deployment of payroll applications: they can
keep payroll on-premise or they can choose to move payroll to the cloud.

Business Architecture Review
2.1
49
Figure 2.1  Candidates for the Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model
As stated previously, no two customers are the same. Therefore, variations in the
commonplace deployment scenarios will arise. Two of these are discussed next.
Employee Central Payroll
Some customers may decide to move payroll applications to the cloud. In this
case, they will choose Employee Central Payroll.
Employee Central Payroll is SAP’s global payroll solution and is provided as a
hosted option that comes integrated with Employee Central. For organizations
that wish to manage payroll in-house via a cloud-based solution, Employee Cen-
tral Payroll offers all the same features and benefits as SAP’s on-premise payroll
solution, but it is hosted and delivered by SAP. Employee Central Payroll is avail-
able as an option for Employee Central customers only.
Although the Employee Central Payroll software is provided as a service, the pay-
roll administration has to be managed by the customer’s personnel. Figure 2.2
displays the resulting landscape when moving payroll to the cloud.

Some customers may decide to keep payroll applications on-premise. In many
companies, payroll is managed by finance departments that run their applications
on-premise behind firewalls. They tend to be more conservative in their approach
to the cloud compared to sales or HCM departments. Figure 2.3 displays the
resulting landscape of an on-premise payroll system.

Scenario 2: Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
An organization that wishes to run SAP ERP HCM for its core HR needs on-prem-
ise while using the SuccessFactors Talent Management suite for its talent manage-
ment needs in the cloud will employ the Talent Hybrid deployment model.
Customers who move talent management applications to the cloud normally start
with a talent management application that solves an immediate problem area. For
example, for customers in the fast-growing oil and gas industry in Canada, attract-
ing and recruiting new employees is a big problem area. Such customers start
with the recruiting and onboarding applications first and expand to other appli-
cations.
In addition, certain other customers—from the mining industry, for example—
may have grown by acquiring other, smaller companies. They may have a need to
analyze data from multiple acquisitions. Such customers choose to start with the
Workforce Analytics application and then chose to expand to other talent man-
agement applications.
Figure 2.4 displays the current and future landscapes of customers choosing the
Talent Hybrid deployment model.
Figure 2.4  Candidates for Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
In many cases, such customers start the project to move core HR for all employees
to the cloud one year after they start the project to move talent solutions to the cloud.

Comfort Level of Internal IT Team Members
Moving HCM applications to the cloud is a stressful project for HRIT team members.
Moving a small but important application, usually from the talent management suite of
SuccessFactors, is a good way to test the waters and see how such a move changes the
responsibilities of internal HRIT team members. In almost all projects, there is a clear
and important role for HRIT team members, even when HCM moves to the cloud.
2.1.3
Scenario 3: Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is employed when SAP ERP HCM on-
premise serves as the system of record for employee and organizational informa-
tion for some employees, but Employee Central in the cloud serves as a system of
record for other employees, usually from a subsidiary company. In this deploy-
ment model, all employees use talent management solutions in the cloud.
Figure 2.5 illustrates the current and future landscapes for candidates choosing
the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model.

Customers in this scenario have chosen to move only a portion of their employ-
ees. They do this for one of two reasons: to test the waters in the cloud or to avoid

a large-scale implementation for integrating a newly acquired subsidiary into
their information technology landscapes. The success of these deployment mod-
els depends on the suitability of the model for the business needs of the
customer. The business architecture workshop, usually offered by a HCM con-
sulting expert, is a good exercise to uncover such business needs.
After this evaluation has been completed, the chosen deployment model drives
the product review and purchasing decisions. This will be discussed in the next
section.
2.2
Product Review
When should an SAP executive or an executive partner start the cloud migration
conversation with a customer?
The right time to start conversations about the cloud deployment model, technol-
ogy landscape, and associated packaged integrations is about six months before
the product decision is made and the implementation is kicked off. If you are an
SAP account executive or an account executive from a partner organization, then
plan to start the conversation about moving to the cloud a year before the antici-
pated start date of the move.
A discussion about deployment models should not be afterthoughts once the prod-
uct review is done and the purchasing decisions are made. Instead, the deploy-
ment model chosen should drive the product review and purchasing decisions.
The solution architecture review workshop is a good forum for such conversa-
tions.
2.3
Solution Architecture Review
The solution architecture review is an important step in moving to the cloud. This
workshop is valuable for customers who buy the service, account executives who sell
the service, and implementation partners who implement the service. This is usually
a two-hour workshop conducted before product purchasing decisions are made.
The solution architecture review workshop has multiple objectives. The sections
that follow describe the various objectives of a solution architecture review.

Journey to the Cloud
2
54
2.3.1
Understanding the Current Landscape
The first objective of the solution architecture review workshop is to understand
the current landscape of the customer. Almost all organizations will have this doc-
ument in Microsoft Visio or Microsoft PowerPoint. The document author is usu-
ally someone from the IT team who is responsible for enterprise application inte-
gration. Normally, this diagram will be more complex than necessary for this
workshop and will include items that may not be relevant for this workshop. It is
advisable to get the diagram from the IT team member beforehand and to create
a simplified version of the diagram for use during the workshop. In some cases,
the solution architect conducting the workshop may have to oversimplify the dia-
gram for discussion purposes.
2.3.2
Mapping the Future Landscape
The second objective is to map the future landscape along with any intermediate
landscapes. In almost all cases, the eventual landscape for any customer will be
the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, even if it takes years to reach that goal.
Therefore, it is advisable to assume this goal and to mention it to the customer.
The next step in this process is to identify the intermediate landscapes. For exam-
ple, some customers might adopt the Talent Hybrid deployment model before
moving to the Full Cloud HCM deployment model.
2.3.3
Identifying the Available Packaged Integrations
The third objective is to identify the packaged integrations available to support
the chosen landscapes. Packaged integrations reduce the cost and time required
to build integrations by about 80%. Therefore, identifying the available packaged
integrations will help with building the project timeline and calculating the cost
of integration. See Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 for further information on the pack-
aged integrations for the Full Cloud HCM deployment model and the Talent
Hybrid deployment model.
2.3.4
Identifying Standard Integration Templates
The fourth objective is to identify the standard templates available to support the
chosen deployment models. The SAP product team provides standard templates
to connect with third-party time, benefits, and payroll providers.

Case Study
2.4
55
2.3.5
Identifying Reusable Integration Templates
The fifth objective is to identify available reusable templates. SAP professional
services teams have performed hundreds of custom integrations. They maintain a
library of these integrations and use them when appropriate. Therefore, it is good
to verify with them whether there are reusable templates available to integrate
with a particular benefits vendor, for example.
2.3.6
Identifying the Need for Custom Integrations
The sixth objective is to identify the custom integrations that might have to be built.
It is important to note that 80% of all integrations built will be specific to a cus-
tomer and hence have to be custom built. The cost associated with this is signifi-
cant. It is important to identify these integration requirements and plan for them.
2.3.7
Determining the Need for Intermediate Integrations
The seventh objective is to identify the intermediate integrations that need to be
built. Integrating two systems is similar to building a bridge across a river. While
building a new bridge, traffic may have to be routed through to another path.
Civil engineers usually build a temporary bridge to keep traffic moving while they
build a new, permanent bridge. IT architects have to do the same when they
move the on-premise systems to the cloud. They may have to build temporary
integrations between their systems to keep them running while new systems are
implemented. In some cases, these intermediate integrations could take a signifi-
cant amount of time and money to build.
In the next section, we will look at a case study of how a customer can adopt these
deployment models in response to his or her organization’s business needs.
2.4
Case Study
In this section, we will look at the journey taken by a customer moving some, or
all, of his or her HCM solutions to the cloud. During this process, we will see how
the customer’s solution architects guided him or her through the process by ask-
ing the right questions and helping him or her make the right decisions through
appropriate input and insight.
Let’s begin by looking at the parameters of our case study.

Journey to the Cloud

2.4.1
Case Study Parameters
Janet Lee is an information technology executive at a company in the fast-grow-
ing oil and gas industry.
Although her industry’s growth has opened up many opportunities for the com-
pany and its employees, it has also created several talent management challenges.
Her industry struggles to attract engineering graduates critical to the growing
operations of the company. The chief people officer, Louisa, is keen on adopting
all the innovative cloud and mobile applications.
Janet is under tremendous pressure from her senior leadership to cut information
technology costs and introduce innovation at a faster pace. She also clearly sees
the trend of HCM software moving to the cloud. Her human resource manage-
ment colleagues demand software that can attract a new generation of employees
to the organization and keep them engaged. However, Janet and her organization
are not in a position to drop all of their on-premise software and move all HCM
to the cloud.
Our solution architect in this situation is James, an SAP solution architect who has
been working with Janet and Louisa to help them choose the right cloud applica-
tions that will address their business challenges.
Some of the business challenges faced by Janet and Louisa’s company include the
following:
 Challenge of recruitment marketing 
The human resource management team is struggling to attract people to the
available opportunities and is not sure about the markets to source future
employees from. Their recruitment marketing budget is spent without any
insight into the return on such investment.
 Onboarding experience is inconsistent 
Even when they are able to attract employees, it is becoming hard to retain
them in the critical first three months. New hires are either leaving the industry
or leaving to work for competitors who are able to attract them by showcasing
more millennial-friendly work environments and career prospects.
 Timely workforce analytics are hard to gather 
The HR team is struggling to keep track of headcount due to a lack of analytics
tools integrated with the core HR system.

Case Study
2.4
57
The HR team believes that the turnover rate in the company is the same as the
turnover rate in the industry, but has no way of proving that to their colleagues
and senior executives. The team did put some new employee incentives in
place to address the problem of turnover, which they believe is helping to
reduce turnover. However, once again, there is no reliable way of verifying
that. The HR team also designed a new hire mentoring program as a strategy to
retain new hires in the critical first 90-day period. That program has helped,
but the team cannot scale that mentoring program to all new hires because it
does not have insight into employees with mentoring skills available in the
company.
Packaged Integrations Address Specific Business Challenges
Packaged integrations supporting SuccessFactors HCM suite integration with SAP are
designed to address specific challenges faced by organizations. Solution architects can
and should be able to identify and pick appropriate talent solutions and the associated
packaged integrations that can address specific business challenges.
For example, the SuccessFactors recruiting integration with SAP ERP HCM brings infor-
mation about new hires to the SAP ERP HCM system for timely employee administra-
tion and payroll purposes.
2.4.2
Stage 1: Understanding Business Challenges
A discussion about integration should always start with a look at business objec-
tives and the current technology landscape of an organization. Therefore, James
starts by asking Janet about her current technology landscape for human resource
management software and how it is connected to SAP ERP and other business
applications.
They then discuss the business challenges faced by the human resource manage-
ment team. Janet points out that her human resource management colleagues
have identified attracting and retaining talent as the top business challenge for the
next five years. They are using homegrown performance management applica-
tions, multiple recruitment management, and recruitment marketing tools in the
cloud. However, multiple tools in multiple countries and organizations have not
solved the problem of talent acquisition.
James also determines that employee administration and payroll are not big
problem areas for Janet’s organization at this time. He then comes up with a high-
level recommendation for the cloud deployment model that Janet can start with.

Journey to the Cloud

58
James draws a quick diagram of the various SuccessFactors cloud deployment
models for Janet. The clear and simple diagrams help Janet grasp the cloud
deployment models without reading elaborate documents and sitting through
long presentations (see Figure 2.6).
Figure 2.6  James Explains the Deployment Options to Janet
Make a Recommendation for the Deployment Model
The partner or SuccessFactors solution architect should have a hypothesis about the
cloud deployment model before conducting a workshop for the larger HRIT and HR
business teams. The solution architect should make a clear recommendation to the
customer.
James recommends that Janet start with the Talent Hybrid deployment model.
He points out that because most of the company’s challenges are in the talent
management area the ideal first step would be to move talent management appli-
cations to the cloud while retaining SAP ERP HCM for core HR applications (see
Figure 2.7).
James then points out that there are several packaged integrations provided by
SAP to support this deployment model and outlines the packaged integrations

Stage 2: Executing the Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
Janet likes James’ recommendations and starts with the Talent Hybrid deployment
model. She understands the importance of bringing the leadership team, the human
resource management team, and the information technology team together to the
table in order to understand their concerns and address them early on.
The concerns of the leadership team involve return on investment, costs, and the
risks involved. The CFO wants to make sure that the recent large investment in
implementing the on-premise SAP ERP HCM system is not wasted. He also wants
to make sure that the team understands the risks involved in moving employee
data to the cloud and takes the appropriate measures to minimize business risk.
The HR business team that supports all managers and employees in the company
are interested in understanding what the unified user experience looks like to
managers and employees. They also want to understand if the SAP ERP HCM user
interface will stay for core HR processes, because they have made many modifica-
tions to the user interface.
The SAP technical experts in the team want to understand if they have a role to play
in the integration in a scenario in which many applications are moving to the cloud.
The in-house SAP ERP HCM functional consultant is a bit concerned about all the new
things he has to learn and is wondering if he can bring any value to his organization
when many applications on which he is an expert are moving to the cloud.
Janet understands all the questions and concerns and proactively arranges a con-
versation with James, the SuccessFactors solution architect.
Career Transition to the Cloud
In many cases, the colleagues who are managing SAP ERP HCM in a customer’s organi-
zation have been doing so for years, if not decades. It is important to point out to these
colleagues that this migration to the cloud benefits their career as well. Their skills in the
HCM area are valuable, transferrable skills. Embracing SuccessFactors solutions is a
good way to make the career transition to the cloud.
Let’s look at some of the concerns raised and how James addresses them.
Addressing the Concerns
James starts by explaining to David, the CFO, that the current investment in
recent upgrades to SAP ERP HCM will not be lost. He points out to the CFO that

Case Study

the packaged integrations are designed to ensure that the SuccessFactors Talent
Solutions modules integrate and function well with existing SAP ERP HCM solu-
tions. He points out that the packaged integrations can be extended to work with
the customizations made on the customer’s SAP ERP HCM system.
He then turns to Steve, the SAP HCM functional expert, and explains that the
packaged integrations map SuccessFactors fields to corresponding infotypes in
SAP ERP HCM. He points out that Steve can modify or extend the field mapping
to accommodate additional infotypes that Steve has created in the SAP ERP HCM
system to suit the needs of his organization.
Alexis, the manager of HRIT, wonders about the source of truth for employee
master data. James points out that in the Talent Hybrid deployment model SAP
ERP HCM will be the source of truth for employee master data. Changes to the
master data will be made in the SAP ERP HCM system. Therefore, Alexis does not
need to maintain the data in multiple places, nor does he need to worry about
data inconsistency.
Sharon, the HR analyst, supports managers and employees with their self-service
questions for core HR processes. She wonders if the user experience of employees
and managers will change when SuccessFactors Talent Solutions are added to SAP
ERP HCM. James points out that employees and managers will access the same
SAP ERP HCM screens from the portals they are currently using. There will be no
change to the experience when it comes to core HR processes that are delivered
by SAP ERP HCM. He points out that SuccessFactors does not become the user
interface for core HR processes. However, employees and managers will access
SuccessFactors screens for all talent management applications. He talks about the
SuccessFactors theming tool that enables administrators to modify the look and
feel of all SuccessFactors screens to match the look and feel of their corporate por-
tal and business applications.
Sharon asks James if they can they can continue to use the Employee Self-Service
(ESS) and Manager Self-Service (MSS) portals. James responds that employees
and managers can continue to use the ESS and MSS portals to launch SAP ERP
HCM and SuccessFactors applications.
Employee Self-Service and Manager Self-Service
Thousands of SAP customers use ESS and MSS portals to provide self-service capabilities
for HR and other business applications. It is important to point out that they do not
have to discard those portals when they move to the Talent Hybrid deployment model.

Journey to the Cloud
2
62
Ethan, the SAP ERP administrator, asks James if he has a role to play in the Talent
Hybrid deployment model. James says that the SAP ERP administrator does have
a role to play in implementing the integrations, given that all packaged integra-
tions rely on an SAP ERP add-on that needs to be installed as a support package by
an SAP ERP administrator. These supports packages are made available to SAP
ERP administrators from the SAP Service Marketplace, the web site from which
all SAP support packages are made available to customers.
This conversation answers most of the questions from Janet’s colleagues and
gives them an idea of their roles and the road ahead.
The Integration Workshop
Once the initial questions and concerns are addressed, Janet arranges a two hour
integration workshop in which the SuccessFactors solution architects and Janet’s
HRIT colleagues discuss the current and future technology landscapes for HR
applications.
Documenting the Current Landscape Is Very Valuable
Most information technology organizations have a diagram showing the integrations
between systems in their landscape. Usually, this diagram attempts to document all
aspects of the landscape for multiple LOBs and attempts to capture the network and
security architecture. The goal of the solution architect should be to simplify the dia-
gram and depict the integrations between HR and business systems without making the
diagram too complex to understand.
After studying the current technology landscape, James draws a simplified ver-
sion of the current landscape on a whiteboard and confirms that his understand-
ing of the landscape is accurate. The HRIT team members point out that there are
some systems not documented in the landscape diagram and suggest that James
add those systems to the diagram.
The collaborative effort to document and depict the current landscape brings a
common understanding of the current state and lays the foundation for a conver-
sation about the future desired landscape.
Talent Hybrid Deployment Model Implementation
Janet starts the implementation of the Talent Hybrid solution. With the strong
support of her CFO, the chief human resource officer, and the HRIT team, she sig-

nificantly increases the probability of an on-time, on-budget implementation. The
integration workshop conducted by SuccessFactors solution architects and Janet’s
HRIT teams creates a common understanding of the current and future technol-
ogy landscapes and provides a strong foundation of knowledge to plan the imple-
mentation.
In about six months, Janet’s team completes the successful implementation of all
necessary modules in the SuccessFactors Talent Solutions suite.
Talent Solutions Suite Implementation
Even when customers buy the entire talent solutions suite of applications from Success-
Factors, they may not implement all the solutions in the first phase. They usually choose
to implement two to three applications in the first phase and expand later. The archi-
tecture of the SuccessFactors HCM suite enables customers to do so.
2.4.4
Stage 3: Acquiring a Smaller Competitor
After the SuccessFactors Talent Management solutions implementation was com-
plete, Janet’s company acquired another smaller, innovative competitor. The
CEO decides to run the new acquisition as a separate legal entity for business rea-
sons. Even though the new acquisition is a separate business, executives and
managers need to have a unified view of all employees for talent management,
workforce planning, and workforce analytics purposes.
This is a practical situation. When a company acquires another company, in some
cases the parent company runs the acquired company as a subsidiary for a while.
Over a period of months or even years, they may integrate the acquired company
into the parent company. However, for workforce planning, workforce analytics,
and talent management purposes, human resource management professionals
need to look at the entire workforce in one place within a few weeks after the
acquisition is complete.
In this situation, the employees from the new company had to be combined with
the employees from the parent company for talent management needs but kept
separate for employee administration needs, compensation planning purposes,
and payroll purposes.
In Janet’s case, employees of the acquired company were already using multiple
software solutions in the cloud and were not very inclined towards using an on-
premise core HR system. Janet’s analysis also found out that implementing a

Journey to the Cloud
2
64
separate SAP ERP HCM system for the acquired company would be a multiyear,
multimillion dollar implementation. She reaches out to James for his advice on
the best way to handle this challenge. James points out that this might be a good
opportunity for Janet to test the waters for core HR in the cloud.
Employee Management
Forcing employees of a smaller, innovative company to switch to systems they consider
old and cumbersome to use is not a good way to retain talent. This challenge could
become an opportunity for the parent company. Rather than force the employees of the
acquired company to use older systems, the parent company could implement cloud
solutions for the new employees and learn from the experience.
Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
In the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, organizations run core HR in the
cloud for some employees, usually from a subsidiary, and core HR on-premise for
other employees, usually from the parent organization. In this model, all talent
management for all employees is performed via cloud applications.
James suggests that Janet should use Employee Central for core HR for employees
of the acquired company. This will give Janet an opportunity to address all her
business needs while keeping overall project costs lower. This approach also gives
Janet an opportunity to do a relatively small project for core HR in the cloud
before moving core HR for all employees to the cloud. James points out that this
deployment model is called the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model and that
there are several packaged integrations planned to support this deployment model
(see Figure 2.9).
James points out that in this deployment model Janet will use SuccessFactors in
the cloud for talent management processes and workforce analytics. She will run
Employee Central in the cloud to deliver core HR processes for employees of the
newly acquired company and will run SAP ERP HCM to deliver core HR processes
for employees of the parent company. She will have a unified view of the employ-
ees for workforce planning and workforce analytics purposes while maintaining
two different core HR solutions for two sets of employees.
Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model helps customers with specific business
needs, such an integrating a newly acquired company or employees from a geographical

region that was not previously part of the HR landscape. However, the Side-By-Side
HCM deployment model requires more time, money, and skills to implement. When
possible, customers should consider moving to the Full Cloud HCM model directly.
Figure 2.9  James Recommends the Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
Janet understands that this is a good solution to the current business challenges
she faces and decides to implement the solution. It takes about a year to imple-
ment Employee Central for the newly acquired company. Because the acquired
company had very few employees, Janet and her team were able to manage the
risks and understand what it takes to move core HR to the cloud without under-
taking a high-cost, high-risk project.
Data Migration
Migration of data from an on-premise core HR system to a cloud-based core HR
system is a critical and yet often overlooked part of a core HR project. Fortunately
for Janet, SAP provides a data cleansing and migration service that she utilizes to
cleanse data before it is loaded into Employee Central, the cloud-based core HR
system from SuccessFactors. Cleansing the data using proven best practices and
migrating the data using tried and tested tools lays a good foundation for the

move of core HR to the cloud for Janet. The core HR in the cloud project was com-
pleted successfully in a year.
Data Migration from SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central
The enterprise information management experts at SAP have designed the data migra-
tion package to move data from one or more SAP ERP HCM systems to Employee Cen-
tral. The details of this data migration service are explained later in Chapter 11.
Employees of the newly acquired company were glad that they were provided
with a new and innovative core HR and talent management system in the cloud.
The project improved employee engagement and helped retain key talent from
the acquired company. The project became a success story not just for the infor-
mation technology team but also for the mergers and acquisitions team and the
company executives.
2.4.5
Stage 4: Moving to Full Cloud HCM
Completing the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model gives Janet and her team
the confidence and the clear metrics required to plan the movement of core HR to
the cloud for all employees (see Figure 2.10).

The success of this project becomes instrumental in securing the budget approval
for moving core HR for all employees to the cloud.
James explains the packaged integrations that support the Full Cloud HCM
deployment model. He points out that the packaged integrations fall into three
broad categories: employee data, organizational management data, and cost cen-
ter data (see Figure 2.11).
Figure 2.11  Packaged Integrations Connecting Employee Central to SAP ERP
As previously stated, James indicates that these packaged integrations may save
the company time and money in the transition. This helps with the budgetary
concerns for the project, allowing the company to move forward successfully.

Summary
The journey to the cloud may not be the same for all customers. Based on factors
such as company culture, government policy, recent technology investment, and
business challenges, different customers may choose different paths to the cloud.
SuccessFactors solution architects need to study the customer’s business chal-
lenges, recent investments in information technology, and current human resource

management technology landscape and then suggest an appropriate deployment
model to start with. Every direction should assume that sooner or later customers
may move to the cloud, even if they have no plans to do so today. It is the belief
of industry experts that competitive pressures and relentless innovation in the
cloud will make the move to the cloud for HCM inevitable for most organizations
in the world.
In the next chapter, we will look at the Full Cloud HCM deployment model and
discuss the packaged integrations and other tools available to connect HCM appli-
cations in the cloud with on-premise SAP ERP applications and third-party cloud
applications.

New providers of HR software in the cloud and cloud offerings from 
traditional HR software providers dominate the market. Sooner 
rather than later, moving all HCM to the cloud will become a com-
petitive necessity for almost all organizations. In this chapter, we 
will discuss the deployment model that will allow the customer to do 
just that.

Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model
SAP ERP customers are simplifying their HCM technology landscape by moving
all the people management applications to the cloud using the SuccessFactors
HCM suite. They are doing this to simplify their current technology landscape,
reduce total cost of ownership, and adopt rapid innovation that is happening in
the cloud. The deployment model that enables customers to do this is called the
Full Cloud HCM deployment model (see Figure 3.1).
Figure 3.1  SAP and SuccessFactors Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model
The Full Cloud HCM deployment model
is for customers who want to run all people
management applications in the cloud.

In this chapter, we will discuss the packaged integrations that connect HCM appli-
cations in the cloud with on-premise SAP ERP applications, third-party payroll,
time applications, and benefits applications. We will also discuss the user experi-
ence integration that makes this deployment model unique. To wrap the chapter
up, we will look at two case studies that display the use of these packaged integra-
tions at work.
Let’s begin by looking at the type of audience this deployment model would
attract.
3.1
Target Audience
The Full Cloud HCM deployment is for customers who want to run all people
management applications in the cloud while connecting them with on-premise
business applications and third-party cloud business applications.
In the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, customers run Employee Central, Suc-
cessFactors Talent Solutions, and Workforce Planning and Analytics in the cloud
and integrate them with on-premise SAP ERP applications. With this deployment
model, you can move all your HCM applications to the cloud while providing
employee information to all critical applications that run your business.
Normally, customers who are struggling with employee administration prefer to
move to this deployment model. Such customers fall into two main categories. 
The first category of customers might be running a very old core HR system to man-
age their employees. These customers may be struggling with employee administra-
tion due to a lack of modern features, lack of support from the vendor who pro-
vided the software, and excessive customization that is difficult to maintain.
The second category of customers may be running multiple core HR systems.
Some of these customers run about ten different core HR systems to administer
their employees. Such distribution of data and administration creates problems
that can be addressed by moving to the Full Cloud HCM deployment model and
customizing it via its various packaged integrations.

Technology Options

3.2
Technology Options
Before we begin looking at the Full Cloud HCM integrations themselves, it is
important to understand the technology options that are available to facilitate them.
Dell Boomi AtomSphere is the enterprise application integration technology for
the Full Cloud HCM deployment model. Dell Boomi AtomSphere acts as a single
hub in the cloud for all integrations originating or ending in Employee Central,
thus making the management and administration of these packaged custom inte-
grations efficient and cost-effective (see Figure 3.2).
Figure 3.2  Integration Technology for Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model
The cost of licensing a cloud-based integration technology could run into millions
of dollars per year for a large organization. The license cost usually increases with
the number of integrations built on that integration technology. To address this
problem and free customers from the cost burden, SAP bundles the license for the
Dell Boomi AtomSphere enterprise application integration technology with the
Employee Central license. Customers can use it to connect Employee Central with

not only on-premise SAP ERP but also with any third-party cloud or on-premise
application. Several Employee Central customers have taken advantage of this
offer and have built hundreds of custom integrations over and above the pack-
aged integrations provided by SAP.
The Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration technology is hosted by SAP in the same
data centers as SuccessFactors and is secured the same way SuccessFactors appli-
cations are secured.
Via these technology options, the SuccessFactors HCM suite integrates with SAP
ERP and third-party applications using multiple packaged integrations. These
packaged data integrations are available for three areas:
 Integrating Employee Central with SAP ERP
 Integrating Employee Central with on-premise SAP Payroll and cloud-based
Employee Central Payroll
 Connecting Employee Central with third-party cloud applications in the areas
of payroll, time management, and benefits administration
The following sections look at these integrations in further detail.
3.3
Packaged Integrations for Employee Central and 
SAP ERP
There are multiple packaged integrations to connect Employee Central with SAP
ERP. Most of the current packaged integrations fall into the following categories
(see Figure 3.3):
 Employee Central employee data integration (see Section 3.3.1)
 Employee Central organizational management data integration (see Section
3.3.2)
 SAP ERP Financials cost center data integration with Employee Central (see Sec-
tion 3.3.3)
Let’s begin with the integration of employee data between Employee Central and
SAP ERP.

Packaged Integrations for Employee Central and SAP ERP

Figure 3.3  Packaged Integrations to Connect Employee Central with SAP ERP
3.3.1
SAP ERP Employee Data Integration
The integration of employee data between SAP ERP and Employee Central repli-
cates basic employee information from Employee Central to SAP ERP. This inte-
gration enables the execution of business processes in the connected SAP ERP sys-
tems that customers use to run their businesses.
Additional Information
Implementation and integration information is provided in a document titled Employee
Central and SAP ERP: Employee Master Data Replication. This document can be down-
loaded from http://help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
When customers move all people management applications to the cloud, the
cloud becomes the source of truth for employee data. However, systems that run
the business of a customer require such employee data. Employee data, such as
name and gender, are extracted from Employee Central and transferred to SAP

ERP, to make it available for the systems that run a customer’s business. The pro-
cess flow of this packaged integration is depicted in Figure 3.4.
Figure 3.4  Employee Central Data Integration with SAP ERP
SAP provides predefined integration content for this scenario via the SuccessFac-
tors Integration 1210 Add-on for SAP ERP. The integration of employee data from
Employee Central to SAP ERP is performed via a web service periodically. The
transfer of data can be done in near real time, if required. The amount of (histor-
ical) data to be transferred can be controlled. The integration supports loading of
initial data as well as delta integration that replicates only changed data. Time
dependency is also considered.
The built-in extensibility options allow data integration to be enhanced to include
customer-specific attributes required at the job level or personal information
level without the need to change code; it can be realized simply through configu-
ration.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met:
 This Integration 1210 Add-On for SAP ERP 6.0 or higher. The current version of the
SuccessFactors HCM suite is required.

3.3.2
SAP ERP Organizational Management Data Integration
In this integration, organizational data and an employee’s relationship with such
organizational data is replicated from Employee Central to SAP ERP.
In the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, Employee Central is the system of
records for the enterprise structure, which includes departments, business units,
and divisions. Information about this enterprise structure and an employee’s rela-
tionship to the elements in that structure are required by systems that run the
business. For example, many business systems will require information about an
employee’s cost center association.
Employee Central is the system of record for HR-related organizational data and
organizational assignments, and the integration replicates these objects to SAP
ERP. This includes the following data integration points:
 Data integration for enterprise structure information 
This integration is realized through several web services that replicate enter-
prise structure data such as business units, divisions, and departments. In addi-
tion, the scenario ensures the synchronization of the respective employee
assignments to these objects from Employee Central to SAP ERP organizational
management. The enterprise structure information in Employee Central is
interpreted as organizational unit information in SAP ERP.
 Data integration for reporting lines 
The reporting line information shows the relationship of an employee and the
responsible manager. This replication takes place via a web service. The job
information in Employee Central is mapped to the organizational manage-
ment in SAP ERP. In SAP ERP’s organizational management, the information is
interpreted as a relationship between the employee’s and the line manager’s
positions. If a position does not exist in SAP ERP, then the system automati-
cally generates technical positions in SAP ERP’s organizational management.
Employee Central position management is not required to make use of this
integration.
 Data integration for employee cost center assignments 
SAP provides a web service for the data replication of employees and their cost
center assignments from Employee Central to SAP ERP’s organizational man-
agement. In SAP ERP’s organizational management, the information is inter-
preted as a relationship between the employee’s position and the cost center.

SAP recommends that you first implement the cost center data integration sce-
nario before using the scenario for organizational data.

data. Time dependency is also considered. The built-in extensibility options allow
data integration to be enhanced through the implementation of a Business Add-In
(BAdI), to take into account customer-specific requirements.

Packaged Integrations for Employee Central 
and Payroll
This section discusses the Employee Central integration with both on-premise
SAP Payroll (see Section 3.4.1) and Employee Central Payroll (see Section 3.4.2).
Integration of the employee administration system with the payroll systems is
one of the most common and foundational integrations in HCM.
3.4.1
SAP Payroll Integration
There are over 7,000 installations of on-premise SAP Payroll. Even when custom-
ers move all HCM applications to the cloud, they may continue to use SAP Payroll
on-premise. To enable such customers to reduce cost and business risk, SAP pro-
vides a packaged integration to connect Employee Central with on-premise SAP
Payroll.
Payroll Ownership
In some organizations, payroll is managed by the finance department rather than the HR
department. Such organizations tend to keep payroll on-premise, even when all other
people management applications are moved to the cloud.
In this scenario, customers run SAP Payroll on-premise and integrate it with
Employee Central in the cloud. The payroll system receives cost center data from
SAP ERP Financials and employee master data from Employee Central. You can
also integrate the UI of SAP Payroll into the UI of Employee Central for the
selected country payroll version.
This integration comprises predefined content and documentation based on best
practices for integrating both SAP Payroll systems with Employee Central. The
packaged integration to connect Employee Central to on-premise SAP Payroll
uses Dell Boomi AtomSphere as the integration middleware.
In this packaged integration, multiple types of data are sent between the systems.
The following types of data will be sent:
 Cost center 
Cost centers are replicated from SAP ERP Financials to SAP Payroll. The inte-
gration is based on intermediate documents (IDocs). The integration is auto-
mated.

Packaged Integrations for Employee Central and Payroll
3.4
81
IDocs
IDoc, short for intermediate document, is an SAP document format for business transac-
tion data transfers.
 Employee data 
Basic employee data is transferred from Employee Central to the payroll sys-
tem. The integration utilizes a web service and then transfers the data periodi-
cally. The amount of (historical) data transferred can be specified. The integra-
tion supports the loading of initial data as well as the replication of changed
data. Extensibility options allow data integration to be enhanced to include cus-
tomer-specific requirements.
The process flow of the packaged integration to connect payroll-relevant data
from Employee Central to on-premise SAP Payroll is depicted in Figure 3.7.

pack of HR Renewal, because SAP continuously delivers new country versions and
updates to support integration with Employee Central.
 User interface 
The user interface integration enables pay statement look-up for employees in
Employee Central. The user interface integration also enables HR administra-
tors to maintain payroll data in SAP ERP HCM without leaving the Employee
Central user interface.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met:
 SAP ERP EHP 6.0 or higher
 Employee Central (HCM suite) latest version
 Employee Central Integration 1210 Add-on for SAP ERP
 Dell Boomi AtomSphere (delivered with Employee Central)
 Optional: HR Renewal 1.0
3.4.2
Employee Central Payroll Integration
In this scenario, customers run Employee Central Payroll in the cloud and inte-
grate it with Employee Central in the cloud. The payroll system receives cost
center data from SAP ERP Financials and employee master data from Employee
Central. 
The process flow of the packaged integration to connect Employee Central with
Employee Central Payroll is depicted in Figure 3.8. In this packaged integration,
multiple types of data are sent between the systems. Integration of cost center
data, employee data, and the user interface is done exactly the same way as when
integrating Employee Central with on-premise SAP Payroll (see Section 3.4.1).

Packaged Integrations for Employee Central and 
Third-Party Applications
Employee Central makes use of multiple third-party cloud applications in the
areas of time management, benefits management, and payroll (see Figure 3.9).
SAP provides packaged integrations to connect Employee Central with time
management applications, such as those from Kronos and WorkForce Software.
Employee Central is integrated with benefits providers, such as Aon Hewitt, Ben-
efitfocus, and Thomons Online Benefits, via packaged integrations. For payroll,
Employee Central is integrated with ADP and NGA.

Kronos, Workforce Software, Aon Hewitt, Benefitfocus, Thomons Online Bene-
fits, ADP, and NGA are service providers who partner with SAP. However, cus-
tomers can also use providers who are not SAP partners for their time manage-
ment, benefits management, and payroll needs. To cater to the needs of such
customers, SAP provides standard integration templates for time management inte-
gration, benefits management integration, and payroll integration (see Chapter 8).
The following sections look at these integrations in closer detail.
3.5.1
Kronos Time Management Integration
Kronos Time Management is a time and attendance management solution. Kronos
Time Management provides employers with a cloud-based solution to manage
time- and labor-related information. Kronos Time Management receives informa-
tion from employee administration (core HR) systems, such as Employee Central,
and uses that information for time and attendance management purposes. Kronos
Time Management then sends periodic updates to employee administration sys-
tems and payroll systems that require time data for legal reporting and payroll
purposes.
Employee data is extracted from Employee Central and sent to Kronos Time Man-
agement periodically. The integration middleware technology maps the employee
data to a format provided by Kronos Time Management. It then sends the employee
data to Kronos Time Management, which accepts the data and populates necessary
systems.

Employees enter time- and attendance-related data in Kronos Time Management,
which then makes such data available. This data is fetched by the integration mid-
dleware technology and provided to Employee Central Payroll, which uses the
information for payroll purposes (see Figure 3.10).
Figure 3.10  Employee Central to Kronos Time Management Integration
Employees using Employee Central can navigate to Kronos Time Management to
enter time- and attendance-related information without having to provide a sep-
arate user name and password. SAP implementation guides provide information
about configuring such access as Single Sign-On (SSO).

ment purposes. It then sends periodic updates to employee administration sys-
tems and payroll systems that require time data for legal reporting and payroll
purposes.
Employee data is extracted from Employee Central and sent to WorkForce Soft-
ware EmpCenter periodically. The integration middleware technology maps the
employee data to a format provided by WorkForce Software EmpCenter. It then
sends the employee data to WorkForce Software EmpCenter, which accepts the
data and populates the necessary systems (see Figure 3.11).
Figure 3.11  Employee Central Integration with WorkForce Software
Employees using Employee Central can then navigate to WorkForce Software
EmpCenter to enter time- and attendance-related information without having to
provide a separate user name and password. SAP implementation guides provide
information about configuring such access as SSO.

Now that we’ve looked at the packaged integrations for the Full Cloud HCM
deployment model, let’s turn our attention to another important integration: user
experience.
3.6
User Experience Integration
In addition to data integration, user integration is provided in three areas:
 Administrators and employees can sign into ADP GlobalView without provid-
ing additional user names and passwords. This can be enabled by configuring
the systems for SSO.
 HR administrators can update infotype data specific to payroll in ADP
GlobalView seamlessly from within the Employee Central user interface.
 Employees can view their pay slips stored in ADP GlobalView pay slip infor-
mation from within Employee Central.
All systems are in the cloud and already use the same user interface. Therefore,
the integration teams have added limited value in this area for this deployment
model.
So far, we have seen the available packaged integrations that support the Full
Cloud HCM deployment model. Many customers choose to implement these
integrations on their own or with the help of a partner. Some customers like to
have a clear idea of the implementation timeline and costs associated with their
projects for budget and planning purposes.
To help such customers, SAP has put together content and services. Together, they
are called rapid-deployment solution packages, and there are rapid-deployment
solution packages that support the implementation of the packaged solutions for
the Full Cloud HCM deployment model. Let’s take a look at them next.

Rapid-Deployment Solutions
Many SAP customers are wary of the uncertainty associated with the implementa-
tion of hybrid solutions. To address these concerns, SAP provides an integrated
delivery approach designed to fix scope, contain costs, and streamline schedules for
implementation of these packaged integrations. SAP calls this delivery approach
rapid-deployment solutions. Rapid-deployment solutions enable customers to
quickly and affordably deploy SAP solutions for specific business requirements at a
low service-to-software ratio.
There is a rapid-deployment solution available for integrating employee data,
organizational management data, and cost center data. Employee data and orga-
nizational management data is sent from Employee Central to SAP ERP. Cost cen-
ter data is sent from SAP ERP to Employee Central.
Rapid-deployment solutions are available to cover the following packaged inte-
grations (see Figure 3.17):
 Transfer of basic employee data from Employee Central to SAP ERP. This allows
you to extract personnel administration and organization management data
flexibly and to perform full and delta uploads.

Employee Data Migration to Employee Central
A rapid-deployment solution to migrate data to Employee Central from a cus-
tomer’s current core HR system covers the migration of foundational data,
employee data, time off data, and position data from current core HR systems to
Employee Central.
This data migration solution enables customers to do several things. First, it helps
customers analyze existing data from virtually any source system. Second, it
enables customers to cleanse the data and transform the data to the required for-
mat. Third, the data is validated against specific customer business rules and
loaded to Employee Central. Finally, the data is reconsolidated against the source
data and a report of all migration activities is generated. Data migration is dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 11.
3.7.2
Delivering Rapid-Deployment Solutions via Partners
Partners who want to deliver these rapid-deployment solutions to customers get free
access to all the content from the SAP Service Marketplace. Content for all rapid-
deployment solutions from SAP can be accessed from http://service.sap.com/rds.

Case Studies
As discussed in Section 3.1, the Full Cloud HCM often applies to two types of cus-
tomers: those who are running an old core HR system and need to invest in a
modern core HR system and those who are running multiple on-premise core HR
systems and need to consolidate them into a modern, unified, cost-effective core

HR system. In the case studies that follow, we will look at one customer from
each type and see how that customer made the move to the Full Cloud HCM
deployment model and how the integration technologies and tools from SAP
helped the customer on the way.
3.8.1
Case Study 1
In this case study, we will look at a company in the financial services industry that
uses SAP to run its business. The customer has invested heavily in software that
manages its business for decades. However, its HCM software investment has
fallen behind for many reasons. We will discuss how the customer addressed this
situation by adopting the Full Cloud HCM deployment model. Let’s start with a
look at the company and the business problems it faces.
Client Scenario
In the following case study, we will look at the company AlphaBeta Co., a finan-
cial services company of about 5,000 employees that provides banking, financial,
and wealth management services to individuals and businesses.
Currently, AlphaBeta Co. uses SAP ERP to run its company and SAP for Banking
to run its banking business. The company uses other SAP Business Suite solu-
tions, such as SAP Customer Relationship Management (CRM), to manage its cus-
tomer information and SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM). It also
uses a 20-year-old HCM solution provided on-premise. The company customized
it heavily during the initial deployment and modified it to suit AlphaBeta Co.’s
needs over the years. The vendor that provided that solution does not support the
software any longer, and therefore the system is hard to maintain, costly to
upgrade, and no longer meets AlphaBeta Co.’s business needs.
The company’s current HCM system is connected to 15 different business sys-
tems. These include several business applications, such as SAP Financials, SAP
CRM, and SAP SRM, as well as multiple payroll and benefits providers. Most of
this integration is done via file-based data transfer on a daily basis. In the case of
some payroll providers, information is uploaded via data entry to service center
teams, which receive this information via Microsoft Excel files.

Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model

In addition, AlphaBeta Co.’s recruiting system is in the cloud, and employee
information from its current core HR system is sent via FTP every week. Figure
3.18 shows a simplified version of the company’s current landscape.
Figure 3.18  Current Landscape of AlphaBeta Co., Running an Old Core HR System
Given that AlphaBeta Co. is in the financial services industry, finding and retaining
top-quality talent is very important to their bottom line. However, the company
currently struggles to attract young, talented people, due in large part to their tech-
nological shortcomings described previously. The result is that the company is
seen as a traditional organization that doesn’t embrace new technologies and pro-
cesses used by younger workers today. AlphaBeta Co. uses a cloud-based recruiting
system to attract and recruit employees, but the processes to bring these new
employees into the company and motivate and retain them are paper-based and
rely too heavily on managers who themselves are not trained in the use and adop-
tion of new technologies and processes. Young interns and entry-level employees,
put off by the paper-based processes and old technology used by the company, are
being driven to rivals with newer technology and modern business processes.
To remedy its shortcomings, AlphaBeta Co. has chosen to move its entire HCM
solution to the cloud via the Full Cloud HCM deployment model.

Process Steps
Having chosen the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, the company is moving
its HCM solution to the cloud, including all talent management solutions from
SuccessFactors, such as Performance and Goals Management, Succession Planning,
Learning Compensation, SAP Jam, and SuccessFactors Analytics. For employee
administration, the company adopted Employee Central and Employee Central Pay-
roll.
Even though the company licenses SuccessFactors Recruitment Management and
SuccessFactors Onboarding, it has chosen to continue to use its current third-
party recruiting system with which everyone is familiar. To integrate the third-
party recruiting system with Employee Central, AlphaBeta Co. created a custom
integration using the APIs provided by Employee Central. Using Dell Boomi
AtomSphere as the enterprise application integration technology, the company
will send vacancy data to its third-party recruiting system and bring back new
hire data to Employee Central.
The following list describes the individual steps taken to successfully implement
these choices:
1. The company starts by migrating employee data from its legacy system to
Employee Central. It then uses the rapid-deployment solution provided by SAP
to handle the migration process. For detailed information about employee data
migration to Employee Central, see Chapter 11.
2. The company moves its payroll data to Employee Central Payroll to get payroll
up and running.
3. The company builds the necessary integration of Employee Central with SAP
ERP and third-party payroll, time management, and benefits providers. For
detailed implementation information about the packaged integrations between
Employee Central and SAP ERP, see Chapter 10.
4. Once Employee Central is up and running along with payroll, the company
implements the SuccessFactors Performance and Goals Management, Succes-
sion Planning, and Compensation systems.
5. Next is the implementation of SuccessFactors Learning for formal learning and
SAP Jam for informal learning and collaboration. The company implemented
the packaged integrations available to connect SuccessFactors learning to Adobe
Connect for virtual learning and PayPal Payflow Pro for payment processing.

Full Cloud HCM Deployment Model

6. The company builds a custom integration to connect its on-premise Active
Directory with the cloud-based HR system, using the middleware Dell Boomi
AtomSphere. For this integration, the company relies on the integration template
provided by the SAP professional services team and utilizes these services to
take advantage of the team’s expertise in this area.
7. The company integrates its third-party recruiting system with Employee Cen-
tral to bring new hire data in near real time to Employee Central.
The entire implementation process of the Employee Central module takes Alpha-
Beta Co. a year, plus another six months for the implementation of the Success-
Factors Talent Solutions modules.
Using Packaged Integrations and Integration Technology
Even after HCM is completely moved to the cloud, employee information is still
required by the company’s business applications, which it plans to run on-prem-
ise behind a firewall for years to come. This means that the company has to pro-
vide employee information and organizational information from Employee Cen-
tral to SAP ERP and SAP for Banking. It will also have to provide cost center
information from SAP Financials to Employee Central. The company will con-
tinue to use its current payroll and benefits providers. To do so, it has to build
packaged integrations for every one of those payroll and benefits providers. In
addition, it will have to build several custom integrations to other homegrown
systems that manage several business processes unique to the company.
Dell Boomi AtomSphere, the enterprise applications integration technology, is
made available for all Employee Central customers as part of their Employee Cen-
tral license. Customers can connect Employee Central with any number of SAP or
third-party applications for no additional license fee. Taking advantage of this
license offering, this customer integrates Employee Central with an existing third-
party recruiting application. This saves a significant amount of money in license
costs over the life of the software.
AlphaBeta Co. will also use the rapid-deployment solutions for data migration
and integration. Using rapid-deployment solutions provided by SAP enables the
company to define the budget and timeline clearly and without any budget over-
runs and enables the company to access SAP experts who have experience imple-
menting multiple data migration and integration projects.

Let’s now look at another type of customer with different business needs.
3.8.2
Case Study 2
In this case study, we will look at a company in the retail industry that uses SAP
to run its business. The company has invested heavily in software that manages
its business and its people. The company grew its business by building new
stores and by acquiring other, similar businesses. Because HCM is critical for the
retail industry, even the acquired companies have their own implementations of
on-premise SAP ERP HCM for managing their employees. Because every newly
acquired company has customized SAP ERP HCM to suit its culture and its own
needs, the company decided to continue using a separate instance of SAP ERP
HCM for every acquired business. However, over the years the management of
multiple instances of SAP ERP HCM has become costly and time-consuming. We
will now discuss how this customer addressed this situation by adopting the Full
Cloud HCM deployment model. Let’s start with a look at the company and its
business problems.

Client Scenario
In the following case study, we will look at the company IndustryShopper Inc., a
retail center selling industrial supplies that has about 30,000 employees. The
company distributes various types of supplies, such as material handling, safety
and security, cleaning and maintenance, pumps and plumbing, electrical, light-
ing, ventilation, tools, metal working, fluid power, heating and air-conditioning
products, motors, and power transmissions. The company has physical stores that
require different numbers of employees and temporary workers depending upon
demand and runs online and mobile stores that require the company to attract
and retain very talented employees. There is a separate division that analyses the
data provided by all stores and derives insight from that data, which then drives
hiring decisions in these stores.
Currently, IndustryShopper Inc. uses SAP ERP to run its company and SAP for
Retail Solution to run its retail business. It uses other SAP Business Suite solu-
tions, such as SAP CRM to manage its customer information and SAP SRM. It also
uses nine SAP ERP HCM systems on-premise and a data store to combine the
employee information from these nine systems. In addition, talent management
needs are handled via SuccessFactors Talent Managment.
The company’s current nine HCM systems are connected to a data store via cus-
tom integrations. There are nine different integration points, and they all run at
different times depending on the availability of the source system. The combined
employee data is integrated with SuccessFactors Talent Management in the cloud
via a file-based integration. This data is uploaded every night. Figure 3.20 shows
a simplified version of the customer’s HR technology landscape.
The company’s current business problem involves the multiple core HR systems
and instances that have become costly and time-consuming. As noted previously,
IndustryShopper Inc. currently runs nine different core HR systems, all powered
by SAP ERP HCM. Employee data is distributed across these nine different sys-
tems. When employees transfer between divisions or stores, their data is manu-
ally entered in the target system and is sometimes duplicated across systems. This
causes errors in payroll and delays in transferring employees across stores and
divisions that need their skills. It has also led to employee dissatisfaction and a
higher than normal employee attrition rate. While planning store locations and
office space for employees, the facilities management team struggles to get an
accurate headcount of employees and their current work locations. To solve this
problem, the company custom built a very expensive data store that combines

Case Studies
3.8

data from all nine systems for reporting and analytics purposes. This data store
addressed the problem of reporting, but the system’s user interface was com-
mand-line driven and required highly specialized experts. To access the data, HR
professionals, managers, and employees were required to rely on these experts.
This caused huge delays in decision-making and in many cases forced mangers to
make decisions that were not supported by reliable data.
Figure 3.20  Current Landscape of IndustryShopper Inc., Running Multiple Core HR Systems
To resolve these issues, the company has chosen to use the Full Cloud HCM deploy-
ment model to eliminate the need for nine different SAP ERP HCM systems.
Process Steps
The company currently runs some talent management solutions from SuccessFac-
tors in the cloud. With the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, it has chosen to
use all talent solutions in the cloud. This includes all talent management solutions
from SuccessFactors, such as Performance and Goals Management, Succession
Planning, Learning Compensation, SAP Jam, and SuccessFactors Analytics. For
employee administration, the company adopted Employee Central and Employee
Central Payroll. In this way, the company hopes to eliminate the need for nine

different SAP ERP HCM systems on-premise and the expensive data store it had
custom built.
The following list describes the individual steps taken to successfully implement
these choices:
1. The company starts by migrating employee data from the employee data store
to Employee Central. The company uses the rapid-deployment solution pro-
vided by SAP to handle the migration process. This is followed by the configu-
ration of Employee Central to suit its needs.
2. The company discontinues all the current integrations of the SuccessFactors
Talent Solutions module with SAP ERP HCM.
3. The company moves payroll data to Employee Central Payroll to get payroll up
and running.
4. The company implements the packaged integrations connecting Employee
Central to SAP ERP, using Dell Boomi AtomSphere enterprise application inte-
gration technology.
5. The company builds the necessary integration of Employee Central with third-
party payroll, time management, and benefits providers, using Dell Boomi
AtomSphere as the integration technology.
6. The company uses Dell Boomi AtomSphere enterprise application integration
technology to build the necessary custom integrations of Employee Central to
third-party cloud systems.
Using Packaged Integrations, Integration Technology, and Services
Just as in the previous case study, this company must also develop packaged inte-
grations, because it has to provide employee information and organizational
information from Employee Central to SAP ERP and SAP for Banking, provide
cost center information from SAP Financials to Employee Central, and continue
to use current payroll and benefits providers. In addition, IndustryShopper Inc.
will have to build several custom integrations to other homegrown systems that
manage several business processes unique to the company.
Like the customer in the previous case study, this customer also took advantage of
the Dell Boomi AtomSphere license offering to integrate Employee Central with
multiple third-party applications. This saved a significant amount of money in
license costs over the life of the software. The company also used the rapid-deploy-
ment solutions provided by SAP for migrating data in a predictable manner.

Summary
The Full Cloud HCM deployment model is for customers who want to run all peo-
ple management applications in the cloud. In this deployment model, customers
run Employee Central, SuccessFactors Talent Solutions, and SuccessFactors Work-
force Planning and Analytics in the cloud and integrate them with on-premise
SAP ERP applications. SAP and SuccessFactors provide packaged integrations to
enable easier and better integration between SAP ERP and the SuccessFactors
HCM suite.
In this chapter, we discussed how customers who are having trouble maintaining
and analyzing their employee data are good candidates to adopt the Full Cloud
HCM deployment model. There are multiple packaged integrations to connect
Employee Central with SAP ERP that are customized to address these different
customer needs.

In addition, we explored how Employee Central makes use of multiple third-
party cloud applications in the areas of time management, benefits management,
and payroll. SAP provides packaged integrations for these applications. To con-
nect with other time, benefits, and payroll providers, SAP provides standard inte-
gration templates.
We examined two case studies. First, we saw how a customer using a 20-year-old
core HR system implemented the Full Cloud HCM deployment model to create a
modern HCM suite in the cloud and how the packaged integrations and integra-
tion technologies from SAP helped. Then, we looked at a customer struggling
with multiple core HR systems on-premise; the company used the Full Cloud
HCM deployment model to cut costs while improving efficiency and user experi-
ence.
In the next chapter, we will take a look the Talent Hybrid deployment model,
which is aimed at customers who are happy with their employee administration
tools but need help with talent management and analytics.

105
 
In this chapter, you’ll learn about the Talent Hybrid deployment model, in 
which the talent modules are in the cloud and the core HRMS is on-prem-
ise. We’ll also discuss the packaged integrations that are available with 
this deployment model.

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
The Talent Hybrid deployment model is a combination of talent modules (Perfor-
mance and Goals Management, Learning Management, Compensation Manage-
ment/Variable Pay, Succession Management, Recruiting Management) that are in
the cloud, while the core HCM systems continue to be on-premise. When you
have the talent solutions in the cloud (either all of the talent modules or some of
them), data still needs to be passed between the on-premise SAP ERP HCM appli-
cations and the cloud-based talent applications.
After the acquisition of SuccessFactors by SAP, SAP and SuccessFactors became
invested in developing packaged integrations between the different talent mod-
ules of SuccessFactors and SAP ERP HCM. These packaged integrations facilitate
the exchange of data between the on-premise HCM applications and the cloud-
based talent applications.
Data Transfers
When data is transferred from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM, the data in the
fields identified for integration are transferred to SuccessFactors HCM. Unless you have
defined that the data residing in SuccessFactors HCM is the system of record, do not make
any changes to the transferred data in SuccessFactors. Any changes made to those fields
might be overwritten during the next data transfer for the same integration scenario.
In this chapter, we will discuss what the Talent Hybrid deployment model is, the
different integration techniques that can be implemented with it, and an over-
view of the available packaged integrations. To conclude, we will look at two
detailed case studies to see how an integration strategy is developed and how

customers can extract the employee data for transfer to their cloud-based Success-
Factors Performance and Goals Management application.
Let’s begin by looking at who the core audience is for this deployment model.
4.1
Target Audience
The Talent Hybrid deployment model helps customers maintain their invest-
ments in the core SAP ERP HCM applications and move their talent processes to
SuccessFactors talent applications.
Often, customers are already introduced to the concept of Software as a Service
and might have one or more cloud-based applications. These applications will
need be integrated with the on-premise SAP ERP HCM solution. In some cases,
customers might have already integrated with the on-premise SAP ERP HCM
solution by developing their own integration processes, possibly through flat file
transfers or developing custom web services.
In the next section, we will look at the options available for customers looking to
take advantage of the integration options for the Talent Hybrid deployment
model.
4.2
Technology Options
Before we begin looking at the integrations themselves, it is important to under-
stand the technology options that are available to facilitate them.
As shown in Figure 4.1, the customer can perform the integrations by using the
flat file method (option 1) or via the middleware integration method. The middle-
ware used for the integration can be SAP PI (or any third-party middleware tool;
option 2) or SAP HANA Cloud Integration (option 3).
The customer and the implementation team should discuss and develop an integra-
tion strategy. The strategy should leverage the option best suited for the customer.
In the Talent Hybrid deployment model (see Figure 4.2), the cloud application
will require the employee details to be made available inside the application.
Hence, the employee details (employees’ PERNR, their line manager, the employee

Technology Options
4.2

HR Manager, etc.) will be transferred from the on-premise HCM application to
the cloud application. The cloud application will then transfer the processed data
(for example, if SuccessFactors Performance Management and Goal Management
application is deployed, the employees’ final appraisal scores) to the on-premise
SAP ERP HCM application for further processing (if required).

Packaged Integrations for the Talent Hybrid 
Deployment Model
The following packaged integrations are available from SAP and SuccessFactors
for the Talent Hybrid deployment model:
 Employee master data integration 
In this integration, the employee and organizational data are transferred from
SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM to support the talent modules and the
associated talent-related processes (see Section 4.3.1).
 Workforce Analytics/Analytical extractors integration 
For this integration, all the data required to support workforce planning and ana-
lytics is transferred from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Workforce Analytics
(see Section 4.3.2).
 Compensation process/Pay-for-performance process integration 
During this integration, compensation data can be transferred from SAP ERP
HCM to SuccessFactors HCM to support compensation planning in SuccessFac-
tors. The completed planning data can be transferred from SuccessFactors HCM
to SAP ERP HCM, and this data can be included in the payroll run (see Section
4.3.3).
 Recruiting process integration 
In this integration, the position-related data (positions for which requisitions
are created) is transferred from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM to enable
the creation and maintenance of requisitions in SuccessFactors. Applications
can be transferred from SuccessFactors HCM to SAP ERP HCM to enable the HR
administrator to perform hiring actions in SAP ERP HCM (see Section 4.3.4).
 SuccessFactors Competencies integration with SAP ERP HCM qualifications 
In this integration, the competency catalog in SuccessFactors is integrated with
the qualifications catalog in SAP ERP HCM, and the employee competencies
maintained in SuccessFactors are integrated with the employee qualifications
maintained in SAP ERP HCM. The qualifications catalog residing in SAP ERP
HCM and the assigned employee qualifications are uploaded manually into
SuccessFactors. After the initial upload, the employee competencies are main-
tained in SuccessFactors and are replicated back to SAP ERP HCM through the
middleware (see Section 4.3.5).

 SuccessFactors Learning curricula integration with SAP ERP HCM qualifi-
cations 
In this integration, the learning curricula is integrated with the SAP ERP HCM
qualifications catalog, and each employee’s course completion status is inte-
grated with the employee’s profile in SAP ERP HCM.
The curriculum catalog is transferred from SuccessFactors LMS to SAP ERP
HCM. The curriculum type and curriculum in SuccessFactors LMS is mapped to
the qualification group and qualification in SAP ERP HCM. The curriculum sta-
tus of the employee is transferred to SAP ERP HCM as the employee qualifica-
tion (the employee’s qualification will be displayed in SAP ERP HCM as the
employee profile). The employee’s curriculum status will have a rating scale of
0 (incomplete) or 1 (complete) (see Section 4.3.6).
 Variable Pay integration 
You can use this integration to transfer employee history records from SAP ERP
HCM to SuccessFactors Variable Pay to determine an employee’s bonus eligi-
bility and calculate the employee’s variable pay. The calculated variable pay is
transferred back to SAP ERP HCM for payouts (see Section 4.3.7).
SAP ERP Version
SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 15 is the lowest version on which the Integration Add-on can be
implemented.
Refer to SAP Note 1708986 (Installation of SFIHCM01600) to understand the prereq-
uisites, installation process, and the follow-up for installing the Integration Add-on.
In a SuccessFactors project, it is a common occurrence that you might end up
using more than one of these integration scenarios. Table 4.1 explains the
sequence in which the integration scenarios need to be implemented, as well as
any dependencies that exists.

No dependencies exist between recruiting and compensation data integration
scenarios. You can implement either of the two scenarios (compensation or
recruiting data) in any order you wish.
The following sections look at these different packaged integrations in greater
detail.
4.3.1
Employee Master Data Integration
The employee master data packaged integration enables the transfer of employee
and organizational data using SAP Process Integration (SAP PI) or SAP HANA
Cloud Integration (SAP HCI) as the middleware bus (see Section 4.2).
This integration fully supports the transfer of all employee and organizational
data, as well the changed data records (delta) after the initial transfer. It also
allows you to transfer future employees from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors
HCM, enabling future employee access to groups such as SAP Jam and participa-
tion in onboarding activities. When future employees are transferred to Success-
Factors HCM, their status is set to Active; therefore, it is important that future-
dated employees do not have access to SuccessFactors HCM, do not participate in
any business processes, and are not visible to their future managers.

Employee master data must exist for inter-
nal candidates in SuccessFactors HCM.

You can define an indicator in the Customer-Specific field in the flat file that is
generated from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM to identify somebody as a
future-dated employee. You can use the report RH_SFI_PREHIRE_EMPL_DATA
(Sync Employee Data with SuccessFactors in Prehire Period) for extraction of data
related to future-dated employees. The extracted data can be transferred to Suc-
cessFactors HCM using the middleware.
To determine an employee’s manager in SAP ERP HCM, choose one of the follow-
ing options:
 The relationship B012 (Is Managed by) between the employee’s organizational
unit and the manager’s position
 The relationship A002 (Reports to) between the employee’s position and the
manager’s position
The data extracted will be used in the Manager field in SuccessFactors HCM.
As shown in Figure 4.3, you can use the packaged integration to do an initial
transfer of basic personnel administration and organizational data using SAP PI or
SAP HANA Cloud Integration as the middleware bus.
Figure 4.3  Employee Master Data Integration
The data is also transferred due to a business-process-driven event, such as new
hire, rehire, termination (voluntary or involuntary), transfer, or any changes that
are made in the employee data.
We will discuss more about employee master data integration and the configura-
tion settings that need to be made in an SAP ERP HCM system in Chapter 10, Sec-
tion 10.2.

 Employee profiles are set up and maintained in SuccessFactors
 Employees are hired and their master data exists in the SAP ERP HCM system with at
least the following infotypes:
 0000—Actions
 0001—Organizational Assignment
 0002—Personal Data
 0105 (Subtype: Email)—Communication

Workforce Analytics/Analytic Extractors Integration
The analytical extractors integration supports the extraction of reporting data
required for SuccessFactors Workforce Analytics from SAP ERP HCM using SAP
PI or SAP HANA Cloud Integration as the middleware integration bus. This inte-
gration also supports the preparation of the extracted data for upload to Success-
Factors HCM.
As shown in Figure 4.4, the extractors enable you to extract the required report-
ing data from SAP ERP HCM into a flat file and use SAP PI to store these files in
an SFTP server. The file mappings are done on the middleware, and the data files
are pushed into an SFTP server. Using a prescheduled job, SuccessFactors HCM
will read this file and upload into the tables.

Compensation Process/Pay-for-Performance Integration
The compensation process, or pay-for-performance integration enables the bidi-
rectional transfer of employees and their salary data to support compensation
processing in the SuccessFactors Compensation module. In a typical pay-for-
performance environment, managers will consider the employee’s performance
and their salary band during the compensation payout process.
As shown in Figure 4.5, the process for the pay-for-performance integration
begins with the transfer of employee data, organizational data, and salary details
from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM.

Any changes made in the compensation data for the employee, such as salary
change, bonuses (lump sum payment), or LTI (Long-Term Incentive), is trans-
ferred from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM for processing by SAP Payroll. 
For the compensation processing, the following data are extracted from SAP ERP
HCM:
 Salary information 
The employee’s salary information (annual, monthly, bimonthly, or hourly)
 Additional organizational information 
Start date at the current position and the pay grade
 Additional personal information 
If required, additional employee-related data (eligibility, job title, job level, etc.)
This data is extracted from SAP ERP HCM using the standard extraction logic. You
can enhance the BAdI to include custom logic, if any. One of the reasons that you
might want to enhance the delivered BAdI will be to determine the employee’s
eligibility to participate in the compensation process in SAP ERP HCM. You can
also determine the employee’s eligibility in SuccessFactors. There are no best
practices as to where the employee’s eligibility should be determined.
What is required, however, is that employee-related data (current salary, current
job title, job grade, etc.) must be transferred to SuccessFactors HCM prior to the
start of the compensation process. This will ensure that the managers have accu-
rate and up-to-date information about the employees.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites should be satisfied prior to implementing the pay-for-per-
formance process integration:
 Integration Add-on 1.0 SP 02 for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors HCM is imple-
mented.
 An initial compensation template is set up in SuccessFactors to enable compensation
related evaluation.
 Employee data interface is implemented, and employee-related data is transferred
from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM for employees who require being part of
the compensation process.
 Field groupings are configured for data export from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors.
 Field groupings are configured for data import from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM.
 An ad hoc report for export is configured in SuccessFactors.

Recruiting Process Integration
The recruiting process integration enables the transfer of newly hired candidate
data from SuccessFactors HCM to SAP ERP HCM. Once the new hire data is trans-
ferred to SAP ERP HCM, the hiring process is initiated and executed in SAP ERP
HCM (see Figure 4.6).
Figure 4.6  Recruiting Process Integration
As shown in Figure 4.6, the process for integration is as follows:
 Employee, organizational data, and vacancy information are transferred from
SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Recruiting. With these data, the requisition
process is initiated in SuccessFactors Recruiting.
 Even if the integration is implemented, if the customers desire, they can initiate
the requisition creation in SuccessFactors Recruiting without these data.
 Once the candidate accepts the offer, the new hire data is transferred from Suc-
cessFactors Recruiting to SAP ERP HCM and is maintained as a new employee.
 Status of candidate data transfer is uploaded to SuccessFactors HCM.
 Candidate is marked as Hired and linked to the employee data.
 Now the employee (newly hired candidate) can execute the talent management
processes (for example, search for jobs as an internal candidate).

When the vacancy data is transferred from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors
Recruiting, position details such as position description and location of the posi-
tion are also transferred. When the identified candidate is hired in SAP ERP HCM,
the information is sent back to SuccessFactors Recruiting, and the candidate infor-
mation is updated with the employee ID. Now, the newly hired candidate will be
identified in SuccessFactors Recruiting as an internal candidate. The hiring action
in SAP ERP HCM can be a new hire, a rehire, or a transfer, depending on whether
the identified candidate is a new candidate, an alumni of the organization, or an
existing employee.
When the identified candidate has accepted the offer, SuccessFactors Recruiting
will initiate an action to hire (or rehire or transfer) the candidate to the identified
position. This transfer of information is initiated automatically in the system.
We discuss more about recruiting process integration and the configuration set-
tings that need to be made in SAP ERP HCM system in Chapter 10, Section 10.3.

SuccessFactors Competencies Integration with 
SAP ERP HCM Qualifications
This packaged integration enables automated uploading of the qualifications cat-
alog maintained in SAP ERP HCM to the SuccessFactors competency library.
The competency library in SuccessFactors is used to maintain an employee’s com-
petences. Modules such as Succession Management, Performance and Goals
Management, and Learning Management access this competency library for their
talent-related business processes. Similarly, many customers maintain a qualifica-
tions catalog in SAP ERP HCM. The qualifications catalog is used to track an
employee’s competencies, learning requirements, and other talent-related pro-
cesses. Figure 4.7 illustrates the SuccessFactors Competency integration.

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model

Figure 4.7  SuccessFactors Competencies Integration with SAP ERP HCM Qualifications
When customers implement SuccessFactors talent modules, they sometimes pre-
fer to leverage the qualifications catalog maintained in SAP ERP HCM. They also
prefer a single system of truth to maintain the competency library and track the
competencies of their employees.

Customers who maintain the qualifications catalog in SAP ERP HCM can export
the qualifications into a flat file and populate the SuccessFactors competency
library. This is a one-time upload only, and no middleware is used.
In SAP ERP HCM, if you maintain an employee’s competency using the qualifica-
tion catalog, then the data can be migrated from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors
using this packaged integration. The migrated competency data of the employees
can be viewed in the competency profile. Once these uploads are completed, the
customer is required to maintain the competency library in SuccessFactors only.
Any changes made to the competency library or to an employee’s competency
profile in SuccessFactors are updated in SAP ERP HCM on a periodic basis.
The SuccessFactors Competencies integration with SAP ERP HCM qualifications
packaged integration has the following limitations:
 The competency data object in SuccessFactors has relationships with multiple
objects. This packaged integration only supports the relationship between a
competency and an employee.
 The competency library in SuccessFactors has objects such as skills, behaviors,
teasers, and tuners. These are not supported with this integration.
 The packaged integration does not support competencies based on the Meta-
data Framework (MDF).
 If you delete a competency in the SuccessFactors competency library, then this
deletion is not replicated to SAP ERP HCM qualifications catalog.
 In SuccessFactors, an employee’s competency rating from multiple sources
is stored individually. However, in SAP ERP HCM only one rating is stored
for each qualification assigned to an employee. If you want to replicate the
employee’s competency rating from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM, then
customers need to convert the multiple ratings to a single rating prior to
replication.
Employee curriculum status Employee skills

Prerequisites
Prior to implementing the SuccessFactors Competencies integration with SAP ERP HCM
qualifications, the following prerequisites should be met:
 Ensure the employee master data is available in SuccessFactors HCM.
 In SAP ERP HCM, you can maintain qualifications in either the Personnel Administra-
tion (PA) or the Personnel Development (PD) modules. Where required, in SAP ERP
HCM you can migrate qualifications from one module to another. However, if you do
this migration after the implementation of this integration, then you must re-imple-
ment the integration.
4.3.6
SuccessFactors Learning Curricula Integration with 
SAP ERP HCM Qualifications
Many customers use sources other than the competency library to track the com-
petencies of their employees. This packaged integration is specifically useful to
SAP ERP HCM customers who have implemented SuccessFactors Learning Man-
agement System and use the curricula feature instead of the competency library
to track the competencies of their employees.
Any changes made in SuccessFactors curricula will be sent to SAP ERP HCM for
updating the qualification catalog maintained there. Similarly, any changes in the
employee competency profile will be replicated to the employee profile main-
tained in SAP ERP HCM. Figure 4.8 illustrates the integration process in detail.

The following are the assumptions and limitations that need to be considered
while implementing this packaged integration:
 No support is currently available for the one-time flat file upload of the SAP
ERP HCM qualifications catalog to SuccessFactors Learning Management Sys-
tem.
 If a curricula is deleted in SuccessFactors Learning Management System, this
deletion is not replicated to the qualifications catalog.
 Although the SuccessFactors Learning curricula is mapped to SAP ERP HCM
qualifications, SuccessFactors Learning items are not mapped to SAP ERP HCM
qualifications.
 The SuccessFactors Learning curricula might contain items that have an expira-
tion date. Each item can also have a separate expiration date. To arrive at the
valid end date of a curriculum, all the items within a curriculum are processed.
The earliest expiration date among these is interpreted as the curriculum end
date. If items do not have an end date specified, then it is assumed that the skills
will never expire. There is no start date supplied either. The current date is con-
sidered to be the valid start date. In every replication, the data for employee
skill is updated to start with the current date.
Prerequisites
Prior to implementing learning curricula integration with SAP ERP HCM Qualification,
ensure the following prerequisites are met:
 The employee master data integration is implemented and the employee master data
is available in SuccessFactors HCM.
 In this packaged integration, no data will be sent from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFac-
tors Learning. The curriculum is created and maintained in SuccessFactors LMS.
4.3.7
Variable Pay Integration
As seen in Figure 4.9, the employee history data is extracted from SAP ERP HCM
and transferred to Variable Pay in SuccessFactors.
Review Notes
Prior to implementing the integration scenario for Variable Pay, review the following
SAP Notes:

This note includes corrections for the package interface and enhancements to
domain fixed values used by the Variable Pay integration.
Figure 4.9  Variable Pay Integration
The integration requires the employee history data, which is used as input for
bonus calculations and planning.
Using this packaged integration, you can select eligible employees from SAP ERP
HCM and load them into the SuccessFactors Variable Pay application. You can
select the eligible employees based on certain criteria, such as location or depart-
ment. You can further apply business rules to filter the selected employees and
select only employees who meet the conditions of these business rules. In addi-
tion, you can modify the business logic (used to develop the business rules) to suit
the specific requirements of your enterprise.

 The packaged integration assumes that you are currently not using or do not
have SAP ERP HCM Compensation Management in your landscape.
 The effective date for Variable Pay is determined by user input. This effective
date information does not exist in the processed result.
 It is important to note that after the Variable Pay data is transferred to Success-
Factors no changes should be made in SAP ERP HCM. Any and all changes after
the data transfer should be made only in SuccessFactors.
 The variable pay result that you generated using an ad hoc report is based on
the completed Variable Pay process.
 If you set up the transfer of an employee history record as a scheduled job, then
there might be instances when you might have to delete certain records in the
staging area. (This will occur when the data is wrong or corrupted.) As a best
practice, it is suggested that you schedule a job to update the calculated infor-
mation in all Variable Pay forms.
SuccessFactors will use the transferred employee data to process Variable Pay for
the employees. After the Variable Pay is processed in SuccessFactors, the calcu-
lated bonus of each employee is transferred back to SAP ERP HCM to be included
in the payroll run.
Prior to the transfer of Variable Pay data from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors, it
is important that employee-related data are present in SuccessFactors HCM.
Calculated Variable Pay
Currently, the packaged integration does not support the transfer of the calculated vari-
able pay from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM. As a suggested practice, you can use flat
files to transfer the calculated variable pay from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM for
payroll processing.
The add-on for Variable Pay must be implemented on SuccessFactors release b1408
or later. The b1405 release also supports the integration, but variable pay for inac-
tive employees is not supported. The integration scenarios are fully supported using
the middleware. The current release of the Integration Add-on supports SAP PI, and
support for SAP HANA Cloud Integration is planned for the future.
The following general services are used for the Variable Pay integration scenario:

messages, if any.
Prerequisites
The following components are mandatory for implementing the Integration Add-on for
the Variable Pay integration scenario:
 Integration Add-on 3.0 SP 01 for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors HCM suite
(product version SUCCESSFACTORS HCM INTEGR 3.0, software component versions
SFIHCM01 600 with SP 09, SFIHCM02 600 with SP 05, and SFIHCM03 600 with SP
01)
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 15 or above (with version 600 of SAP ERP software components;
SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 15 comprises SP 38 for software component version EA-HR 600)
 SAP PI 7.11 SP 12 or above
 SAP PI Connectivity Add-on 1.0 SP 01 or above
 ESR Content for software component versions SFIHCM01 600, SFIHCM02 600, and
SFIHCM03 600
 SAP Gateway 2.0 SP 07 or above (and in the backend, software component IW_BEP
SP 07 or above)

User Experience Integration

4.4
User Experience Integration
When SAP ERP HCM customers implement SuccessFactors on-premise, one of
their big requirements is to access SuccessFactors modules directly from within
SAP Enterprise Portal, which provides a unified user experience for the end user.
In this section, we will provide an overview of how unified access can be imple-
mented.
4.4.1
Unified Access for SuccessFactors and SAP Applications
Using Single Sign-On (SSO), SuccessFactors modules can be called directly from
SAP Enterprise Portal. The advantage of providing this integration is that it
enables end users to access all of the applications (SuccessFactors applications and
different SAP applications that are available as iViews in SAP Enterprise Portal)
from a single portal. In this section, we will discuss how to set up SSO and pro-
vide a unified user experience to the users. We will also discuss setting up Secu-
rity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 as the SSO security token. It is
important to remember that SuccessFactors supports other security tokens, such
as MD5, SHA1, DES, and 3DES encryption of the username and/or password.
In this section, we discuss the integration between SuccessFactors and SAP Enter-
prise Portal, but you can integrate SuccessFactors with any identity provider solu-
tion, such as SharePoint.
Prerequisites
The following information should be obtained for your SuccessFactors HCM system
from SuccessFactors Customer Success:
 Digital certificate in the X.509 standard format
 SuccessFactors entity ID
 URL of the consuming service
 URL of the global logout response handler (optional)
 Relay state (relative path of the application to which the incoming SAML assertion
should be redirected)
First, you need to access SuccessFactors Provisioning to complete the provision-
ing-related setup (see Figure 4.10).

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
4
128
Figure 4.10  SSO Settings to Be Made in SuccessFactors Provisioning
You then need access to SAP Enterprise Portal with sufficient authorization to
make changes in the Content Administration area.
When you set up SSO, SuccessFactors requires the user first to be authenticated
on the customer side and then to be directed to the SuccessFactors home page (or
any other application that you might have set up). With this procedure, the num-
ber of user logins is reduced, helping to provide a seamless user experience.
A trust mechanism will pass the identify information between the customer and
SuccessFactors servers. This trust mechanism is based on encryption, timestamp,
and other relevant data, such as the username and password. HTTPS is the pre-
ferred protocol for the transport of this trust mechanism, because SuccessFactors
requires an HTTPS post from the customer’s SSO environment.
For security reasons, SuccessFactors recommends that all parameters that are
passed should be an HTTPS post instead of a GET. A HTTPS post prevents sniffing
when information is passed through the network. A HTTPS connection ensures
that all information is encrypted when transmitted through the network. Success-
Factors supports HTTPS GET if the customer prefers this protocol.
Prior to data being sent to SuccessFactors, the data packet must be encrypted.
When SuccessFactors receives the packet, it will check the timestamp attached to
the packet. If the timestamp is more than the predefined period, the user login

User Experience Integration
4.4
129
will be rejected. This predefined expiration period is configured in SuccessFactors
Provisioning.
SSO Expiration
If SSO expiration is activated, then there is an option to specify the time zone that can
be used for the expiration check. If a time zone is not specified, then it will default to
the SuccessFactors server (datacenter) time zone. As a best practice, we suggest that
you pass the time zone as part of the HTTPS POST/GET. If you pass the time zone, then
it will be considered for the SSO expiration check.
4.4.2
Configuration in SuccessFactors Provisioning
To continue the process of unified access, the following configuration steps must
be undertaken in SuccessFactors Provisioning:
1. Click on the Single Sign-On Settings (SSO) configuration option. In the dis-
played page, select the SAML v2 SSO radio button.
SuccessFactors HCM User ID
The SuccessFactors HCM user ID (UID) must be available as a user attribute in the User
Management Engine of the identity provider (IdP).
2. The SAML Asserting Parties (IdP) section is displayed (see Figure 4.11). Enter
the following details in the fields:
 SAML Asserting Party Name: Enter a unique identifier.
 SAML Issuer: This should be the provider name you have identified.
 Relaying Party Description: The value will be Localhost.
 Require Mandatory Signature: The possible values are a) Assertion b)
Response (Customer Generated/IdP/ADP) c) Both, or d) Neither. Check
with your admin what values need to be used.
 Enable SAML Flag: Choose Enabled.
 SAML Verifying Certificate: Paste in the SAML certificate you down-
loaded. Remember to enter the Begin Certificate text above the pasted cer-
tificate and the End Certificate text below the pasted certificate.

3. Now, click on the Add an asserting party button. The asserting party that you
created is now available in the picklist attached to the SAML Asserting Parties
(IdP) field.
4. To activate the integration, in the Reset Token field enter a user-defined token.
Click on Save Token to save the entries.
Disable SSO
To disable SSO, leave the Reset Token field empty and click on the Save Token button.
4.4.3
Integrating SuccessFactors HCM with SAP Enterprise Portal
Next, you need to create an iView to call SuccessFactors HCM from the SAP Enter-
prise Portal. To do so, follow these steps:
1. In the Content Administration area of SAP Enterprise Portal, create an URL
portal and enter the following details:
 URL: Specify your SAP Enterprise Portal and add “/saml2/idp/sso” at the end
of the portal.
 Saml2sp: Specify the entity ID provided by SuccessFactors, which will be
similar to https://www.successfactors.com.
 RelayState: Specify the relay state provided by SuccessFactors.

User Experience Integration
4.4
131
Tip
The URL can also be created manually by specifying the PORTAL, ENTITY, and RELAY-
STATE as https://<portal>/saml2/idp/sso?saml2sp=ENTITY&RelayState=RELAYSTATE.
As a best practice, it is recommended that you use a URL encoder to encode the para-
meters.
2. You can test this by logging in as a user who has credentials set up in Success-
Factors HCM and SAP Enterprise Portal. Navigate to the iView, and check
whether SuccessFactors HCM opens in a new window.
You might have business requirements that necessitate the user be directed to the
landing page of SuccessFactors HCM rather than to specific applications. In such
a circumstance, you can use deep links to direct the users to the appropriate Suc-
cessFactors applications.
To embed the deep links, follow this procedure:
1. Create the URL, as mentioned previously in this section.
2. If you would like the user to be taken to the SuccessFactors Recruiting Careers
landing page, then RelayState will have a value of RelayState=/sf/careers.
Table 4.4 lists deep links and the corresponding landing pages.

3. Typically, when SSO is activated, the SuccessFactors password maintenance
functionality is turned off. This prevents users from changing their passwords
directly in SuccessFactors. You can switch off the SuccessFactors password
maintenance functionality directly in Admin Tools.
4. In Admin Tools, click the Company System and Logo Settings option. In the
displayed page, select the Hide the Personal Password Tab from Users
checkbox option. This will prevent the system from asking users to update their
passwords.
5. Again in Admin Tools (see Figure 4.12), click the Password & Login Policy
Settings option. In the displayed page, enter -1 in the Maximum Password
Age (in days) field. A value of -1 will keep the password from expiring.

If you decide to disable SSO, then you must rollback these settings as needed for
your business requirements.

Rapid-Deployment Solutions
To ease the pressure of uncertainties involved in implementing integrations in
the Talent Hybrid deployment model, SAP provides preconfigured integration
solutions referred to as rapid-deployment solutions (RDS).
Rapid-Deployment Solutions Download
Customers can download the required RDS integration option from the SAP Service
Marketplace. Each RDS integration option has detailed configuration documents that
list the prerequisites and the required configurations that need to be completed by
the customers.

Rapid-Deployment Solutions
4.5
135
The following sections discuss the RDS-related integration options currently
available for the Talent Hybrid deployment model.
4.5.1
Recruiting Integration between SuccessFactors 
and SAP ERP HCM
The recruiting RDS integration solution supports two process scenarios:
 Job requisition 
In this scenario, requisition-related data, such as job description, hiring man-
ager details, position title, job location, country, and so on, are transferred
from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Recruiting. The requisition ID is also
stored in Infotype 1107 (SuccessFactors Job Requisition) in SAP ERP HCM.
 Candidate selection 
In this scenario, qualified users can search for qualified candidates for a specific
requisition. The identified candidate data is transferred to SAP ERP HCM for
hiring as an employee.
4.5.2
User Authentication Integration
The user authentication integration provides the ease and capabilities of signing
on to multiple applications at once via one authentication access point.
When SSO is installed, this RDS integration solution enables users to access both
SAP ERP HCM applications and SuccessFactors applications through SAP Enter-
prise Portal without having to sign in multiple times.
4.5.3
Compensation Integration
The compensation integration facilitates the transfer of salary-related data from
SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors. For the employee, when there is a salary change
or bonus payment the changes are transferred from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP
HCM for payroll processing. This integration is primarily used in pay-for-perfor-
mance business processes.
Now that we’ve looked at the different integration technologies for the Talent
Hybrid deployment model and an overview of the user experience integration
and rapid-deployment solutions, let’s turn our attention to the two case studies
that will provide real-world applications of this content.

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model

Case Studies
The following two case studies will walk through the implementation of Success-
Factors cloud applications using flat files and the implementation of SuccessFactors
Succession Management using the MDF.
4.6.1
Case Study 1
In this case study, we will see a customer implement SuccessFactors cloud appli-
cations for the first time using the flat files integration method to transfer
employee-related data from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors HCM.
The case study will walk through the process of how to use the SuccessFactors-
provided data templates and will cover the settings that need to be completed in
SuccessFactors Provisioning to automate the data integration.
Client Scenario
In the following case study, we will look at the company ABC Inc., a large con-
sumer goods manufacturer with over 20,000 employees present in 18 countries,
headquartered in the United States.
ABC Inc. has an existing SAP on-premise solution and uses all modules from SAP
ERP HCM. The company’s employee data is maintained in the SAP ERP HCM
application. Employees can update their personal info by using Employee Self-
Service, made available through the SAP Enterprise Portal.
To improve HR processes to better support enterprise-level talent strategies, ABC
Inc. is implementing SuccessFactors Performance and Goals Management and
Succession Management. To do this, they have chosen the flat file integration
strategy due to the simplicity of the process. The company believed it would be
overwhelmed with the change management activities during the rollout of Suc-
cessFactors and did not want to spend time or money implementing SAP PI. It is
also important to note that ABC Inc. is an existing TIBCO user and has not been
interested in developing APIs or web services to integrate SAP ERP HCM and Suc-
cessFactors with TIBCO as the middleware broker.
Important!
Even though flat files are used for the data integration, no SAP-delivered add-ons were
implemented during this customer project.

Case Studies
4.6
137
Now that we have discussed the client scenario and the integration strategy cho-
sen, let’s begin looking at the process steps that must be undertaken for a success-
ful implementation.
Process Steps
To begin, the company team develops an ABAP interface to get a listing of active
employees, the managers they report to, their HR representatives, and other rel-
evant data from the on-premise SAP ERP HCM application.
The data that is derived from the SAP ERP HCM application then needs to be
entered in the SuccessFactors-delivered employee data template and uploaded
into SuccessFactors HCM.
As shown in Figure 4.13, the ABAP interface will extract employee demographic
data from SAP ERP HCM through the following process:
1. Read an employee’s current PA0000 record.
2. Output a CSV file and save it in a predetermined SAP HR network drive.
3. Use an SAP PI file-watcher job to trigger a job that will send the file to the Suc-
cessFactors secure FTP site.
4. A scheduled job will upload the employee demographic file into SuccessFactors
HCM.
Figure 4.13  Extraction of Data for Upload into SuccessFactors HCM
Inactive and Active Employees
For the talent modules, it is not required to upload an inactive employee’s demographic
data (i.e., the PA0000/STAT2 field will have a value of 0 or 2) into SuccessFactors HCM.
Hence, we suggest that you upload only active employees into SuccessFactors HCM
(i.e., the PA0000/STAT2 field will have a value of 1 or 3).
HTTP protocol is no longer supported; SuccessFactors supports SFTP and HTTPS proto-
cols only. Hence, you do not need to encrypt the file.
If you are still interested in encrypting the file, you can use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
protocol to encrypt the files.

status of the employee. The employee can have either an Active status or an
Inactive status. The mapping of the status in the SAP ERP HCM application
to SuccessFactors is as follows: If the status in SAP = 0 (employee is sepa-
rated), then the status in SuccessFactors is translated as Inactive. If the status
in SAP = 1 (employee is on unpaid leave), then the status in SuccessFactors
is translated as Active. If the status in SAP = 2 (employee has retired), then

the status in SuccessFactors is translated as Inactive. If the status in SAP = 3
(employee is on paid leave), then the status in SuccessFactors is translated as
Active.
 USERID: This must always be the second field in the template. If your orga-
nization is based off a single SAP ERP HCM system, then the employee’s
PERNR can be mapped as the USERID in SuccessFactors. If you have multiple
SAP ERP HCM systems or have implemented concurrent employment or
global employment, then as a best practice the employee Business Partner
(BP) number is mapped as the USERID in SuccessFactors. The USERID is
unique to the employee and should not be changed during the employee’s
tenure with the company. As a best practice, do not reuse the USERID for
another employee. The USERID of the employee is visible in the SuccessFac-
tors system to other employees; do not use any PII data as the USERID.
 USERNAME: Users use the values stored in this field to log in to the system.
USERNAME is visible to other users in the system and should not contain
any PII data. USERNAME must be unique, but can be changed during the
employee tenure. As a best practice, you can use the employee network
login or the SAP account as the value for USERNAME.
 FIRSTNAME: This field contains the employee’s first name.
 NICKNAME: This field can be used to display the employee’s preferred first
name. Often, employees use a preferred name and would like to be
addressed by that name.
 LASTNAME: This field contains the employee’s last name.
 MI: This field is used to display the employee’s middle initial.
 GENDER: This field contains one of two values: F (Female) or M (Male). The
value contained in this field is used by other applications, such as Writing
Assistant (to refer to the user as “he” or “she”).
 EMAIL: In this field, the system will use the stored value to deliver system-
generated notifications.
 MANAGER: The value in this field helps create the organization hierarchy.
The USERID of the manager the employee reports to is stored in this field.
Usually, the head of the organization will have a NO_MANAGER value dis-
played in this field. The employee whose USERID is stored in this field
should have an Active status in the system.

 HR: The value in this field displays the USERID of the assigned HR represen-
tative. If HR does not need to be maintained, then enter a value of NO_HR in
the field.
 DIVISION: This field can be used to display the company name. The value in
this field is typically used in reporting and in permissions. If data does not
exist for an employee, then a value of N/A can be used. As a best practice,
ensure that the value stored in this field is made visible to the user.
 DEPARTMENT: This field can be used to display the organization name. The
value in this field is typically used in reporting and in permissions. If data
does not exist for an employee, then a value of N/A can be used. As a best
practice, ensure that the value stored in this field is made visible to the user.
 LOCATION: This field can be used to display the personnel area. The value
in this field is typically used in reporting and in permissions. If data does not
exist for an employee, then a value of N/A can be used. As a best practice,
ensure that the value stored in this field is made visible to the user.
 JOBCODE: This field refers to the job code entered in Families and Roles.
Entries are case and space sensitive and must match exactly what is main-
tained in Managing Competencies and Skills—Families and Roles.
 TIMEZONE: The value stored in this field is used for maintaining internal
date and time stamps for a specific user. If the field is blank, then the system
will default to Eastern Standard Time. To enable the system to automatically
adjust for daylight savings time, you will need to use the time zone ID
instead of the short name.
 HIREDATE: The format for the value stored in this field will be mm/dd/yyyy.
 EMPID: You can use this field to store a value other than the USERID stored
in the USERID field. If you are using the USERID field to store values other
than the employee’s PERNR (such as the employee’s Business Partner ID),
then you can use this field to store the employee’s PERNR.
 TITLE: This field is used to display the employee’s job title.
 BIZ_PHONE: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the
employee’s business contact information.
 FAX: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the
employee’s business fax information.

 ADDR1: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the
employee’s business address.
 ADDR2: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the
employee’s business address.
 CITY: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the city of
the employee’s business address.
 STATE: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the state of
the employee’s business address.
 ZIP: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the zip code
of the employee’s business address.
 COUNTRY: SuccessFactors uses the data stored in this field to display the
country of the employee’s business address.
 REVIEW_FREQ: This field is not required and can be left blank.
 LAST_REVIEW_DATE: In this field, the date format is mm/dd/yyyy. If it is
not required, then you can leave it blank.
 CUSTOM01 to CUSTOM15: These fields are used to capture employee
details that cannot be maintained in the SuccessFactors-delivered fields. Use
these custom fields very cautiously. You can only maintain 15 custom fields
for all the applications that leverage SuccessFactors HCM. (For modules that
leverage MDF, you can create up to 200 custom fields.)
 MATRIX_MANAGER: This field is used to specify the Matrix Manager for
the employee. The value will be the USERID of the Matrix Manager for the
employee. If your organization does not have Matrix Managers, then you
can leave this field blank.
 DEFAULT_LOCALE: The value stored in this field defaults to the system lan-
guage for the user. For example, if a user is employed in a US office, then the
value in DEFAULT_LOCALE will be en_us.
 PROXY: The identified proxy for the employee will be stored in this field.
 CUSTOM_MANAGER: The USERID of the CUSTOM_MANAGER for the
employee is stored in this field. Customers use this field to populate the
identified mentor for the employee. If there are multiple CUSTOM_MAN-
AGER values for the employee, then use the “|” symbol to separate the val-
ues.

 SECOND_MANAGER: You can use this field to develop a second planning
hierarchy. This field is used primarily in Compensation.
 LOGIN_METHOD: This field is primarily used to track whether the
employee is set up to use SSO or the password authentication method. If the
field USERNAME is filled with a value, then you can leave this field blank
 PASSWORD: Usually, this field is populated during the testing phase only.
We strongly recommend not populating this field in production files. If the
column is included in the template and if it does not contain a value, then it
will force employees to change their passwords.
In the test files, you can consider populating this field with the value contained
in the USERID field.
7. In the SuccessFactors SFTP site (see Figure 4.14), click on the Incoming folder
to upload the Employee Demographic data file. You must also create a sched-
uled job that can read this file and populate the BizX data dictionary. In Suc-
cessFactors Provisioning, in the Managing Job Scheduler group, click on
Manage Scheduled Jobs (see Figure 4.15).
Important!
As a suggested practice, do not use any SFTP client to access the SuccessFactors SFTP/
HTTPS websites. Access the SFTP website directly from your web browser. The SFTP cli-
ents are known to store connection information in an unencrypted format. Hence, we
recommend that you access SuccessFactors SFTP/HTTPS sites directly.

10. Figure 4.18 shows settings that are made by a customer. However, you might
have different requirements for processing the file, so set these parameters
accordingly. In the Server Access group, in the Host Address field, enter the

11. In the File Access group (see Figure 4.19), in the File Path field, enter “/in-
coming”, which is the folder in the SFTP host server where the data file will be
available for uploading into the SuccessFactors HCM dictionary. In the File
Name field, enter the file name as “<yourcompany_id>_EMP_.csv”. The yourcom-
pany_id referenced in the file name is the SuccessFactors instance ID.
12. As a suggested version control practice, it is a good idea to append the date
to the file name. In the Date Format field, select the date format you want
to use.
Figure 4.19  Configuring the File Path and File Name in SuccessFactors Provisioning
13. In the File Encryption field, select the option None. Because the SFTP host
server is being used, you do not need encrypt the files. If you still prefer to
encrypt the files, then select the option PGP.
File Naming
The name of the file in the SFTP server should be similar to the file name format you
configure in provisioning. For example, if your company name is ABC Corporation, your
instance ID is ABCPrd, and you have included date format in the file extension, then you
would have configured the file name as “ABCPrd_EMP_<dateformat>.csv”.
On the SFTP server side, the file will be named ABCPrd_EMP_140706.csv.
If the file names do not match, then you will get an error message when the job is exe-
cuted. The SuccessFactors notification will have a message similar to this: FTP transport
failed to get data file from FTP server: sftp4-int.successfactors.com. If files are

encrypted, then add .pgp to the end of the file name. In Provisioning, you will configure
the file name as “<yourcompany_id>_EMP_.csv.pg”.
Both CSV and TXT file formats are supported. If you are using TXT file format, then the
values need to be separated by a comma.
14. In the Job Occurrence & Notification group, choose whether this job is a
recurring job, a one-time job, or dependent on another job. Choose the start
date of the job and an end date if the job is to be terminated in a date range.
If there is no end date for the job, then you can leave it blank.
15. If you want email notifications to be generated and sent when the job starts,
select the Send Email checkbox. The owner of the job by default will receive
all email notifications related to this job. If you want notifications to be gen-
erated for additional recipients, then enter those recipients’ email addresses
in the Additional E-mail Recipients field.
16. Click on the Create Job button to execute the job. You will receive a notifica-
tion when the job is started. A notification will also be sent when the job is
completed.
With this process completed, ABC Inc. has successfully implemented their inte-
gration.

Case Study 2
In this case study, we will see how a customer implementing SuccessFactors Suc-
cession Management using MDF Position Management uses the flat file to upload
the identified key positions. The customer is using the flat file to upload the leg-
acy performance management ratings into SuccessFactors.
The case study will walk through the process of how to use the SuccessFactors-
provided data templates to upload the data one time only.
Client Scenario
In the following case study, we will look at the company RapidGrow Co., a large
retail store with more than 700 stores nationwide and over 27,000 employees on
its payroll. RapidGrow Co. is currently headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico.

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model

148
RapidGrow Co. is an existing SAP on-premise customer and uses the core mod-
ules of SAP ERP HCM, maintaining its employee data in the SAP ERP HCM appli-
cation. Except for a third-party recruiting solution, the customer uses pen and
paper for other talent-related processes.
To convert a pen-and-paper processes into a technology-driven process aligned to
current HR trends, RapidGrow Co. is implementing SuccessFactors Performance
and Goals Management and Succession Management.
To do this, the company is implementing an integration strategy that is a mix-
ture of flat files, Dell Boomi AtomSphere (the integration tool to integrate Em-
ployee Central and on-premise SAP applications), and SAP PI. For this particular
scenario, the customer decided to use flat files, because this data upload is one
time only.
Now that we have discussed the client scenario and the integration strategy cho-
sen, let’s begin looking at the process steps that must be undertaken for a success-
ful implementation.
Process Steps
To begin, two data files need to be uploaded to support Succession Management
processes in SuccessFactors. The first data file is the performance ratings of the
last five years. The second data file is an upload of the key positions of the orga-
nization.
Import Performance Ratings
RapidGrow Co. would like their performance ratings for the last five years to be
uploaded into the system. They have never rated an employee on potential, and
therefore no historical data is available. Because the historical performance data is
maintained via pen and paper, the HRIS team pulled the data into an Excel sheet.
To begin this process, perform the following steps:
1. As seen in Figure 4.20, in Admin Tools you can download the template that can
be used to populate performance ratings data by clicking on Import Extended
User Information.

by clicking on Download Data Import File Template.
Figure 4.21  Download the File for Trend Data
3. Figure 4.22 shows the format of the data file template that will be used to pop-
ulate data and upload it into SuccessFactors. The same template can be used to
upload historical ratings for Potential, Objectives, and Competencies. For this
case study, we will upload historical ratings for Performance only.

4. Table 4.6 lists the fields that are required for the data transfer of the basic
employee data.
Data Template
In the data template, a start date or end date is required, but not both. If you provide
only the end date, then the system will populate the start date with the same value as
the end date, and vice versa.
The current release of SuccessFactors (b1405) does not support the Name and Descrip-
tion fields. These two fields are included in the template for future use. Providing min
and max values enables SuccessFactors to normalize the rating to 100%.
The performance ratings are used in the calibration grid report, live profile data, succes-
sion org chart data, in analytics/dashboard reports, and are searchable via a query tool.

The performance ratings are then captured via the Overall Summary section in the
annual appraisal document, import of the performance ratings, and/or entered manually
by the permissioned user in the live profile.
5. Populate the template with the required data (see Figure 4.23) and save it as a
CSV file.
6. In Admin Tools, you can now upload the CSV file by clicking on Import
Extended User Information. In the displayed page, upload the file by click-
ing on the Browse button then selecting the Trend Information radio but-
ton. In Specify Additional File Options, select the options that meet your
requirements.

7. Click on Import Extended User Data File. SuccessFactors will queue the file
for upload, and a SuccessFactors generated notification will be sent once the
file is uploaded.
Position Management
The customer has implemented MDF Position Management for Succession Man-
agement. MDF Position Management for Succession Management provides ben-
efits such as a dedicated landing page for talent pools and effective dating of any
changes being made in identifying key positions in the organization.

Talent Hybrid Deployment Model
4
152
The talent team makes an annual review of the key positions in the enterprise.
Year after year, very few changes are made to the key positions identified in ear-
lier cycles.
The HRIS team will do once per year uploads of the key positions in the organi-
zation, and any updates to the key positions will be maintained in SuccessFactors.
If the key positions are updated in SuccessFactors, then a flat file containing the
changes will be uploaded into the SAP ERP HCM application.
Because the key positions updates are a once-per-year process, the HRIS team
decided to use flat file integration. To initiate this process, perform the following
steps:
1. In Admin Tools, search for the configuration step Position Management:
Export Positions. In the displayed page, click on Export Template (see Figure
4.24) to download a copy of the data file template that we will populate with
data and upload into SuccessFactors.

Note: If you are updating existing 
positions, this field is optional, but we 
recommend that it be included. Blank or 
invalid position codes will result in errors.

be hired) positions. If the position has a valid incumbent, then these fields
will be ignored. Any changes to these fields for a position occupied by an
active incumbent can be changed by employee import or by updating it in
the system.
 As a suggested best practice, have valid values for these fields to ensure
proper permission controls and display of TBH position records. The per-
mission controls determine who can do succession planning for these posi-
tions or for which positions you can do succession planning.
 For these fields, use the same header and value format that you use in the
employee import data file.
 If a TBH position has no manager, then you can use the value NO_MAN-
AGER (similar to the format you use in the employee import data file).

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the Talent Hybrid deployment model and the pack-
aged integrations available for integrating SuccessFactors talent modules and SAP
ERP HCM. We also discussed the employee master data integrations using flat
files and MDF-based Position Management in the case studies.
In Chapter 5, we will discuss the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, which is
particularly useful for customers who are implementing SuccessFactors Employee
Central and who continue to maintain portions of employee and organization
master data records in SAP ERP HCM.

Organizations that have invested in on-premise HR software want to 
leverage their investment while transitioning to the cloud. This chapter 
details the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model and defines scenarios 
that would best suit this integration choice.

Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
Although customers are eager to move to the cloud, some larger customers may
have difficulty transitioning in one single implementation. Instead, these custom-
ers adopt a more cautious approach while maintaining full functionality during
implementation for employees housed both in the cloud and on-premise. The
Side-By-Side HCM deployment model enables this phased and cautious approach
to the cloud (see Figure 5.1).

Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model

158
As of the time of writing (spring 2015), the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model
is still an evolving model with more scenarios being identified. A phased cus-
tomer implementation of the Full Cloud HCM deployment model, based on
region or subsidiaries, can be considered for a Side-By-Side HCM deployment
between the first and final phases. As such, this model is always an intermediate
deployment and never a final state model. Customers planning to move to the
cloud typically employ this model to start the journey at their own pace. The final
model will most likely be Full Cloud HCM deployment.
In this chapter, we will look at the various packaged integrations that are currently
available with the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, along with the user expe-
rience integration offered. In addition, details about exclusive features and busi-
ness processes for this deployment model will be examined. To conclude the chap-
ter, two case studies will be discussed that provide real-world application.
5.1
Target Audience
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is for customers who want to transi-
tion their HCM systems to the cloud while still leveraging investments into
employee administration on-premise. It comprises the coexistence of Employee
Central and on-premise SAP core HR.
Easing into the Cloud
In should be emphasized that this deployment model is for those customers that are
easing into the cloud. It allows businesses to make the transition without large-scale dis-
ruption during the process.
In the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, customers run core HR on-premise
for a majority of employees with SuccessFactors Talent Management solutions in
the cloud. Simultaneously, the customer also runs Employee Central and talent
solutions for employees that belong to a specific region or LOB.
Customers looking to employ the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model may be
facing some of the following issues: they are struggling with employee adminis-
tration for parent and subsidiaries, legal entities in other countries have the need

Technology Options

to implement different workflows, or there are branches or subsidiaries that have
different rules from the rest of the organization. Such customers fall into two
main categories:
 The first category of customers might want to implement the SuccessFactors
cloud business application for subsidiaries that are either legally separate
entries or have different cultures, workflows, and approvals, while still main-
taining the rest of their employees on-premise.
 The second category of customers may be running multiple, local core HR sys-
tems with specialized functionality catering to local population, where Employee
Central is used for general functionality for all employee populations and
includes Employee and Manager Self-Service (ESS and MSS) functions.
Legal Ramifications
For some US-based companies, there may be governmental-based legal ramifications
when exposing foreign nationals’ information online in the cloud. The Side-By-Side
HCM deployment model would enable companies to keep foreign employees on the
on-premise system to avoid exposing sensitive data that may result in penalties and
fines.
5.2
Technology Options
Before looking at the packaged integrations that come with the Side-By-Side HCM
deployment model, it is important to understand the technology options that are
available to facilitate them.
Dell Boomi AtomSphere is the enterprise application integration technology for
the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model. Dell Boomi AtomSphere acts as a single
hub in the cloud for all integrations originating from or ending in Employee Cen-
tral. For more information on the use of this technology option, see Chapter 3,
Section 3.2.
Via this technology option, the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model’s function-
ality is complemented and extended in the customer’s on-premise software,
helping customers to move their business to the cloud at their own pace and
terms.

Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model

160
Many customers run a majority of their employees on SAP ERP HCM but may
have employee populations in other systems as a result of acquisitions, geo-
graphic expansions, or “phase 2” implementation projects that never happened.
This model enables an organization to achieve a single view of its workforce and
allows single access for managers by connecting existing SAP ERP HCM deploy-
ments with new Employee Central deployments for those employee populations
that are not on SAP ERP HCM. This will enable customers to extend existing SAP
on-premise investments while planning a move to the cloud now.
With the SuccessFactors b1408 quarterly release, SAP provided the capability to
run Employee Central in parallel with the SAP ERP HCM system that customers
might have already deployed. Such a scenario is currently supported with pack-
aged integrations developed and maintained by SAP. The result is an overall
reduction of operational costs, minimizing the manual effort necessary to keep
distributed system landscapes synchronized and delivering the lowest possible
total cost of ownership. Typically, this scenario falls into one of the following two
broad categories (see Figure 5.2):
 Side-By-Side HCM consolidated packaged data integration (see Section 5.3)
 Side-By-Side HCM distributed packaged data integration (see Section 5.4)

Packaged Integrations for Side-By-Side 
HCM Consolidated
The Side-By-Side HCM consolidated deployment model uses packaged integra-
tions released for the Full Cloud HCM, with the SuccessFactors homepage as the
global UI hub for all employee, manager, and payroll mashups. Using the Side-By-
Side HCM consolidated deployment approach, Employee Central is established as
the single system of record for all global core HR processes, while keeping exist-
ing HCM systems for running local and country-specific HR processes and inte-
grations already built with business-critical systems. This scenario is most gener-
ally available across customers.
For example, consider a business case in which a customer currently uses multi-
ple core HR systems for different countries or legal entities. However, there is no
global template yet established. In this case, eventually there is no real consolida-
tion layer in the customer landscape to feed global HR processes or run analytics
in place. Using the Side-By-Side HCM deployment, customers benefit from hav-
ing Employee Central as the global core HR, setting up global processes (like
hiring and talent), establishing a global HR template, gaining insights into the
workforce (particularly head count globally), and providing global ESS and MSS
(including access to local processes but without modifying country-specific local
HR processes or integrations already in place).
Again, Figure 5.3 illustrates the Side-By-Side HCM consolidated approach.

The integration of employee data between SAP ERP and Employee Central repli-
cates basic employee information from Employee Central to SAP ERP. The inte-
gration enables business process execution in the connected SAP ERP systems
customers use to run their business.
The following section discusses the packaged integration from Employee Central
to SAP ERP HCM for employee data synchronization. This packaged integration is
applicable only for the Side-By-Side HCM consolidated deployment model. A
consolidated scenario implies that Employee Central is leveraged as the system of
record for all global core HR processes, whereas SAP ERP HCM is used for local
HR processes.
Employee Master Data from Employee Central to SAP ERP HCM Integration
SAP provides packaged integration content for this scenario via the SuccessFac-
tors Integration 1210 Add-on for SAP ERP. The integration of employee data from
Employee Central to SAP ERP is performed periodically via a web service. The
transfer of data can be performed in near real-time if required. In addition, the
amount of (historical) data to be transferred can be controlled. The integration
supports the loading of initial data, as well as a delta integration that replicates
only changed data (time dependency is also considered). The built-in extensibility
options allow data integration to be enhanced to include customer-specific attri-
butes required at the job or personal information level without the need to
change code; this can be realized simply through configuration.
To begin, the HR specialist enters employee- and employment-related data into
Employee Central. Data must be manually extracted for employees (for instance,
once a day) from the middleware to SAP ERP HCM.
The employee enters his or her private contact data, biographical data, payment
information, or direct deposit information in Employee Central. The HR specialist
then enters payroll-related information—for example, pay group and compensa-
tion information or salary and pay rate—in Employee Central.

Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met prior to this integration:
 This integration is an add-on for SAP ERP 6.0 or higher. The current version of the
SuccessFactors HCM suite is required.
 Employee Central Integration 1210 Add-on for SAP ERP 6.0 is required.
 Dell Boomi AtomSphere enterprise application integration technology is required.
Now that we’ve looked at the consolidated packaged integration version for the
Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, let’s turn our attention to the distributed
approach.
5.4
Packaged Integrations for Side-By-Side 
HCM Distributed
Using the Side-By-Side HCM distributed deployment approach, the workforce is
split up between two or more systems of record (i.e. Employee Central and one or
more SAP ERP HCM systems), and all of the changes are made in the system to
which the employee is assigned or in which his country of assignment is configured.
When customers plan for a multiyear core HR transition to the cloud using
Employee Central, they start with certain legal entities or regions that are smaller
in size and then transition the remaining pieces as evaluated from a business per-
spective, with an end goal of moving the entire organization to the cloud. This
approach provides the time and flexibility to reorganize employee data and move
to the cloud at their own pace. However, during the interim stage, customers will
want to have continued unified access for end users to all HCM processes, regard-
less of which system houses their core HR data.
To achieve this, a central UI navigation hub will need to be leveraged via UI mash-
ups in Employee Central for ESS/MSS cases in which administrators need to cen-
trally utilize the HR data throughout the company. Despite HR processes running
on their respective system of records, employee data still needs to be kept in sync

Packaged Integrations for Side-By-Side HCM Distributed
5.4
165
across the distributed HCM system landscape. This necessitates the transfer of
employee–manager relationship data (employee data maintained in on-premise
HCM to Employee Central for synchronization with the UI hub). In addition, it
should be noted that the data of employees mastered in SAP ERP HCM shouldn’t
be editable in Employee Central and access controlled by RBP. This type of inte-
gration is only available as a public beta shipment as of the writing of this book
(spring 2015).
Figure 5.5 further illustrates the Side-By-Side HCM distributed approach.
Figure 5.5  Side-By-Side HCM: Distributed Deployment Model
Employee Data Integration
With the SuccessFactors b1411 release, the employee data integration from one SAP
ERP HCM system to Employee Central is only generally available for new customers
leveraging Performance Management, platform features, and reporting.
With the b1502 release, SAP ERP to Employee Central employee data integration is
available for existing SuccessFactors Talent Hybrid customers enabling employee master
data replication from SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central with the Side-By-Side HCM
deployment model for customers.
The following section discusses the packaged integrations for the Side-By-Side
distributed model. This includes information on the on-premise SAP ERP HCM to
Employee Central system integration for employee data synchronization that
makes use of a single UI for global HR data maintained across systems within the
customer landscape, and the enhancements of the SAP ERP HCM to Employee
Central Talent Hybrid integration for the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model.

Employee Master Data from SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central
A large number of customers have a global business presence via on-premise SAP
ERP HCM systems. When such enterprises with a global footprint embark on
their cloud journey, they plan the global rollout of Employee Central to occur in
phases. In such circumstances, depending on the country, region, or legal entity,
you might have SAP ERP HCM and Employee Central coexisting as a system of
records. While the deployment of Employee Central is happening, customers can
still leverage their on-premise SAP ERP HCM applications for employee adminis-
tration.
To reduce cost and business risk for these customers, SAP has provided a pack-
aged integration to connect on-premise SAP ERP HCM with Employee Central in
the Side-By-Side HCM distributed scenario.
Current Release
The current release of the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model supports employee
data replication from a single SAP EPR HCM system to Employee Central.
You can make required configuration settings in SAP ERP HCM by following the menu
path IMG  Personnel Management  Personnel Administration  Interfaces and Inte-
gration  Integration of SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Employee Central Side By
Side.
With this deployment, you will notice the following points:
 The application administration of the workforce is split between SAP ERP HCM
and Employee Central, depending on the country, region, or legal entity that
the employee is attached to.
 HR-related processes are executed in their respective systems of record. How-
ever, the employee records need to be kept in sync across the distributed HCM
system landscape.
 Mashups available within Employee Central provide accesses to HR records
that are mastered in Employee Central as well in the on-premise SAP ERP HCM.
You can use either synchronous web service calls or CSV-based flat files and the
manual import framework to transfer employee master data from SAP ERP HCM
to Employee Central (see Figure 5.6).

Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met for this integration:
 This integration is an add-on for SAP ERP 6.0 or higher. The current version of the
SuccessFactors HCM suite (b1408 & above) is required.
 The Employee Central Integration 1210 Add-on for SAP ERP 6.0 is required, with
software component version PA_SE_IN100 SP 08 or above.
 Dell Boomi AtomSphere enterprise application integration technology (provided

Enhancement of SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central Data Integration
The packaged integration to integrate employee data from SAP ERP HCM to Suc-
cessFactors for the Talent Hybrid deployment scenario, discussed in Chapter 4,
Section 4.3.1, is enhanced with new capabilities to be used with Employee Cen-
tral for the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model. Additional data fields derived
from organizational management are now part of the packaged integration. Sup-
port is available for integration of more Employee Central entities, such as com-
pensation, recurring payment, nonrecurring payment, new MDF-based payment
information, addresses, and terminations. This integration also supports global
processes such as concurrent employment, including transfer of data for employ-
ees who are concurrently employed within SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central.

Now that we’ve looked at the different packaged data integrations provided for
the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, let’s look at another integration this
model employs.
5.5
User Experience Integration
The user experience integration for the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model
enables employees and managers to launch self-service applications in SAP ERP
from Employee Central and is now available as a packaged integration. Users can
easily access all HR data independent of systems and leverage the Employee Cen-
tral experience, including mobile support, by using the Side-By-Side HCM deploy-
ment model. Employees can use the SuccessFactors home page as a global UI hub
for all HR-related processes and data. Employee Central acts as a display only in
cases of local fields, and maintenance of these fields is performed in the system in
which they are mastered, such as SAP ERP HCM.
The use of Employee Central as the central UI hub for Side-By-Side HCM deploy-
ment customers has been offered as beta functionality in release 1405 of Success-
Factors and SAP. It is currently available in a public beta version as well. Here are
some use cases for this feature:
 If a global manager has team members, and some are mastered in Employee
Central, and others are mastered in SAP ERP HCM, then the manager can nav-
igate to SAP ERP HCM-mastered employees through the Employee Central UI.
This approach requires the data integrations discussed earlier in Section 5.4.
 The UI navigation for employees replicated from SAP ERP HCM to Employee
Central allows menus to adjust automatically for replicated employees.
 It can be used to view job information of replicated employee data from SAP
ERP in Employee Central.
 It can switch from Employee Central to SAP HCM processes and forms for
selected replicated employees.
 It can trigger workflow creation in SAP HCM.

User Experience Integration
5.5
169
This feature allows Employee Central customers to leverage Employee Central’s
UI as a central entry point for managers while still connecting to SAP ERP HCM-
mastered employees and/or processes for core HR. Figure 5.7 shows a transaction
using Employee Central as the UI hub for employees mastered in SAP ERP HCM
and those mastered in Employee Central.
Figure 5.7  User Experience from Employee Central to SAP ERP HCM Self-Service Applications
Managers of employees mastered in SAP ERP can navigate from the SuccessFac-
tors home page via UI mashups to the SAP ERP screen to trigger changes of
employee data (MSS). The employees mastered in SAP ERP can navigate from the
SuccessFactors home page via the UI mashups to SAP ERP screens to trigger
changes of their employee data (ESS). The SuccessFactors home page shows the
team members from various master systems, such as Employee Central and SAP
ERP (see Figure 5.8).
In addition, the Take Action & Go To menu in SAP ERP-mastered Employee Cen-
tral shows links for viewing employment information, personal information, and
other details, including links to change employee data.
The Change Employee Data screen also shows options to change time off-related
information, initiation of transfer, termination, and other related changes, whereas
the Change of Working Time screen shows an Adobe form displaying relevant
fields that can be updated directly in the SAP ERP system.

Process and Reporting Integration
In a Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, it is imperative to have superior pro-
cess implementation and reporting, even if the systems of record for user data are
different. This section details the key features of the Side-By-Side HCM deploy-
ment model that make this situation possible.
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model provides the ability to seamlessly run
core HR processes across systems while employee data is kept in sync from the
distributed HR system landscape, where the workforce may be split across sys-
tems (see Figure 5.9).

Process and Reporting Integration
5.6
171
Figure 5.9  Workforce Split among Systems by Country
For example, an on-premise SAP ERP HCM system can be configured to manage
a company’s employee master data. However, the HR processes can continue run-
ning in this system. The employee master data can be synced with Employee Cen-
tral so that the cloud-based system can be leveraged by global managers. Custom-
ers find this function appealing when they are moving certain data to the cloud
while keeping some on-premise.
When using the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, Employee Central sup-
ports a range of predelivered standard reports that can be adapted based on the
individual need. Reporting requirements on workforces maintained on separate
systems can leverage the central view and access. An example of this can be seen
in a company looking to get a headcount for employees across multiple branches,
departments, geographies, and subsidies.
Now that we have looked at the various features involved in this deployment
model, let’s see how business processes operate in the Side-By-Side HCM deploy-
ment model.

Business Processes
In the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, HR processes can be executed with
similar efficiency as in standalone systems. This offers convenience for customers
who are shifting data to the cloud while keeping some information on-premise.
Prerequisites
Prior to discussing some common HR processes in this deployment model, ensure that
the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
 Employees are replicated from SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central, but not from
Employee Central to SAP ERP HCM.
 The number ranges (primarily used for generating Employee PERNRs, Organizational
Object IDs, etc.) used in SAP ERP HCM and Employee Central must not overlap.
 You defined the system in which the employee is mastered. (The employee is mas-
tered in SAP ERP HCM or in Employee Central; the same employee cannot be mas-
tered both in SAP ERP HCM and Employee Central.) Common rules you can use to
define in which system an employee is mastered center on country, regions, and
other such factors.
 RBPs are defined to control maintenance access.
 Employee Central is used as the global HCM system to store all employee master
data, including for employees who are mastered in SAP ERP HCM.
 SAP ERP HCM stores the master data of employees who are mastered in SAP ERP
HCM only.
 The following data mappings should been implemented:
 The Central Person (CP) from SAP ERP HCM is mapped to the person_id_exter-
nal field in Employee Central.
 The Personnel Number (PERNR) from SAP ERP HCM is mapped to the user_id
field in Employee Central.
The following sections will discuss employee data considerations for transactions
performed in Side-By-Side HCM deployment on employees mastered in SAP ERP
HCM and those mastered in Employee Central.
5.7.1
Hire
In this deployment model, when an employee is hired in SAP ERP HCM, the new
employee is replicated to Employee Central.

Business Processes
5.7
173
In Employee Central, the employee’s PERNR (an employee’s personnel number
assigned to the employee in SAP ERP HCM) is mapped to the Employee Central
user_id field and the employee’s CP ID is mapped to person_id_external. The
employee’s data is stored in Employee Central as per the mapping you have
defined.
In SAP ERP HCM, using the feature Rules for Determining Entry Date (ENTRY),
you can define how the hire date is determined. The hire date as determined by
this feature is replicated to Employee Central.
Concurrent and Global Employment Scenarios
The current release (b1408) of the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model does not sup-
port concurrent employment or global employment scenarios.
The current release of the Side-By-Side HCM model does not support the scenario to
replicate global assignments of an employee with multiple PERNRs attached to one CP
ID stored in SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central.
If you have been using the SAP ERP HCM system for several years and are migrat-
ing to Employee Central, then you can replicate the employee master data from
SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central at a certain point in time by defining the
cutover date. If the cutover date is defined, then the fields Hire Date and Origi-
nal Start Date in Employee Central are filled differently, depending on whether
the employee’s hire date is before or after the cutover date.
The following considerations should be made when dealing with the cutover date
for hiring (see also Figure 5.10):
 If the cutover date is before the Hire Date in SAP ERP HCM, then the fields
Hire Date and Original Start Date in Employee Central are both filled with
the SAP ERP HCM Hire Date.
 If the cutover date if after the Hire Date in SAP ERP HCM, then the Original
Start Date field in Employee Central is mapped to the SAP ERP HCM Hire
Date, and Hire Date in Employee Central is mapped to the cutover date.
 If the Hire Date is before the cutover date and the employee master data in SAP
ERP HCM is changed before the cutover date, then the Original Start Date
field in Employee Central is mapped to the Hire Date in SAP ERP HCM, and the
Hire Date in Employee Central is mapped to the cutover date. Therefore, the

Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
5
174
employee will have only have one job info record in Employee Central, which
represents the data that is valid on the cutover date.
Figure 5.10  Hire and Data Change before Cutover Date
Hiring in Employee Central
In the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, if the employee is hired directly in
Employee Central, then the new hire process in Employee Central will work as usual.
Employees mastered in Employee Central are never replicated to SAP ERP HCM.
5.7.2
Rehire
In SAP ERP HCM, it is possible to rehire an employee and assign the same PERNR
and CP ID to the rehired employee. After an employee has been rehired, the
employee master data is replicated to Employee Central via the Side-By-Side HCM
deployment model.
When an employee is rehired in SAP ERP HCM, you’ll want to verify that the
rehired employee is not mastered in Employee Central. This verification has to be
manually done in Employee Central. If you’ve been using an SAP ERP HCM sys-
tem for several years and are migrating to Employee Central, then you can repli-
cate the employee master data from SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central at a cer-
tain point in time by defining the cutover date.
If the cutover date is defined, then the fields Hire Date and Original Start Date
in Employee Central are filled differently depending on whether the employee’s
rehire date is before or after the cutover date (see Figure 5.11).

The following considerations should be made when dealing with the cutover date
for rehiring:
 If the employee was hired, terminated, and rehired in SAP ERP HCM before the
cutover date, then the first hire date is mapped to Original Start Date in
Employee Central. The cutover date is mapped to Hire Date in Employee Cen-
tral. When a rehire is replicated to Employee Central, the special event reason
PSEUDO_HIRE is used. In this scenario, the date stored in the Original Start
Date (the date the employee was first hired into the company) is used to calcu-
late the seniority of the employee.
 If the cutover date is between termination and the rehire dates in SAP ERP
HCM, then the first hire date in SAP ERP HCM is mapped to Original Hire
Date in Employee Central, and the rehire date is mapped to Hire Date in
Employee Central. The event reason PSEUDO_HIRE is used in Employee Central.
Figure 5.11  Rehire before Cutover Date
Rehiring in Employee Central
If the employee is rehired directly in Employee Central, then the rehire process in
Employee Central will work as usual. Employees mastered or rehired directly in
Employee Central are never replicated to SAP ERP HCM.
If you hire an employee in Employee Central and this employee already exists in
Employee Central (because the employee either was mastered in Employee Central or
was replicated from SAP ERP HCM), then the system will perform a duplicate check and
will display a message. You will then be required to initiate a rehire event in Employee
Central using the same user_id and person_id_external data.

176
The current release of the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model does not support the
scenario in which an employee who was previously mastered in Employee Central can-
not be rehired in SAP ERP HCM.
5.7.3
Transfers
For employees who are mastered in SAP ERP HCM, an organization reassignment
would mean changes in Infotype 0001 (Organizational Reassignment). For any
organizational reassignment, the employee’s country assignment and personnel
number must remain unchanged. (The current release of the Side-By-Side HCM
deployment model supports only scenarios in which an employee can have only
one personnel number.) Any changes made in Infotype 0001 are replicated to
Employee Central. In Employee Central, the system creates a new record in the
job information object. The date these changes were made in SAP ERP HCM is
used as the Effective Start Date for this newly created record in the job infor-
mation object. The event reason DATAREORG is used in Employee Central.
Transfers in Employee Central
If the employee is mastered in Employee Central, then transfers or the organizational
reassignment process in Employee Central works as usual. Employees mastered in
Employee Central are never replicated to SAP ERP HCM.
International Transfer
When dealing with international transfers in this Side-By-Side HCM deployment
model integration, the following considerations should be made:
 Transferring an employee from a country mastered in SAP ERP HCM to
another country mastered in SAP ERP HCM 
When an employee is transferred from one country to another (mastered in
SAP ERP HCM in both countries), a Leaving action is executed in the original
country, and a Hiring action is executed in the new country. The employee will
get a new personnel number (PERNR) in the new country, and this PERNR will
be attached to the same CP.
The employee master data extraction program ECPAO_EMPL_EXTRACTION merges
data from different personnel numbers of the employee assigned to the same
CP ID, and the data associated with the different PERNRs are transferred to the

Business Processes
5.7
177
job information and job history records in Employee Central if the following
conditions are fulfilled:
 The PERNRs assigned to the employee are assigned in different countries.
 Only one PERNR is active.
 Leaving and hiring actions are completed for the employee record.
 Transferring an employee from a country mastered in Employee Central to
another country mastered in Employee Central 
There are no changes in the process in Employee Central when an employee is
transferred from one country to another. Employee records mastered in
Employee Central are not transferred to SAP ERP HCM.
 Transferring an employee from a country mastered in SAP ERP HCM to a
country mastered in Employee Central 
When an employee mastered in SAP ERP HCM is transferred from a country to
a country mastered in Employee Central, then you are required to execute a
future-dated leaving action in the original country.
The specific employee’s master data is replicated to Employee Central. In
Employee Central, carry out a Termination Event for the original country, and
future-date the employee status as Inactive. Now, in Employee Central, create
an additional employment for that employee in the hiring country. A new user
needs to be created in Employee Central for the new employment.
5.7.4
Termination
For the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model, when an employee is mastered in
SAP ERP HCM, if that employee is terminated in SAP ERP HCM, the information
about that termination is replicated to Employee Central. When the employee is
terminated in SAP ERP HCM, the employee record is set to the Withdrawn
status.
The replication of the termination status from SAP ERP HCM to Employee Central
ensures that the employee is terminated in Employee Central and that master
data in Employee Central is set to the Inactive status. When the terminated
employee records are replicated to Employee Central, a new record is created in
the job information object using a termination event and event reason.

Terminations in Employee Central
If the employee is mastered in Employee Central, then the termination process of
employees in Employee Central works as usual. Employees mastered in Employee Cen-
tral are never replicated to SAP ERP HCM.

Case Studies
As discussed in Section 5.1, the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model applies to
the customers that want to keep their on-premise HR system for catering to local
needs and have employee and manager actions performed in a modern, unified,
cost-effective core HR system. In the case studies that follow, we will look at cus-
tomers implementing the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model in consolidated
and distributed variants.
5.8.1
Case Study 1
In this case study, we will look at a company in the semiconductors industry that
uses different SAP deployments to run its business around the globe. They
invested heavily in software that manages their business for decades. However,
their HCM software could not provide a single system to manage their global
workforce. We will discuss how this customer addressed this situation by adopt-
ing the Side-By-Side HCM consolidated deployment model.
Client Scenario
ReliableBoards Co., a semiconductors industry of about 9,000 employees that
designs, develops, and manufactures flash memory microcontrollers and mixed-
signal and analog products, uses multiple HR systems for global human resource
management. The company uses other SAP Business Suite solutions, such as SAP
CRM, to manage its customer information and SAP SRM system. As a result, it
has implemented multiple HCM systems to meet requirements across the globe.
However, these HCM systems are connected to 25 different business systems.
These include several business applications, such as SAP ERP, multiple payroll
providers, and benefits providers. Most of these integrations were done via file-
based data transfer on a schedule. In the case of some payroll providers, informa-

tion was uploaded via data entry by service center teams that received this infor-
mation in Microsoft Excel files.
Their multiple HR systems do not provide a global employee count or cross-loca-
tion reporting and have become hard to maintain and costly to upgrade; as a
result, these systems do not meet their business needs. In addition to the diffi-
culty in connecting multiple HCM systems to different business systems, this has
pushed the company to use the Side-By-Side HCM consolidated deployment
model to implement a single HCM system.
Process Steps
Having decided to implement a single HCM system for the entire organization via
the Side-By-Side HCM consolidated model, ReliableBoards Co. adopted Employee
Central for employee administration and Employee Central Payroll to run payroll
for each of the regions.
This transition to the cloud was executed in multiple phases. Employee Central
housed all employee data at the end of the transition, and integrations were
implemented for payroll, benefits, time, and attendance systems. ReliableBoards
Co. integrated Employee Central with SAP ERP for local workflow management.
The following are the individual steps taken to successfully implement consoli-
dated Side-By-Side HCM deployment:
1. In phase 1, ReliableBoards Co. implemented Employee Central for North Amer-
ica. The company migrated North American employees’ data from an on-prem-
ise HCM system to Employee Central.
2. Then, the company implemented and migrated its payroll data to Employee
Central Payroll for processing payroll.
3. Next, the company used Dell Boomi AtomSphere as the middleware platform
to integrate Employee Central with on-premise SAP ERP in North America,
Employee Central Payroll, Workforce Time Management, and Benefitfocus. To
implement these integrations, they used packaged integrations provided by
SAP and executed the procedures defined in each of the integration handbooks
available at http://help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
4. Next, the company used Dell Boomi AtomSphere again as middleware, this
time to integrate Employee Central with Active Directory by utilizing the inte-
gration template provided by SAP Professional Services. The company then
went live with Employee Central for the North America region.

Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model

180
5. ReliableBoards Co. then implemented Employee Central for its European
region in phase 2 and for Asia in phase 3, following the same process outlined
for phase 1. In each case of these phases, the company integrated Employee
Central with its on-premise SAP ERP, Employee Central Payroll, and Workforce
Time Management.
6. After phase 3, the company has all its employees in Employee Central but still
executes some local processes in its on-premise system. However, Employee
Central is the company’s global system of record for employee data.
Let’s now look at a company that has decided to use the Side-By-Side HCM dis-
tributed option.
5.8.2
Case Study 2
In this case study, we will look at a company in the software industry that uses
SAP to run its business. The company has invested heavily in its current HR sys-
tem that manages its business for decades. The company acquired a new business
but does not want to bring data for the subsidiary into SAP. We will discuss how
the customer addressed this situation by adopting the Side-By-Side HCM distrib-
uted deployment model. Let’s start with a look at the company and the business
problems it faces.
Client Scenario
Gloplex International, a software services industry with over 30,000 employees,
provides business transformation and software consulting services to large busi-
nesses. Gloplex International acquired Cyberdin Software to expand its services
in Asia.
Currently, Gloplex uses SAP ERP to run its company and SAP Payroll for process-
ing payroll for its global employee population. It also uses an HCM solution but
has heavily customized it. Recently, the company implemented SuccessFactors
Talent Management suite for its global employee population in a record time of
six months.
As the industry changes, so do the processes at Gloplex. To keep up with these
growing changes, the company decided to move to the cloud and benefit from
the advantages. However, the company is hesitant to make this transformation,
fearing it could disrupt business. Cyberdin Software, on the other hand, built its

Case Studies
5.8
181
own HR system and outsourced payroll processing. Cyberdin conducts perfor-
mance reviews and learning delivery using homegrown software.
Immediately after the acquisition, Gloplex and Cyberdin formed teams compris-
ing of people from both organizations. This resulted in some employees from
Gloplex reporting to middle managers in Cyberdin, who reported to executives in
Gloplex. However, without a single employee database containing all users, there
were challenges in managing employees effectively across both organizations.
To remedy these shortcomings, the company has chosen to move its entire HCM
solution to the cloud, but it wants to move at its own pace. It plans to adopt
Employee Central as Cyberdin’s core HR system and implement packaged integra-
tions for the Side-By-Side HCM distributed model with Gloplex’s SAP ERP HCM,
thereby enabling employee transactions for both companies using the same
Employee Central instance.
Process Steps
Having chosen the Side-By-Side HCM distributed deployment model, the company
is retiring Cyberdin’s homegrown HR solution and implementing its HCM solution
in the cloud, including all talent management solutions from SuccessFactors, such
as Performance Management and Goal Management, Succession Planning, Learn-
ing Compensation, SAP Jam, and SuccessFactors Workforce Analytics. For em-
ployee administration, the company adopted Employee Central and SAP Payroll.
Because Gloplex had the SuccessFactors Talent Management suite implemented
before, all employees of Cyberdin are added to the same SuccessFactors Talent
Management suite instance and are provided instant access. The company then
embarked on implementing Employee Central for Cyberdin employees and set
up Side-By-Side HCM integrations with SAP on-premise.
The following are the individual steps taken to successfully implement these
choices:
1. Employee Central was configured using a global template design that would
work not just for Cyberdin employees but also for Gloplex employees, because
the goal for Gloplex is to use Employee Central for all its employees in the
future.
2. While defining the global template, it was ensured that all fields required for
employee replication from Employee Central to SAP ERP were defined. These

Side-By-Side HCM Deployment Model
5
182
fields can be found in the Employee Master Data Replication implementation
guide available at http://help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
3. All Cyberdin employee data was migrated from Cyberdin’s legacy system to
Employee Central. The company used SuccessFactors migration tools to load
this data into Employee Central.
4. The company then enabled employee replication from Employee Central to
SAP ERP, following the steps from the Employee Master Data Replication
implementation guide. This will allow the company to run SAP Payroll for
Cyberdin employees in Gloplex’s SAP ERP. This integration needs not be
implemented if employees mastered in Employee Central do not use any on-
premise applications.
5. The HRIS sync job is turned on for Cyberdin employees from Employee Central
to SuccessFactors Talent Management suite, enabling data synchronization
between core employee data and talent modules.
6. Next, the company set up and enabled replication of employee master data
from SAP ERP to Employee Central for Gloplex employees. The process is doc-
umented in Employee Central and SAP ERP in the Side-By-Side HCM Deploy-
ment Model implementation guide available at http://help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
7. Finally, the integration of Employee Central UI with on-premise SAP ERP
enabled managers and employees to use the SuccessFactors home page as a
global UI hub was implemented. They can view data or trigger data changes for
employees whose data is mastered in SAP ERP HCM using the navigation on
the Employee Central UI. This is possible because all employees whose data is
mastered in SAP ERP HCM are replicated to Employee Central using the
employee data integration of the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model.
5.9
Summary
The Side-By-Side HCM deployment model is for customers who want to segment
employee population and run people management applications in the cloud as
well as on-premise. In this deployment model, customers run Employee Central,
SuccessFactors Talent Solutions, and SuccessFactors Workforce Planning and Ana-
lytics in the cloud for a subset of employees and core HR with SuccessFactors Tal-
ent Management solutions for the remaining employees. SAP and SuccessFactors

provide packaged integrations to enable easier and better integration between SAP
ERP and the SuccessFactors HCM suite.
In this chapter, we also discussed how customers who need data and process inte-
gration across geographies on different core HR systems are good candidates to
adopt the Side-By-Side HCM deployment model. There are multiple packaged
integrations to connect Employee Central with SAP ERP, customized to address
these different customer needs. In addition, we explored how HR business pro-
cesses for events like hire, rehire, transfer, and terminate can be executed with
same efficiency and ease of use as in a single system. 
In the next chapter, we will take a look at SuccessFactors integration layers and
open APIs that can be leveraged to integrate Employee Central and SuccessFactors
Talent Management solutions with external systems for both data and process
integrations.


 
PART III
SuccessFactors Integration Models


187
 
This chapter introduces SuccessFactors’ integration layers and APIs. After 
reviewing this chapter, you will better understand SuccessFactors’ logical 
integration architecture as well as the capabilities of its various APIs to 
integrate with SuccessFactors modules.
6
Integration Layers and APIs
In today’s business world, companies use numerous applications that are not
always from the same software provider. These applications are expected to inter-
act with one another to increase productivity, reduce duplicate data entries, and
provide an integrated experience to end users. The architecture of SuccessFactors
products, from the early stages of their development, provide multiple mecha-
nisms for integrating with third-party systems, both for data and process integra-
tions (including real-time integrations).
Today, SuccessFactors products can be integrated with other systems to not only
exchange data and implement a business process spanning across multiple sys-
tems but also extend and build new functionality that provides a seamless user
interface (UI) and real-time data exchange with other systems.
In this chapter, we will discuss SuccessFactors’ integration logical architecture,
breaking down its various parts and looking at what roles are played in the inte-
gration process. Then, we will focus in on the importance of APIs in the various
integration scenarios that occur.
6.1
SuccessFactors Integration Logical Layers
SuccessFactors products have been extended to work across multiple systems,
providing a seamless UI and real-time data exchange. SuccessFactors owes this
functionality to its innovative integration architecture and models.
Figure 6.1 illustrates the logical architecture to integrate with SuccessFactor
products.

Integration Layers and APIs
6
188
Figure 6.1  SuccessFactors Integration Logical Architecture
When integrating with SuccessFactors, the following four logic layers need to be
considered:
 SuccessFactors data model (see Section 6.1.1)
 Data interfaces (see Section 6.1.2)
 SuccessFactors integration and extension platforms (see Section 6.1.3)
 Customer applications (both on-premise and in cloud systems, including SAP
products; see Section 6.1.4)
Let’s look at each of these layers now.
6.1.1
SuccessFactors Data Model
The SuccessFactors data model is flexible and configures to a customer’s need. For
example, in Employee Central you can define how the company’s organization
structure should look and what attributes need to be associated with the company,
person, and employment data. All of this is done through configurations to the
data model, allowing customers to define their own unique data models that fits
specific and distinctive requirements. These configurations are upgrade compatible
with each SuccessFactors release, providing seamless integration.

SuccessFactors Integration Logical Layers
6.1
189
The following are the core data models in Employee Central:
 Corporate data model 
This model contains the data structures related to the company’s organization,
pay, and job structure.
 Succession data model 
This model contains the data structures related to the data of the people work-
ing in the company, like compensation and address.
 Corporate data model (country specific) 
This model contains country-specific corporate data, like location address
information for each country in which the company has a presence.
 Succession data model (country specific) 
This model contains the international formats and fields, like national IDs and
addresses.
These data models offer different purposes and customizations based on the
needs of the customer.
6.1.2
Data Interfaces
SuccessFactors’ core framework provides import and export jobs with specific
predefined formats that can be used to extract data from or add data to different
entities. These jobs are available through administration sections of the applica-
tion for ad hoc runs and can be accessed if the user has specific permissions. They
are also available to be scheduled as background jobs.
Ad hoc reports can also be configured with the fields that are needed and sched-
uled to export data to SFTP. There are options to encrypt data for data exchanges
with SuccessFactors modules.
Web Service APIs
A web service API is the de facto standard for real-time integrations and is one of the
most popular ways of interacting with SuccessFactors. Section 6.2 is dedicated to dis-
cussing the different types of APIs available in SuccessFactors.
6.1.3
SuccessFactors Integration Platform
The SuccessFactors integration platform can be used for data integrations with
other systems to include transformations or customer-specific requirements.

Integration Layers and APIs
6
190
SuccessFactors’ products officially support SAP HANA Cloud Integration, SAP
Process Integration (PI), and Dell Boomi AtomSphere platforms for data integra-
tions. For building extensions to SuccessFactors products, SAP HANA Cloud Plat-
form is the only option and requires the use of Java programming language for
development.
Third-Party Applications and APIs
At the end of the day, SuccessFactors APIs are web services and can be invoked directly
from third-party applications without the need for any middleware. Middleware, on the
other hand, helps with transformation, business rules, notifications, and so on.
6.1.4
Customer Applications
Typically, SuccessFactors modules are integrated with a variety of applications,
which can be on-premise applications such as SAP ERP and Microsoft Active
Directory or third-party cloud applications such as benefits, time and attendance,
payroll, and background screening vendors. Each of these types of applications can
require a different integration pattern based on best practices. Typically, payroll
integrations are complex, but a majority of the other integrations involve demo-
graphic data being passed from Employee Central to other third-party applications.
Now that we’ve looked at the architecture and integration layers of SuccessFac-
tors, let’s turn our attention to the web service APIs available.
6.2
SuccessFactors APIs
SuccessFactors has both SOAP-based and REST-based web services. There are
three types of web services available today with SuccessFactors:
 OData API 
This is the REST-based API and the ideal way to interface with SuccessFactors—
especially Employee Central.
 SFAPI 
This SOAP-based API is being used widely today to integrate SuccessFactors
modules other than Employee Central.
 Compound Employee API 
The CE API returns multiple SuccessFactors objects in a hierarchically structured

SuccessFactors APIs
6.2
191
response XML file with the employee as the root node, and is a neat way to
extract employee superset data.
The following sections look at these different APIs in further detail so that you
can determine which API suits a specific scenario that you may encounter.
6.2.1
OData API
Open Data Protocol (OData) is a protocol for creating (POST), reading (GET),
updating (PUT), and deleting (DELETE) data based on HTTP. In other words,
OData offers CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations over HTTP.
OData is the web-equivalent of ODBC (Open Database Connectivity). It provides
a uniform way to expose full-featured data APIs. It is an open protocol originally
suggested by Microsoft and is now widely supported (MS, SAP, IBM, etc.).
Many SAP products use OData as the default protocol for integrations with other
systems.
Additional Information
For more details on OData, refer to www.odata.org.
The following sections discuss some of the critical components of SuccessFactors
OData implementations and corresponding formats and examples to get you
started.
OData Provisioning
OData is enabled by the support representatives on your instance. You should
reach out to them in the standard way you interact with SuccessFactors support.
The endpoint URLs for accessing OData APIs depend on which data center the
instance is hosted on. Your SuccessFactors support representative will provide
that data.
OData Authentication
OData APIs provide two types of authentication: HTTP-Basic authentication and
OAuth authentication. In HTTP-Basic authentication, the client provides creden-
tials, which are carried as plain text in the authorization header. OAuth is the
authorization concept for OData services that offers constrained access without

Integration Layers and APIs
6
192
passing or storing credentials. We recommend OAuth authentication, because it
is the more secure method.
HTTP-Basic Authentication
In HTTP-Basic authentication, the credentials are constructed in a certain way and
are base encoded and passed in the authorization header.
The following format should be used to specify your credentials:
username@companyId:password
For example, if you have a company called ACEHR and the username/password is
cgrant/pwd, then the string format is as follows:
cgrant@ACEHR:pwd
This string must be Base64 encoded. For example, the previous string encoded
with Base64 should appear as follows:
Y2dyYW50QEFDRUhSOnB3ZA==
Next, you’ll add this string into your HTTP header in the following format:
Authorization: Basic Y2dyYW50QEFDRUhSOnB3ZA==
OAuth 2.0 Authentication
OAuth 2.0 is an open authorization protocol that lets different applications share
information with each other in a secure fashion. To enable OAuth 2.0, you have
to go through the steps of granting permissions for the Role-Based Permissions
(RBP) or user-based system and registering your OAuth client application.
Additional Information
For more information on the exact steps required, refer to the SAP HCM Suite OData API
User Guide at http://help.sap.com/saphelpiis_cloud4hr/en/successfactors_hcm_suite_
odata_api_handbook_en.pdf.
OData Metadata Document
The metadata document is a data structure that describes the capabilities of the
API to your SuccessFactors instance. OData has a standard for the basic informa-
tion that should be represented in the metadata document. It contains details of

SuccessFactors APIs
6.2
193
each of the entities that are accessible through the API, including the fields,
names, labels, data types, and the relationships (associations) between the enti-
ties. The metadata document also lists the operations available in the API. Suc-
cessFactors matches this standard and also adds additional information through
an annotations-based approach.
The additional information, for example, includes localized labels for fields and
behaviors to describe if the field is required when inserting or if the field is filter-
able.
The OData API metadata document can be accessed via https://<hostname>/odata/
v2/$metadata. Make sure the credential is correctly set in the HTTP header and
that you can access the OData metadata document via the preceding URL. This
will return an XML serialization of the service, including the entity data model
and the service operations descriptions. The metadata response supports only
application or atom plus XML type. (You cannot get the metadata response in
JSON, for example.)
The metadata document also describes the operations available in the API. The
OData protocol specifies four basic database-style operations: insert, update,
query, and delete. SuccessFactors also adds a fifth operation called upsert, which
performs an insert or update operation.
The same metadata information is also available in the OData API Data Dictionary,
which can be accessed within the SuccessFactors platform as long as the user has
RBPs enabled for it. Figure 6.2 shows a snippet of the API Data Dictionary.
Figure 6.2  OData API Data Dictionary

Integration Layers and APIs
6
194
In the future, SuccessFactors may add other custom operations. Typically, custom
operations will perform specific business transactions, especially if a custom API
is easier to manage versus a database-style approach against multiple entities.
Regardless of which operations are used (create, read, update, delete, upsert, or
even future custom operations), SuccessFactors will apply the appropriate busi-
ness logic for each entity.
In other words, even though the operations appear to be database-centric, the API
goes through the application business logic layer. The API does not go directly
against the database, nor does it bypass the business logic layer. The entities in
the API represent logical application objects that should be familiar to an applica-
tion user. The entities do not represent the actual physical data storage imple-
mentation, which may be in a completely different structure. There should be no
assumption of the underlying implementation details.
Speed Up Responses with a gzip Header
The metadata document can be quite large. You can reduce the response time of
this operation by using gzip to compress the document in transit through HTTP,
thereby saving bandwidth. To enable gzip, the client should issue the HTTP
request with the header Accept-Encoding:GZIP. If the OData server gets this
header, it will assume that the client expects a compressed stream, and responses
will be a gzipped output stream to the client.
Client Application Code
It may sound obvious, but make sure your client application code supports gzip if you
use this header.
OData Query Operations
The OData URI identifies resources defined in the data model that can be edited or
published by simple HTTP messages using OData. The OData specification defines
a set of recommended rules for constructing URIs to identify the data and metadata
exposed by an OData server. Figure 6.3 displays the structure of the OData URI.
Figure 6.3  OData Query Format

SuccessFactors APIs
6.2
195
This URI is used by different clients to interact with SuccessFactors data. It can be
as simple as using a browser to display the results of the URI or can be as complex
as using middleware to dynamically read the metadata and then act accordingly.
The following are important components of the OData URI:
 Collection or EntitySet 
This is the name of a collection or a custom service operation (which returns a
collection of entries) exposed by the service.
 KeyPredicate 
This is a predicate that identifies the value(s) of the key properties of an entry.
If the entry has a single key property, then the predicate may include only the
value of the key property. If the key is made up of two or more properties, then
its value must be stated using name/value pairs. More precisely, the syntax for
a KeyPredicate is shown in Figure 6.4.
Figure 6.4  KeyPredicate Syntax
 NavPropSingle 
This is the name of a navigation property defined by the entry associated with
the prior path segment. The navigation property must identify a single entity
(that is, have a "to 1" relationship).
 NavPropCollection
 This is the same as NavPropSingle, except it must identify a collection of entries
(that is, have a "too many" relationship).
 ComplexType 
This is the name of a declared or dynamic property of the entry or complex
type associated with the prior path segment.
 Property 
This is the name of a declared or dynamic property of the entry or complex
type associated with the prior path segment.
Let’s now look at some examples based on the addressing rules stated previously:
 https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User
 Identifies all user collections

 Is described by the entity set named User in the service metadata document
 https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User('1')
 Identifies a single user entry with key value 1
 Is described by the entity type named User in the service metadata document
 https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User('1')/username
 Identifies the name property of the user entry with key value 1
 Is described by the property named Name on the User entity type in the ser-
vice metadata document
 https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User('1')/proxy
 Identifies the collection of proxies associated with user entry with key value 1
 Is described by the navigation property named proxy on the User entity type
in the service metadata document
 https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User('1')/proxy/$count
 Identifies the number of proxy entries associated with User 1
 Is described by the navigation property named proxy on the User entity type
in the service metadata document
 https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User(‘1’)/proxy(‘1’)/hr/username
 Identifies the username of the hr for proxy 1, which is associated with User 1
 Is described by the property named username on the hr entity type in the ser-
vice metadata document
System Query Options
In some cases, you may want to refine the results of your query, which is where
the system query options come in. These are very powerful mechanisms to help
you get the data the way you want it. Table 6.1 lists the system query options sup-
ported.
Query Option Brief Description
Orderby
Orders the result set with the values given in the clause. Ascending 
order by default.
Top
Picks the top N entries.
Skip
Skips the first N entries, and returns the remaining.
Table 6.1  OData Query Parameters

SuccessFactors APIs
6.2
197
For example, the following query is used to retrieve the user name and associated
manager for the selected user. As in Table 6.1, you can see that the format is
JSON, and the expand option helps retrieve the user’s manager:
https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User?$format=json&$expand=manager&select=
userId,manager/userId
The query results are shown in Listing 6.1.
{
__metadata: {
uri: " https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User('01171917-1') "
type: "SFOData.User"
}
userId: "01171917-1"
manager: {
__metadata: {
uri: " https://<hostname>/odata/v2/User('01170004')"
type: "SFOData.User"
}
userId: "01170004"
}
}

Troubleshooting OData Operations
Outside of logs that are available from the target system, troubleshooting OData
operations with SuccessFactors modules can be accomplished in multiple ways.
The following describes a few of these methods:
 OData API audit logs 
The OData audit logs can be accessed by users who have the corresponding per-
missions granted through RBPs. The ellipsis (...) buttons under the HTTP column
Filter
Returns the subset of entries that satisfy the predicate expression.
Expand
Entries associated with the entry or collection of entries; must be 
represented inline.
Format
The media type that the response should conform to.
Select
Returns a subset of the properties.

provide the state of the HTTP headers for request and response. The buttons in
the REST column provide the REST request and response data (see Figure 6.5).
Figure 6.5  OData Audit Logs in Admin Tools
 OData API debug logs 
The debug logs for OData are accessible from Provisioning and will provide
application-level logging information.
 REST client 
By using REST client plug-ins with your Internet browser, you can invoke APIs
for different scenarios and adjust your operation parameters accordingly (see
Figure 6.6).
Figure 6.6  OData Query Modeling Using a REST Client
Now that we have discussed OData APIs, let’s look at another important type of API.

SuccessFactors APIs
6.2
199
6.2.2
SFAPI
SFAPI provides SOAP-based web services designed for importing and exporting
data in and out of a SuccessFactors instance. It provides metadata operations for
the entities in addition to generic CRUD operations.
In the case of Employee Central, SFAPI should only be used if there are no corre-
sponding OData APIs available. In general, SuccessFactors is moving towards
OData API but has committed to be backward compatible to SFAPI for quite some
time.
Important!
Please note that SFAPI is the only and main option in some modules (such as Success-
Factors Recruiting) as of the time of writing (spring 2015).
SFObjects are the entities exposed by SFAPI. These objects are analogous to data-
base tables, but in reality they are not directly related to tables underneath. Meta-
data operations are used to do things such as list SFObjects and fields within an
entity. The CRUD operations enable you to access and manipulate the data within
the objects.
SOAP provides the definition of the XML-based information, which can be used
for exchanging structured and typed information between peers in a decentral-
ized, distributed environment.
Additional Information
For more details on SOAP, refer to www.w3.org.
The following sections discuss some of the critical components of SuccessFactors
SOAP (SFAPI) and corresponding formats and examples to get you started.
Provisioning SFAPI
Each user of the API must have an API login permission. An administrator of your
SuccessFactors system can grant this permission. Provisioning SFAPI depends on
the type of permission model implemented for your SuccessFactors instance.
There are two types of permission models: user-based permissions and RBP. The
permission setting in the UI is under Manage Users  API Login Permission.

Integration Layers and APIs

The following are instructions for each permission system:
 User-based permission settings 
This API login permission is granted via Admin Tools  Manage Users  Man-
age API Login Permission.
 RBP settings 
This API login permission is granted via Admin Tools  Manage Permission
Roles  Create New (see Figure 6.7).
Figure 6.7  Role and Permission Settings
After creating an SFAPI role, assign API permissions to the newly created role,
and assign the role to a group of users (see Figure 6.8).

Authentication is established by the login operation by passing the proper cre-
dentials in the SFCredential object. This will return a session ID, which needs to
be passed back for all subsequent HTTP requests invoking the API.
A successful login will return a session ID as an HTTP cookie. This cookie must be
passed back to all subsequent HTTP requests that invoke API operations in order
to authenticate.
The sessions will timeout after 10 minutes of inactivity. You can also manually
invalidate a session by using the logout method.
SFAPI Operations
The SFAPI operations help get data out of SuccessFactors and put data into Suc-
cessFactors. SFAPI is dynamic in the sense that you have to use the metadata
operations to discover the schema and its data instead of using a static WSDL.
The five categories of SFAPI methods are as follows:
 Session Management (login/logout/isValidSession)
 Metadata Inspection (list/describe)
 Data Manipulation (insert/update/upsert/delete)
 Data Query (query/queryMore)
 Asynchronous Job (submitJob/getJobStatus/getJobResult/listJobs/cancelJob)
Let’s look at the format of these categories more closely.
Session Management
Session Management contains the following operations:
 LoginResult login(SFCredential credential, List<SFParameters> params) 
This operation involves the following variables:
 Includes boolean logout()
 Destroys the current API session
 Includes boolean isValidSession()
 Returns true if the current API session is still valid
 Includes String [] list()

In the example shown in Listing 6.7, DeleteResult delete(String type,
SFObject[] objects, SFParameter[] processingParam) deletes the SFObjects
specified by the type and the objects. The operation will resume if one row has
failed to delete.
Data Query
The following are operations for Data Query:
 QueryResult query(String queryString, SFParameter[] param) 
This queries the SuccessFactors platform with the given query string in SFQL
(SuccessFactors Query Language). For a detailed grammar description, check the
SFAPI reference guide. An example of this operation is shown in Listing 6.8.

Listing 6.9  QueryResult query(String queryString, SFParameter[] param)Response
 QueryResult queryMore(String querySessionId) 
The queryMore call is provided to support paging. It requires a querySessionId
to identify the next page of results. The querySessionId is a parameter of the
QueryResult object, obtained from a previous call to either the query or que-
ryMore operation. An example of this operation is shown in Listing 6.10.
<S:Envelope>

Asynchronous Job
The following operations are available for Asynchronous Job:

Integration Layers and APIs
6
206
 TaskStatus submitQueryJob(String queryString, SFParameter[] param) 
This submits the asynchronous query job to the SuccessFactors platform with
the given query string in SFQL (SuccessFactors Query Language). TaskStatus
includes taskId, which is used to identify a submitted job.
 TaskStatus getJobStatus(String taskId) 
This gets the execution status of the submitted asynchronous job.
 DataHandler getJobResult(GetJobResult parameters) 
This downloads the result of the submitted asynchronous query job.
 TaskStatus[] listJobs() 
This list all jobs that are running or waiting to run.
 TaskStatus cancelJob(String taskId) 
This downloads the result of the submitted asynchronous query job.
Thresholds and Limitations of SFAPI
There are a few thresholds and limitations to keep in mind when utilizing SFAPI,
including the following:
 The batchSize parameter controls the number of rows that will be processed in
a single insert/update/upsert/delete method. This number can be set to any-
thing from 1 to 800, and the default value is 200.
 The maxRows parameter controls the number of rows returned by a single
Query/QueryMore method. It can be set to any value between 1 and 800, and the
default value is 200.
 A SOAP message cannot exceed 5MB, which is the limit when uploading binary
attachments using SFAPI. The attachment storage configuration controls the
total size of the storage for all attachments.
Troubleshooting SFAPI Operations
There are multiple ways to troubleshoot SFAPI operations. A few are described as
follows:
 API Audit log 
This captures the last 10,000 API call payload details, allowing you to inspect
the payload details for issues.

SuccessFactors APIs
6.2
207
 API Data Dictionary 
This gives access to all the SuccessFactors data entities and the corresponding
field metadata in a readable format.
 SOAP UI 
The SOAP UI tool can model SFAPI operations.
Now that we have gone through SFAPI in detail, let’s talk about a specialized API
created to take care of a common scenario.
6.2.3
Compound Employee API
The Compound Employee API for Employee Central is used to extract employee
data out of Employee Central. One of the main focuses of this API is to query and
replicate employee master data from Employee Central to SAP and the payroll
and benefits systems. This API is based on SOAP protocol and uses the same login
and logout operations discussed in Section 6.2.2.
Figure 6.9 displays the Compound Employee API XML schema.
Figure 6.9  Compound Employee XML Schema
Some key features of this API are as follows:
 Returning all requested data of an employee in a single call provides a hierar-
chically structured response.

Integration Layers and APIs
6
208
 Provides full employee historical information.
 Provides employee snapshot information for a given date.
 Provides employee changes only since a given date. This is the delta mode
Compound Employee API.
 Results with changed segments indicate field-level changes.
 Results with changed segments indicate field-level changes along with other
unchanged fields.
 Provides global assignment data.
Examples that demonstrate key features of the Compound Employee API are dis-
cussed ahead.
Full Historical Employee Details Query
The Full Historical Employee Details query extracts the complete historical data
for all employees. This is used in integrations in which there is a need to send all
employee data to another system. A good example is the Employee Central to SAP
ERP packaged integration, in which this scenario is run (when you do not use fil-
ters; see Listing 6.11).

The Changed Employee with Changed Segments Only query results in only the
changed fields in the changed segments, commonly called a delta operation. This
scenario creates efficiency in third-party systems, because there are no redundant
history records for the employee when nothing actually changed. This also takes
away the need to perform a delta operation in the target system (see Listing 6.14).

Summary
This chapter provided an overview of the integration architecture for Success-
Factors and described the APIs based on SOAP (XML) protocol and OData,
which is a REST-based framework. It also discussed how SOAP or OData APIs
can be utilized, depending upon a client’s needs and the middleware used in
their landscape. SuccessFactors OData API enables the creation and consump-
tion of REST APIs. Entities created using MDF in SuccessFactors architecture are
automatically exposed as OData API objects. In the final section, we discussed
the Compound Employee API, the most commonly used API for the master data
replication of employee to third-party systems for integration between SAP on-
premise systems.
In the next chapter, we will discuss another integration model, the standard inte-
gration templates. These come ready, out-of-the-box, and help accelerate the devel-
opment of new custom integrations to various third-party systems with no existing
packaged integrations.

213
 
In addition to building packaged integrations that connect Employee Cen-
tral to specific cloud software providers, SAP product teams have also cre-
ated standard templates based on commonly used patterns of integration.
7
Standard Integration Templates
A standard integration template is a process that can be adopted and extended by
integration consultants to build integrations with different vendors as per their
requirements. These template processes contain multiple standalone modules
that are not connected with each other (i.e., each functionality is standalone and
can be used independently). They provide all relevant data in HRXML or generic
flat file formats. They are also completely configurable and are available on mul-
tiple supported middleware platforms but are not executable as is.
Additional Information
Up-to-date information on these templates is available at http://help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
Some key advantages of using standard integration templates include the following:
 Reduced development costs 
Because templates have built-in extraction and transformation logic embedded
in them, development of integrations typically adopts, extends, or modifies
existing components to suit the integration requirements. This would reduce
development time and hence the cost of building the integration.
 Common design patterns 
Adopting templates will enforce common design patters across multiple inte-
grations and across the entire customer base. This helps ease integration devel-
opment and sustainability, because more developers are available in a market
that is aware of the patterns and standards.
 Template maintenance 
Templates are maintained by SAP product management and engineering teams,
and new enhancements and defect fixes are introduced as part of the regular
release cycles.

Standard Integration Templates
7
214
Adopting Enhancements
Even though new enhancements or bug fixes are incorporated into the templates with
each release, integrations built with previous versions of the template do not automat-
ically get these enhancements, because they represent copies of the template. Changes
have to be analyzed and adopted into existing integrations.
In this chapter, we will discuss the basic design of standard integration templates
and the various standard integration templates that are provided by SAP and Suc-
cessFactors to build integrations with third-party services. The standard integra-
tion templates discussed in this chapter are available on the Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere middleware platform and will be available on SAP HCI in late 2015.
7.1
Design and Types
All templates that integrate with Employee Central share data with an external
system and follow similar design patterns. The key differences among these tem-
plates are their mapping steps and file formats. The basic pattern is represented in
Figure 7.1.
Figure 7.1  Standard Integration Templates Subcomponents
Looking at Figure 7.1, you can see the extract, transform, and distribute mapping
steps. The following list provides further description of their functions:
Extract
Transform
Distribute
Employee
Central
Template
Administrators

Time Management
7.2
215
 Extract 
Each template provides multiple modules to extract data based on when the
event is effective. The modules extract current, past, and future records, and
employ the Compound Employee API (see Chapter 6, Section 6.2.3) to get the
data, which outputs hierarchical XML. In addition, all the preceding modules
support filter criteria based on pay group, employee class, employee type, loca-
tion, company, country, business unit, and employee ID. There is also a module
provided to generate denormalized XML from the hierarchical XML output. The
templates also include code to merge data between multiple foundation objects
and employee entities if they cannot be extracted as part of a single query.
 Transform 
The transform step involves mapping between Employee Central entities and tar-
get formats. It also includes logic to handle global assignment and denormalized
records, to format fields based on data type or business condition, to transform
data to target system codes, and to exclude terminations based on pay periods and
country-specific address fields mapped to common address attributes so data from
different Employee Central HRIS fields appear in the same target address fields.
 Distribute 
The distribute step includes generation of XML and/or flat files, encrypting and
writing data to target SFTP servers, sending notifications on exceptions, and
steps for debugging data or sending it via email where needed.
There are currently three different standard integration templates:
 Time management
 Benefits management
 Payroll management
Even though they are named based on their most likely use, you are free to use
them for any integration to cut down on the development effort. In the following
sections, we will discuss the standard templates for these three areas.
7.2
Time Management
Although SAP has partnered with Kronos and WorkForce Software for time and
attendance management, customers use multiple time and attendance manage-
ment providers in the cloud. To facilitate the integration of Employee Central

Standard Integration Templates

216
with such time management providers, SAP provides a standard integration tem-
plate. This standard template captures time management integration best prac-
tices. Using the standard template will reduce costs and implementation time for
customers.
The standard template enables the replication of employee data with third-party
time management providers. The template is designed to fetch all the employee
data during the first replication and the changed data (delta data) in subsequent
replications (see Figure 7.2).
Figure 7.2  Standard Template for Employee Central Integration with Time Management Providers
Prerequisites
One prerequisite to keep in mind is that Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration middle-
ware, which is licensed along with Employee Central, is required.
The following sections look at how to use the template to your advantage, the
known assumptions and design boundaries to keep in mind during implementa-
tion, and the various data entries involved in the template.
7.2.1
Using the Time Management Integration Template
This template is provided as part of the process library in the Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere integration middleware. Customers need to install the time management
template in their accounts as a process and build on or customize it to suit the
needs of the specific time and attendance provider they use. The implementation

Dell Boomi AtomSphere Process Library
A process library is a collection of integration processes published in Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere for the purpose of sharing best practices. Customers install copies of processes in
their accounts and use the installed processes as templates for processes tailored to
their needs.
7.2.2
Known Assumptions and Design Boundaries
Separate mapping is required for fields that are country dependent (for example,
ethnicity). Accommodating mapping for each country-specific field in the stan-
dard template is not feasible. Hence, some manual effort is required to adapt this
process to a specific country. As a standard, this process has been adapted to work
for the United States.
7.2.3
Time Management Entities
The time management template provides the same basic data as the benefits tem-
plate but also includes concurrent employment information. It includes the fol-
lowing entities:
 Person information
 Home address
 Home and cell phone
 Work phone and business cell phone
 Work and personal email
 Manager and time approver information
 Employment information
 Job information
 Compensation information
 Recurring pay components (up to 15)
 Nonrecurring pay components (up to 15)
 Pay group information

Benefits Management
Although SAP has chosen Aon Hewitt and Benefitfocus as partners for benefits
management, customers use multiple benefits management providers in the
cloud. To facilitate the integration of Employee Central with such providers, SAP
provides a standard integration template for benefits management. This standard
template captures the benefits management integration best practices, reducing
cost and implementation time for customers.
This standard template enables the replication of employee data with third-party
benefits management providers. It is designed to fetch all the employee data
during the first replication and the changed data (delta data) in subsequent repli-
cations. The process flow supported by this standard template is depicted in Fig-
ure 7.3.

The following sections look at how to use the template to your advantage, the
known assumptions and design boundaries to keep in mind during implementa-
tion, and the various data entries involved in the template.
7.3.1
Using the Benefits Management Integration Template
Standard benefits integration is a template process with a collection of stand-
alone generic functionalities to replicate employee data and eligibility data from
Employee Central to any third-party benefits management provider. Consultants
can use it to build Employee Central integrations with any third-party benefits
provider. This process is to be treated as a template with a collection of generic
modules to build a provider-specific integration process. The implementation
steps are outlined in the Standard Benefits Integration Template for Employee Cen-
tral integration guide. This document is available at help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
7.3.2
Known Assumptions and Design Boundaries
This is not an out-of-box solution to integrate with any benefits provider. The
process library is a collection of modules (standalone design patterns) that can be
used to integrate Employee Central with benefits providers, with some modifica-
tions and manual mapping to achieve the provider-specific integration use case.
The modules must be chosen based on the provider’s requirements and built on
with some custom development and provider-specific logic before it can be exe-
cuted.
7.3.3
Benefits Entities
The benefits template includes basic demographic data for each employee, includ-
ing global assignment information. It includes the following entities:
 Person information
 Personal information, including country-specific information
 Home address
 Home and cell phone
 Personal email
 Dependents’ information

Standard Integration Templates

220
 Employment information
 Job information
 Annual and benefit salary
 Pay group information
 National ID information
7.4
Payroll Management
Although SAP has chosen ADP and NGA as partners for payroll, customers can
use multiple payroll providers. To facilitate the integration of Employee Central
with such providers, SAP provides a standard integration template for payroll.
This standard template enables the replication of employee data with third-party
payroll providers and is designed to fetch all the employee data during the first
replication and the changed data (delta data) in subsequent replications.
This process is to be treated as a template with a collection of generic modules to
build a provider-specific integration process (see Figure 7.4).
Figure 7.4  Standard Template for Employee Central to Payroll Integration

The following sections look at how to use the template to your advantage, the
known assumptions and design boundaries to keep in mind during implementa-
tion, and the various data entries involved in the template.
7.4.1
Using the Payroll Integration Template
Standard payroll integration is a template process with a collection of standalone
generic functionalities to replicate employee data and eligibility data from
Employee Central to any third-party payroll provider. Consultants can use it to
build Employee Central integrations with any third-party payroll provider. The
implementation steps are outlined in the Standard Payroll Integration Template for
Employee Central integration guide, available at help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
7.4.2
Known Assumptions and Design Boundaries
Again, this is not an out-of-box solution to integrate with any payroll provider.
The process library is a collection of modules (standalone design patterns) that
can be used to integrate Employee Central with payroll providers, with some
modifications and manual mapping to achieve the provider-specific integration
use case. The modules must be chosen based on the provider’s requirements and
built on with some custom development and provider-specific logic before it can
be executed.
7.4.3
Payroll Entities
Payroll integrations are typically the most complex and need a lot of data from
Employee Central to be passed to payroll systems. The standard process cannot
be consumed directly.
The payroll template includes the following entities:
 Person information

Now that we’ve gone through the different types of standard integration tem-
plates available, let’s shift our attention to the process of building integrations
with these templates.
7.5
Building Integrations Using Standard Integration 
Templates
To provide a better understanding of how standard templates can be adopted to
implement custom integrations, we will discuss adopting a standard payroll tem-
plate to develop a custom payroll integration. Using similar steps and leveraging
standard templates provided by SAP, you can build custom integrations that real-
ize the benefits outlined at the beginning of the chapter.
7.5.1
Business Processes
Employee Central as the core HR system captures and records all employee lifecy-
cle transactions. Employee master data, including payroll and other related infor-
mation, needs to be transmitted periodically to a third-party payroll provider.
The standard payroll template is a collection of design patterns that can be used to
integrate Employee Central with third-party payroll providers, with modifica-
tions to filter, transform, and map data to achieve the provider-specific integra-
tion use case. The template must be chosen based on the provider’s data require-
ments and then modified to include specific logic based on the customer’s and

vendor’s business needs. There could be scenarios in which a benefits template or
a time and attendance template can be adopted to build employee demographics,
because both of these templates include different types of information and one
might suit better than the other for some customer implementations.
The payroll template is designed to fetch all the employee data during the first
replication and changes in employee data in subsequent replications. The integra-
tion template is not available as an executable program. Customer-specific devel-
opment or configuration will be needed to integrate independent templates into
a comprehensive executable process.
In our scenario, Employee Central has been implemented, and we will be inte-
grating a third-party payroll provider for a US-based employee population.
Employees hired in Employee Central will need to be transferred to the provider
via an interface; similarly, an employee’s location changes or terminations need
to be sent across. In addition to this information, an employee’s personal address,
employment, job info, national ID, dependents, and so on will also have to be
transmitted to the payroll provider. Employee master data needs to be kept in
sync on both systems via this interface.
Prerequisites
Most companies should have an agreement with their payroll provider and include the
payroll provider in the implementation as a partner to provide access to environments,
design the specification if it is not one of their standard ones, build or configure changes,
and support testing the integration end to end. In the situation we have detailed here,
it was decided that the vendor will accept a pipe-delimited file, which is PGP encrypted
and posted to their SFTP server.
In addition, Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration will work as the middleware, licensed
and procured through SuccessFactors.
Employee Central must have all required data elements configured. The following
Employee Central data elements were configured and are to be sent to the payroll sys-
tem as part of this implementation:
 Person information
 Personal information
 Address information
 Phone information
 Email information
 Employment information

Standard Integration Templates

224
 Job information
 Compensation information
 Pay component recurring
 Pay component nonrecurring
 National ID card information
One of the key tasks for the implementation team to keep in mind is enabling Dell
Boomi AtomSphere. The basic steps that are needed for enabling Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere integrations are common for all integrations and are necessary for integrat-
ing Employee Central to external systems. These steps include the following:
 Enabling web services SFAPI
 Creating a SuccessFactors API user
 Creating a SuccessFactors API login exception
It will be assumed that you have already completed these steps and are ready to
download the standard integration template within the company’s Dell Boomi
AtomSphere account (see Chapter 9, Section 9.1.2 for further details).
The remaining tasks for the implementation of integration template include the
following:
 Identifying and mapping fields from the Employee Central specification to the
payroll vendor specification
 Transformation of field values where necessary
 File and field formatting requirements
 Testing file outputs with the provider prior to production cutover
Let’s now look at an overview of the high-level process flow for the payroll inte-
gration template, which includes the execution of these other tasks.
7.5.2
High-Level Payroll Template Process Flow
The replication of employee data from Employee Central to a payroll provider
consists of the following steps:

Building Integrations Using Standard Integration Templates
7.5
225
1. Get the last execution date and time.
2. Extract data from Employee Central portlets.
3. Transform the Employee Central data.
4. Generate a flat file output.
5. Make the output file PGP encrypted.
6. Post the file to the assigned SFTP server location.
The process also incorporates subprocesses for sending email notifications upon
process completion. The following sections go into greater detail about each step.
Get the Last Execution Date and Time
In this step, the Dell Boomi AtomSphere job extracts employee data from
Employee Central as of the last execution date. LOCAL_LAST_EXECUTION_TIMESTAMP
is a dynamic process property that is captured upon each successful run of the
process. This property is persisted throughout the process and is updated when
the property is left blank within the extension properties. This property is readied
by the Compound Employee API to pull changes to employee data after the time
stamp. For the first run of the interface, the property is updated to the date and
time from which changes need to be pulled.
Figure 7.5 is a visual representation of the last execution date logic within the
template.

226
Extract Data from Employee Central Portlets
This is the main process of the implementation and is presented as four options
provided as dynamic query filters for data extraction of employee data from
Employee Central:
 Compound Employee Query Filter—Past+Current+Future Records
 Compound Employee Query Filter—Current Record
 Compound Employee Query Filter—Current+Future Records
 Compound Employee Query Filter—By Pay Calendar
Each of these variants can be used depending upon what kind of data the payroll
vendor is requesting for the company workforce.
If the payroll vendor is requesting past, current, and future records, then the
Compound Employee Query Filter—Past+Current+Future Records template/pro-
cess should be enabled to retrieve data from Employee Central (see Figure 7.6).
Figure 7.6  Process to Extract Past, Current, and Future Employee Records
If a payroll vendor is requesting only current records, then the Compound
Employee Query Filter—Current Record template/process should be enabled to
retrieve data from Employee Central (see Figure 7.7).

Building Integrations Using Standard Integration Templates
7.5
227
Figure 7.7  Process to Extract Current Employee Records
If a payroll vendor is requesting current and future records, then the Compound
Employee Query Filter—Current+Future Records template/process should be
enabled to retrieve data from Employee Central (see Figure 7.8).
Figure 7.8  Process to Extract Current and Future Employee Records
If the payroll vendor is requesting records based on the pay calendar, then the
Compound Employee Query Filter—By Pay Calendar template/process should be
enabled to retrieve data from Employee Central (see Figure 7.9).

Standard Integration Templates

228
Figure 7.9  Process to Extract Employee Records by Pay Period/Calendar
The Compound Employee API extracts data in an XML format based upon the fil-
ter that has been implemented. Extracted data can be split into multiple record
types as needed by payroll vendor. The interface template can extract data in CSV
or XML format.
Transform the Employee Central Data
This step transforms the data extracted in the extraction process into a flat file
output format. Each employee data extracted from Employee Central will be
mapped to a payroll vendor-specific format (see Figure 7.10).
Figure 7.10  Map to Transform Employee Central Data to Target Format

An example of transforming data from Employee Central XML format to a payroll
vendor-specific flat file format is shown in Figure 7.11.
Figure 7.11  Tramsformation of Data from XML to Flat File Format
Generate a Flat File Output
This step maps the extracted and transformed data into a pipe-delimited flat file
format or normalized XML format. Depending on the payroll vendor needs, the
interface can select the appropriate subprocess (see Figure 7.12).

This subprocess encrypts the output file. The PGP keys can be provided either via
an extension parameter or within the subprocess (see Figure 7.13).

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at the different types of standard integration templates
available for building custom integrations with SuccessFactors. These template
types for time management, benefits management, and payroll allow customers
to utilize commonly used patterns of integration to save both time and money.
Using the example of the standard payroll integration template, we walked
through the high-level process of building an integration with one of these tem-
plates.
In the next chapter we will look at integrating talent solutions with third-party
applications.

231
 
In this chapter, we will discuss how to integrate your instance of the 
SuccessFactors Talent Management suite with some of the leading cloud-
based service providers. From there, we will move on to the standard data 
imports available in SuccessFactors that can be used to integrate with 
systems that do not have a packaged integration.

Integrating Talent Solutions with 
Third-Party Applications
SuccessFactors’ market-leading talent modules are integrated not only within the
suite but also with non-SAP systems to share data, execute end-to-end business
processes, and provide an integrated user experience. SuccessFactors Talent Man-
agement applications make use of multiple third-party cloud applications for
assessment verification, background checks, virtual learning, learning assess-
ments, resume, and payroll.
Figure 8.1 illustrates different types of systems that integrate with SuccessFactors
Talent Management suite.

SAP provides packaged integrations to connect SuccessFactors Talent Manage-
ment suite with the following:
 PeopleAnswers and SHL for pre-employment assessments (see Section 8.1.1)
 First Advantage for background check verification (see Section 8.1.2)
 eQuest for posting job requisitions to job boards (see Section 8.1.3)
 LinkedIn for creating candidate profiles (see Section 8.1.4)
 E-Verify for confirming employment eligibility 
(see Section 8.2, E-Verify Integration)
 PayPal Payflow Pro for payment processing (see Section 8.3.1)
 Virtual Learning System (VLS) for e-learning (see Section 8.3.2)
 Questionmark for learning assessments (see Section 8.3.3)
First, in Section 8.1, we detail the packaged integrations from SuccessFactors that
connect SuccessFactors Recruiting with assessment verifications from PeopleAn-
swers and SHL, background checks from First Advantage, candidate profile infor-
mation from LinkedIn, and job posting distribution data from eQuest. Section 8.2
analyzes packaged integrations that connect SuccessFactors Onboarding for
employment verification through USCIS E-Verify. Section 8.3 describes packaged
integrations by SuccessFactors Learning that integrate with virtual learning sys-
tems like Cisco WebEx and Adobe Connect, learning assessments through Ques-
tionmark, and the payment processor PayPal. Finally, in Section 8.4 we provide
an overview of standard connectors available in the SuccessFactors Talent Man-
agement suite that enable data exchange with third-party applications.
8.1
Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Recruiting
In this section, we will look at how SuccessFactors integrations with PeopleAn-
swers, SHL, First Advantage, eQuest, and LinkedIn. PeopleAnswers and SHL
assessment integrations use one of the middleware platforms supported by SAP
and make use of event-based web services to trigger the integration in real-time.
First Advantage, eQuest, and LinkedIn are built into the SuccessFactors Recruiting
product and support real-time integration.
Other Third-Party Products
There are other third-party products that integrate with SuccessFactors Recruiting that
are not covered in this section, such as LexisNexis and the Verifications Inc. background
check. However, these will be depreciated due to acquisitions.

8.1.1
Assessment Vendor Integration
SuccessFactors Recruiting provides integrations to PeopleAnswers and SHL assess-
ment solutions. The integrations for both providers use the same platform with
similar configurations. PeopleAnswers and SHL are pre-employment assessment
solutions that provide employers with a cloud-based solution to accurately match
the right person with the right job. Assessment vendors receive candidate infor-
mation along with the position applied for and assessment packages configured
in the recruiting system to administer corresponding assessments.
Pre-employment assessments are used to screen job applicants and can include
testing of cognitive abilities, knowledge, work skills, physical and motor abilities,
personality, emotional intelligence, language proficiency, and even integrity.
Employers use assessments to find the candidates most likely to succeed in the
open positions and to screen out those who are unqualified, leading to additional
company benefits, such as saving time and money in the selection process.
When a candidate applies for a job and if the requisition has assessments config-
ured to be delivered immediately, the candidate will get the assessments link dis-
played after the job application is submitted. Otherwise, the candidate will be
prompted to take the assessment by email when the application reaches the status
associated with the assessment package. 
The sequence of steps, actors, and systems involved in PeopleAnswers integration
with SuccessFactors Recruiting is illustrated in Figure 8.2.

The SHL integration with SuccessFactors Recruiting is illustrated in Figure 8.3.
Figure 8.3  SuccessFactors Recruiting Integration with SHL 
The integration is implemented with two web services. Both of these services will
be hosted on the customer’s Dell Boomi AtomSphere account:
 Recruiting to PeopleAnswers or SHL— AssessmentOrder process 
This web service listens to requests from the SuccessFactors Recruiting API.
When a request is received by this service, it will transform the data to the
assessment vendor format and create an order by invoking the vendor’s assess-
ment order web service. The web service returns the order ID and unique
assessment URL, which is updated on the job application entity in SuccessFactors.
 PeopleAnswers or SHL to Recruiting— AssessmentOrderStatus process 
This web service is invoked by the assessment vendor and is supplied with the
assessment score and result link. The recommendation and score, along with
the detailed results link pointing to the providers’ server, are updated in the
corresponding standard fields in SuccessFactors.
Implementing Packaged Integrations
When you choose to implement packaged integrations for assessment vendors, the
packaged integration content is directly available to install, configure, and run on the
supported middleware you choose.

The following sections detail the process steps involved in this integration, as
well as key considerations and benefits to keep in mind.
Integration Process Steps
The following steps describe the integration process to be undertaken:
1. Select Enable Assessment Integration (Requires Candidate Workbench),
under Company Settings  Recruiting V2 Application, to access the assess-
ment integration feature.
2. The Manage Assessment Vendors permission needs to be assigned to the
Role-Based Permissions (RBP) user role—typically, an administrator that would
configure assessment vendors in Recruiting.
3. Administrators with permission to manage assessment vendors can then
import assessment vendor configurations. The vendor ID for PeopleAnswers
and SHL are “PA” and “SHL”, respectively.
4. Administrators should then upload assessment vendor packages using the
SuccessFactors Provisioning Import/Export Assessment Vendor Packages
option.
5. Configure assessment fields in a job requisition template with permissions to
view and edit these fields set to be managed similarly to other job requisition
fields. These fields will be shown in the job requisition page in the same order
as they are configured in the template (see Figure 8.4).
Figure 8.4  Setting Up Assessment for a Job Requisition

Integrating Talent Solutions with Third-Party Applications

6.
The SFAPI user needs to be set up in Admin Tools  Recruiting Permissions
with the following options selected for each vendor (see the information on
setting up an SFAPI user in Chapter 6):
 SFAPI Retrieve Assessment Order Permission
 SFAPI Update Assessment Report Permission
7.
When a candidate applies for a job requisition that has assessment set up, an
event is generated within SuccessFactors Recruiting and published to listen-
ing web services. The packaged integration’s AssessmentOrder process
receives the request and will process it as explained previously.
8.
If the assessment is created immediately after the candidate applies, then the
candidate will see a screen with assessment links (see Figure 8.5).
Figure 8.5  Candidate Assessments Screen
9.
Once the candidate clicks on the assessment link, he or she is taken to the cor-
responding vendor’s cloud application for assessment delivery.
10. Upon completion of the assessment, the vendor will send the results by send-
ing data to the AssessmentOrderStatus process discussed previously.
11. The candidate summary page can be set up to display the assessment score,
recommendation, and status of different assessments packages. All scores and
recommendations for assessments will also be available in the assessment
portlet in the applicant profile page (see Figure 8.6).

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Recruiting

237
Figure 8.6  Applicant Profile Page with Assessment Score Results
12. There could be scenarios in which job applications can be processed even
when assessment scores are not available until the application reaches certain
steps in the recruiting workflow. This can be set up by choosing an option
under the Hardstop Status dropdown field to the status value that should
hold the application until the assessment results are available (see Figure 8.7).
Figure 8.7  Setting Hardstop Status
Key Considerations and Benefits
With this integration, there are a number of key considerations and benefits,
including the following:
 All data transmissions occur in real-time immediately after the candidate com-
pletes actions on either system.

Integrating Talent Solutions with Third-Party Applications
8
238
 An email template can be created for assessment in the Admin Tools, and can be
associated with a job requisition. This will enable a candidate to receive an email
with the information configured in the template when assessment is initiated.
 Assessments can be created for candidates in one of two ways: The first is to
have the assessment initiated immediately after the candidate submits the
application. The second option is to create the assessment later in the recruiting
process, usually after some initial application processing steps, and to send an
email to the candidate with assessment links embedded in it.
 In situations where an error occurred while initiating assessment, an acknow-
ledged assessment can be reinitiated from the applicant profile page by clicking
on the Initiate Assessment button.
 This integration ships with configurable settings for endpoint URLs and status
code mappings.
 Using externalized settings and mappings enables customization through con-
figuration.
 This integration can be deployed on multiple environments easily, and main-
tenance is seamless, with little to no custom code.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met to implement this integration:
 Appropriate licensing to use the assessment integration
 Dell Boomi AtomSphere or SAP HANA Cloud Integration middleware, procured
through SAP
 A separate third-party contract with either PeopleAnswers or SHL for pre-employ-
ment assessments solution
8.1.2
First Advantage Integration
Employers may want to validate the claims of an applicant by initiating a back-
ground check. SuccessFactors Recruiting offers integration with the First Advan-
tage Direct Advantage process.
When the recruiter or hiring manager initiates a background check request, the
candidate invitation is initiated from SuccessFactors, and then First Advantage
collects candidate data not prepopulated by SuccessFactors. The standard Direct
Advantage functionality applies once the invitation is sent.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Recruiting
8.1
239
Figure 8.8  First Advantage Background Check: Direct Advantage
The following section describes the steps and interactions in both SuccessFactors
and First Advantage for this integration and is illustrated in Figure 8.8.
Integration Process Steps
The following steps describe the integration process:
1. The candidate applies and progresses through the workflow in SuccessFactors.
During this process, the candidate data are collected for the screening request.
2. The hiring manager or recruiter sends an invitation to the candidate via Suc-
cessFactors.
3. First Advantage sends a request for additional information directly to the can-
didate’s email.
4. The candidate provides consent, populates any missing information, and sub-
mits the application.
5. The customer also has the option of placing an instant order at this point or
allowing a review by the recruiter.
6. Once the order is submitted, the request progresses through the fulfillment
process.
7. First Advantage sends status updates to SuccessFactors as the request pro-
gresses through the screening order fulfillment process.

8. SuccessFactors displays the case level status and results for the request. In addi-
tion, a link in the application allows the user to access the detailed results in
Enterprise Advantage.
The following section lays out the key considerations and benefits of using the
First Advantage Direct Advantage process with SuccessFactors Recruiting.
Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 Requires public records, education, and employment scope to be predefined
and consistent per customer account.
 Requires the package to be defined in SuccessFactors and provided on the request.
 Data collected by First Advantage will not be sent back to update SuccessFac-
tors but will reside in Enterprise Advantage.
 The candidate will be able to modify any of the data sent from SuccessFactors
for the background check.
 Allows data to be reviewed and added by the candidate prior to submission.
 Allows signed consent forms and other forms to be provided directly from the
candidate.
 For international searches, because the required data can vary by country, the
requestor will be able to see any additional required information not provided
by the source system.
 Minimal data can be sent from SuccessFactors, and First Advantage can reach
out for any required missing information directly.
Prerequisites
First Advantage’s Direct Advantage background check product is required.
8.1.3
eQuest Integration
SuccessFactors Recruiting integration with eQuest provides better board-to-board
mapping accuracy and access to eQuest’s continued feature innovations. It
reduces the time to post jobs and enables the ability to easily add additional job
boards, worldwide job board access, and detailed monthly transaction reports
summarizing job posting usage.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Recruiting
8.1

As illustrated in Figure 8.9, after a job requisition is approved in SuccessFactors,
it can be posted in one language per posting. Under the job board posting section,
links are available to send the data to eQuest when the integration is enabled. In
eQuest, the recruiter will have the ability to choose which job boards to post to
and add specific information related to each board posting.
Figure 8.9  SuccessFactors Recruiting with eQuest Integration
The following sections provide a detailed step-by-step sequence of activities as part
of eQuest integration as well as key considerations and benefits to keep in mind.
Integration Process Steps
The following steps describe the integration process:
1. The recruiter creates a job requisition in SuccessFactors Recruiting, providing
all of the information required for posting to eQuest along with open position
information. The recruiter then submits the requisition for approval.
2. The requisition progresses through the approval process, and the person with
permission to post to job boards will see the Add Job Boards option appear.
3. After the job poster clicks on Add Job Boards, SuccessFactors Recruiting vali-
dates whether all data required by eQuest is provided, and the user is taken to
eQuest.
4. Once in eQuest, the user will see all the boards his or her company has access
to post to (see Figure 8.10).

6. After the postings are submitted, the user is brought back to SuccessFactors and
presented with the requisition’s Job Postings page. The user should see the
lower table populated with the job boards that were selected from eQuest (see
Figure 8.11).

Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 The following information is required on the job requisition to post it to eQuest:
 Classification Type
– Permanent
– Contract
– Contract to Permanent
– Intern
 Classification Time
– Full-Time
– Part-Time
 Industry
 Function
 City
 State/Province
 Postal Code
 Country
 Recruiter Name
 If information is missing in the job requisition, then the user will be asked to
provide the data while posting.
 You must request that the eQuest configuration and eQuest job board subscrip-
tions are enable in SuccessFactors.
 We recommended that you use one eQuest login ID for all SuccessFactors jobs
postings, which will enable multiple users to be able to post and edit the same job.
 Multiple eQuest logins can be used, in which case multiple user profiles for
eQuest are required for the company’s recruiters. This may be case if only some
recruiters have access to post requisitions to certain job boards.
 The eQuest Advantage solution to purchase postings a la carte is not supported
through this integration. SuccessFactors Marketing Central provides such fea-
tures and is part of SuccessFactors Talent Management.
Prerequisites
A separate third-party license with eQuest is required.

8.1.4
LinkedIn Data Integration
When candidates apply for a job through SuccessFactors Recruiting, they can
choose to apply either by entering their candidate profile data (typing the individ-
ual information into each field) or by using LinkedIn to populate certain data val-
ues on their candidate profiles.
External Users
This integration is initiated by external users that set up an account on your SuccessFac-
tors instance. All other integrations discussed in this chapter send and receive data for
users that have accounts on their own active SuccessFactors instances.
The LinkedIn integration can only be used as part of the application process; it is
not possible to use LinkedIn to populate a candidate profile if the candidate is not
presently applying for a job. This integration may only be initiated and autho-
rized by candidates, not recruiting users.
In addition, this integration may only occur on a case-by-case basis, as depicted in
Figure 8.12; the candidate’s authorization may not be used to maintain a dynamic
link to the LinkedIn data. LinkedIn only makes limited data available via integra-
tion, and not all available LinkedIn fields need to be mapped; customers may
choose to use fewer fields than LinkedIn makes available.

Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 The standardized mapping supports only the following data structures:
 Basic Information
– First Name
– Last Name
– Address
– Date of Birth
– Cell Phone

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Recruiting

– Employer
– Job Title
– Present Employer
– Employment State Date
– Employment End Date
– Job Description
 Education
– Name of School
– Degree Obtained
– Field Of Study
– Start Date
– End Date
 The candidate profile can be populated from LinkedIn during the application
process and is not available just to synchronize data to the profile.
 Standard mapping between the candidate profile and LinkedIn data elements
needs to be set up in Admin Tools. Standardized field mapping is necessary to
define where the values from certain LinkedIn fields should be placed in the
SuccessFactors Recruiting Management candidate profile. The values on the
right are the values available from LinkedIn. The fields on the left are drop-
down menus from which you can select fields you configured in the candidate
profile XML. Some fields are limited to match types; for instance, you cannot
map a field defined as text to a value that LinkedIn will send over as a date.
Picklists in Recruiting cannot be mapped to LinkedIn fields.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met:
 Configure standardized mapping in Admin Tools
 The Provisioning setting Enhanced Job Search UI must be enabled
 The Provisioning setting Complete Profile Before Application must be enabled

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors 
Onboarding
In this section, we will discuss the packaged integration between SuccessFactors
Onboarding and a third-party system. As of the writing of this book (spring
2015), there is one standard integration that is offered through the USCIS E-
Verify program. SuccessFactors Onboarding has functionality that can enable
creating new forms, which can ultimately generate data through the standard
export job, which can also be used to integrate most third-party systems.
E-Verify Integration
US law requires companies to employ only individuals who may legally work in
the United States—either US citizens or foreign citizens who have the necessary
authorization. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that compares information
from an employee’s Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) to data from
US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Social Security Administration
(SSA) records to confirm employment eligibility.
E-Verify process consists of the following four steps:
1. Initial verification 
The employee identification information is verified and sent to the DHS E-Ver-
ify program. An eligibility statement is returned providing confirmation or ten-
tative nonconfirmation of an employee’s eligibility to be employed.
2. Secondary verification 
Secondary verification is for employees who contest tentative nonconfirma-
tions and provides final confirmation or nonconfirmation of the employee’s
employment eligibility within three federal government workdays from the
initial inquiry date.
3. Third verification 
Additional processing of the employee’s information occurs in cases in which
the DHS tentative nonconformation is returned within 10 federal government
workdays from the initial inquiry date.
4. Signature 
The employer representative and employee sign employment eligibility forms
using the e-signature technology. This is the final step in the E-Verify process.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Onboarding
8.2

SuccessFactors Onboarding E-Verify process begins immediately after all I-9 doc-
uments are completed and electronically signed. The following process details
how E-Verify works as implemented in the SuccessFactors Onboarding tool (see
Figure 8.16).
The following sections provide a detailed step-by-step sequence of activities as
part of E-Verify integration as well as key considerations and benefits to keep in
mind.
Figure 8.16  SuccessFactors E-Verify Integration
Integration Process Steps
The following steps describe the integration process:
1. After the Form I-9 is completed, new hire data is transmitted from SuccessFac-
tors Onboarding to the Social Security Administration on behalf of the client.
The start date of for E-Verify is determined based on the following criteria (see
also Figure 8.17):
 If the E-Verify request create date is before the start date of the employee,
then the hire date is the E-Verify create date.
 If the E-Verify create date is equal to or after the start date, then the E-Verify
hire date is the start date.

2. SSA checks the validity of the following information (see Figure 8.17):
 Social Security Number
 Date of birth
 Citizenship
Figure 8.17  Review I-9 Form Data to Start E-Verify Process
3. SSA confirms the data then refers to DHS to verify work authorization accord-
ing to the agency’s immigration records.
4. After verification, DHS returns one of the following statements (see Figure 8.18):
 Employment Authorized
 SSA Tentative Nonconfirmation
 DHS Tenative Nonconfirmation
 Case Incomplete
 Photo Matching Required
5. If work authorization is confirmed, then DHS will return Employment Autho-
rized, which will be displayed in SuccessFactors Onboarding, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.18.
6. If neither agency can confirm work authorization, then the employer receives
a Tentative Nonconfirmation message.
7. Upon receiving this nonconfirmation, the employee and employer have the fol-
lowing options:
 The employee has eight days to contest or resolve.
 If the employee does not contest, then the employer can terminate without
the employer being civilly liable for termination.
 If the employee contests, then the employer must sign the Notice of Non-
confirmation.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Onboarding
8.2
251
 If the employee does not report to the SSA to resolve the nonconfirmation sta-
tus and cannot resolve his or her status with the SSA or DHS, then employment
can be terminated without the employer being civilly liable for termination.
 The employee can work during the eight-day period.
Figure 8.18  E-Verify—Employment Authorized
8. When the SSA or DHS Tentative Nonconfirmation statement is returned, the
new employee must be given an opportunity to contest or not contest the state-
ment. The new employee must also acknowledge an understanding of the next
steps associated with his or her decision and sign any notices and referral let-
ters required (see Figure 8.19).
9. The SuccessFactors Onboarding remote employee process features updated
language describing the reasons for the SSA tentative nonconfirmation that can
be easily understood by both employers and employees and acted upon from
different locations.

10. When Photo-Matching Required is returned, SuccessFactors Onboarding
accommodates the automatic upload of the photo to the E-Verify program
and assists with retaining a copy of the photo for your records.
Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 The E-Verify process is not a substitute for pre-employment screenings and
background checks and should not be used as such.
 A tentative nonconfirmation does not mean that the new hire is unauthorized
to work, but rather that the data that was submitted cannot be confirmed. For
example, the new hire may have a hyphen in his or her last name, but at the
SSA there may be no hyphen on record.
 Photo-matching, as defined by the USCIS, is “an automatic part of the initial
verification in E-Verify” that prompts employers to compare an employee’s

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning
8.3
253
photo ID with a photo displayed on the E-Verify screen. This step helps em-
ployers ensure that the documents provided are valid.
User Interface
The UI provides wizards to guide the onboarding specialist through the E-Verify pro-
cess. Only options that are relevant for each step are visible on the screen, along with
helpful instructions pertaining to that step in the workflow.
 The photo-matching step occurs automatically when you perform a verification
case for an employee who has presented a United States Passport or Passport
Card, a Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551), or an Employment Authoriza-
tion Document (Form I-766) as their Form I-9 documentation. When the
employee presents any of these three documents and the Form I-9 information
entered by the employer matches DHS records, the employee’s photo will auto-
matically display in SuccessFactors Onboarding on the E-Verify screen.
 According to the DHS, if an employer participates in the E-Verify program and
the employee presents a document used as part of the Photo Screening tool as
noted previously, then the employer must retain a photocopy of the document
he or she presents when there is a photo nonmatch.
Prerequisites
SuccessFactors Onboarding E-Verify is required.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning
In this section, we will discuss the packaged integrations for SuccessFactors
Learning. SuccessFactors Learning integrates with PayPal for enabling com-
merce functionality. It also integrates with Questionmark for learning assess-
ments and with virtual learning systems such as Adobe Connect and Cisco
WebEx to deliver training remotely. Each of these integrations are enabled with
different configurations. This section will detail the required and more commonly
used configurations.

8.3.1
PayPal Payflow Pro Integration
A SuccessFactors Learning customer will train his or her customers, partners, and
suppliers by providing curricula and courses available through resources outside
the organization. External users pay for this training in multiple ways, including
PO, chargebacks, credit card, and so on. When you connect SuccessFactors Learn-
ing to PayPal Payflow Pro, Payflow handles the financial transactions when users
purchase courses from inside SuccessFactors Learning.
By allowing PayPal Payflow Pro to handle the transactions, you separate learning
records from financial records: SuccessFactors does not store any credit card
numbers unless you tell it to store the last four digits for auditing purposes. Even
when you allow the last four digits to be saved in the database, SuccessFactors
Learning encrypts the last four digits.
Because PayPal Payflow Pro handles both the information and the transaction, we
recommend that you read the PayPal Payflow Pro documentation as a companion
to the SuccessFactors documentation. PayPal publishes a Payflow Developer’s
Guide with the most current information about configuring the system. We rec-
ommend that you read the guide, particularly sections about testing the system.
PayPal built a testing system that allows you to submit test transactions to Pay-
flow without real credit card information. Figure 8.20 shows the steps and inter-
actions between SuccessFactors Learning and PayPal Payflow Pro.

The following sections provide a detailed step-by-step sequence of activities as
part of the integration, information on setting up and configuring your PayPal
Payflow Pro account once you have established the integration, financial configu-
ration steps to be taken within SuccessFactors Learning for PayPal, and finally key
considerations to keep in mind when utilizing the integration.
Integration Process Steps
Perform the following process steps to successfully implement the integration
between SuccessFactors Learning and PayPal:
1. Set up your PayPal Payflow Pro account before you configure the SuccessFac-
tors Learning connection to the account.
2. Work with PayPal to set up your Payflow Pro payment gateway account. This
account information is necessary for setting up SuccessFactors Learning to con-
nect to Payflow.
3. Once PayPal account information is available, the following key configurations
need to be configured for this integration to work:
 Gateway Name 
The gateway that SuccessFactors Learning communicates with. The value is
PayPal for PayPal Payflow Pro gateway.
 Gateway Password 
The password you set up when you created the Payflow Pro account. Contact
PayPal support for your password.
 Gateway Host Address and Port 
The host address and port number of the service that is hosting PayPal Pay-
flow Pro.
 Partner Name 
The ID provided to you by either PayPal or the reseller who created your
account.
 Vendor Name 
The merchant login ID created with the PayPal account.
 User Name 
The username you created for the PayPal account.
 Currency Codes 
The currency codes are the three-letter currency codes that the Payflow
account accepts.

PayPal Payflow Pro Documentation
The Paypal Payflow Pro FAQ is available at https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/
payflow-faq, and API documentation is available at https://developer.paypal.com/
webapps/developer/docs.
4. Set up the BOOTSTRAP-PAYMENT-GATEWAY in SuccessFactors Learning.
The BOOTSTRAP-PAYMENT-GATEWAY file contains the network and log-
ging settings of the PayPal Payflow Pro connection. It appears only to on-
premise customers in System Admin  Configuration  System Configura-
tion  BOOTSTRAP-PAYMENT-GATEWAY. For cloud learning, reach out to
your SuccessFactors support representative for help. The key settings in this
configuration are as follows:
 hostAddress 
The hostAddress property contains the URL of the host for the PayPal site
hosting your Payflow Pro account. By default, SuccessFactors Learning goes
to the test, or “pilot” site (pilot-payflowpro.paypal.com). Read more about the
pilot site and find your live transaction site in the PayPal Payflow Pro docu-
mentation.
 hostPort 
The hostPort property contains the port that SuccessFactors uses and that
PayPal Payflow Pro requires. The default is 443.
 timeout 
This is the number of seconds SuccessFactors Learning waits for a response
before giving up.
5. Set up the financial configuration in SuccessFactors Learning. The financial con-
figuration controls parts of SuccessFactors Learning commerce. It contains the
PayPal Payflow Pro login settings and the settings to control the behavior of
SuccessFactors Learning when a user provides payment information. This file
appears to all customers in System Admin  Configuration  System Configu-
ration  FINANCIAL. Some important configurations to be set are as follows:
 financialTxApprovalRequired 
If set to true, then the financial transactions will have to be approved by an
administrator before the transactions can be extracted.
 shoppingAccountTypeStudent 
This property defines the default shopping account type for newly added

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning
8.3
257
users. The shopping account type can be internal or external. A user’s type
matters, because external users can be excluded from some transactions.
 shoppingAccountTypeOrganization 
Defines the default shopping account type for newly added organizations.
The shopping account type can be internal or external. An organization’s
type matters, because users in external organizations can be excluded from
some transactions
 externalStudentPaymentMethodCreditCardEnabled 
When checking out at the shopping cart, this setting controls whether an
external user (or user in an external organization) can use a credit card as a
payment method.
 creditCardAuthorizationEnabled 
Set creditCardAuthorizationEnabled to true to enable transactions
through PayPal Payflow Pro.
 creditCardSecurityCodeRequired 
Set creditCardSecurityCodeRequired to true to require users to enter their
credit card security code (for example, the three digits on the back of a Visa
card). Check PayPal Payflow Pro documentation and your PayPal Payflow
Pro configuration before setting this property.
 paymentGatewayCurrencies[USD] 
The paymentGatewayCurrencies sets the currencies accepted by PayPal Pay-
flow Pro. By default, it is set to US Dollars (USD). For each currency you want
to add, copy paymentGatewayCurrencies[USD] and change USD to the correct
three-letter currency code, then set the property to true. To disable the cur-
rency while leaving its entry in the file, set it to false.
6. Next, the SuccessFactors Learning administrator needs to set up a catalog with
prices and define payment methods, including credit card payment processor
configuration. Although SuccessFactors Learning never stores full credit card
numbers, you can decide how you want SuccessFactors Learning to handle the
credit card at the moment the user enters the information and for auditing pur-
poses. Your company might have a policy concerning these issues.
You have the following options when handling credit card information:
 You can mask the credit card numbers in the text box in which a user enters
the numbers.
 You can store the last four digits, encrypted, for auditing purposes.

Integrating Talent Solutions with Third-Party Applications
8
258
 You can validate the credit card number for simple errors before it is sent.
For example, validation checks that Visa and MasterCard numbers are 16
digits.
 You can require the credit card security code.
 You can mask the security code when the user types it into text boxes.
 You can set how you want the system to handle the expiration year—that is,
how many years into the future to show in the dropdown list.
After the successful completion of these steps, users will now be able to perform
payment transactions for SuccessFactors Learning courses.
Users will be able to browse the catalogs they have access to and see the price of
each item. Users can add items to a shopping cart and click on Checkout once
they are done with selection. When a user clicks on Checkout, he or she is shown
a shopping cart summary and address information. After confirmation, the user
will see payment method options and, if credit card is selected, will be shown a
screen to enter credit card details. Upon entering credit card information and
clicking on Submit, connection with PayPal payment processor is established and
order details (including price, address, and credit card information) are sent.
Once PayPal successfully charges the credit card, a transaction ID and status is
supplied to SuccessFactors Learning. The user is shown the order details and
transaction status in SuccessFactors Learning.
Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 Credit card information is not stored in SuccessFactors, but (based on the con-
figuration) the last four digits of the credit card number can be stored for track-
ing purposes.
 The order ID is associated with the PayPal transaction ID in SuccessFactors
Learning. This will enable tracking an order and its fulfillment details.
 User and organization shopping account types influence the payment options
available in commerce functionality.
 The currency PayPal Payflow Pro accepts must have the matching currency
code in SuccessFactors Learning.

Virtual Learning Systems Integration
Virtual Learning Systems (VLS) enables e-learning over the web and mimics an in-
person training delivery. VLS creates a classroom-type environment, allowing an
instructor to deliver training through video, presentation, chatting, or phone.
They enable discussions between participants through chat, phone, or a com-
puter’s speaker and microphone. Figure 8.21 details the interactions between
SuccessFactors Learning and VLS, along with the steps performed in each system.
Figure 8.21  SuccessFactors Learning Integration with Virtual Learning Systems
SuccessFactors Learning VLS integration is designed to work when the user con-
nects directly from SuccessFactors Learning to the listed virtual VLS classrooms.
Therefore, users should always connect to virtual classrooms through SuccessFac-
tors Learning. We recommend that you plan your use of the VLS server to match
the options available to you through SuccessFactors Learning:

The following sections provide a detailed step-by-step sequence of activities for
VLS integration and key considerations and benefits to keep in mind.
Integration Process Steps
The following steps describe the integration process:
1. The administrator should set up VLS configuration in SuccessFactors Learn-
ing, as documented in the Virtual Meeting Rooms guide available at http://
help.sap.com/cloud4hr. Figure 8.22 shows the configuration screen.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning
8.3
261
2. When you sign up with a VLS vendor, the vendor should provide the following
configuration information (if you already have a VLS provider, reach out to that
provider for configuration information):
 XML API Address
 URL API Address
 Username
 Password
 Meeting Type
 Site Name
Figure 8.22  SuccessFactors Learning VLS Configuration
3. There may be additional configuration settings for your virtual learning server,
but the settings in the previous step are the basic requirements for SuccessFac-
tors VLS environment settings. SuccessFactors Learning can be configured with
multiple VLS providers if your organization uses different ones based on differ-
ent types of sessions.

Integrating Talent Solutions with Third-Party Applications

4. VLS configuration is disabled by default. Therefore, you’ll have to enable it. Go
to System Admin  Configuration  System Configuration. From here, edit
the LMS_ADMIN configuration page.
5. Find the vleEnabled setting, and change its value to true. Click on Apply
Changes.
6. The SuccessFactors VLS connection configuration can be added or edited from
SuccessFactors Learning Administration. To do so, log in to SuccessFactors
Learning Administration, and then go to System Admin  Configuration  VLS
Configuration.
7. Click on the Add New link, and then add a unique VLS ID, a description, and the
XML configuration file provided by SuccessFactors in the Configuration box.
Add a new VLS configuration for every VLS provider you want to connect to.
8. Click on Add.
9. Make provider-specific changes to the XML configuration, as described in the
reference guide available at http://help.sap.com/cloud4hr.
<connector> and <connector_class>
Do not modify the <connector> and <connector_class> elements for any of these
files. To edit the files, you should have an understanding of XML and technical knowl-
edge of the VLS server to which you are integrating. The values you put in each of the
XML elements are supplied by the vendor or the server you are integrating with.
Time zone mappings are contained in the VLS configuration files, in the timezones ele-
ment. In almost every case, you can use the default time zone mappings. However, if
participants in your meetings describe time zone issues, then you can check the map for
their time zones to make sure that they are correct.
Set Up Instructors and Courses
Once the primary configurations for the integration are complete, the instructors
that will deliver virtual courses should have their accounts set up with VLS cre-
dentials. VLS IDs can be created through SuccessFactors Learning, or existing
ones can be associated with the instructor’s account.
For an item’s scheduled offerings, one or more segments can be set up as Vir-
tual. When a segment is marked Virtual, the VLS server to be used should be
selected from the dropdown; optionally, you can provide a password in case you

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning
8.3
263
want attendees to both access the meeting URL and enter a password to join (see
Figure 8.23).
Once the session is created, the instructor is sent a VLS link that enables him or
her to start the virtual meeting room. As users register and enroll in the course,
emails with unique attendee URLs will be sent to them. The URLs include infor-
mation to enable tracking for attendance. Users can attend the virtual sessions
either by clicking on the URL or logging into SuccessFactors Learning and clicking
on the launch link on the Learning Assignments dashboard. The link will be
enabled prior to the session start based on VLS configuration.
Figure 8.23  Scheduled Offering with Virtual Segment
Data Synchronization with VLS
VLS synchronization is the process that transfers information from SuccessFactors Learn-
ing Administration to your VLS server. For example, if you add an instructor in Success-
Factors Learning Administration, then the instructor record is synchronized from Suc-
cessFactors Learning Administration through VLS so that the instructor is recognized in
both systems. The systems can be synchronized when you save the instructor record, or
SuccessFactors Learning can synchronize changes in a batch.
 To synchronize immediately: Set the sync element in your VLS configuration XML
file to true. By default, the sync element is set to true, because we recommend that
you synchronize immediately unless you have a slow connection. As soon as you add,
update, or delete a record that needs to be synchronized with VLS, SuccessFactors
Learning Administration sends the information through VLS. This setting is recom-
mended for most customers.

Integrating Talent Solutions with Third-Party Applications
8
264
 To synchronize at an interval: Set the sync element to false, and then configure
the synchronization frequency in System Admin  Configuration  Global Variables.
When you synchronize at an interval, the synchronization process runs in the back-
ground at an interval. Any changes you make in SuccessFactors Learning do not
appear immediately on the VLS server.
Once all the sessions in the scheduled offering are completed, the VLS Attendance
Processing automatic process will run if enabled, retrieving information about
the user and the duration for which he or she attended virtual sessions. If this
duration meets or exceeds the attendance percentage that was set up, then the
user is marked as having attended the course.
Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 The course item should be classified as instructor-led or blended to be able to
create scheduled offerings in SuccessFactors Learning.
 If you need to resend the email notifications to registered users, then you can
send do so from the Scheduled Offering Segment screen.
 When a user drops and rejoins a virtual session, typically multiple attendance
records are sent by VLS. All attendance records of a user are added to deter-
mine if they met the attendance percentage.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met to implement this integration:
 SuccessFactors Learning VLS license
 SuccessFactors Learning VLS configuration XML for your provider
 VLS account with Cisco WebEx or Adobe Connect
8.3.3
Questionmark Integration
Questionmark is a provider of online assessment software for learning, certifica-
tion, compliance, and channel expertise. The software allows you to create,
deliver, and report on assessments.

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning
8.3
265
After the assessments are authored in Questionmark, the SuccessFactors Learning
administrator should copy the public URL for delivery of the assessment and con-
figure a content object entity of type AICC or SCORM based on the specification
provided by its author in SuccessFactors. The administrator should then associate
the content object to a SuccessFactors Learning item and add it to one or more
catalogs based on business need.
When the user launches the learning item, the SSO handshake is initiated between
SuccessFactors and Questionmark, and the user is securely logged in and assess-
ment information sent. Questionmark will display the assessment screens to the
user. Upon completion of the assessment, the score is sent back and stored in
SuccessFactors. The learning administrator can run Questionmark reports from
SuccessFactors Learning. Figure 8.24 provides a sequence of events that would
need to occur in each system for this integration to work and to return the score
to SuccessFactors Learning.

Integration Process Steps
The following steps describe the integration process:
1. The following key configurations need to be set up for this integration to work:
 endPointAddress: Questionmark SOAP end point URL
 apiClientID: The client ID assigned by Questionmark
 apiChecksum: Checksum value provided by Questionmark
2. Once the necessary configurations have been completed, the SuccessFactors
Learning administrator should create a content object with the Launch Method
set as either AICC or SCORM, based on how the content was authored, and
should also provide the Questionmark URL to launch for assessment delivery
(see Figure 8.25).
Figure 8.25  SuccessFactors Learning Content Object Setup
3. The administrator should then create an item and classify it as Online Only,
providing all relevant information, and associate the content object created in
the previous step (see Figure 8.26).

Packaged Integrations for SuccessFactors Learning

4. The item created in the previous step can be assigned to users as part of a cur-
riculum or as a standalone course.
5. The item then appears on an assigned user’s My Learning Assignments screen.
The user clicks on the assessment to launch it and then completes it (see Fig-
ure 8.27).
Figure 8.27  SuccessFactors My Learning Assignments Screen
The assessment results are simultaneously sent back to SuccessFactors Learning
and recorded in the user’s learning history. The same information is also available
for the administrator in the User Administration section.

Key Considerations and Benefits
When employing this integration, keep the following considerations and benefits
in mind:
 The content object’s file name should contain the full URL for the Question-
mark assessment, including the domain name.
 When the score is available in SuccessFactors Learning, the success or failure
based on the value specified can be determined in the Mastery Score field.
 Refer to the SuccessFactors Learning help documentation for associating con-
tent to an item and enabling it to be available for users.
Prerequisites
A separate third-party contract with Questionmark for its learning assessments solution
is required.
8.4
Standard Data Imports
Standard data imports are another way to integrate SuccessFactors with third-
party vendors. The previous sections discussed the business process-based inte-
grations. In this section, we will look at the data integrations.
Data is imported into SuccessFactors through standard import jobs. These data
imports accept flat files (mostly in CSV format) and send out notifications when
they complete processing data. This section discusses the high-level design and
function of these standard import processes.
The next two sections look at the import process for the SuccessFactors HCM plat-
form and data imports in SuccessFactors Learning.
8.4.1
SuccessFactors HCM Platform
The import process starts with the preparation of the file in SuccessFactors-
defined format. The template files can be downloaded directly from the applica-
tion in Admin Tools. The file format supported is a comma-delimited file. The
first line contains the column technical name, and the second line includes the
user-friendly column name. Figure 8.28 shows the steps performed by the import
process to consume files and add data to the SuccessFactors platform.

Standard Data Imports
8.4
269
Figure 8.28  SuccessFactors HCM Import Process Internal Design
The data from the file is updated as is, but if specific data in SuccessFactors needs
to be retained for a column, then &&NO_OVERWRITE&& needs to be specified in the
file for the corresponding column. The file generated can be encrypted and is to
be placed on the SuccessFactors-provided secure FTP server or the customer’s FTP
server. The file name can include the current date to not overwrite files that are
still on the FTP server.
The file will be picked up at the scheduled time, decrypted, and validated for for-
mat and data consistency. Once these checks pass, the data in each row is vali-
dated against the data in the database, and actions that need to be taken on the
record are determined and executed. Once all records are processed, an email is
sent out to all users or groups specified at the time of scheduling the job. The
email contains a summary of information, including counts of new and updated
records, along with error counts and error messages.
8.4.2
SuccessFactors Learning
Data imports to SuccessFactors are also known as connectors. There are connectors
for users, admins, organizations, domains, learning history, jobs, item domains,
positions, scheduled offerings, and registration data. Connector workbooks
defining the specifications are released along with product releases by Success-
Factors. Each of the following sections provide details on connector features.
Action on record determined and executed
File picked up by SuccessFactors import process
Report sent to administrators with summary
information
Place file on FTP server directory
Global validation on the file followed by record
level validations

Integrating Talent Solutions with Third-Party Applications

270
File Format
SuccessFactors supports only the UTF-8 character set in the input file. Because
many connectors have description fields that span multiple rows, it is recom-
mended to use !##! as a row delimiter. The column delimiter is always a pipe (|)
character. The connector will be set to the header method for processing the
input file. This means that the order of the headers can vary, because the connec-
tor reads the header row and uses it to map data to the connector fields. All col-
umns indicated in the header row must be supplied in the input file data. Two
consecutive pipes indicate a null value.
Configuration Options
The System Admin  Configuration  System Configuration  Connectors con-
figuration menu contains both global settings applicable to all connectors and
those that are specific to each connector. Properties starting with the connector
prefix apply to all connectors. These can be overridden for a specific connector by
adding a prefix to the property. If this needs to be changed only for a specific con-
nector, then add a new property prefixing the property for that connector.
Example
The connector configuration ships with connector.pgp.enabled=false, indicating that
file encryption is disabled. It can be enabled for a connector by adding a new property,
xyz.connector.pgp.enabled=true, where xyz is the connector prefix.
Table 8.1 provides a list of connectors and their corresponding prefixes.

Scheduling
A connector scheduler resembles Windows Scheduler options, and each of the
connector menus available at System Admin  Connectors displays the connector
scheduler (see Figure 8.29).
Data Processing
Data from input files are loaded into staging tables. After comparing them with
the target data, delta data is determined along with the type of operation that
needs to be performed on each of the target records. Records determined as
unchanged are ignored, and changed records are processed by the connector.
Figure 8.29  SuccessFactors Learning Connector—Schedule and Status
Reports and Error Logs
Once the connector completes processing all records, it generates two reports
and emails them to the email address(es) specified on the scheduling screen. The
summary report contains record counts for operations performed and aggre-
gated information. The connector has the ability to archive processed files (see
Figure 8.30).

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed how to integrate SuccessFactors talent modules with
third-party applications using delivered integrations. Some of these integrations
do not require a middleware platform, whereas others (such as assessment inte-
grations with SuccessFactors Recruiting) do need one. When middleware is
needed, SuccessFactors and SAP deliver packaged integration content via both
Dell Boomi AtomSphere and SAP HANA Cloud Integration. All of the integrations
described in this chapter are with SuccessFactors partners that are in the cloud,
with no further network configurations needed.
Moving on from business process-oriented integrations, we also touched on the
various data imports and integrations involved with talent modules. A large num-
ber of SuccessFactors customers use flat file imports to add data to the talent
suite. The data templates for standard imports to talent modules are available in
Admin Tools.
The next chapter will showcase a few case studies for the Full Cloud HCM deploy-
ment model. This will provide real-world application to the concepts discussed
throughout the book.

Moving your HR processes to the cloud is a process best handled by the 
Full Cloud HCM integrations. In this chapter, we will discuss the integra-
tion of Employee Central with SAP ERP, Employee Central Payroll and 
SAP Payroll, and third-party tools, such as Kronos Time Management.

Implementing the Full Cloud 
HCM Integrations
Full Cloud HCM integrations allow HR processes to be maintained in the cloud
via Employee Central. Full Cloud HCM integrations with SAP ERP include stan-
dard integration solutions for cost center master data replication, employee data,
and organizational replication using the Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware
tool. In addition, Employee Central can be integrated with third-party applica-
tions using Dell Boomi AtomSphere as the middleware with benefit vendors, pay-
roll vendors, and Kronos Time Management for time processing.
Target Audience
The perfect candidates for Full Cloud HCM integrations are customers who are main-
taining their core HR processes in the cloud within Employee Central. For more infor-
mation, see Chapter 3.
The following sections provide detailed, step-by-step customer case studies that
show how the standard integration scenarios can be implemented via standard
integration templates to complete the integration between Employee Central and
SAP ERP and third-party applications that use Dell Boomi AtomSphere for the fol-
lowing tasks:
 Employee Central integration with SAP ERP
 Employee Central integration with SAP Payroll or Employee Central Payroll
 Employee Central integration with Kronos Time Management
Let’s begin by looking at the integration of Employee Central with SAP ERP.

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

9.1
Employee Central Integration to SAP ERP
The Employee Central to SAP ERP integration is tailored for customers using the
Full Cloud HCM deployment model. Employee master data is managed in Em-
ployee Central in the cloud, but part of the employee record needs to be repli-
cated back to SAP ERP to support other, non-HR processes. For example, if SAP
ERP is used for procurement, then employee data may be required to determine
approval structures in workflow processes.
Prerequisites
Prior to implementing Employee Central integration with SAP ERP, you will need to
complete the following relevant configurations:
 Set up Employee Central with the latest version of SuccessFactors
 Set up Dell Boomi AtomSphere
 Have SFSF Employee Central Integration Add-on (PA_SE_IN 100 SP1 and ODTFINCC
600) deployed and configured in SAP. You must also have the following system min-
imum requirements:
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 15 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 08 EHP 2 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 05 EHP 3 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 05 EHP 4 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0/SAP NetWeaver 7.01 SPS 05 EHP 4 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 06 EHP 5 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 03 EHP 6 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 on SAP HANA SPS 01 EHP 6 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 ISS EHP 7 or higher
 HR Renewal 1.0 SPS 03 or higher
 Have relevant access to SAP ERP with a sufficient authorization role for the configu-
ration activities in SAP IMG, SALE, web service configuration, and background job
scheduler, as well as access to the SuccessFactors Provisioning and Administration
pages
 IT network configuration is required to enable communication through firewalls
between Dell Boomi AtomSphere and SAP ERP
In a typical integration scenario, the cost center replication process is set to run
first to replicate the cost center from SAP ERP to Employee Central for employee
cost assignment purposes. Then, the employee master data, job information, and

Employee Central Integration to SAP ERP
9.1
277
organizational structure information is replicated from Employee Central to SAP
ERP. To link the employee master data with the job and organizational structure,
organizational assignment information is replicated from Employee Central to
SAP ERP.
We will use a case study example to demonstrate this process. A description of
the parameters that this integration will entail is presented next, including the cli-
ent scenario and an overview of the process steps.
9.1.1
Case Study Parameters
In this case study, we will focus on the Employee Central integration to SAP ERP.
Specifically, we’ll discuss the implementation steps necessary for both SAP ERP
and SuccessFactors to implement the cost center, organizational, and employee
data integration.
Client Scenario
ABC Global Services is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has operations sites
across the United States—with over 5,000 employees in North America. The com-
pany currently uses SAP ERP to support its financials, sales and distribution, and
materials management functions. ABC Global Services became increasingly inter-
ested in SuccessFactors because it is looking to lessen IT configuration support and
have its system be more user maintained while providing a more positive user
experience. Over time, ABC Global Services inspires to have modules to exchange
and build on data—in hopes of bringing employees closer to their HR data.
At this point, ABC Global Services would like to implement the SuccessFactors
Employee Central module for its core HR processes. ABC Global Service’s existing
IT footprint includes SAP ERP ECC 6.0 EHP 6.
To effectively integrate and transfer the cost center, organizational, and employee
data, the team recognizes that the technical consultant will need to have a solid
understanding of the basic settings of Employee Central integration with SAP ERP
and the necessary Integration Add-ons and system requirements to make the inte-
gration successful. The biggest challenge will be to keep the systems and HR data
in sync between SAP ERP and SuccessFactors.
With a successful integration, the benefits of moving to the cloud will include an
easy and fast deployment of the Employee Central module and the ability to

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations
9
278
leverage standard Integration Add-ons delivered by SAP to ensure that the data is
in sync between SuccessFactors and SAP ERP HCM. To ensure that the integration
is successful, there are certain business requirements that will guarantee a smooth
transfer of data. For example, there needs to be a single source of employee data
from Employee Central.
To integrate and transfer data from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP using Dell Boomi
AtomSphere middleware, execute the following steps:
1. Ensure that baseline integration configuration settings were made for SAP ERP
and for the Employee Central integration by defining authorizations in SAP
ERP to access the new integration transactions.
2. The middleware, installation, and configuration of Dell Boomi AtomSphere
was set as an integration point between SAP ERP and SuccessFactors.
Process Overview
There are four main steps that are required to implement the Employee Central
integration with SAP ERP:
 Step 1: Basic setup 
In this step, we’ll look at the basic system configuration necessary for integra-
tion with SuccessFactors to SAP ERP. This includes everything from creating a
technical system user in SAP ERP to creating an RFC destination in SAP ERP (see
Section 9.1.2).
 Step 2: Employee Central configuration 
In this section step, we will look at setting up the configuration for Employee
Central. This includes the data models, picklists, and Role-Based Permissions
(RBP) enhancement configurations (see Section 9.1.3).
 Step 3: SAP ERP configuration 
This section will cover the SAP ERP configuration setup steps, which involves
tasks such as refining the default logic of a work schedule to organization struc-
ture, organizational assignment, and job classification replication (see Section
9.1.4).
 Step 4: Middleware setup and web service activation 
This section discusses the necessary steps for configuring the Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere middleware, along with the SAP ERP web service activation and Appli-
cation Link Enabling (ALE) distribution model for integrating cost center repli-

Employee Central Integration to SAP ERP
9.1
279
cation, employee data replication, and employee data replication confirmation
scenarios between Employee Central and SAP ERP (see Section 9.1.5).
Let’s begin with the basic setup process involved with this integration.
9.1.2
Step 1: Basic Setup
There is a baseline integration configuration that is required for setting up
Employee Central in SAP ERP. This baseline system configuration covers settings
for Employee Central, SAP ERP, and Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware.
The basic setup is comprised of the following tasks:
 Creating a technical system user in SAP ERP
 Enabling web services for the SuccessFactors API
 Creating a SuccessFactors API user
 Configuring the SuccessFactors API user security
 Configuring the SuccessFactors API login exceptions
 Installing the integration pack in Dell Boomi AtomSphere
 Importing the SSL trusted CA certificate into SAP ERP
 Creating an RFC destination in SAP ERP
We’ll begin by creating a technical user in SAP ERP.
Create a Technical System User in SAP ERP
To begin, we’ll define the authorization for the communication of the Dell Boomi
AtomSphere middleware with SAP ERP. To do this, you’ll define the role by refer-
ring to standard roles SAP_HR_PA_EC_EE_REPL (which includes employee data rep-
lication access) and SAP_HR_SFIOM_WEBSERVICES (which includes organizational
data replication access). You may use the standard roles as a template to define an
authorization that suits your requirement.
Access Transaction PFCG to begin defining a role. Once you have defined the
authorization, you can proceed to create a technical user by assigning the defined
role. Access Transaction SU01 to begin creating a technical user, with System des-
ignated as the User Type.
Now, let’s focus on enabling the web services for the SuccessFactors API.

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

280
Enable Web Services SuccessFactors API
In this task, you will want to activate the SuccessFactors web services API features.
To do so, log on to the SuccessFactors Provisioning page by accessing https://
<Instance URL>/provisioning_login (the instance URL is provided by the Success-
Factors team—for example, https://performancemanager8.SuccessFactors.com/pro-
visioning_login).
Next, on the Provisioning page, go to Company Settings, then navigate to Web
Services. Under Web Services, select the following features:
 SFAPI
 SFAPI Ad hoc Feature
 Employee Central SOAP API
 OData API
 Employee Central OData API
Next, we’ll talk about how to create a SuccessFactors API user.
Create a SuccessFactors API User
A SuccessFactors API user is required for the Dell Boomi AtomSphere middle-
ware to integrate with Employee Central. The API user must first be created in the
SuccessFactors provisioning tool. The same API user logon credential is then
stored in the middleware credential setting of the Dell Boomi AtomSphere envi-
ronment setup.
Log on to the SuccessFactors Provisioning site and choose Company Settings.
Then, navigate to Admin Username. Enter the following information:
 Admin Username (we suggest using “SAP_API_USER”)
 Admin Password (create a strong password)
 Admin First Name (Enter user’s first name)
 Admin Last Name (Enter user’s first name)
 Admin Email (Enter user’s email address)
Click on the Create Admin button to create the API user.
Now, let us turn our attention to the API user security.

Employee Central Integration to SAP ERP
9.1
281
Configure the SuccessFactors API User Security
In this step, you will grant security access to the API user created in the previous
step. You will need to use RBP to assign permissions to the API User.
Role-Based Permissions
RBP will normally be created by your Employee Central functional consultant.
Proceed with the following steps:
1. Log on to the SuccessFactors instance URL as an admin—for example, https://
performancemanager8.SuccessFactors.com.
2. Create an RBP group and assign your API user to it. Navigate to Admin Tools 
Manage Employees  Set User Permissions  Manage Permission Groups (see
Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.2).

sion Role List.
8.
Pick the API Users role from the Permission Role list in the Permission Role
Detail window.
9.
Click on the Permission Settings button to open a User Permissions win-
dow, which will contain a list of categories for permissions.
10. Make the minimum selections necessary for enabling the API user. Please
work with an Employee Central functional consultant to determine any addi-
tional permissions needed. Select each category, and within the category
select the settings shown in Figure 9.4.
Figure 9.4  Employee Central Admin Tools—Assigning Permissions to Roles
SuccessFactors API Login Exception
In this step, you will configure the API login exception for the API user that was just
created. The purpose is to ensure that the password for the API user does not expire.

Log on to the SuccessFactors tenant as an admin user, then navigate to Admin
Tools  Company Settings  Password & Login Policy Settings  Set API Login
Exceptions. Then, add the following settings (see Figure 9.5):
 Username 
sap_api_user
 Maximum Password Age (in days) 
- 1
 IP Address Restrictions 
Select designated external, EGRESS IP addresses, or the address range from
which the API user is being accessed from. This can be used to ensure that the
API user is only called from designated sources.
Figure 9.5  Set API Login Exceptions
Install the Integration Pack in Dell Boomi AtomSphere
Next, you will set up the preconfigured integration pack in Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere. This integration pack contains the required integration mapping between
the Employee Central data fields and the corresponding fields of SAP ERP. Prior
to the installation, you will have to create a separate Dell Boomi AtomSphere
atom and environment for the integration pack to be able to deploy. Let’s start by
creating an atom. Proceed as follows:
1. Log on to the Dell Boomi AtomSphere system, and navigate to Build  Create
Component  Create  Atom. Under Atom Setup, select the In the Cloud radio
button, and choose Atom Cloud. Enter a name for your atom, and click on OK
to create it (see Figure 9.6).

2. Once the atom is created, you can proceed to create the environments. Go to
Manage  Atom Management. Click on the + (plus sign) icon (see Figure 9.7).
Figure 9.7  Add Environment
3. Under the Environments properties, enter the environment name, and then
click on Save. Once it is saved, the newly created environment will appear under
Environments on the left pane. Select the environment that was just created. Go
to its properties, and then select the atom that was created earlier from the Unat-
tached Atoms list and click on the << button to attach the atom to the environ-
ment. The atom will appear in the Attached Atoms list (see Figure 9.8).
Figure 9.8  Attached Atoms
You have now successfully set up the required atom and environment and can
now install the integration pack. You will install three integration packs as part of
the Employee Central to SAP ERP integration:

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

286
 Employee master data replication scenario
 Cost center replication scenario
 Organizational management scenario
Proceed as follows:
1. Go to Deploy, and select Integration Packs (see Figure 9.9).
Figure 9.9  Deploy and Select Integration Packs
2. Under Integration Packs, click on the + icon to browse the integration packs
catalog and look for the integration pack iFlow EC to EC Payroll Employee
Replication v2.0. Click on View and Install to complete the installation.
3. iFlow EC to EC Payroll Employee Replication v2.0 will now appear under
Integration Packs. You are ready to begin attaching an environment to the
integration pack. Select the newly deployed integration pack, and attach the
environment that was created earlier by choosing it from the Unattached
Environment list on the right side of the screen, then click on the << button to
attach it. As a result, the environment will now appear under the Attached
Environments list of the integration pack iFlow EC to EC Payroll Employee
Replication v2.0 (see Figure 9.10).

SSL Trusted CA Certificate Import in SAP ERP
To enable the SSL connection between SAP ERP to the Dell Boomi AtomSphere
middleware, first import the Dell Boomi AtomSphere SSL Trusted CA certificates
into SAP ERP via Transaction STRUST.
Begin by downloading the SSL CA certificates from Dell Boomi AtomSphere.
Then, proceed as follows:
1. Go to Manage  Environments and select the atom that was created earlier.
Under the Atom Properties, open the Shared Web Server Settings. Copy
the base URL and paste it into the desired Internet browser (we recommend
Google Chrome; see Figure 9.11).
Figure 9.11  Web Server Settings
2. Click on the Security icon (a closed lock) next to the URL address box. Navigate
to the Connection tab, and click on the certificate information. A certificate
dialog box will appear (see Figure 9.12).

4. After successfully downloading the certificates, import the certificates into SAP
ERP via Transaction STRUST. Double-click on SSL System Client, and then
choose Import Certificate in the lower-left corner of the UI.
Create an RFC Destination in SAP ERP
There is one more basic configuration that must be completed. This step involves
creating an RFC destination in SAP ERP for connecting the Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere middleware. This connection will be used by the cost center replication
scenario.
Follow these steps to proceed:
1. To begin, access Transaction SM59, and create an RFC destination with connec-
tion type G by entering the parameters shown in Table 9.1 (also see Figure 9.14).

Step 2: Employee Central Configuration
Now, let’s turn our attention to the necessary Employee Central configuration
steps required for setting up the Employee Central integration with SAP ERP.
This section covers the following tasks:
 Data model configuration
 Picklist configuration
 RBP enhancement configuration
Let’s begin our discussion by defining the succession data model and corporate
data model.
Data Model Configurations
There are two types of data models that need to be updated for this configuration:
the succession data model and the corporate data model. The configuration steps for
both data models are described in the next sections.

Employee Central Integration to SAP ERP
9.1
291
Succession Data Model Configuration
The succession data model governs the structure of the SuccessFactors system. It
is accessible in the provisioning tool for each instance. This best practice data
model contains all standard fields and background elements available to capture
employee data.
In this step, you will update the required HRIS fields’ attributes of the succession
data model for the employee master data replication process. You will then
export the succession data model for adjustment and import it back in the Provi-
sioning tools.
Perform the following steps to proceed:
1. Log on to the SuccessFactors Provisioning page of your instance and navigate
to Succession Management. From here, log on to https://<server>.successfac-
tors.com/provisioning_login (see Figure 9.17).
Figure 9.17  Provisioning—Succession Management
2. From this screen, click on the Import/Export Data Model link, then select the
Export radio button.
3. Save the succession data model XML file to your local machine, and make the
following adjustments:
 Open the XML file via the XML Editor tool, and edit the HRIS fields attribute
based on the following information:
– Visibility: “both”
– Required: “true”
4. These changes are applicable to all required HRIS fields listed in Table 9.2.

 In the succession data model, ensure visibility is set to value “both” and
required is set to “true”, as seen in the following example for the first name: 
<hris-field max-length=”128” id=”first-name” visibility=”both” and
required=”true”
6. Save the changes.
7. Go back to provisioning tool, and choose Import/Export Succession Data
Model, then select the Import radio button.
8. Browse for and upload the updated XML.
Corporate Data Model Configuration
Continuing with the data model configuration, you will now update the corporate
data model XML. The corporate data model update covers restricting the maxi-
mum length of the foundation field ID that can be handled by the API for
employee master data replication and cost center replication processes.
In the Succession Management section of the SuccessFactors Provisioning page,
perform the following steps:
1. Choose Import/Export Corporate Data Model, then select the Export radio
button.
2. Save the corporate data model XML file to your local machine, and make the
adjustments noted in the next step.
3. Open the XML file via the XML Editor tool, and edit the HRIS fields attribute
based on the following information:
 Max length of ID: This refers to the maximum length handled by the API.
Any field with a length set beyond the maximum length cannot be handled
by the middleware and will end with an error.
 Recommendation length: This is based on the SAP ERP field length. Addi-
tional code mapping is required in SAP ERP if you are using fields with exter-
nal code longer than the recommended characters. However, some fields
require mandatory code mapping in SAP ERP. Refer to Section 9.1.4 for fur-
ther details.
See Table 9.4 for the recommended field lengths for certain foundation objects.

4. Save the changes.
5. Go back to the SuccessFactors Provisioning page, and click on the Import/
Export Corporate Data Model link, then select the Import radio button.
6. Browse for and upload the updated XML.
Let’s now move on to configuring the picklists.
Picklist Configuration
In this step, you will define additional picklist information on an existing picklist
template. You will have to add an external code for all picklists used for the
employee master data replication scenario.
Prior to updating the picklist, there are some important points to consider:
 Make sure all codes are unique for their contexts; the external codes will be
replicated and mapped to SAP ERP.
 External codes need to be in CAPITAL LETTERS and/or numbers.
 External codes that are longer than 10 characters are cut off during replication;
only the first 10 characters are available for mapping in SAP ERP.
You are now ready to initiate the configuration. Perform the following steps:
1. To begin the picklist update, log on to Employee Central.
2. Go to Admin Tools  Company Setting  Picklist Management. Select Export
All picklists, and then click Submit to save them to your local machine. Open
the picklist.csv file, and update the external code for the relevant picklist (as
listed in Table 9.5 for the Employee Central integration with SAP ERP).

Once the picklist is updated, go back to Picklist Management. Select Import Pick-
list, and browse for the picklist.csv file. Click on Submit to complete the upload.
Role-Based Permissions Enhancement Configuration
We have almost completed the configuration setup required in Employee Central.
Now, let’s start updating the RBP for a SuccessFactors API role.
Go to Admin Tools  Set User Permissions  Manage Permissions Roles. In the
Permission Role list, select the permission roles that correspond to the HR
Administrator role, Employee Standard role, and SuccessFactor API role, and
update the user permissions accordingly (refer to Table 9.6).

Let’s switch gears altogether now and discuss configuration setup for the SAP ERP
side.
9.1.4
Step 3: SAP ERP Configuration
We will now discuss the necessary SAP ERP configurations steps required for set-
ting up the Employee Central integration with SAP ERP.
The two main tasks we will cover are refining the default logic of the work sched-
ule and refining the key mapping. Let’s begin.
Refine Default Logic of Work Schedule
As a note, this is an optional step. Only execute this step if you have decided to
use Employee Central Time Off for work schedule determination instead of the
default SAP ERP system setting in which the work schedule is determined
through table T508A’s match with the employee’s Employee Group (Employee
Subgroup Grouping) and the Personnel Area (Personnel Subarea Grouping).
To disable default logic for work schedule determination, go to Transaction
SM30. Maintain the entries as shown in Figure 9.19 in table/view V_T77S0, and
save the entry.

Refine Mapping
In this configuration task, you will define the key mapping of the organization
terms, mapping the code value list and wage type assignments to the infotype.
These mappings are important for the integration to work, because they act as the
functional translation key between Employee Central and SAP ERP.
Prior to maintaining the mappings, you must cross-check the picklist’s external
codes updated in the Employee Central configuration, as described in Section
9.1.3, because the Employee Central picklist external code will be replicated and
mapped to the SAP ERP code within the same context.
To maintain the mapping, access the menu path SAP IMG  Personnel Manage-
ment  Personnel Administration  Interfaces and Integration  Integration
of SAP ERP HR Master Data and SuccessFactors Employee Central. From
there, access the following areas:
 Assignment of Code Values  Define Mapping Code Value Lists
 Key Mapping of Organizational Terms  Assign Company Code Keys
 Key Mapping of Organizational Terms  Assign Place of Work Keys
 infotype Filtering  Filter Infotypes
Let’s take a closer look at each of the mapping activities and fill in the mapping
according to your integration setup between Employee Central and SAP ERP.
Let’s begin by looking at the key mapping of organizational terms.
Key Mapping of Organizational Terms
The following list examines the key mapping of organizational terms between
Employee Central and SAP ERP:
 Company Code 
For the company code, maintain the mapping between the organization unit
legal entity of Employee Central and the company code entity of SAP ERP. Click
on Assign Company Code Keys from the Integration of SAP ERP HR Master
Data and SuccessFactors Employee Central IMG menu path shown previ-
ously, and create a new entry, as indicated in Table 9.7. Then, save the entries
that have been created.

 Location 
The Employee Central location will be mapped to the SAP ERP Personnel Area
and Personnel Subarea. Click on Assign Place of Work Keys from the IMG
menu, and create a new entry as indicated in Table 9.8. Then, save the entries.
Mapping Code Value Lists
Under Assignment Code Value, click on the Define Mapping Code Value List
from the IMG menu, and create the following entries:
 Salutation 
This is an optional step. Create a new mapping entry if you have a different sal-
utation ID set up in Employee Central and SAP ERP. Then, create new entries
as indicated in Table 9.9.
 Marital Status 
This is an optional step. Create a new mapping entry if you have a different
marital status ID set up in Employee Central and SAP ERP. Create new entries
as indicated in Table 9.10.

Key Mapping of Organization Structure Items
Here, you maintain the mappings between the department/division/business
unit/job key setup in Employee Central and the organizational unit in SAP ERP.
Go to Transaction SM30 to maintain the customizing table SFIOM_KMAP_OSI.
Create new entries, as indicated in Table 9.20, and save the entries.
Infotype Mapping
Here, you will restrict the infotypes and subtypes being replicated in SAP ERP. If
no entries are defined, then all infotypes will be replicated. If you define one
country only, then that country will be replicated. All countries that require rep-
lication need to be specified.
Under Infotype Filtering, click on Filter Infotypes from the IMG menu, and
enter the fields as shown in Table 9.21.

Replication Employee Key Mapping Table
During the employee master data replication process, table PAOCFEC_EEKEY-
MAP in SAP ERP is updated with the employee key mapping between Employee
Central and SAP ERP for those employee master records that are successfully rep-
licated. This employee key mapping table is updated to avoid any duplicate
employee master record replication in SAP ERP.
To view table PAOCFEC_EEKEYMAP, use Transaction SE16.
You’ve now completed the Employee Central and SAP ERP configurations. Next,
let’s discuss the setup required for the middleware.
9.1.5
Step 4: Middleware Setup and Web Service Activation
This section describes the steps for configuring the Dell Boomi AtomSphere mid-
dleware. In addition, we will discuss the SAP ERP web service activation and ALE
distribution model for integrating cost center replication, employee data replica-
tion, employee data replication confirmation, and organizational data replication
scenarios between Employee Central and SAP ERP.
The basic setup steps are a prerequisite for configuring in this chapter. Therefore,
make sure the basic setup is completed before you proceed (see Section 9.1.2).

flag is activated to replicate the external cost center code to Employee Central.
This is useful if you do not want to maintain cost center mapping in SAP ERP,
because the same cost center external code that is assigned to employee job
information will be replicated from Employee Central to SAP ERP during the
employee data replication process.
Now, let’s discuss how to configure the web service for the employee data repli-
cation process in the SAP ERP system.
Employee Data Replication
This section will discuss the necessary steps for completing the employee data

sary configuration and technical steps required to implement the Employee
Central integration with SAP ERP using the Full Cloud HCM deployment model.
9.2
Employee Central to Payroll Integration
The Employee Central to SAP Payroll on-premise or Employee Central Payroll
integration allows customers to manage their employee master data in the cloud
or have the payroll run in-house. Because the data is maintained in two different
systems (Employee Central and either SAP Payroll or Employee Central Payroll),
the integration brings the two systems in sync by integrating cost center replica-
tion and employee master data replication processes.

Prerequisites
Prior to implementing Employee Central integration with SAP Payroll on-premise or
Employee Central Payroll, you will need to complete the following relevant configura-
tions:
 Employee Central has been set up in the latest version of SuccessFactors
 Dell Boomi AtomSphere has been set up
 Have SFSF Employee Central Integration Add-On (PA_SE_IN 100 SP1 and ODTFINCC
600) deployed and configured in SAP
 The following system minimum requirements:
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 15 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 08 EHP 2 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 05 EHP 3 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 05 EHP 4 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0/SAP NetWeaver 7.01 SPS 05 EHP 4 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 06 EHP 5 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 03 EHP 6 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 on SAP HANA SPS 01 EHP 6 or higher
 SAP ERP 6.0 ISS EHP 7 or higher
 HR Renewal 1.0 SPS 03 or higher
 Have relevant access to SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll with a sufficient autho-
rization role for the configuration activities in SAP IMG, SALE, web service configu-
ration, and background job scheduler, as well as access to SuccessFactors Provision-
ing and Administration pages
 IT network configuration is required to enable communication through firewalls
between Dell Boomi AtomSphere and SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll
In a typical integration scenario, the cost center replication process is set to run
first to replicate the cost center from Employee Central Payroll to Employee Cen-
tral for employee cost assignment purposes. The employee master data, together
with the cost center assignment, is then replicated from Employee Central to
Employee Central Payroll for payroll processing purposes. The Employee Central
Payroll system is not the truth source of the cost center. The cost center is always
distributed from the finance source system; it’s transferred from the finance sys-
tem to Employee Central Payroll prior to any replication process run.
We will use a case study example to demonstrate this process; a description of the
parameters that this integration will entail is presented next, including the client
scenario and an overview of the process steps.

9.2.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study focuses on how a customer who desires to implement Employee
Central will integrate and transfer employee data from Employee Central to on-
premise SAP Payroll or cloud-based Employee Central Payroll, using Dell Boomi
AtomSphere as the integration middleware. Also, the case study covers the cost
center integration between SAP Payroll on-premise or Employee Central Payroll
with Employee Central.
Specifically, we’ll discuss the implementation steps necessary for both Success-
Factors and SAP Payroll or Employee Central Payroll to implement the employee
data integration. We’ll use a client scenario to demonstrate our case. A snapshot
of our client is presented next.
Client Scenario
ABC Global Services has just implemented Employee Central and has selected
Employee Central Payroll to run its payroll operations.
Important Integration Notice
Please note that for this client scenario, ABC Global Services is implementing the
Employee Central integration with Employee Central Payroll. However, the technical
activities to set up the integration with SAP Payroll and Employee Central Payroll are
the same, so throughout this case study both on-premise SAP Payroll and cloud payroll
in Employee Central Payroll are being referred to.
At this point, ABC Global Services would like to implement the SuccessFactors
Employee Central integrations with Employee Central Payroll to ensure data con-
sistency between the two systems. To effectively integrate and transfer the cost
center, organizational, and employee data, the team recognizes that the technical
consultant will need to have a solid understanding of the basic settings of the
Employee Central integration with Employee Central Payroll, as well as the nec-
essary Integration Add-ons and system requirements to make the integration suc-
cessful. The biggest challenge will be to keep the systems and HR data in sync
between SuccessFactors and Employee Central Payroll.
To ensure that the integration is successful, there are certain business require-
ments that will guarantee a smooth transfer of data. For example, there needs to
be a single source of employee data from Employee Central and a single source of
cost center data.

Employee Central to Payroll Integration
9.2
321
To integrate and transfer data from Employee Central using Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere middleware, the following steps must be executed:
1. Prior to implementing Employee Central integration with SAP Payroll/
Employee Central Payroll using Dell Boomi AtomSphere as the integration
middleware, ensure that SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll has the latest
Integration Add-on deployed and configured. Also ensure that you have rele-
vant access to SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll with a sufficient authori-
zation role for all configuration activities.
2. Ensure that baseline integration configuration settings were made for SAP Pay-
roll/Employee Central Payroll as well as for Employee Central integration by
defining authorizations in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll to access the
new integration transactions.
3. For setting the middleware, ensure that the installation and configuration of
Dell Boomi AtomSphere was set as an integration point between SuccessFac-
tors and SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll.
Process Overview
There are four main steps required to implement the SuccessFactors Employee
Central integration with SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll:
 Step 1: Basic setup 
In this step, we’ll look at the basic system configuration necessary for integra-
tion with Employee Central to SAP Payroll and Employee Central Payroll. This
includes everything from creating a technical system user in SAP ERP to creat-
ing an RFC destination in SAP ERP (see Section 9.2.2).
 Step 2: SuccessFactors configuration 
This section discuss the SuccessFactors configuration setup necessary for the
integration with Employee Central Payroll and SAP Payroll on-premise. This
step also includes an Employee Files tab configuration specific to the integra-
tion of Employee Central Payroll and SAP Payroll (see Section 9.2.3).
 Step 3: SAP Payroll and Employee Central Payroll configuration 
This step revolves around the specific configuration tasks that must be com-
pleted within SAP Payroll and Employee Central Payroll. Remember, these
steps are the same whether integrating SAP Payroll or Employee Central Pay-
roll, unless specified otherwise (see Section 9.2.4).

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

322
 Step 4: Middleware setup and web service activation 
This step involves setting up the Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware and acti-
vating the web service for Employee Central Payroll and SAP Payroll. Similar to
the integration of Employee Central with SAP ERP, this step also involves cost
center replication, employee data replication, and employee data replication
response (see Section 9.2.5).
Let’s begin by looking at the basic setup involved with this integration.
9.2.2
Step 1: Basic Setup
There is a baseline integration configuration that is required for integrating
Employee Central and SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll. This baseline sys-
tem configuration covers settings in Employee Central, SAP Payroll/Employee
Central Payroll, and Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware.
The basic setup for this integration is comprised of the following tasks:
 Creating a technical system user in SAP ERP
 Enabling the web services SuccessFactors API
 Creating a SuccessFactors API user
 Configuring the SuccessFactors API user security
 Configuring the SuccessFactors API login exception
 Installing the integration pack in Dell Boomi AtomSphere
 Importing the SSL trusted CA certificate in SAP ERP
 Creating an RFC destination in SAP ERP
We’ll begin by creating an SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll technical user as
our first task.
Create a Technical System User in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll
First, define the authorization for the communication of the Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere middleware with SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll. To do this, you’ll
define the role by referring to standard role SAP_HR_PA_EC_EE_REPL, which com-
prises the authorizations that a user needs to run the employee data replication
process in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll system. You may use it as a tem-
plate to define an authorization that suits your requirements. Access Transaction
PFCG to begin defining a role.

Employee Central to Payroll Integration
9.2
323
Once you have defined the authorization, you can create a technical user by
assigning the role defined previously. Then, access Transaction SU01 to begin cre-
ating a technical user, with System as the User Type.
Enable Web Services SuccessFactors API
In this step, you will activate SuccessFactors Talent Solutions web services API
features.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Enable Web Services SuccessFactors
API.
Create a SuccessFactors API User
A SuccessFactors API user is required for Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware to
integrate with Employee Central. An API user must first be created in the Success-
Factors provisioning tool. The same API user logon credential is then stored in the
middleware credentials setting of the Dell Boomi AtomSphere environment setup.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Create a SuccessFactors API User.
Configure the SuccessFactors API User Security
In this step, you will configure the security RBP and group for the API user cre-
ated in the previous step. For detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Configure the
SuccessFactors API User Security.
SuccessFactors API Login Exception
In this step, you will configure the API login exception for the API user that was just
created. The purpose is to ensure that the password for the API user does not expire.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, SuccessFactors API Login Exception.
Install the Integration Pack in Dell Boomi AtomSphere
Next, you will setup the preconfigured integration pack in Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere. This integration pack contains the required integration mapping between
the Employee Central data fields and the corresponding fields of SAP Payroll/
Employee Central Payroll. Prior to the installation, you will have to create a sep-

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations
9
324
arate Dell Boomi AtomSphere atom and environment for the integration pack to
be able to deploy. For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Install the Integra-
tion Pack in Dell Boomi AtomSphere.
Two integration packs are part of the Employee Central to SAP Payroll/Employee
Central Payroll integration installation. The first installation is for the employee
master data replication scenario and the second installation is for the cost center
replication scenario.
The integration packs that should be downloaded for the Employee Central to
Employee Central Payroll integrations are as follows:
 iFlow EC to EC Payroll Employee Replication v2
 iFlow Solution: SAP ERP to EC Cost Center Replication 1308
SSL Trusted CA Certificate Import in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll
In this section you will enable the SSL connection between SAP Payroll/Employee
Central Payroll to Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware. Dell Boomi AtomSphere
SSL trusted CA certificates must be imported into SAP Payroll/Employee Central
Payroll via Transaction STRUST.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, SSL Trusted CA Certificate Import in
SAP ERP.
Create RFC Destination in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll
One last basic setting that must be completed is to create an RFC destination in SAP
Payroll/Employee Central Payroll for connecting Dell Boomi AtomSphere middle-
ware. This connection will be used by the cost center replication scenario. For
detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Create an RFC Destination in SAP ERP.
Now that the basic setup has been completed, let’s turn our attention to the
Employee Central configuration.
9.2.3
Step 2: Employee Central Configuration
Now, let’s discuss the necessary Employee Central configuration steps required
for setting up the Employee Central integration with SAP Payroll/Employee Cen-
tral Payroll.

Employee Central to Payroll Integration
9.2
325
This section covers the following tasks:
 Data model configuration
 Picklist configuration
 Employee Central Payroll-related configuration:
 Employee Files tab configuration
 Payroll configuration
 Creating payment methods
 RBP enhancement configuration
Let’s begin our discussion by defining the succession data model and corporate
data model.
Data Model Configurations
There are two data models to be updated: the succession data model and the cor-
porate data model.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.3, Data Model Configurations.
Picklist Configuration
In this step, you will define additional picklist information on the existing picklist
template. You will have to add external codes for all picklists that are used for the
employee master data replication scenario.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.3, Picklist Configuration. Prior to
updating the picklist, there are some important notes to consider:
 Make sure all codes are unique for their contexts; the external codes will be
replicated and mapped to SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll.
 External codes need to be in CAPITAL LETTERS and/or numbers.
 External codes that are longer than 10 characters are cut off during replication,
and only first 10 characters are available for mapping in the SAP Payroll/
Employee Central Payroll.
To begin the picklist update, log on to Employee Central. Then, perform the fol-
lowing steps:

1. Go to Admin Tools  Company Setting  Picklist Management. Select Export
All Picklists and Submit to save them to your local machine. Open the pick-
list.csv file and update the external code for the relevant picklist, as listed in
Table 9.42.
For example, you can update the external code for a picklist pay scale type, as
shown in Figure 9.25.
Figure 9.25  Picklist—External Code
2. Once the picklist is updated, go back to Picklist Management. Select Import
Picklist, and browse for the picklist.csv file. Click on Submit to complete the
upload.
Let’s move on to the next step, which will focus specifically on the Employee Cen-
tral Payroll-related configuration that must happen if you choose this payroll
method over the on-premise SAP Payroll option.

Employee Central Payroll-Related Configuration
Next, we will concentrate on the Employee Central Payroll-related configuration.
This is separate from the configuration and setup of SAP Payroll and should only
be employed if you plan on implementing Employee Central Payroll. We will
enable payroll information in the Employee File tab and set up the Employee Cen-
tral Payroll system-related information in the Employee Central and Employee
Central Payroll payment method setup.
Employee Files Tab Configuration
In this step, you enable the payroll information to appear in the Employee File
tab. Go to Admin Tool  Employee File  Configure Employee Files. Select the
Payroll checkbox, and save.
Set Up Payroll Configuration
To set up the payroll configuration for Employee Central Payroll, go to Admin
Tools  Payroll  Payroll Configuration. Under Create New, select Default
Portlets (see Figure 9.26), then select the countries that are in scope for payroll,
and save. In this case, set up the payroll configuration for the United States.
Figure 9.26  Default Portlets
Once the configuration is created, you´ll need to further configure the payroll set-
tings. From the same page, choose Search, and search for “payroll system config-
uration”. Choose the corresponding countries that are in scope for payroll, then
select Take Action  Make Correction. Finally, enter the details shown in Table
9.43, and save the changes (see also Figure 9.27).

Role-Based Permissions Enhancement Configurations
You have almost completed the payroll-related configuration in Employee Cen-
tral. Now, we have to update the RBPs for the HR Administrator role, Employee
Standard role, and SFAPI role to add additional roles for accessing payroll-related
processes.
Go to Admin Tools  Set User Permissions  Manage Permissions Roles. In the
Permission Role list, select the permission roles that corresponds to the HR
Administrator role, Employee Standard role, and SFAPI role, and update their
user permissions accordingly by referring to Table 9.45.
9.2.4
Step 3: SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll Configurations
Now, let’s proceed to the necessary SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll config-
uration steps required for setting up the Employee Central integration.
We will cover two main activities in this section, which include refining the
default logic of the work schedule and refining mapping.
Refine Default Logic of Work Schedule
This is an optional step. Only execute this step if you decide to use Employee Cen-
tral Time Off for work schedule determination. This would replace the use of the

default settings in Employee Central Payroll or the on-premise SAP Payroll sys-
tem, in which the work schedule is determined through table T508A match with
an employee’s Employee Group (Employee Subgroup Grouping) and the Person-
nel Area (Personnel Subarea Grouping).
For the detailed steps to disable the default logic for work schedule determina-
tion, refer to Section 9.1.4, Refine Default Logic of Work Schedule.
Refine Mapping
In this configuration activity, you will define the key mappings of organizational
terms, mapping code value lists, and wage type assignments to an infotype. These
mappings act as the functional translation keys between Employee Central and
SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll. Prior to maintaining the mappings, you
need to cross-check the picklist external codes updated in the Employee Central
configuration setup, because the Employee Central picklist external codes will be
replicated and mapped to the SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll code within
the same context.
Let’s take a closer look at each mapping activity and fill in the mappings accord-
ing to your integration setup between Employee Central and SAP Payroll/
Employee Central Payroll system.
Mapping activities for the following fields are covered in Section 9.1.4, Refining
Mapping: company code, location, salutation, marital status, address type,
employee class, job classification, events, event reason, work schedule, state,
department, division, business unit, and infotype mappings.
Additional key mappings required for integration with SAP Payroll/Employee
Central Payroll are as follows:
 Pay Group

Replication Employee Key Mapping Table
During the employee master data replication process, table PAOCFEC_EEKEY-
MAP is updated with employee key mapping between Employee Central and SAP
Payroll/Employee Central Payroll for those employee master records that are suc-
cessfully replicated. This employee key mapping table is updated to avoid any
duplicate employee master record replication in the SAP Payroll/Employee Cen-
tral Payroll systems. This same table is useful to keep your employee master
records in sync within your system landscape if you plan to replicate the same
employee master record set from Employee Central to your SAP Finance system.
You can transfer this table from SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll to your
SAP Finance system to avoid having any existing employee created with a differ-
ent personnel number in the SAP Finance system. To view table PAOCFEC_
EEKEYMAP, use Transaction SE16.

Now that we’ve completed the SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll configura-
tions, let’s discuss the setup required for the middleware.
9.2.5
Step 4: Middleware Setup and Web Service Activation
This section describes the necessary steps for configuring Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere middleware, SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll web service activa-
tion, and configuring the ALE distribution model for integrating cost center rep-
lication, employee data replication, and employee data replication confirmation
scenarios between Employee Central and SAP Payroll/Employee Central Pay-
roll.
See Section 9.2.2 for the basic setup that needs to be completed prior to this con-
figuration. We will walk through the configuration based on each integration sce-
nario.
The following tasks are required to set up the middleware and web service acti-
vation:
 Cost center replication
 Employee data replication
 Employee data replication response
Let’s start with the cost center replication, then employee data replication, fol-
lowed by the employee data replication confirmation scenario.
Cost Center Replication
This step covers the cost center distribution in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Pay-
roll system. This process is similar to steps we’ve already taken in this chapter.
Therefore, for the detailed steps of this process, please refer to Section 9.1.5, Cost
Center Replication.
Employee Data Replication
This step covers the configuration of the web service for the employee data repli-
cation process in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll system. This process is
similar to steps we’ve already taken in this chapter. Therefore, for detailed steps
of this process, please refer to Section 9.1.5, Employee Data Replication.

Employee Data Replication Response
This step covers the configuration of the web service for the employee data repli-
cation response process in SAP Payroll/Employee Central Payroll. This process is
similar to steps we’ve already taken in this chapter. Therefore, for the detailed
steps of this process, please refer to Section 9.1.5, Employee Data Replication
Response.
In this case study, along with the ABC Global Services example provided, we
detailed the necessary configuration and technical steps required to implement
the Employee Central integration with SAP Payroll on-premise or Employee Cen-
tral Payroll using the Full Cloud HCM deployment model. The goal of this case
study was to highlight the necessary steps that you can follow to implement
Employee Central integration with payroll, be it on-premise SAP Payroll or
Employee Central Payroll in the cloud.
In the next section, we will discuss how to integrate Employee Central with a
third-party system: Kronos Time Management.
9.3
Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
Kronos Workforce Central software provides complete automation for workforce
management functions and processes around time and attendance, scheduling,
absence management, human resources, payroll, hiring, and labor analytics. Kro-
nos Workforce Central receives information from employee administration (core
HR) systems such as Employee Central and uses that information for time and
attendance management purposes. SAP provides a packaged implementation
product built on the Dell Boomi AtomSphere platform to support the integration
of employee master data from Employee Central to Kronos Time Management.
Kronos Time Management is a time, attendance, and labor management solution.
Kronos Time Management also provides companies with a cloud-based solution to
manage their employees’ and contractors’ time- and labor-related information.
Kronos Time Management sends periodic updates to employee administration and
payroll systems that require time data for legal reporting and payroll processing.
Employee data is extracted from Employee Central and sent to Kronos Time Man-
agement periodically. When the integration middleware extracts the data, it maps
and reformats the employee data to a Kronos format, then sends the employee

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
9.3
335
data to Kronos Time Management, which then accepts the data and populates
necessary systems.
Employees enter time- and attendance-related data in Kronos Time Management,
which then makes such time data available. This data is captured by the integra-
tion middleware technology, Dell Boomi AtomSphere, and provided to Employee
Central Payroll, which uses the information for payroll purposes.
In this section, we will cover the implementation steps needed in integrating
Employee Central with Kronos Time Management using standard best practices.
Figure 9.28 displays this integration via middleware in action.
Figure 9.28  Employee Central Integration with Kronos Time Management
Prerequisites
Prior to the Employee Central integration with Kronos Time Management, you will need
to ensure that the following relevant configurations and customizations have been com-
pleted:
 Obtain licensing to use Kronos Time Management
 Configure Kronos Time Management to build an employee master table and subse-
quent time management configuration to record and evaluate time data
 Obtain Dell Boomi AtomSphere integration middleware, licensed along with Employee
Central
 Complete necessary configurations for Employee Central

The following key pieces of Employee Central master data configuration will need to
be completed by the configuration team prior to commencement of the integration
project:
 Personal information
 Employment information
 Job information
 Email information
 Phone information
 Pay component recurring
This information is needed by the Kronos Workforce Central system in order to allow
time data entry and evaluate time. Employee master data tables within Kronos Time
Management will need to be configured to receive and process this data from Employee
Central.
SAP and Kronos have partnered to deliver packaged integration content that will
integrate data between Employee Central core HR and Kronos Time Manage-
ment. The delivered integration content consists of three integration options,
which can be implemented independently of one another:
 Employee Central to Kronos Time Management employee data replication 
This is used to replicate employee master data relevant for time management.
 Kronos to Employee Central Payroll 
This is used to transfer evaluated time data from Kronos Time Management to
SAP infotypes via an IDoc.
 User Interface Integration via Single Sign- On 
This allows users to seamlessly access Kronos Time Management from within
Employee Central.
This case study will focus on the Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
integration using the standard integration template. Ahead is a description of the
parameters that this integration will entail, including the client scenario and an
overview of the process steps.
9.3.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study focuses on how a customer can integrate its current Employee
Central system with Kronos Time Management to manage its employees’ and

contractors’ time- and labor-related information using Dell Boomi AtomSphere as
the integration middleware.
Specifically, we’ll discuss the prerequisites and steps necessary to implement the
Employee Central to Kronos Time Management packaged integrations and the HR
master data replication process that will help keep the company’s data in sync
between both systems.
We’ll use a client scenario to demonstrate our case. A snapshot of our client is
presented next.
Client Scenario
ABC Global Services is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has operations sites
across the United States —with over 5,000 employees in North America. The com-
pany currently uses SAP ERP to support its financials, sales and distribution, and
materials management functions and uses Employee Central as its core HR system.
ABC Global Services has implemented the Kronos Workforce Central Time and
Attendance, Workforce Scheduling, and Absence Management, and parts of the
Labor Analytics modules, for most of its North American manufacturing loca-
tions. Kronos Workforce Central requires employee master data from Employee
Central, and employees hired in Employee Central will need to be transferred to
Kronos Time Management; similarly, employees transferred or terminated will
have to be transmitted to Kronos Time Management. Therefore, it is imperative
that the employee master data is kept in sync in both systems.
At this point, ABC Global Services would like to integrate its current core HR sys-
tem, Employee Central, with Kronos Time Management, using the Dell Boomi
AtomSphere cloud integration platform, which requires a knowledgeable Dell
Boomi AtomSphere integration resource in order to implement and customize the
packaged integrations.
Now, let’s discuss how you can achieve a successful integration between Employee
Central and Kronos Time Management, using Dell Boomi AtomSphere as your
integration middleware. We’ll begin with an overview of the process.
Process Overview
In order to properly set up the Kronos Time Management packaged integration,
the following steps must be taken:

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations
9
338
 Step 1: SuccessFactors configuration 
In this section, we will discuss the basic configuration steps required for setting
up the employee data integration between Employee Central and the third-
party Kronos Time Management system. This involves such steps as enabling
web services for SuccessFactors API, creating a SuccessFactors API user, and
more (see Section 9.3.2).
 Step 2: Employee replication process setup for Employee Central to Kronos
Time Management integration 
In this section, we’ll look at an overview of the employee replication process
for the integration of Employee Central with Kronos (see Section 9.3.3).
 Step 3: Customize and deploy the Employee Central to Kronos Time Manage-
ment packaged integrations 
In this section, we will discuss the key steps that need to be taken in order to
customize and deploy the Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
packaged integrations. Some of these steps include configuring the connections
settings, field mapping review and setup, reviewing map functions, reviewing
cross-reference tables, and more (see Section 9.3.4).
Let’s begin by looking at the basic configuration of this integration.
9.3.2
Step 1: SuccessFactors Configuration
The following activities describe the necessary SuccessFactors configuration steps
required for setting up the employee data integration with Employee Central and
other third-party systems, like Kronos Time Management.
The basic configuration for this integration is comprised of the following tasks:
 Enabling web services SuccessFactors API
 Creating a SuccessFactors API User
 Configuring the SuccessFactors API user security
 Configuring SuccessFactors API login exceptions
 Downloading the packaged content for Employee Central to Kronos Time Man-
agement integration
Settings Configuration
These settings should be completed by the Employee Central functional consultant.

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
9.3
339
We’ll begin by enabling the web services SuccessFactors API.
Enable Web Services SuccessFactors API
In this step, you will activate Employee Central web services and SuccessFactors
API features needed for implementing integrations to and from Employee Cen-
tral. For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Enable Web Services Success-
Factors API.
Next, we’ll talk about how to create a SuccessFactors API user and assign RBP.
Create a SuccessFactors API User
A SuccessFactors API user is required for Dell Boomi AtomSphere middleware to
integrate with Employee Central. The API user must first be created in the Suc-
cessFactors provisioning tool. The same API user logon credential is then stored
in the middleware credentials setting of the Dell Boomi Atomsphere environ-
ment setup. For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Create a SuccessFactors
API User.
Now, let’s focus on setting up the API user security.
Configure the SuccessFactors API User Security
In this step, you will configure the security RBP and group for the API user cre-
ated in the previous step. For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, Configure
the SuccessFactors API User Security.
The following key permissions should be selected by checking the related check-
boxes in order to set up integration access for the API user:
 General User Permission
 User Login
 Live Profile Access
 SFAPI User Login
 Manage System Properties
 Picklist Management and Picklists Mappings Set Up

9.3
341
SuccessFactors API Login Exception
In this step, you will configure the API login exception for the API user just cre-
ated. The purpose is to ensure that the password for the API user does not expire.
For the detailed steps, refer to Section 9.1.2, SuccessFactors API Login Exception.
Download the Packaged Content

The Kronos Time Management integration package content has now been success-
fully downloaded into the ABC Global Services account within the Dell Boomi
AtomSphere integration middleware tool. The standard content is delivered as a
template that can be customized to suit your company’s specific requirements.
Mapping tables and logic are normally customer-specific, and this package can be
customized as needed while using the delivered content as a guideline. You are now
ready to customize the packaged integration to suit your specific requirements.
Now, let’s move on to the employee data replication integration process between
Employee Central and Kronos Time Management.
9.3.3
Step 2: Overview of the Employee Data Replication Process
The replication of employee data from Employee Central to Kronos Time Man-
agement is comprised of the following steps:
1.
The interface is scheduled to run, typically on a daily basis. The interface
extracts employee data from Employee Central as of the previous run.
2.
The extracted data is mapped to and conforms to a WSDL (Web Services
Description Language) published by Kronos.

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations
9
346
3. Dell Boomi AtomSphere calls the web service and sends the employee data to
Kronos Time Management.
4. Once data is received, employee import processing occurs within Kronos Time
Management.
This job runs on a daily basis and extracts changes only from the last successful
run date and time, which is stored within the Dell Boomi AtomSphere process as
a variable. The Dell Boomi AtomSphere process calls the compound employee
API to extract employee data from Employee Central in the form of a hierarchi-
cally structured XML response.
The compound employee API extracts data from the following Employee Central
portlets:
 Personal information
 Employment information
 Job information
 Email information
 Phone information
 Pay component recurring
The data received within the XML is then mapped and transformed into Kronos
fields using map functions and cross-reference tables as part of the processing
steps within Dell Boomi AtomSphere. It is then presented in a CSV file format as
prescribed by Kronos.
The process is designed to output two files: Person_import.txt and Costcenter_
import.txt.
The output file format for the Person_import.txt file has been detailed in a field
mapping Table 9.51 which captures the source Employee Central fields and maps
them to target fields in Kronos Time Managment; any data transformation
requirements are also captured within the mapping table.
In this case study for ABC Global Services, we will focus on the employee data rep-
lication file (Person_import.txt), because cost centers will be directly sent over
from SAP ERP to Kronos Time Management via a feed from SAP ERP. Hence, we
will customize the implementation by disabling the process to generate a cost cen-
ter file from Employee Central to Kronos Time Management via this integration.

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
9.3
347
The overall process starts with the extraction of employee data from Employee
Central followed by field mapping and data translations that produce an output
file in the required format. This is depicted in the process flow diagram in Figure
9.37. The main process is split into many subprocesses that are required in order
to complete the integration. The main subprocesses include the following:
 Identification of the last successful run date and time and persisting the last suc-
cessful run date/time throughout the process
 Deciding whether a cost center file is needed and subsequent processing or
ending of the subprocess for the cost center file
 Compounding an employee query to extract employee data and subsequent
processing to produce the output file in the prescribed format

348
The steps needed to customize the integration process for the current case study
are discussed in the following sections.
9.3.4
Step 3: Customize and Deploy the Packaged Integration
In the previous sections, we have seen the process of downloading a prepackaged
implementation and the prerequisites required to enable the integration with
Kronos Time Management. In this section, we will review some configuration
steps and customization opportunities for our implementation of this integration.
The steps will broadly consist of the following:
 Configuring the connections settings
 Reviewing field mappings and setup
 Reviewing map functions
 Reviewing cross-reference tables
 Specifying process properties
 Setting up the Dell Boomi AtomSphere environment and atom
 Deploy the process
 Executing the process
The current version of the Employee Central to Kronos Time Management pack-
aged integration is delivered for the United States, but it can be used for any
country with minor adjustments as needed. The integration is designed to run for
one country at a time. Another limitation of this integration is that it is not built
to support future-dated transactions. Therefore, if future-dated transactions need
to be sent across, then additional coding or customization will be needed.
We will now go over each of the steps to enable and customize this integration.
Configure the Connection Settings
In this step, you will configure the parameters for the SuccessFactors API via the
following steps:
1. In Dell Boomi AtomSphere, open the Build tab.
2. Within the Component Explorer, navigate to the Packaged Integration Con-
tent folder. Open the Connectors folder, then follow the menu path Success-

Add the following settings for the Employee Central to Kronos Time Manage-
ment SuccessFactors API web service connections:
 Endpoint: The endpoints of the API–SuccessFactors data center
 Company ID: The company ID of the Employee Central instance
 Username: The SuccessFactors API username (the SuccessFactors API user
used to query data from Employee Central was configured in a previous step
for example SAP_API_USER)
 Password: The SuccessFactors API user password

3. Next, configure the Kronos Time Management SFTP settings. Click on the
Build tab. Within the Component Explorer, navigate to the Packaged Inte-
gration Content folder. From here, open the Connectors folder, and follow
the menu path SFTP  Connections  EC KRONOS SFTP File Server (see Figure
9.39). Then, add the following settings for the Employee Central to Kronos

Map Functions
Map functions are used to capture any translation or transformation logic require-
ments. In Table 9.51, some fields have been defined as those that require trans-
formation. Transformations can be accomplished by using a map function or a
cross-reference table.
Map functions have been defined for Middle Initial. Employee Central captures
the middle name as a field value. We will use a right-justified trim function on the
field value to remove all characters except the first one. In this way, the first char-
acter of the Middle Name field of Employee Central is mapped to the Middle Ini-
tial field in Kronos Workforce Central.
This is an example of a map function that is relevant for ABC Global Services’ con-
figuration. Map functions can be created for any field, depending upon source
and target field configuration and customer-specific requirements.
Another method of data transformation is the use of translations or cross-refer-
ence tables.
Cross-Reference Tables
Cross-reference tables have been defined to transform the following Employee
Central fields into the corresponding values in Kronos Workforce Central:
 Employment Status 
The cross-reference table for mapping Employment Status values in Employee
Central to those in Kronos Time Management is shown in Figure 9.41.

 Pay Rule 
The cross-reference table for mapping pay rules in Kronos Time Manage-
ment to full- or part-time status values in Employee Central is shown in Fig-
ure 9.42.
Figure 9.42  Dell Boomi AtomSphere Cross-Reference Tables—Pay Rules
 Timezone Codes 
The cross-reference table for mapping timezone codes is shown in Table
9.43.
Figure 9.43  Dell Boomi AtomSphere Cross-Reference Tables—Time Zone Codes
 Address Mapping by Country 
Address fields tend to change with each country. The cross-reference table for
address field formats for each country’s values in Employee Central is shown in
Figure 9.44.

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management

Figure 9.44  Dell Boomi AtomSphere Cross-Reference Tables—Country Address Field Mapping
Additional field maps or map functions can be defined in a similar way.
Now, let’s move on to setting the process properties needed for the integration.
Specify Process Properties
Process properties can be found as an option within the Component Explorer.
Process properties are used to specify processing parameters or conditions. The
Employee Central packaged integration comes delivered with two process prop-
erties that allow you to define data filters and general settings for the integration:
 Employee Filter Criteria 
The Employee Filter Criteria allows selecting the type of employee to be sent
across to Kronos Time Management. Each criteria can be selected, and the val-
ues relevant for selection can be specified in this step (see Figure 9.45).
Figure 9.45  Dell Boomi AtomSphere Process Properties—Employee Filters

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

358
 General Settings 
General Settings allows you to define settings such as the Kronos SFTP Direc-
tory and whether the cost center file is required to be generated. In this case,
choose not to generate the cost center extract as part of this integration.
As shown Figure 9.46, select the Avoid generation of Cost Center File
option in order to restrict your processing and output to the single person
file.
Figure 9.46  Dell Boomi AtomSphere Process Properties—General Settings
As you can see from the preceding examples, map functions and cross-reference
tables can be configured or built for any field within the map. You can also use
process properties to set employee filters or to specify SFTP locations or process-
ing parameters for each interface run.
You will now deploy your enhanced integration in order to test it.
Set Up the Dell Boomi AtomSphere Environment and Atom
Upon completion of the initial development of the integration, you will need to
deploy the integration to an atom that is connected to an Employee Central
instance from which data will need to be extracted.
The deployment process will consist of first creating an environment for the
implementation and then attaching an atom to it; this will be a one-time activity

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
9.3
359
for each environment and is generally performed by the Dell Boomi AtomSphere
administrator.
Perform the following steps:
1. Environments and atoms are managed from within the Manage tab in Dell
Boomi AtomSphere; click on Manage, and access the Atom Management
functionality (see Figure 9.47).
Figure 9.47  Dell Boomi AtomSphere Atom Management
2. Environments can be added by clicking on the Add Environment (+) button
and specifying properties for the environment (see Figure 9.48).
Figure 9.48  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Creating an Environment
3. Atoms are typically created by the Dell Boomi AtomSphere administrator;
these atoms will then be attached to an environment. In this example, the atom
for ABC Global Services has been created (see Figure 9.49).
4. Attach the atom to your environment by moving it from the Unattached
Atoms section on the right to the Attached Atoms section on the left via the
<< button (see Figure 9.50).

Figure 9.49  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Set Atom Properties
Figure 9.50  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Set Environment Properties
5. Assign roles to the atom by selecting the Roles tab and moving the required
roles from the right to the left using the << button. For this example, select the
Standard User role (see Figure 9.51).

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management

361
Figure 9.51  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Set Environment Properties, Assign Roles
You are now ready to deploy the Kronos Time Management packaged integration
to your atom.
Deploy the Process Integration
Next, you will deploy the process integration. Perform the following steps:
1. Click on the Deploy tab on the header, and then select the main process. It is
sufficient to select the main process; all subprocesses within the main process
are automatically deployed as part of the deployment of the main process (see
Figure 9.52).
Figure 9.52  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

362
2. Enter comments to indicate the version of the deployment and key changes
made to the process via this deployment (see Figure 9.53).
Process
Each process may undergo multiple deployments during the testing and bug resolution
phases.
Figure 9.53  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process Confirmation
3. Upon the successful completion of the deployment step, the deployed process
will appear in the Deployed Processes window at the right side of the pane.
4. Check the environment extensions to identify the source and target systems for
the environment. From the Manage tab, click on your environment, and then
select the Environment Extensions option on the right (see Figure 9.54).
Figure 9.54  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Environment Properties
The Environment Extensions option allows you to customize or adapt process-
specific properties for each deployed environment and enables you to apply vari-
ations per environment.

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
9.3
363
Please note that the settings made here pertain to the deployment within this
environment only. The settings here allow you to point to specific environments
or SFTP servers, or to test with specific employee filter criteria. They settings are
generic and default in nature, whereas settings made within extensions when a
process is deployed to a specific environment affect and influence that deploy-
ment or process runs within that environment only.
Options available for each environment include the following:
 Connection settings
 Dynamic process properties
 Process properties
 Cross-reference tables
 PGP
 Data maps
We will now go over each extension to review the options available.
Connection Settings
Here, you set the endpoints for each of the connections available. The endpoint
for EC Kronos—SFAPI Web Service (under Connection) is set to point to the
Employee Central instance from which data will be extracted. You can specify the
SuccessFactors API user and password setting as well (see Figure 9.55).
Figure 9.55  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Connection Settings, 
SuccessFactors API Web Service Endpoints

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

364
The end point for Employee Central Kronos—SFTP File Server (under Connec-
tion) is set to point to the Kronos Time Management file server to which the data
files will be sent. You can specify the server user ID and password as well (see Fig-
ure 9.56).
Figure 9.56  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Connection Settings, 
File Server
Dynamic Process Properties
Here, you will set the properties that will vary dynamically for each run of the
interface. The property to be set is KR_LAST_MODIFIED ON.
This property will be set manually for the first run to a date such as 01/01/1900.
The first run of the interface is expected to set the baseline in the Kronos Time
Management system and will include all historical records.
Subsequently, after the first run is complete and the baseline established within
Kronos Time Management, you will return to this setting to remove the data
entered here. Leaving this setting blank will allow the system to dynamically
populate the last successful run after each run of the interface (see Figure
9.57).

365
Figure 9.57  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Dynamic Process Properties
Process Properties
In Process Properties, you can enter values for the following:
 General Settings 
Within the General Settings, specify the SFTP directory and SFTP certificates
and identify if you will be passing cost center information to Kronos Time Man-
agement via this interface. In this case, you will not be sending cost center
information to Kronos Time Management and hence will select the Avoid Gen-
eration of Cost Center File checkbox (see Figure 9.58).
Figure 9.58  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Process Properties

366
 Employee Filter Criteria 
Employee Filter Criteria allows you to define filters to extract employee data.
The following options are available to filter employees as part of the delivered
package:
 pay_group
 employee_class
 location
 company
 company_territory_code (Country)
In this case, set the Country filter to the USA, and leave the other filters blank
(see Figure 9.59).
Figure 9.59  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Process Properties, 
Filter Criteria

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management

367
 Cross Reference 
This property allows you to override the cross-reference table values set within
the process for this environment. This setting will only be needed if a cross-ref-
erence table value is different for this environment, which could possibly occur
if configurations have been updated in development or testing but not made it
to production (see Figure 9.60).
Figure 9.60  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Cross-Reference Tables
When selected, the Override checkbox indicates that the values specified here
must be referenced by the interface.
 PGP 
The PGP setting allows you to specify the PGP keys needed for cases of data
encryption cases (see Figure 9.61).
Figure 9.61  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, PGP Key Settings

Implementing the Full Cloud HCM Integrations

368
 Data Maps 
The Data Maps extension allows you to specify a different mapping than what
exists within the main process. This property would normally not be set here
(see Figure 9.62).
Figure 9.62  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Deploy Process, Extensions, Data Maps
You have now specified all the properties and filter criteria for your integration
and are ready to execute this interface for testing.
Execute the Process
You have completed your development and deployed the integration to your test
atom. You have updated the extensions and identified the source and target sys-
tems. You have also updated the properties to identify employee data filters to be
applied.
Now, you’re ready to execute the interface. Navigate to the Manage tab and
select your atom. Then, go to the Deployed Processes section, right-click on your
process, and select the Execute Process option (see Figure 9.63).

Employee Central to Kronos Time Management
9.3
369
Figure 9.63  Dell Boomi AtomSphere—Process Execution
This action will trigger the execution of the process within Dell Boomi Atom-
Sphere. The API will extract data out of the source Employee Central instance,
apply filters that have been set within the properties, map and transform the data,
and then produce an output file, which is posted to the Kronos SFTP server, as
specified within the environment extensions. You then review the output files
and error logs to monitor fields that are required and test for field mapping and
mapping logic.
Then, continue to test multiple runs for various scenarios, and execute a complete
end-to-end system test in which data from Employee Central updates Kronos
Wokforce Central and time evaluation is executed within Kronos Time Manag-
ment.
In this case study, we discussed the Employee Central integration with Kronos
Time Management, using the Dell Boomi AtomSphere cloud integration plat-
form. The goal of this case study was to highlight the necessary steps that need
to be followed to implement the Employee Central integrations with Kronos
Time Management by downloading and adapting the SAP-delivered packaged
integration.

Summary
This chapter detailed the necessary configuration and technical steps required to
implement the Full Cloud HCM packaged integrations. In our first case study, we
looked at the Employee Central to SAP ERP integration. Then, we looked at inte-
grating Employee Central with payroll and the similar steps involved in integrat-
ing SAP Payroll and Employee Central Payroll with Employee Central while also
identifying where the processes diverged. Finally, we looked at the integration
of Employee Central with third-party applications, using the example of Kronos
Time Management to guide us.
The next chapter will showcase a few case studies for the Talent Hybrid deploy-
ment model using concepts discussed in Chapter 8 and APIs from Chapter 6. Tal-
ent Hybrid deployments can be implemented by exporting data into files from
SAP ERP HCM in the format needed by SuccessFactors Talent Management mod-
ules and scheduling imports discussed in this chapter. Data can also be exchanged
to support business processes through a middleware platform. The case studies in
the next chapter use the latter mechanism for implementing Talent Hybrid pack-
aged integrations.

371
 
In this chapter, we will look at individual case studies for implementing 
the Talent Hybrid integrations. Through step-by-step instructions and 
practical application, you will be able to grasp these implementation 
processes.
10
Implementing the Talent 
Hybrid Integrations
Once the Talent Hybrid deployment model is implemented, you can integrate
individual SuccessFactors modules. SuccessFactors Talent Management solutions
in the cloud can be integrated easily with SAP ERP HCM with the standard inte-
gration solutions for employee data, compensation, and recruiting processes
using the SAP Process Integration (SAP PI) middleware tool. In addition, a single
point of entry for the end users can be established by achieving Single Sign-On
(SSO) between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors.
Target Audience
The perfect candidates for the Talent Hybrid deployment model are existing SAP cus-
tomers who utilize the SAP ERP HCM module to maintain core HR processes, such as
organizational management and personnel administration, in their on-premise land-
scapes. For more information, see Chapter 4.
The following sections provide detailed, step-by-step case studies based on SAP
best practices of how the standard process integration scenarios can be imple-
mented to complete the integration between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors
using SAP PI for the following tasks:
 Implementation steps necessary to configure SAP PI to support particular inte-
gration scenarios (see Section 10.1)
 Employee data integration (see Section 10.2)
 Compensation process integration (see Section 10.3)

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
372
 Recruiting process integration (see Section 10.4)
 User authentication integration (see Section 10.5)
By following the integration steps that are provided within each of the cases stud-
ies, you will be guided through how to integrate and transfer data from SAP ERP
HCM to SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions, using SAP PI on-premise
as the integration middleware. 
Let’s first begin by discussing the SAP PI integration steps involved.
10.1
Integration of SAP Process Integration
To begin the different integration scenarios of employee data, compensation, and
recruiting, you’ll first need to implement SAP PI to support these integrations.
This section provides a case study that discusses the integration steps involved in
implementing SAP PI.
Prerequisites
Prior to implementing SAP PI, you will need to check for and implement, if required, the
following configurations:
 Have SAP PI 7.0 (at a minimum) or above running in your system landscape envi-
ronment.
 Have the AXIS framework component deployed. The Integration Add-on solution in
SAP PI uses the AXIS framework in the SOAP adapter for communicating with the
SuccessFactors web services API. The AXIS framework component is not in the SAP
PI standard installation. Refer to SAP Note 1039369 (FAQ XI Axis Adapter) for the
component deployment guide.
Let’s begin by looking at the case study parameters and client involved.
10.1.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study focuses on how a customer, who plans to set up SuccessFactors
Talent Management Solutions to integrate with an existing SAP ERP HCM system,
will implement SAP PI on-premise as the integration middleware. Specifically,
we’ll discuss the system requirements and implementation steps necessary to set

Integration of SAP Process Integration
10.1
373
up SAP PI. We’ll use a client scenario to demonstrate our case to begin and then
will look at the steps involved in the integration.
Client Scenario
MedTron Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, and has manufacturing
sites across the United States and Canada—with over 3,000 employees in North
America. Their presales team successfully sold the technical capabilities of inte-
grating SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions with SAP ERP HCM, using
SAP PI as the integration middleware.
At this point, MedTron would like to implement SAP PI as the integration soft-
ware for the following benefits:
 Automatic updating of HR data between two different systems to reduce data
entry and errors
 Stable middleware-based data exchange with standard web services usage
 Secure data transfer with standardized security protocols
Once the SAP PI middleware is set up, MedTron will be able to implement the
Talent Hybrid integration between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors. The imple-
mentation of SAP PI is a prerequisite to enable employee data integration, com-
pensation process integration, and recruiting process integration. MedTron will
begin with the Performance Management module. In the future, the Talent Man-
agement Roadmap, which includes SuccessFactors Compensation, will be imple-
mented in phase 2, followed by the Succession Planning module implementation
in phase 3, and finally the Recruiting module in the phase 4 implementation work.
MedTron’s existing IT footprint includes SAP ERP HCM ECC 6.0 EHP 6. MedTron
currently runs Organizational Management (OM) and PA (Personnel Administra-
tion) in SAP. In addition, they also use SAP PI version 7.4 Java stack.
Process Overview
To set up the SAP PI middleware, follow these steps:
 Step 1: Basic setup 
In this step, you’ll look at the basic system configuration necessary for integration
with SuccessFactors, with settings covered in both SAP PI and SAP ERP HCM
(see Section 10.1.2).

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
374
 Step 2: SAP ERP HCM integration setup 
This step covers the settings for the middleware you need to implement for SAP
ERP HCM (see Section 10.1.3).
 Step 3: SAP PI Integration Directory configuration 
This step describes the set up and configuration of the SAP PI Integration Direc-
tory. This will be used in relation to the different integration scenarios dis-
cussed later in the chapter (see Section 10.1.4).
 Step 4: Creating communication channels 
In this step, you will create the integration channels shared by the employee
data, compensation data, and recruiting data transfer (see Section 10.1.5).
 Step 5: Creating the integration scenarios 
This step will help you create the integration scenarios for three of your inte-
grations: employee data, compensation, and recruiting (see Section 10.1.6).
Important
Some Integration Add-on support package releases require specific versions of SAP PI to
be installed, so you will need to check this in the release.
The following sections detail each of the processes in the preceding list.
10.1.2
Step 1: Basic Setup
This section describes the system configuration that is needed for SAP SuccessFac-
tors integration, regardless of the scenario (such as employee data, compensation
process, and recruiting process integration; see Section 10.1.6). The system con-
figuration covers settings in SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI.
You will need knowledge of SAP Basis and SAP PI administration to perform the
following system configuration tasks.
SAP PI Enterprise Services Repository Design Content Deployment
The following steps explain how to download and import objects for the SAP PI
Enterprise Services Repository. In this step, the design object is delivered by SAP
as part of the SuccessFactors Integration Add-on.

Integration of SAP Process Integration

To download the design content, follow these steps:
1. Find the ESR content on the SAP Service Marketplace. Navigate to http://ser-
vice.sap.com/swdc, and then go to SAP Software Download Center  Support
Packages and Patches  Browse our Download Catalog  SAP Content 
ESR Content (XI Content).
2. Select XI Content SFIHCM01 for implementing the Integration Add-on 1.0,
which enables the employee data and compensation data integration scenarios.
Or, select both XI Content SFIHCM01 and XI Content SFIHCM02 for imple-
menting Integration Add-on 2.0 to enable the recruiting data integration sce-
nario.
3. Click on the #Database independent link to select the Integration Add-on sup-
port package level. Determine the desired support package level to use, and
then download the XI content as a ZIP file.
4. Unzip the file. You should see a TPZ file in the unzipped folder.
Now that you have downloaded the content, you will want to import it. Complete
the following steps to import the design content:
1. Open the SAP PI landing page by accessing the following URL: http://<pi_host-
name>:<pi_http_port>/dir.
2. Open the Enterprise Services Builder tool within the Enterprise Service Repos-
itory by clicking on the Enterprise Services Builder link.
3. Navigate to the top menu, and click Tools  Import Design Objects in the
Enterprise Services Repository.
4. Select Client as the import source.
5. Select the XI content TPZ file downloaded in the earlier step, then click Import.
Select Import again when a warning message appears.
6. Once imported successfully, the new software component SFIHCM01 600 or
both SFIHCM01 600 and SFIHCM02 600 should appear in the Enterprise Ser-
vices Repository design objects list.
This completes your first task of step 1, downloading and importing objects for
the SAP PI Enterprise Service Repository.
Now, let’s move on to the next task in this step, which covers setting up the RFC
destinations to connect SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
376
Set Up Connectivity between SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI
In the following steps, you will set up the RFC destinations in SAP ERP HCM to
connect with SAP PI. The SuccessFactors Integration Add-on uses an ABAP proxy
runtime interface for exchanging messages between SAP ERP HCM and the SAP
PI integration server. Note that there are multiple subtasks needed to set up con-
nectivity between SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI.
Proceed as follows:
1. Set up the HTTP destination from the SAP ERP HCM system to the SAP PI Inte-
gration Engine or Adapter Engine, depending on what type of installation you
used for the SAP PI system.
2. Create an RFC destination type H to connect SAP ERP HCM to the SAP PI dual-
stack system (ABAP and Java), or create an RFC destination type G to connect
SAP ERP HCM to SAP PI AEX (Java single-stack system), or the Advanced
Adapter Engine of SAP PI (7.11 or above). Access Transaction SM59, and per-
form the following substeps:
 Highlight connection type H (HTTP Connections to ABAP System) or type
G (HTTP Connections to External Server), and click on Create. Enter a
description with the suggested name of “XI_Integration_Engine_<SID>” for
type H or “XI_ADAPTER_ENGINE_<SID>” for type G.
 Maintain the following information on the Technical Settings tab:
– Target Host: <Host name of SAP PI>
– Service No.: <Port of SAP PI>
– Path Prefix: /sap/xi/engine?type=entry for connection type H for connect-
ing the Integration Engine or /XISOAPAdapter/MessageServlet?ximessage=
true for connection type G for connecting the Advanced Adapter Engine.
 Maintain the following information on the Logon and Security tab:
– Client: <Client number of SAP PI>
– User: PIAPPL<SID>
– Password: <Password>
3. Save you entries, and test the connection by clicking on the Connection Test
button. If the connection is successful, then you should be able to see HTTP
response status 500 for the Integration Engine connection or HTTP response

Integration of SAP Process Integration

status 200 for the Advanced Adapter Engine connection (see Figure 10.1 and
Figure 10.2).
Figure 10.1  HTTP Connection—Integration Engine
Figure 10.2  HTTP Connection—Adapter Engine
4. Set up the TCP/IP connection from SAP ERP HCM to the SAP PI system. The
SAPSLDAPI connection is used by ABAP SLD API to read system landscape
information from the SAP PI System Landscape Directory (SLD).
SAP PI AEX (Java Single Stack) Step
The following are optional steps for connecting SAP PI AEX (Java single stack):
1. Access Transaction SM59. Highlight connection type T (TCP/IP Connection), and
click on Create. Enter the RFC destination name “SAPSLDAPI”.
2. Maintain the following information on the Technical Settings tab:
 Activation Type: Select registered server program
 Program ID of Registered Server Program: SAPSLDAPI_<SID>
 Gateway Host: <Gateway host name of SAP PI>
 Gateway Service: <Gateway service of SAP PI>

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
378
3. Save your entries, and test the connection by clicking on the Connection Test but-
ton. If the connection is successful, then you won’t be able to view any error mes-
sages in the test result.
5. Set up the TCP/IP connection from SAP ERP HCM to the SAP PI system. The
LCRSAPRFC connection is used by ABAP SLD API to read system landscape
information from the SAP PI SLD.
SAP PI AEX (Java Single Stack) Step
The following are optional steps for connecting to SAP PI AEX (Java single stack):
1. Access Transaction SM59. Highlight connection type T (TCP/IP Connection), and
click on Create. Enter the RFC destination name “LCRSAPRFC”.
2. Maintain the following information on technical settings tab:
 Activation Type: Select registered server program
 Program ID of Registered Server Program: SAPSLDAPI_<SID>
 Gateway Host: <Gateway host name of SAP PI>
 Gateway Service: <Gateway service of SAP PI>
3. Save your entries, and test the connection by clicking on the Connection Test but-
ton. If the connection is successful, then you should be able to view the test result
with HTTP response status 200 for the Advanced Adapter Engine connection.
6. Set up the HTTP connection from SAP ERP HCM to the SAP PI system. The SAP_
PROXY_ESR connection is used to access the Enterprise Service Repository con-
tent of SAP PI. This is a mandatory step for connecting SAP PI AEX (Java single
stack), and an optional step for those who use an SAP PI dual-stack system. Per-
form the following substeps:
 Access Transaction SM59.
 Highlight connection type G (HTTP connections to external server) and
click on Create. Enter the RFC destination name “SAP_PROXY_ESR”.
 Maintain the following information on the Technical Settings tab:
– Target Host: <Host name of SAP PI>
– Server No.: <Port of SAP PI>
– Path Prefix: /rep; for connection type H for connecting the integration
engine

Integration of SAP Process Integration
10.1
379
 Maintain the following information on the Logon and Security tab:
– User: PIAPPL<SID>
– Password: <Password>
 Save your entries, and test the connection by clicking on the Connection
Test button. If the connection is successful, you should not see any error
messages in the test result.
You have just finished completing the multiple subtasks needed to set up connec-
tivity between SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI.
Now, let’s discuss the next task of this step, which is to define SLD access and reg-
ister the SAP ERP HCM technical and business systems.
Integrating SAP ERP HCM into the SAP PI SLD
After you have completed setting up the RFC destinations, you are ready to fur-
ther define the SLD access data and register the SAP ERP HCM technical system
and business system in the SLD of SAP PI. Just like in the previous section, there
are multiple subtasks required to integrate SAP ERP HCM into the SAP PI SLD. To
access the SLD server, perform the following steps:
1. Access Transaction SLDAPICUST, switch to Change mode, and create a new
entry with the following information:
 Select Access to SLD Server Using RFC or Access to SLD Server Using
HTTP at your preference to configure the connection parameters:
– Alias Name: <SID of SAP PI> e.g.: PID
– Prim.: Select the checkbox
– Host Name: <Host name of SAP PI>
– Port: <Port of SAP PI>
– User: PIAPPL<SID>
– Password: <Password>
 Save the entry.
2. Highlight the entry, and click Test SLD Connection. If the SLD connection is

You have now finished completing the multiple subtasks needed to integrate SAP
ERP HCM into the SAP PI SLD.
Now, let’s discuss the next task of this step, which is to configure and activate the
local integration engine.
Configure and Activate Local Integration Engine
Now, you will connect the SAP ERP HCM business system with the local integra-
tion engine to the SAP PI Integration Engine or AEX (Advanced Adapter Engine).
You will use the HTTP destination that you created in the Set Up Connectivity
between SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI section. Access Transaction SXMB_ADM in
SAP ERP HCM, and complete the following steps (see Figure 10.5):
1. Go to the Configuration section of the Integration Engine by opening the
directory configuration. Double-click on the Integration Engine Configura-
tion activity.
2. Choose Edit  Change Global Configuration Data.
3. Select the Application System option from the Role of Business System field.
In the Corresponding Integ. Server field, enter dest://<name of HTTP destina-
tion>; here, <name of HTTP destination> refers to the HTTP destination in the
Integration Engine or Advanced Adapter Engine that was previously created.
4. Save the entry.
Figure 10.5  Integration Engine Configuration
You now know how to connect the SAP ERP HCM business system with the local
integration engine to the SAP PI Integration Engine or AEX. Next, you will deploy
SuccessFactors SSL certificates.

Integration of SAP Process Integration
10.1

Deploy SuccessFactors SSL Certificates
Now, you will download the tenant certificate from the tenant API URL, then
import it into the SAP PI Administration tool. The SuccessFactors Integration
Add-on uses SSL connectivity for connecting SAP PI to the SuccessFactors tenant
URL. In order to establish a secure SSL connectivity, the SuccessFactors tenant
certificate needs to be downloaded. Note that there are multiple subtasks needed
to deploy SuccessFactors SSL certificates.
Download the SuccessFactors tenant SSL certificates in the following steps:
1. Access the SuccessFactors tenant API URL in your Internet browser. 
Please contact your SuccessFactors consultant to obtain the SuccessFactors API
endpoint URL.
Browser
The Google Chrome browser is used in our download example. You are able to use
other browsers for the certificate download, but the procedures may be different from
those described in this section.
2. Click on the Lock button, then on Connection  Certificate information to
view the certificate information (see Figure 10.6).

Figure 10.9  Saving Certificate
After downloading the certificates, you will need to import them. Perform the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Access the SAP NetWeaver Administration of SAP PI via the following URL:
<Hostname>:<PI Http port>/nwa.
2. Navigate to the Configuration tab, then to Security  Certificates and Keys.
3. In the Key Storage Views table (Keystore Views in SAP PI 7.11), select the
TrustedCAs view name. Choose Import Entry from the View Entry Details
tab of TrustedCAs. In the Import Entry dialog box, select X.509 Certificate,
and Browse to the location of the CER files downloaded in the previous sec-
tion. Click on Import. Rename the imported key to “*.successfactors.com” in
the View Entry Details tab (see Figure 10.10).

This completes the step for downloading the tenant certificate from the tenant
API URL and importing it into the SAP PI Administration tool. The next step cov-
ers checking the network firewall port.
Check Network Firewall Port 443 Connection
Some organizations block outgoing network port 443 by using a firewall due to
network security concerns. To ensure that the SAP PI server is able to make an
outgoing connection to the SuccessFactors tenant URL, check with your network
security team whether port 443 is open for the SAP PI server to connect to the
SuccessFactors tenant URL.
This concludes the checking of the network firewall port and all the steps
required for basic setup of SAP PI. The next section will cover the steps for setting
up the SAP ERP HCM integration.
10.1.3
Step 2: SAP ERP HCM Integration Setup
This section covers the settings for middleware that need to be implemented in
SAP ERP HCM. You will need to set up API credentials and define the number of
records for each package sent to SuccessFactors via SAP PI. There are the two
tasks associated with this step: storing credentials for integration scenarios and
the defining package size for data transfer.
In the SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors integration run, SAP ERP HCM sends API
credentials to SAP PI. The same API credentials are mapped to the HTTPS header
by SAP PI then forwarded to the SuccessFactors tenant URL for logon purposes.
Let’s begin.
Store Credentials for Integration Scenarios
In this step, you will enter API credentials for each integration scenario. Before
completing this step, you will need to have logon information at hand, including
company ID and the API user ID and password set up in SuccessFactors. Perform
the following steps for each integration scenario:
1. To maintain the API logon credentials for employee data transfer, compensa-
tion data transfer, and recruiting data transfer, you will repeat this process
three times. First, go to the IMG and access Personnel Management  Integra-

Integration of SAP Process Integration
10.1

tion Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Basic Settings 
Settings for Middleware.
2. For the employee data transfer step, click on Store Credentials for Transfer-
ring Employee Data to Secure Storage. For the compensation data transfer
step, click on Store Credentials for Transferring Compensation Data to
Secure Storage. For the recruiting data transfer step, click on Store Creden-
tials for Transferring Recruiting Data to Secure Storage.
3. For employee data, compensation, and recruiting data: enter the Company ID,
for example (acexbc), used by MedTron in SuccessFactors, the User ID, for
example (SAP_API_USER), of the SAP API user, and each related Password.
This completes all the subtasks needed to enter API credentials for each integra-
tion scenario. Next, you will enter the data transfer package size for each scenario
you need to complete.
Define Package Size for Data Transfer
In this task, you will specify the number of records for each package sent to Suc-
cessFactors via SAP PI. Proceed as follows:
1. To define the package size for transferring employee data, go to the IMG and
access Personnel Management  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and
SuccessFactors BizX  Basic Settings  Settings for Middleware  Define
Package Size for Transferring Employee Data.
2. Enter a value of 200 to define a standard package size.
3. Repeat the same steps to define the package size for transferring compensation
data, but instead click on Define Package Size for Transferring Compensa-
tion Data at the end of the menu path.
4. Repeat the same steps to define the package size for transferring recruiting
data, but instead click on Define Package Size for Recruiting Data at the end
of the menu path.
This concludes the set up for the SAP ERP HCM integration. You are now done
with step 2. The next section will discuss the SAP PI Integration Directory config-
uration.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

10.1.4
Step 3: SAP PI Integration Directory Configuration
This section describes the tasks required for setting up the SAP PI Integration
Directory for the employee data, compensation data, and recruiting data integra-
tion scenarios.
For these tasks, you will need to access the Integration Builder link to start the
Integration Directory from the SAP PI landing page: <Hostname>:<PI HTTP port>/dir.
Create a Communication Component and Assign a Business System
In this task, you will be creating a business component for SuccessFactors and
assigning the SAP ERP HCM business system from the SLD in the SAP PI Integra-
tion Directory.
SAP ERP HCM Business System
If the SAP ERP HCM business system has been assigned in the Integration Directory,
then you do not need to assign the SAP ERP HCM business system.
Make sure the necessary software components XI content SFIHCM01 600 and
SFIHCM02 600 of the Integration Add-on are included as installed software in the
SLD. Create the new product, and assign the SFIHCM01 600 and SFIHCM02 600
software components so that service interfaces can be used in the Integration
Directory configuration. Begin by assigning the SAP ERP HCM business system:
1. Go to the top menu, and click on Environment  Clear SLD Data Cache to get
updated information from the SLD. Then, also in the top menu, choose Tools 
Assign Business System (see Figure 10.11).
Figure 10.11  Assign Business System
2. Click on Continue twice from the dialog box.
3. Select the corresponding SAP ERP HCM business system, and click on Finish.

4. A summary appears. Close the dialog box, and save the entry. You should see
the SAP ERP HCM business system appear under the Business System category.
Next, you’ll want to create the SuccessFactors business component. To do so, per-
form the following steps:
1. Go to the Objects view, then right-click on Communication Component
Without Party, and choose New Business Component.
2. In the dialog popup box, choose SuccessFactors as the Communication Com-
ponent.
3. Click on Create, and then save the entry. You should see the SuccessFactors
business component appear under the Business Component category (see Fig-
ure 10.12).

Step 4: Create Communication Channel
This section covers the tasks required to create the SOAP sender and receiver
communication channels for integration. In this step, you will be creating three
communication channels, which are shared by the employee data, compensation
data, and recruiting data transfers. The SuccessFactors Integration Add-on uses
ABAP Proxy technology to integrate SAP ERP HCM with SAP PI. The web service
SOAP protocol is used to integrate SAP PI with SuccessFactors. Let’s begin.
Create a SOAP Sender Communication Channel
In this step, you will be creating a SOAP sender communication channel that is
assigned to the SAP ERP HCM business system. This SOAP sender communication
channel is then configured to receive proxy runtime requests from the SAP ERP
HCM system for all data transfer scenarios.
To receive proxy runtime requests, the SOAP sender communication channel
configuration is different depending on the SAP PI system installation. Dual stack
or Java single stack can be used, or you can use the integration configuration
method (classical configuration or AE integrated configuration).
To begin, you will need to check and then select the SAP ERP HCM business sys-
tem in the Object view, as follows:
1. Right-click on the communication channel, and choose New.
2. Choose SOAPSender for Communication Channel, and click on Create. For
classical configuration (SAP PI dual-stack system), enter the field values seen in
Figure 10.13 in the Parameters and General tabs.
3. For the Advanced tab, in the Adapter-Specific Message Attributes section,
deselect Set Adapter-Specific Message Attributes. Then, for the Adapter Sta-
tus, set Status to Active.
4. For AAE integrated configuration (SAP PI Java single-stack system or SAP PI
dual-stack system 7.1 or above), enter the field values seen in Figure 10.14 for
the Parameters and General tabs.
5. For the Advanced tab, in the Adapter-Specific Message Attributes section,
deselect Set Adapter-Specific Message Attributes. Then, for the Adapter Sta-
tus, set Status to Active.
6. Next, under the Acknowledgements Handling tab, HTTP Destination (from
NWA) should be Unfilled.

This completes the task of creating of a SOAP sender communication channel.
Next, you will create the SOAP receiver communication channel.
Create SOAP Receiver Communication Channel (for Logon Request)
In this step, you will create a SOAP receiver communication channel that is assigned
to the SuccessFactors business component. This SOAP receiver communication

channel is then configured to send API logon requests to the SuccessFactors
tenant for all data transfer scenarios.
The SOAP receiver communication channel configuration for logon operations is
different depending on the Integration Add-on support package releases. To
begin, check for and select the SuccessFactors business component in the Object
view, as follows:
1. Right-click on the Communication channel, and select New.
2. Choose SOAPReceiver or SOAPAxisReceiverLogon for the Communication
Channel, and click on Create.
3. Enter the parameters based on the Integration Add-on release. For Integration
Add-on 1.0 (SP 4.0) and Integration Add-on 2.0 (SP 2.0), enter the field values
shown in Figure 10.15 for the Parameters and General tabs.

 For the Advanced tab, in the Adapter-Specific Message Attributes section,
select both Use Adapter-Specific Message Attributes and Variable Trans-
port Binding. Then, in the Variable Header (XHeaderName1), enter
TServerLocation.
 Next, for the Authentication Keys section, unselect View Authentication
Keys. Set Adapter Status to Active.
4. For the Integration Add-on 1.0 (SP 6.0) or Integration Add-on 2.0 (SP 2.0),
enter the field values seen in Figure 10.16 under the Parameters tab. The han-
dling of HTTP cookies has been enhanced in this Integration Add-on support
package release. Hence, the SOAP AXIS protocol is used in the enhancement.

Pre-configuration Check
Before you begin configuration in the SAP PI Integration Directory, make sure that the
XI content SFIHCM01 and SFIHCM02 are deployed as described in the SAP PI Enter-
prise Services Repository Design Content Deployment section.
The first task associated with this step addresses how to complete the employee
data scenario.
Create the Employee Data Scenario
Configure the employee data integration scenario based on the standard Enter-
prise Service Repository objects delivered by SAP as part of the Integration Add-
on 1.0 (XI content SFIHCM01).
You have a choice between using integrated configuration or the SAP PI Integra-
tion Directory classic configuration for setting up the employee data scenario,
depending on your SAP PI installation and your implementation strategy. There
are three service interfaces delivered for the employee data transfer. Each of
interface must be configured in the SAP PI Integration Directory as shown in

nario, based on the SAP standard Enterprise Service Repository objects delivered
by SAP as part of Integration Add-on 1.0 (XI content SFIHCM01).
You can either use the SAP PI Integration Directory classic configuration or the
integrated configuration for setting up the compensation data scenario, depend-
ing on your SAP PI installation and your system requirements. There are nine ser-
vice interfaces delivered for the compensation data transfer, each of which must
be configured in the SAP Integration Directory. The employee data scenario is the
baseline for the compensation data scenario, so ensure that you have completed
the employee data scenario configuration. Perform the following steps:
1. Right-click on Configuration Scenario in the object tree, and click on New to
create a new configuration scenario.

Create Recruiting Data Scenario
In this step, you will configure the recruiting data integration scenario, based on
the standard Enterprise Service Repository objects delivered by SAP as part of
Integration Add-on 2.0 (XI content SFIHCM02).
You can choose to either use the SAP PI Integration Directory classic configura-
tion or the integrated configuration to set up the recruiting data scenario,
depending on your SAP PI installation and your system requirements. There are
11 service interfaces delivered for the recruiting data transfer, each of which must
be configured in the SAP PI Integration Directory. The employee data scenario is
the baseline for the recruiting data scenario, so ensure that you have completed
the employee data scenario configuration.
Proceed as follows:
1. Right-click on Configuration Scenario in the object tree, and click on New to

This concludes the configuration of integration scenarios setup in the SAP PI Inte-
gration Directory and the SAP PI integration case study. We covered the steps
involved in implementing the middleware between SAP ERP HCM and Success-
Factors. Once the SAP PI middleware is set up, MedTron will be able to imple-
ment the remaining Talent Hybrid integration scenarios. Remember, the imple-
mentation of SAP PI is a prerequisite to enable the employee data, compensation
process, and recruiting process integrations.
10.2
Employee Data Integration
In this section, we will discuss the employee data integration scenario, using a
case study as our guide for application. Specifically, we’ll look at the implementa-
tion steps necessary for both SAP ERP and SuccessFactors to implement the
employee data integration.
Prerequisites
Prior to implementing the SuccessFactors employee data integration with SAP ERP
HCM, you will need to complete the following relevant configurations:
 Have both the SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI systems with the latest Integration Add-on
deployed and configured.
 Have the following system minimum requirements prior to implementing the latest
Integration Add-on:
 SAP ERP Human Capital Management (SAP ERP HCM), SAP ERP 6.0 SPS 15 or
higher
 SAP HANA Cloud Integration or one of the following versions or higher of SAP
Process Integration:
–
SAP PI 7.1 EHP1 SP 08 (minimum requirement for dual-stack deployment)
–
SAP PI 7.3 SP 05 (minimum requirement for Java-only deployment)
–
SAP PI 7.31 SP 04 (minimum requirement for Java-only deployment)
–
SAP PI 7.4 SP 04
 SuccessFactors Talent Solutions 1402

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
412
 Have relevant access to SAP ERP HCM, with a sufficient authorization role for the
configuration activities in SAP IMG, ABAP development, and background job sched-
uler, as well as access to the SuccessFactors Provisioning and Administration page.
 Have your IT network configured to enable communication through firewalls
between SuccessFactors Talent Management and SAP PI.
First, we will look at the parameters of our case study, including the client sce-
nario. Then, we will cover what the process for this integration will entail and the
steps we can expect to go through to complete the case study.
10.2.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study focuses on the employee data integration using best practices and
how a customer that desires to implement SuccessFactors Talent Management
Solutions will integrate and transfer its employee data from SAP ERP HCM to Suc-
cessFactors Talent Management Solutions, using SAP PI on-premise as the inte-
gration middleware.
Client Scenario
MedTron has become increasingly interested in SuccessFactors, because it is look-
ing to lessen IT configuration support and have its system be more user main-
tained while providing a more positive user experience. Over time, MedTron
wishes to have modules to exchange and build on data—in hopes of bringing
employees closer to their HR data.
At this point, MedTron would like to implement the SuccessFactors Talent Man-
agement Solutions—beginning with the Performance Management module. In
the future, the Talent Management Roadmap, which includes Compensation, will
be implemented in phase 2, followed by the Succession Planning module imple-
mentation in phase 3 and the SuccessFactors Recruiting module in the phase 4
implementation work.
MedTron’s existing IT footprint includes SAP ERP HCM ECC 6.0 EHP 6. MedTron
currently runs OM and PA in SAP. In addition, MedTron also uses SAP PI version
7.4 Java stack.
To effectively integrate and transfer the employee data, the team recognizes that
the technical consultant will need to have a solid understanding of the basic set-
tings of the Talent Hybrid integration with SAP ERP HCM and the necessary

Employee Data Integration
10.2
413
Integration Add-ons and system requirements to make the integration successful.
The biggest challenge will be to keep the systems and HCM data in sync between
SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors.
With a successful integration, the benefits of moving to the cloud will include an
easy and fast deployment of SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions, as well
as the ability to leverage standard Integration Add-ons delivered by SAP to ensure
that the data is in sync between SuccessFactors and SAP ERP HCM. To ensure that
the integration is successful, there are certain business requirements needed to
guarantee a smooth transfer of data.
For example, there needs to be a single source of employee data from SAP ERP
HCM. In addition, the employee profile and user data need to be created from SAP
ERP HCM data (the User ID field is the SAP Central Person [CP]). Finally, there
must be a change of mapping of location to the SAP address infotype (IT0006).
To integrate and transfer employee data from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors
Talent Management Solutions using SAP PI middleware, the following steps must
be executed:
1. Ensure that baseline integration configuration settings were made for SAP ERP
HCM and for SuccessFactors employee data integration by defining authoriza-
tions in SAP ERP HCM to access the new integration transactions.
2. For setting the middleware, set the installation and configuration of SAP PI as
an integration point between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Man-
agement Solutions.
Process Overview 
SAP ERP HCM on-premise and SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions in
the cloud serve as two different systems; therefore, integrating SAP ERP HCM
with SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions enables data consistency
between two systems as part of Talent Management.
There are four main steps that are required to integrate and transfer employee
data from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions. These
are as follows:
 Step 1: Basic setup 
In this step, you will need to complete the baseline integration configuration
necessary for implementation. This includes defining authorizations in SAP

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
414
ERP HCM, settings for middleware, and creating an SAP PI employee data sce-
nario (see Section 10.2.2).
 Step 2: SAP ERP HCM configuration 
The next step entails setting up the SAP ERP HCM configuration, which has a
variety of tasks that need to be performed, from defining name formats for
fields to enhancing employee data extraction with BAdI implementations (see
Section 10.2.3).
 Step 3: SuccessFactors configuration 
The SuccessFactors configuration steps for employee data integration include
everything from activating the SuccessFactors APIs to the creation of the API
user (see Section 10.2.4).
 Step 4: SAP PI middleware setup 
For step 4, you will need to set up the SAP PI middleware. Therefore, refer to
Section 10.1 for a detailed description.
In this section, we’ll highlight the necessary information for customers using the
Talent Hybrid deployment model to run SAP ERP HCM for Personnel Administra-
tion and Organization Management, as well as benefits, time, and payroll and
SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions. The employee data integration sce-
nario must be in place prior to implementing the other integration scenarios for
compensation and recruiting.
The following basic implementation steps help to kick start the integration efforts
for employee data integration. Let’s begin with the fundamentals that will allow
these two systems to talk with one another.
10.2.2
Step 1: Basic Setup
There is a baseline integration configuration that is required along with an SAP
ERP HCM configuration for setting up SuccessFactors employee data integration.
This baseline system configuration covers settings from SAP ERP HCM and SAP
PI. To complete the basic setup, you’ll need to perform the following tasks:
 Define authorizations in SAP ERP HCM
 Set up middleware
 Create an SAP PI employee data scenario
Let’s begin.

Employee Data Integration
10.2
415
Define Authorization in SAP ERP HCM
To begin our basic setup, first we’ll need to define the authorization for the Inte-
gration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Solutions. To do this,
you’ll define the role SAP_HR_SFI_EMPL_DATA_REPL, which comprises the authori-
zations that a user needs to run the following reports for extracting employee
data to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions:
 RH_SFI_TRIGGER_EMPL_DATA_REPL 
Extract employee data for SuccessFactors
 RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_DATA 
Sync employee data with SuccessFactors
 RH_SFI_WITHDRAW_VARIANT 
Discontinue data extraction for a group of employees
The role SAP_HR_SFI_EMPL_DATA_REPL is assigned to a composite role, SAP_HR_SFI_
C2, which contains other authorization roles that a user needs for compensation
and recruiting data transfer as part of the Integration Add-on. You may use it as a
template to define authorizations that suit your requirements. Access Transaction
PFCG to define roles. Copy the template role SAP_HR_SFI_EMPL_DATA_REPL to a
customer role and edit it according to your requirement.
You have now defined authorizations in SAP ERP HCM. The next step in complet-
ing the basic setup for configuring the baseline integration is to setup the middle-
ware. Let’s discuss this now.
Set Up the Middleware
To set the middleware, configure SuccessFactors API user logon information, and
define the package size for transferring employee data in the SAP ERP HCM sys-
tem. In this step, specify the number of employees for whom data will be trans-
ferred each time the web services for transferring employee data from SAP ERP to
SuccessFactors Talent Solutions is called.
Additional Information
For more information, refer to the Define Package Size for Data Transfer section (in Sec-
tion 10.1.3).
The last step in completing the basic setup for configuring baseline integration is
to create SAP PI employee data.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
416
Create SAP PI Employee Data Scenario
The SuccessFactors Integration Add-on uses SAP PI as an integration point
between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Solutions. You’ll need to make
sure that the necessary SAP PI configuration is created for setting up the
employee data integration.
Additional Information
For more information on how to configure SAP PI, refer to Section 9.1.
Now that the basic setup has been completed, let’s turn our attention to the SAP
ERP HCM configuration setup.
10.2.3
Step 2: SAP ERP HCM Configuration
The following activities describe SAP ERP HCM basic configuration steps that are
required for setting up employee data integrations to SuccessFactors Talent Solu-
tions:
 Defining name format for the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields
 Creating a report variant for employee data extraction
 Specifying allowed variants for delta extraction
 Running extraction of employee data and organization data
 Discontinuing data extraction for group employees
 Enhancing employee data extraction with BAdI implementation
Let’s first define the name format for the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields.
Then, we’ll discuss the configuration steps.
Define Name Format for the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME Fields
In this step, you will define the name format for the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME
fields that are used for employee data extract. These are mandatory fields in Suc-
cessFactors Talent Solutions.
When defining the name format fields, be sure to specify which SAP ERP HCM
employee FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields are to be used or mapped to the

Employee Data Integration
10.2
417
SuccessFactors Talent Solutions FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields. The for-
matted name setting here will affect SuccessFactors Talent Solutions in several
ways, such as displaying the employee name on the UI, name search, and sorting
behavior.
It is important to define the name format before you run any employee data
extraction to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions to avoid any inconsistency of name
formatting stored in SuccessFactors Talent Solutions. Keep the following points in
mind:
 If the format for the FIRSTNAME and LASTNAME fields has already been
defined as part of the existing SAP ERP HCM implementation, then this config-
uration step is not needed.
 If no specific name format is defined, then the extract program will default to
use of PA0002-VORNA and PA0002-NACHN fields. To define a name format
specific for the integration, use following name formats:
 FIRSTNAME: -71
 LASTNAME: -72
Next, perform the following steps:
1. Access Transaction SPRO, then navigate to IMG  Personnel Management 
Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Integra-
tion Scenario for Employee Data  Define Name Format for Fields FIRST-
NAME and LASTNAME.
2. Choose New Entries, and add the entries shown in Figure 10.26.
Figure 10.26  HR Name Format with Infotype Views
Now, let’s discuss the configuration of SAP ERP HCM to create the report variant
for employee data extraction.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
418
Create Report Variant for Employee Data Extraction
In this step, you will create an employee data extraction report variant that must
be saved with selection parameters and fields mapping required for the integra-
tion of SuccessFactors Talent Solutions.
The extraction report used here is called the Employee Data Sync with Success-
Factors (with delta and inactive logic) report.
The report variant is important and must be created prior to any employee
extraction run, because the variant must be specified during executing the
extraction report. Only those variants assigned in Allowed Variants for Delta
Extraction will be available in report selection. You will perform this step right
after report variant creation. The transaction code and report name are as follows:
 Transaction code 
HRSFI_SYNCH_EMP_DATA
 Report name 
RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_DAT
This report extracts changes to employee data. During the initial run for an
employee, a full record is extracted. The initial run includes full records for all
employees that satisfy the report criteria. If the full employee population is large,
then segmenting into multiple batches through variants may be required. During
each subsequent run, the report extracts only the employees for whom data has
changed compared with the last run of the report.
The report also ensures that employees who are no longer contained in the selec-
tion area receive the status Inactive (for example, if the employees have switched
to another enterprise area, in which there is no integration with SuccessFactors
Talent Solutions).
Let’s take a closer look at setting up the Sync Employee Data with SuccessFac-
tors (with Delta and Inactive Logic) report. You’ll need to access Transaction
HRSFI_SYNCH_EMP_DATA and perform the following three main steps:
 Setup report Period and Selection criteria for employee extraction
 Setup report Default Settings
 Setup report Fields mapping
Let’s begin with setting up the report Period and Selection criteria:

Employee Data Integration
10.2
419
1. To begin setting up the report Period and Selection criteria, first select the
desired Reporting Period by specifying Today or any key date or period for
which the employee data is to be extracted. The default is set as Today (see Fig-
ure 10.27).
Figure 10.27  Setting up the Sync Employee Data with SuccessFactors (with Delta and Inactive 
Logic) Report Variant
2. Next, set the selection criteria and set Employment Status to 3. This means
that the report selects only employees for whom the employment status is
Active.
3. During the initial employee data extract, you cannot extract employee data
with a status other than Active to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions; it will only
process existing employee data with the status changed from Active to Inac-
tive for subsequent employee data transfer.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
420
To set up the Default Settings, specify default settings for employee data inte-
gration behavior (see Figure 10.27). Proceed as follows:
1. First, choose the Middleware option for employee extraction to SuccessFac-
tors Talent Solutions through SAP PI.
2. Enter an email address. This is default email that the extraction report uses
when it cannot determine the employee’s email address using the Email field.
3. Choose an Extraction Language. To avoid any data inconsistencies, transfer
to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions. Do not change the extraction language after
you have initiated the first employee data extract run.
4. Activate the Log Error Messages field only. Do not activate the field Forced
Synchronization, which should only be used for manual extraction repeat
runs in case of employee data correction.
To setup the reports for Field Mapping, specify the employee data selection fields
to be included in the extraction transfer as well as fields mapping from SAP stan-
dard fields or BAdI enhancement implementation. Proceed as follows:
1. Go through the list of available selection fields, and select the checkbox if the
field is mandatory for extraction.
2. In every selection field, you can further define field mapping by selecting the
choices of Standard Field Mapping, Own Implementation, or Exclude from
the dropdown box.
3. If the Own Implementation option is selected for a field, then you must imple-
ment that particular BAdI enhancement for data selection.
4. If the Exclude option is selected for an optional field, then that field will not be
included in the employee data transfer to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions.
Refer to the Enhancement of Employee Data Extraction with BAdI Implementa-
tion section for additional information regarding BAdI enhancements.
Field Mapping Setup
Table 10.11 is an example report field mapping setup for the MedTron organiza-
tion based on its employee data requirements. The first column, SFSF Fields,
indicates target mapping fields of SuccessFactors Talent Solutions. The second
column refers to the mapping source field option of SAP ERP HCM. The third col-
umn, Required, further defines if mapping is mandatory. For fields with the

This is how the employee data sync program in the SAP ERP HCM system will
look. Once the field mapping is done, perform the following steps:
1. Save the settings into a variant using the Save button.
2. Give the variant a meaningful name and description (e.g., “US_CAD” as name
and “US and Canada employees” as description).
3. Save the variant again.
This section described how to create a report variant for employee data

Specify Allowed Variants for Delta Extraction
Once you have created the report variants for employee data extraction, the next
step is to further define which extraction variants will be available for use in the
report Sync Employee Data process (RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_DATA).
Only those variants identified in this configuration will be available for selection
by the user or to be run in the scheduled job.
Proceed as follows:
1. Access Transaction SPRO, and go to the IMG menu. Then, navigate to Person-
nel Management  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFac-
tors BizX  Integration Scenario for Employee Data  Specify Allowed
Variants for Delta Extraction.
2. On the next screen, click on New Entries, and select the appropriate one or
more variants that are permissible for use in the program Sync Employee Data
with SFSF (RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_DATA; see Figure 10.28). Save
your entries.
Figure 10.28  Specifying Allowed Variants for Delta Extraction—New Entries (Overview of Added 
Entries)
Now, let’s discuss how to run an extraction of employee and organizational data.
Run Extraction of Employee and Organizational Data
For this task, we will run an extraction of the employee and organizational data.
To run this extraction, schedule a background job for the report Sync Employee
Data with SuccessFactors (RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_DATA) to extract
employee data and transfer to SuccessFactors Talent Solutions regularly. Perform
the following steps:

1. Access Transaction SM36, and define the job name, job class, and, if necessary,
execution server and spool recipient. Click on Start Condition, then click on
Date/Time to schedule the periodic job (see Figure 10.29).
2. Enter the execution start date and time. Select the Periodic job checkbox, then
choose Period Values, and select the frequency (e.g., monthly, weekly, or
daily). Choose Step to specify the program to be executed in the background
job (see Figure 10.30).
3. Enter report name RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_DATA and the desired vari-
ant. Then, click on Save.

Discontinue Data Extraction for Group of Employees
In addition to the report Sync Employee Data with SuccessFactors (RH_SFI_SYN-
CHRONIZE_EMPL_DATA), there is a report to stop existing employee data syn-
chronization between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Solutions. This
report uses the variant created from the report Sync Employee Data and set group
of the previous transferred employees’ status to Inactive in SuccessFactors Talent
Solutions, depending on the variant selection. This report is useful if you want to
exclude a group of employees which you have previously transferred data to Suc-
cessFactors Talent Solutions, from data transfer in future. 
In a case in which employee data transfer exclusion is needed, schedule and run
report RH_SFI_WITHDRAW_VARIANT with a report variant from the Sync
Employee Data with SuccessFactors report (RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_
DATA).

426
Enhancement of Employee Data Extraction with BAdI Implementation
In a case in which standard SAP table fields mapping options for the 
Sync Employee Data with SuccessFactors report (RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_
DATA) does not meet your requirements, enhance the report extraction process
by implementing BAdI: Replication of Employee Data (HRSFI_B_EMPL_DATA_
REPLICATION) with customer-specific code for data retrieval for all available
fields in the Sync Employee Data with SuccessFactors report.
The use of customer-specific extraction logic is activated through the Own Imple-
menting option in each field of the report together with the BAdI implementa-
tion described here. Let’s take a closer look at BAdI: Replication of Employee Data
for our example scenario (see Table 10.12).
The requirement is to map SuccessFactors field Address 1 with information from
Infotype 0006, but no standard SAP table fields for Infotype 0006 are available in
the field mapping option of the report. Hence, Own Implementation is selected
here together with the BAdI: Replication of Employee Data implementation to
supply Infotype 0006 address information via customer-specific codes. Table
10.12 details the field requirements for Infotype 0006 address information.

Now, let’s switch gears to learn about the SuccessFactors side of the integration.
We’ll begin by discussing the SuccessFactors API configuration.
10.2.4
Step 3: SuccessFactors Configuration
The following activities describe the necessary SuccessFactors configuration steps
required for setting up employee data integration from SAP ER HCM to Success-
Factors Talent Management Solutions. It covers the activation of the Success-
Factors APIs, succession data model configurations, creation of the API user, and
security set up.
To set up the configuration in SuccessFactors, perform the following steps:
 Enable SuccessFactors web services API
 Establish SuccessFactors succession data model configuration
 Create a SuccessFactors API user
 Set up a SuccessFactors API user security
 Create a SuccessFactors API login exception

Enable Web Services SuccessFactors API
In this step, you will activate SuccessFactors Talent Solutions web services API
features.
To begin, log on to SuccessFactors’ Provisioning page via https://<Instance URL>/
provisioning_login. The instance URL is provided by the SuccessFactors team; for
example, it could look like https://performancemanager8.successfactors.com/provi-
sioning_login.
In the provisioning tool, go to Company Settings, then navigate to Web Services.
Under Web Services, select the following features (see Figure 10.33):
 SFAPI

SuccessFactors Succession Data Model Configuration
The succession data model governs the structure of the SuccessFactors system and
is accessible in the provisioning tool for each instance. The best practice data
model contains all standard fields and background elements available capture
employee data.
In this step, you will import the succession data model.xml file in the SuccessFac-
tors provisioning tools. Perform the following steps to proceed:
1. Log on to the provisioning tool for your instance, and then navigate to Succes-
sion Management (see Figure 10.35).
Figure 10.35  Importing Succession Data Model XML File in SuccessFactors Provisioning Tool
2. Click on Import/Export Data Model, then select the Import radio button.
3. Browse for and upload the succession data model XML file. (Contact your Suc-
cessFactors team for the template file.) The message Templates have been
uploaded and saved will appear, showing that the process was successful.
Next, we’ll talk about how to create a SuccessFactors API user.
Create SuccessFactors API User
A SuccessFactors API user is required for SAP ERP HCM to integrate with Success-
Factors Talent Solutions through SAP PI. The API user must first be created in the
SuccessFactors provisioning tool. The same API user logon credential is then
stored in the middleware credential settings of SAP ERP HCM.
Log on to the SuccessFactors provisioning tool, and choose Company Settings.
Then, navigate to Admin Username, and enter the following information:
 Admin Username 
We suggest using “SAP_API_USER”.

Employee Data Integration
10.2

 Admin Password 
Create a strong password.
 Admin First Name 
Provide the appropriate admin user’s first name.
 Admin Last Name 
Provide the appropriate admin user’s last name.
 Admin Email 
Provide the appropriate admin user’s email address.
Select Create Admin to create the API user. Once the API user is created, pass the
API user name and password together with the tenant company ID (where the
API user was created) to store the API user credentials in SAP ERP HCM. Now,
let’s focus on setting up the API user security.
SuccessFactors API User Security Setup
In this step, you will grant security access to the API user created in the previous
substep.
1. Log on to the SuccessFactors instance URL as an admin.
2. Navigate to Admin Tools  Set User Permissions  SF API Login Permission 
Manage SFAPI Login Permission.
3. Select the API user that created previously, then select the Select All checkbox.
4. Select Grant Permissions button. Then, navigate to Admin Tools  Set User

9. Select the SAP API user created from the process, and grant permission for all
SuccessFactors API functionalities.
You have now completed the steps for setting up API user security. Now let’s turn
our attention to the API login exception.
SuccessFactors API Login Exception
In this step, you will configure the API login exception for the API created previ-
ously. The purpose is to ensure that the password for the API user does not
expire.
Log on to the SuccessFactors tenant as an admin, then navigate to Admin Tools 
Company Settings  Password and Login Policy Settings  Set API Login Excep-
tions.
Now, add the following settings (see Figure 10.36):
 Username

Test the System Prior to Production Cutover
After the basic settings and configurations in SAP ERP HCM, SuccessFactors, and
SAP PI have been setup, you will need to test the system prior to cutting over in
your production system.
In this case study, we detailed the configuration steps required for implementing
the SuccessFactors employee data integration within SAP ERP HCM using the Tal-
ent Hybrid integration deployment model. By successfully completing these
steps, you will be able to run the employee data between SAP ERP HCM and Suc-
cessFactors.
10.3
Compensation Process Integration
In this section, we’ll cover the implementation steps required in both SAP ERP
and SuccessFactors to implement the compensation integration. We’ll use a client
scenario to demonstrate the integration steps. The details for our client are pro-
vided ahead.
Prerequisites
Refer to Section 10.2 for a list of the prerequisites required prior to beginning the con-
figuration of the compensation process integration scenario.
10.3.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study illustrates how a customer who wants to implement SuccessFac-
tors Talent Management Solutions will integrate and transfer their compensation
data between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions,
using SAP PI on-premise as the integration middleware.
Client Scenario
Our presales team at MedTron Inc. successfully sold the technical capabilities of
integrating and transferring employee data between SAP ERP HCM and Success-
Factors Talent Management Solutions, using SAP PI as the integration middle-
ware. Because SAP PI is already implemented for employee data integration, the
compensation integration will continue to use this middleware.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
434
Building on the implementation of SAP PI and employee data integration,
MedTron is interested in the pay-for-performance, end-to-end process offered in
this solution. They want to continue using SAP ERP HCM for their payroll process-
ing but want to use SuccessFactors for their compensation planning. The end-to-
end integration of the pay-for-performance process ensures that the salary-related
data is transferred from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors. When the manager has
granted a salary change or lump sum payment, the changed data is transferred
from SuccessFactors back to SAP ERP HCM for payroll processing. MedTron has
already implemented the Performance Management module, and the Talent Man-
agement roadmap includes compensation as part of phase 3. The succession plan-
ning module implementation is part of phase 3, with the final Recruiting module
in the phase 4 implementation work.
MedTron’s existing IT footprint includes SAP ERP HCM ECC 6.0 EHP 6. MedTron
currently runs OM, PA, and SAP Payroll in SAP. In addition, MedTron also uses
SAP PI version 7.4 Java stack.
To effectively integrate and transfer compensation data, the team recognizes that
the technical consultant will need to have a solid understanding of the basic set-
tings of SuccessFactors Talent Solutions integration with SAP ERP HCM and the
necessary Integration Add-ons and system requirements needed to make the inte-
gration successful. The implementation of compensation planning in SuccessFac-
tors will allow managers to award merit payments, bonuses, lump sum payments,
and pay adjustments. This includes an approval process and, after completion, the
transfer of relevant data to SAP ERP HCM.
With a successful integration, the benefits of moving to the cloud will include an
easy and fast deployment of SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions and
the ability to leverage standard Integration Add-ons delivered by SAP to ensure
that the data is in sync between SuccessFactors and SAP ERP HCM. To ensure
that the integration is successful, there are certain business requirements
needed to guarantee a smooth transfer of data. SuccessFactors employee profile
integration with SAP ERP HCM must be implemented, and employees must be
available for compensation planning. Refer to Section 10.2, which covers
employee data integration.
To transfer compensation data between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent
Management Solutions, using SAP PI as the middleware, the following steps must
be executed:

Compensation Process Integration
10.3
435
1. Ensure that integration configuration settings have been made for SAP ERP
HCM and for SAP SuccessFactors compensation data integration by defining
authorizations in SAP ERP HCM to access the new integration transactions.
2. For setting the middleware, the installation and configuration of SAP PI was
set as an integration point between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent
Solutions.
Metadata Transfer
The metadata transfer report will need to be run once SuccessFactors configuration is
completed in order to complete the field mappings for the importing of the compensa-
tion data.
The SuccessFactors configuration must be completed before the metadata transfer to
SAP can be performed. This task transfers objects from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP,
which enables the import and activation of compensation data.
Now, let’s discuss how you can achieve a successful integration between SAP ERP
HCM and the SuccessFactors Compensation module, using SAP PI on-premise as
your integration middleware. We’ll begin with an overview of the process.
Process Overview
SAP ERP HCM on-premise and SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions in
the cloud serve as two different systems; therefore, integrating SAP ERP HCM
with SuccessFactors Compensation enables data consistency between the two
systems.
In this section, we’ll highlight the necessary information for customers using the
Talent Hybrid deployment model to run SAP ERP HCM for Personnel Administra-
tion and Organization Management as well as benefits, time, and payroll and
SuccessFactors for their compensation planning. The employee’s compensation
data will be exported from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors, where it will be used
for the compensation planning process. Once the manager has awarded the salary
increase or lump sum bonus, the data will be imported back into SAP ERP HCM,
where it will be activated as an ongoing amount (salary) or a one-off payment
(lump sum).
There are four main steps that are required in setting up the compensation pro-
cess integration between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Management
Solutions:

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
436
 Step 1: Basic setup 
There are basic integration configuration steps that must be performed in order
to begin this process. This includes tasks such as defining authorization in SAP
ERP HCM, setting middleware, and creating a compensation data scenario from
SAP PI (see Section 10.3.2).
 Step 2: SAP ERP HCM configuration 
In this step, you will perform the SAP ERP HCM basic configuration for setting
up compensation data transfer between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Tal-
ent Management Solutions (see Section 10.3.3).
 Step 3: SuccessFactors configuration 
This step describes the SuccessFactors configuration process for setting up the
compensation data integration between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Tal-
ent Management (see Section 10.3.4).
 Step 4: SAP PI middleware setup 
For step 4, you will need to set up the SAP PI middleware. Therefore, refer to
Section 10.1 for a detailed description.
The following section offers basic implementation steps that help to kick start the
integration efforts for the compensation process integration.
10.3.2
Step 1: Basic Setup
There is some basic integration configuration required, along with SAP ERP HCM
configuration for setting up SuccessFactors compensation process integration.
This basic system configuration covers settings from SAP ERP HCM and SAP PI.
To complete the basic setup, you’ll need to perform the following tasks:
 Define authorizations in SAP ERP HCM
 Set up the middleware
 Create an SAP PI compensation data scenario
Define an Authorization in SAP ERP HCM
First, you’ll need to define the authorization for the Integration Add-on for SAP
ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions. To do this, define
the role SAP_HR_SFI_COMP_DATA_REPL, which contains the authorizations that a

Compensation Process Integration
10.3
437
user needs to run the report for extracting compensation data to SuccessFactors
Talent Solutions. The report for extracting compensation data to SuccessFactors
Talent Management Solutions is RH_SFI_SYNCH_COMP_DATA (Extraction of
Compensation Data for SuccessFactors).
The role SAP_HR_SFI_COMP_DATA_IMPORT contains the authorizations that a user
needs to run the reports for extracting and updating compensation data from Suc-
cessFactors. The reports for extracting compensation data to SuccessFactors Tal-
ent Solutions include the following:
 RH_SFI_IMPORT_COMP_DATA
Import compensation data to SAP ERP
 RH_SFI_ACTIVATE_COMP_DATA
Activate compensation data in SAP ERP
The roles are assigned to composite role SAP_HR_SFI_C2, which contains other
authorization roles that a user needs for data transfer as part of the Integration
Add-on. The roles SAP_HR_SFI_COMP_DATA_REPL and SAP_HR_SFI_COMP_DATA_
IMPORT include the infotypes for which the user will need access. However, no
default values are defined for the personnel area, the employee group, or the
employee subgroup, for example.
Therefore, in any customer-specific roles, values for the fields of authorization
objects P_ORGIN, P_ORGINCON, and PLOG, will need to be specified according to the
client’s requirements.
In addition, the following infotype authorizations for customer-specific versions
of the role SAP_HR_SFI_COMP_DATA_IMPORT for the authorization objects P_ORGIN
and P_ORGINCON will need to be specified:
 Read authorization for Infotype 0001 (Organizational Assignment)
 Read and write authorization for Infotypes 0008 (Basic Pay) and 0015 (Addi-
tional Payments)
The delivered roles can be used as a template to define further authorizations
should MedTron decide that it has additional security requirements. Access to
Transaction PFCG is required to define additional roles.
The next step in completing the basic setup is to configure the middleware.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
438
Set Up the Middleware
To set up the middleware, configure the SuccessFactors API user logon informa-
tion, and define the package size for transferring compensation data in SAP ERP
HCM. Specify the number of employees for whom data is to be transferred each
time the web services for transferring compensation data from SAP ERP to Suc-
cessFactors Talent Management Solutions are called.
Additional Information
For more information, refer to the Define Package Size for Data Transfer section in Sec-
tion 10.1.3.
Create the SAP PI Compensation Data Scenario
The latest SAP SuccessFactors Integration Add-on uses SAP PI as an integration
point between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions.
You’ll need to make sure the necessary SAP PI configuration is created for setting
up compensation data integration.
Additional Information
For more information on how to configure SAP PI, refer to Section 10.1 for a detailed
description.
Now that the basic setup has been completed, let’s turn our attention to the SAP
ERP HCM configuration setup.
10.3.3
Step 2: SAP ERP HCM Configuration
The following activities describe the SAP ERP HCM basic configuration steps that
are required for setting up the compensation data transfer between SAP ERP
HCM and SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions:
 Defining fields for extracting compensation data from SAP ERP HCM
 Defining fields for importing compensation data from SuccessFactors
 Importing metadata from SuccessFactors
 Enhancing the transfer of compensation data with BAdI implementation

Compensation Process Integration
10.3
439
Note
You will need to run the metadata transfer before you can complete the defining fields
for importing compensation data step.
Let’s begin by defining the fields for extracting compensation data from SAP ERP
HCM.
Define Fields for Extracting Compensation Data from SAP ERP HCM
In this step, you will map the fields required for extracting data to the compensa-
tion planning process in SuccessFactors. The RH_SFI_SYNCH_COMP_DATA report
is used to transfer the data from the SAP ERP HCM system to SuccessFactors.
Fields are mapped by defining field sets that provide the required data to the Suc-
cessFactors system. A field set is used to define a group of fields that are extracted
together. A field set must be specified as a runtime parameter in the extraction
program RH_SFI_SYNCH_COMP_DATA.

Define Fields for Importing Compensation Data from SuccessFactors
In this step, you will map the fields required for importing data from SuccessFac-
tors. The RH_SFI_IMPORT_COMP_DATA report transfers the data from Success-
Factors to the SAP ERP system. Then, the data is activated using the RH_SFI_ACTI-
VATE_COMP_DATA report.
SuccessFactors Configuration
The SuccessFactors configuration must be completed prior to performing this step, and
the metadata must be transferred.
Fields are mapped by defining field sets that provide the required data to the SAP
ERP system.
Ad Hoc Report
The ad hoc report must be enabled for use with the API user that SAP PI will use to
access the SuccessFactors system.

Each SuccessFactors instance will generate a different SuccessFactors ad hoc report and
compensation group IDs. In addition, this step cannot be transported from SAP and
therefore must be executed in each customer SAP project system.
Enhance Transfer of Compensation Data with BAdI Implementation
There are two standard BAdI implementations available when you activate com-
pensation data received from SuccessFactors: salary activations and bonus acti-
vations.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

During the activation process, the data is moved from the internal tables to the
SAP ERP HCM infotypes. Salary activations impact Infotype 0008 (Basic Pay), and
bonus activations impact Infotype 0015 (Additional Payments).
This step can be accessed from the Display IMG screen. Navigate to Personnel

On the implementations for BAdI definition HRSI_B_COMP_DATA_ACTIVA-
TION, activate HRSFI_COMP_BONUS_ACTIVATION and HRSFI_COMP_SALA-
RY_ACTIVATION. Then, click on the green checkmark.
Now, let’s switch gears to learn about the SuccessFactors side of the integration.
We’ll begin by discussing the SuccessFactors API configuration.
10.3.4
Step 3: SuccessFactors Configuration
The following activities describe the necessary SuccessFactors configuration steps
required for setting up the compensation data integration from SAP ERP HCM to
SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions. It covers the activation of the Suc-
cessFactors APIs, compensation template configurations, ad hoc report defini-
tions, the creation of and API user, and security setup.
To setup the configuration in SuccessFactors, perform the following tasks:
 Configure the compensation template
 Update compensation forms with staging table data
 Enable the web services SuccessFactors API
 Create SuccessFactors API user permissions
 Enable use of the Ad Hoc Report Builder
 Create ad hoc reporting definitions and share reports with the API user
Configure the Compensation Template
In this step, the user will log in to the SuccessFactors Provisioning tool to edit the
XML of an existing compensation template or to upload a new template. A com-

Compensation Process Integration
10.3
447
pensation template XML defines the fields and functions for the template. We
will be adding a group ID to the XML in this step, which will identify the specific
compensation plan used in SuccessFactors and enable it to be referenced in SAP
ERP HCM when running the import program. This step can be accessed from the
SuccessFactors Provisioning client home page (from there, click on Company 
Form Template Administration).
On the Companies screen, you will select the existing compensation template
used for the current year. Scroll down to the bottom of XML code on the Edit
Compensation Template screen.
Add a <comp-group> tag entry to specify a desired compensation group ID near
the very end of the XML file (see Figure 10.43). The ID attribute value should be
a value that can be easily identified in further processing.
Figure 10.43  Selecting the Existing Compensation Template for the Current Year
Once you have updated the group ID, save the code by clicking on Save.
Update Compensation Forms with Staging Table Data
Next, we’ll schedule a nightly job to update compensation forms. In this step, you
will setup a scheduled nightly job to update the compensation forms with the
data that will be imported into the compensation staging tables through the API.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
448
The nightly update job can be setup in the SuccessFactors Provisioning client home
page (click on Company  Managing Job Scheduler  Manage Scheduled Jobs).
On the Create New Job screen, enter a name for the job, the owner, and the com-
pensation template and job parameters. Once all details have been entered, click
on Save.
Next, we’ll enable the SuccessFactors API for web services.
Enable Web Services SuccessFactors API
In this step, you will activate SuccessFactors Talent Solutions web services API
features. This process follows the same steps as those covered in Section 10.2.4,
so refer back to that section for further details.
Next, we’ll cover creating SuccessFactors API user permissions for Compensation.
Create SuccessFactors API User Permissions
As part of the basic setup for integration, the API user will have already been cre-
ated. In this step, the user will setup and grant permissions for the API user to
gain access to compensation objects and the API login. This step can be accessed
from the Admin Tools, under Manage Employees  Set User Permissions  Select
Manage Permission Roles.
Note
This step is only applicable if Role-Based Permissions (RBP) are being used. If this is the
case, then an admin user with access to Admin Tools and specifically the RBP tasks
needs to complete this step.
From the Permission Role List, the user will need to specify the permission role
by typing in the Role Name or by searching through the list and clicking on the
Permission Role Name (e.g., sap_api_user). Under Permission Role Detail, click
on the Permission button to make the following settings for the API Login Priv-
ileges and Compensation Permissions (see Figure 10.44):
 API Login Privileges 
Make the selection under General User Permission only if you are using RBP.
 SFAPI User Login 
Specify the SFAPI user login previously created e.g. “SAP_API_USER”.

Compensation Process Integration
10.3

Figure 10.44  Specifying Role-Based Permissions
For non-Role-Based Permissions, complete the settings in the Admin Tools 
Manage API Login Permission section. If RBP is active and turned on, then Man-
age API Login Permissions will not appear under the Admin Tools.
API Login
Prevent the API user from being able to log in to the application UI by removing user
login permission from the Admin Tools. When setting up the API and resolving errors,
it’s useful to have access to the API data dictionary and API audit log. This access can be
granted in the Manager Integration tools permissions. Please note that in the API audit
log the full payload data (including sensitive data) can be visible; therefore, this access
should only be granted to the appropriate users.
Under the same Permission Settings screen, under Manage Compensation (in
the User Permissions section), select the Select All checkbox, and click on Done
(see Figure 10.45).

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

Figure 10.45  Setting Permissions
Finally, save your changes on the Permission Role Detail screen.
Next, we’ll look at the ad hoc report.
Enable Use of Ad Hoc Report Builder
This step turns on the Ad Hoc Report Builder feature and the Compensation Plan-
ning subdomain schemas in SuccessFactors Provisioning. This setting must be
enabled in each SuccessFactors instance that will be used in the integration sce-
nario (i.e., test and production).
This step can be accessed from the Provisioning client home page (go to Company 
Company Settings). Then, scroll down to the Ad Hoc Report Builder section
and select the Compensation Planning option (see Figure 10.46). Click on Save
Feature to save the setting.

Figure 10.46  Enabling the Use of the Ad Hoc Report Builder
Create Ad Hoc Reporting Definition and Share Reports with API User
This step creates the ad hoc report used to integrate with SAP ERP HCM. Once the
ad hoc report is created, an entity name is generated, which is referenced in SAP
ERP HCM. This step can be accessed from the main page, under Home  Reports 
Ad Hoc Reports.
On the Ad Hoc Reports screen, select Create New Report, and select Single
Domain Report as the Report Type and Compensation Planning as the Report
Definition Type (see Figure 10.47).
Figure 10.47  Creating a New Ad Hoc Report

From here, click on Create, and give the report a name and description in the
Report Name and Description fields.
Then, click on Data Sets, to select the template used for the report. Next, select
the compensation template you are using in your system from the dropdown list,
and click on OK. The dropdown list appears when you click on Select Template
(see Figure 10.48).
Figure 10.48  Creating a Compensation Report
Next, click on Columns, and select the following fields to include in the ad hoc
report (see Figure 10.49):
 Form Template ID
 Form Template Name
 User ID
 First Name
 Last Name
 Comp Plan Owner
 Comp Plan ID
 Comp Plan Name
 Merit
 Bonus
 Local Currency Code
Ensure that basic details such as the User ID and name are included as well as the
compensation planning values you want to import to SAP ERP HCM. When you
have finished selecting the fields, click on Done.

Compensation Process Integration
10.3

Figure 10.49  Ensuring Compensation Planning Values
The next step is to generate the report and check the output to make sure the
results look correct. On the General Info tab, click on Generate, and download
the CSV file for further checking. Save the report once you are satisfied that all the
required columns have been added.
Once the report has been saved, you need to share it with the API user. Search for
the report in the list on the Ad Hoc Reports screen. Click on the down arrow and
select the Share option.
On the Share Compensation Report for Integration screen, search for the API
user and select its checkbox under Search Results (see Figure 10.50).
Figure 10.50  Search for API User and Select Under the Search Results

Once selected, the user will appear on the right-hand box, in the Selected sec-
tion. Click on Share.
Now that you have created the ad hoc report and shared it with the API user, you
need to find the entity name in the API Data Dictionary. To access the API Data
Dictionary, go to Admin Tools  Company Settings  SFAPI Data Dictionary (see
Figure 10.51).
Search for “AdhocReport_xxxx” entities, where “xxxx” represents the unique
number for the report (there could be several unique numbers, depending on
how many reports have been created). Expand the report detail by clicking on the
plus sign (+) until you find the one that you created. Note the ad hoc report entity
identified with the unique number. This value will be used in SAP ERP HCM to
link to the correct report during integration.

Metadata Transfer Report
The list displayed in the API Data Dictionary is sorted alphabetically, so the most recently
created report should appear at the bottom of the list. This value, along with the com-
pensation group ID, is required for the transfer of metadata step. The metadata transfer
report will need to be run in SAP ERP HCM once the SuccessFactors configuration is
completed. This is required in order to complete the field mapping configurations for
importing compensation data. This is covered in the Import Metadata from SuccessFac-
tors section.
In this section, via the MedTron example, we provided the detailed configuration
and technical steps required to implement the SuccessFactors Compensation inte-
gration with SAP ERP HCM using the Talent Hybrid integration deployment model.
On successful completion of the configuration steps, you will be able to run the
compensation integration programs between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors.
Compensation data in SAP ERP HCM will be exported to SuccessFactors, where
managers will be able to complete the compensation planning process by awarding
a merit increase or bonuses to their employees. The updated pay values will be
imported to SAP ERP HCM from the SuccessFactors Compensation module, where
the salary increase or one-off payment will be further processed in SAP Payroll.
10.4
Recruiting Process Integration
In this section, we’ll discuss the implementation steps necessary for both SAP ERP
HCM and SuccessFactors to implement the recruiting process integration. We’ll
use a client scenario to demonstrate our case. A snapshot of our client is pre-
sented ahead.
Prerequisites
Refer to Section 10.2.1 for a list of the system prerequisites required prior to beginning
the configuration of the recruiting process integration scenario.
In addition, you will need to ensure that the following relevant configurations and cus-
tomizations have been completed:
 Ensure that you have installed the latest SAP SuccessFactors Integration Add-on,
which can be downloaded from SAP Service Marketplace and implemented in the
SAP development landscape (refer to SAP Note 1841471 for more information).
 The integration middleware must also be configured (i.e., SAP PI integration or SAP
HANA Cloud integration; refer to Section 10.1).

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
456
 After the middleware is configured, software and security requirements will need to
be applied to grant a user access to the SAP IMG and to the new recruiting programs.
 To enable SuccessFactors recruiting integration with SAP ERP HCM, you must also
implement SuccessFactors employee profile integration with SAP ERP HCM (refer to
section Section 10.2 for more information).
 You will need access to the SuccessFactors Provisioning client and administration
access (Admin Tools) to the SuccessFactors tenant.
10.4.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study focuses on how a customer who desires to implement SuccessFac-
tors Talent Management Solutions will integrate and transfer their recruiting data
from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions using SAP PI
on-premise as the integration middleware. Let’s look at our client scenario and
process overview.
Client Scenario
MedTron has successfully implemented the employee and compensation process
integrations as part of their Talent Hybrid integration deployment model so far.
Medtron’s focus is to implement SuccessFactors Recruiting next as well as inte-
grating the recruiting data between SAP and SuccessFactors using the standard
recruiting process integration using SAP PI.
Currently, MedTron uses OM and PA in SAP to manage its employee data.
MedTron runs SAP ERP HCM ECC 6.0 EHP 6. In addition, the company has been
advised to use SAP PI version 7.4 Java stack as its middleware.
The biggest concern for MedTron is keeping the systems and the HCM data in
sync between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors. This thought has been keeping
the IT Vice President up at night. Therefore, the SuccessFactors consultant spent
quality time assuring the client that the dual systems will have a seamless and suc-
cessful implementation with leveraging SAP’s standard recruiting process integra-
tions.
Over the course of 14 months, this project was successfully sold based on the
modularity of the solution that allows the client to grow with the system over
time. In addition, the simplicity for the end user made this decision much easier.

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
457
In fact, the benefits of easy, fast deployment of recruiting functionality in the
cloud, along with the ability to leverage standard Integration Add-ons delivered
by SAP to ensure that the data is in sync between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFac-
tors, gave the VP of IT peace of mind and the comfort of knowing that this migra-
tion and the management of data involved will be successful.
The business requirements for MedTron’s Talent Hybrid deployment model will
rely on the following details:
 Vacancies will be maintained in SAP OM, utilizing Infotype 1007, where the
job requisition will be triggered.
 There will be no custom development required.
Process Overview
The following four main steps are required to setup the recruiting process inte-
gration from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions:
 Step 1: Basic setup 
There are basic integration configuration steps that must be performed in order
to begin this process. This includes tasks such as importing metadata from Suc-
cessFactors and activating the vacancy Infotype 1007 in SAP ERP HCM (see Sec-
tion 10.4.2).
 Step 2: SAP ERP HCM configuration 
In this step, you will apply the recruiting basic configuration and customiza-
tions in SAP ERP HCM. The tasks involved in this step range from activating
additional functions to choosing an option for deriving the SuccessFactors
HCM user ID from SAP ERP HCM (see Section 10.4.3).
 Step 3: SuccessFactors configuration 
This step provides the configuration activities that take place in the SuccessFac-
tors Talent Management Solutions Tenant and Provisioning client to support
recruiting integration between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors in the cloud
(see Section 10.4.4).
 Step 4: SAP PI middleware setup 
For step 4, you will need to setup the SAP PI middleware. Therefore, refer to
Section 10.1 for a detailed description.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
458
The integration specified here is tailored to those customers using the Talent
Hybrid deployment approach to run the following systems:
 SAP ERP HCM on-premise for:
 Personnel Administration (PA)
 Organizational Management (OM)
 Benefits, time, and payroll (PY)
 SuccessFactors for Talent Management Suite in the cloud, which includes
Recruiting
Because both systems are used to process recruiting data, and in order to avoid
disparate processes, it is imperative that the processes are integrated as tightly as
possible from one system to another.
The process overview can also be divided into two main scenarios:
 Job requisition creation scenario
 The Job Requisition process can be triggered from the SAP OM module.
 When a new position is created in the SAP OM module, the SuccessFactors
job requisition ID is assigned to the position, and it subsequently triggers the
creation of a job requisition in SuccessFactors Recruiting.
 The requisition will have the same job requisition ID assigned in SAP OM
Infotype 1107 (SFSF Job Requisition).
 These data objects are necessary for the recruiting process and can be trans-
ferred to—and stored in—SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions.
 The data is then stored as requisition data to support the recruiting process
with information such as job description, responsible manager, position
title, location, and country.
 Candidate selection process scenario
 The candidate selection process allows users to conduct searches and find a
qualified candidate for a specific requisition.
 At this point, the candidate’s data is transferred back to SAP ERP to be hired
directly into the new position that was created in the SAP OM module.
 The candidate is therefore hired into the SAP PA module as an employee.

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
459
Consultant Note
Some customers do not use the SAP OM module and thus would not use a new position
to trigger a job requisition in SuccessFactors.
However, they may need other entities in the job requisition—such as personnel area/
subarea, employee group/subgroup, cost center, or country—that are required when a
candidate has been selected to be hired.
Customers using SAP OM and the position object will have personnel structure data
maintained in SAP OM and therefore only need the position to identify the area to
which the candidate needs to be assigned.
In addition, it is very likely that customers have customer-specific infotypes or custom
infotype fields in SAP ERP HCM that they also want to see in the SuccessFactors recruit-
ing system. Some customers may have different views on the data required for the
recruiting process.
You should be mindful that the goal for the recruiting integration should be to consider
only those data or infotype fields that are absolutely required for the integration process
for hiring a new employee or for rehiring employees. Other information that customers
may collect with the SuccessFactors Recruiting system can also be transferred, but it dif-
fers from customer to customer.
A second goal is to make the integration interface as flexible as possible. Customers can
then extend the number of fields they wish to transfer from SuccessFactors HCM to SAP
ERP HCM. As before, let’s begin with the basic setup.
10.4.2
Step 1: Basic Setup
The basic setup for the recruiting process integration is comprised of two import-
ant steps:
 Importing metadata from SuccessFactors
 Activating the Vacancy infotype (1007) in SAP ERP HCM
We will begin our discussion by looking at the first of these two important tasks.
Import Metadata from SuccessFactors
To import metadata from SuccessFactors, the user will execute the report Import-
ing Metadata from SuccessFactors HCM (Transaction RH_SFI_SYNCH_META-
DATA), which is needed to extract the metadata from SuccessFactors Recruiting
into SAP ERP HCM.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
460
This data will then be transferred and used as follows:
 For input help
 To provide dropdown values in the integration programs
 In configuration for the recruiting processes
This step can be accessed via the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Management 
Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Importing
Metadata from SuccessFactors BizX. Then, on the initial screen, make the
selection for the Synchronization Settings for Recruiting, which includes
checkbox selections for SFSF ad hoc reports and SFSF job requisition templates,
described ahead (see Figure 10.52):
 SFSF Ad Hoc Reports 
When the selection is made, this setting will extract and store the following
information into SAP tables:
 Ad hoc report IDs and descriptions (table T77SFI_SFO: SFSF Objects)
 Ad hoc technical names and labels of the fields that the relevant ad hoc
report contains (table T77SFI_SFO_FLDS: SFSF Object Fields)
 SFSF Job Requisitions Templates 
When the selection is made, this setting will extract and store the following
information into SAP tables:
 Job requisition template IDs and descriptions (table T77SFI_SFO: SFSF Objects)
 Job requisition technical names and labels of the fields that the relevant job
requisition template contains (table T77SFI_SFO_FLDS: SFSF Object Fields)
Figure 10.52  Sync Settings for Recruiting

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
461
Once your selections have been saved, the report will then need to be scheduled
in the follow-on systems (e.g., test or productive systems) as a regular background
job to update the metadata and continually keep it current.
Consultant Note
Before we begin the first step, preliminary actions must first take place. Prior to import-
ing any metadata, the following SuccessFactors configuration scenarios must be com-
pleted:
 To execute the report, you must have the proper security role to access the SAP ref-
erence IMG.
 Each SuccessFactors instance will generate a different SFSF ad hoc report and job
requisition template ID.
 In addition, this step cannot be transported from SAP and therefore must be exe-
cuted in each customer SAP project system.
Activate the Vacancy Infotype
For our case study, MedTron Inc. plans to use the Vacancy infotype (1007). Thus,
we will activate Infotype 1007 in SAP ERP HCM. The Vacancy infotype can be
activated in SAP table T77S0 or by following the SAP IMG menu path Personnel
Management  Organizational Management  Infotype Settings  Activate/
Deactivate “Vacancy” Infotype.
Once you arrive on the Vacancy Editing screen, the value abbreviation must be
entered for the Synchronization Settings for Recruiting.
Placing a “1” in the Value Abbr. for Group PPVAC. SEM ABBR—PPVAC field
indicates that an unfilled position is only considered vacant if it has Infotype
1007, thus making the vacancy infotype Active.
When the staffing status is updated on the Vacancy infotype, the corresponding
SFSF Requisition (Infotype 1107) will automatically be updated. The SFSF Requi-
sition infotype is used by the recruiting integration programs.
By leaving Value Abbr. Group PPVAC—PPVAC blank, Vacancy Management is
Deactivated, and the Vacancy infotype is not used.
In this instance, the SFSF Requisition infotype will need to be updated directly.
Note
For MedTron, the Vacancy infotype is activated. PPVAC is set to a value of “1”.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

Now that the basic setup has been completed, let’s turn our attention to the SAP
ERP HCM configuration setup.
10.4.3
Step 2: SAP ERP HCM Configuration
Here, you will need to apply the recruiting basic configuration and customiza-
tions in SAP ERP HCM, required for the recruiting integration from SAP ERP
HCM to SuccessFactors.
The recruiting basic configuration for SAP consists of the following 16 tasks:
 Activate additional functions
 Assign SuccessFactors HCM objects to field sets
 Map SuccessFactors HCM fields and SAP ERP fields to each other
 Check field sets for required fields and correct
 Implement BAdIs for transfer of job requisitions (SAP to SFSF)
 Define values of job requisition status used in SFSF
 Specify handling of existing vacancies during data transfer
 Display Infotype SFSF job requisition in OM applications
 Correct status of job requisitions in SAP
 Implement BAdI for transfer of job applications (SuccessFactors to SAP)
 Change application status values used in SuccessFactors HCM
 Define additional display fields
 Define names of SuccessFactors HCM fields
 Change print form used for PDF overview
 Choose option for deriving SuccessFactors HCM user ID from SAP ERP
 Enter ID of candidate template from SuccessFactors HCM
Let’s begin with the first step.
Activate Additional Functions
In this step, the user will activate two switches. The first is for transferring the
SAP personnel number to SuccessFactors HCM, and the second is for triggering
the creation of job requisitions in SuccessFactors HCM from SAP ERP HCM.

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
463
This step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-
gration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Activate Additional Functions.
Let’s now discuss how to activate the first switch, which transfers the SAP person-
nel number to SuccessFactors.
On the Activation Switches screen, set the parameter values for the following
functions (see Figure 10.53):
 CANDIDATE_UPDATE_ACTIVE = “X”
By setting the parameter value to “X”, this defines that you want to transfer the
SAP personnel number back to SuccessFactors HCM after transferring and
accepting a candidate into SAP ERP HCM as a new employee.
When the personnel number transfers to SuccessFactors HCM, it becomes the
user ID and is stored in the candidate object table in SuccessFactors HCM.
This establishes a connection between the data of the external candidate, who
applied via SuccessFactors HCM and that of the new employee who has been
hired in SAP ERP Personnel Administration.
To activate the second switch, we need to trigger the creation of job requisi-
tions in SuccessFactors HCM from SAP ERP HCM.
 JOB_REQUISITION_INTEGR_ACTIVE = “X”
By setting the parameter value to “X”, you can define whether you want to
transfer information about vacant positions from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFac-
tors HCM so that corresponding job requisitions can be created or changed
there.
For this case study, the activation switches for the candidate update and job
requisition are activated and set to a parameter value of “1”.
Figure 10.53  Activation Switches—Setting the Parameter

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
464
Vacancy Information
The default setting is that the creation of job requisitions in SuccessFactors HCM is not
triggered from SAP ERP HCM.
If you want to transfer information about vacant positions from the SAP ERP HCM sys-
tem to SuccessFactors HCM and want to create corresponding job requisitions in Suc-
cessFactors HCM, then set the value of the parameter JOB_REQUISITION_INTEGR_
ACTIVE to “X”.
For migrating existing vacancies, see the Specify Handling of Existing Vacancies during
Data Transfer section.
Now, let’s discuss the next task, assigning SuccessFactors HCM objects to field sets.
Assign SuccessFactors HCM Objects to Field Sets
In this step, the user will assign SuccessFactors objects that are transferred from
SuccessFactors via the Importing Metadata from the SuccessFactors ad hoc
report to existing field sets that map single SuccessFactors fields to SAP ERP fields.
The step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-
gration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Assign SuccessFactors BizX Objects
to Field Sets.
On the Assignment of SFSF Objects to Fields Sets screen, you’ll need to set the
parameter values for the following functions:
 Field Set 
This field is used as a grouping, which maps individual SuccessFactors HCM
fields to SAP ERP fields.
 Field Set Description 
This field is used to describe the field set.
 SFSF Object ID 
This field is the SuccessFactors object ID, which is the recruiting ad hoc report
technical name or the job requisition template ID that contains the fields you
wish to import into SAP ERP HCM. The dropdown configurable values are
filled during the importing of the metadata in the basic settings configuration.

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
465
 SFSF Object Type 
This field specifies the type of SuccessFactors object (e.g., the ad hoc report or
the job requisition template).
 SFSF Object Description 
This field describes the SuccessFactors object.
For MedTron, the standard SAP_DEMO_01 field set is used and assigned to the cor-
rect SuccessFactors recruiting ad hoc report (see Figure 10.54).
Figure 10.54  Assignment of SFSF Objects to Field Sets
SuccessFactors Recruiting Ad Hoc
In order for the correct SuccessFactors Recruiting ad hoc report to be selected, the
report must be created in SuccessFactors, and the import metadata step (discussed
under the Section 10.4.2) must be executed.
This completes the SAP ERP HCM configuration setup. Now, let’s discuss check-
ing field sets for required fields and how to correct them.
Map SuccessFactors HCM Fields and SAP ERP HCM Fields to Each Other
In this step, the user will define and map the SuccessFactors fields and SAP fields
to each other in the fields and mapping dialog structure. It is the mapping that is
required to transfer job requisition data from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors
HCM and applications from SuccessFactors Recruiting to SAP ERP HCM. Prior to
setting this up, you must have used the Import Metadata from SuccessFactors
HCM ad-hoc report to transfer the objects that you want to assign the SAP fields
to. Once the data objects have been transferred, you may move forward with this
activity to create the field set FS_01 and define the field mappings as desired, then
transport the field set to the follow-on systems.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

The step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-
gration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Map SuccessFactors BizX Fields and
SAP ERP Fields to Each Other.
In order to map the SFSF fields to SAP fields, the user will need to highlight the
field set and double-click on the Fields and Mapping folder under the dialog
structure.
To create a new entry to map, set the following fields (see Figure 10.55):
 SFSF Field ID 
This is the SuccessFactors field name.
 Mapping Mode 
The SuccessFactors fields can be:
 T: Mapped via Table,
 B: Mapped via BAdI (this can be mapped via custom BAdI logic: BAdI—Map-
ping of SAP ERP infotype fields to SFSF fields), or
 N: Not Mapped (display only).
 Country Dependent 
Select this checkbox if you have specified a separate field mapping for each
country.
 Required 
Select this checkbox if the fields are required and should be checked during
data import. If a required field is missing, then the job application is sent back
to SuccessFactors with an error.
 Field Description 
This field is used to describe the SFSF Field ID.
Figure 10.55  Mapping the Fields and Mapping Modes

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
467
Once the fields and mapping modes have been defined, double-click on the Map-
ping to Infotype Fields dialog structure to create a new entry that will include
the SuccessFactors fields that you have set as Mapped via Table in the previous
step. Here, you will define the following details (see Figure 10.56):
 Country Grouping 
This field defines the country that the mapping is applicable for. This is only
required if you have set the field as country dependent and require separate
mappings for different countries. In this example, we are using Ctry Grouping
value “99 Other Countries”.
 Infotype 
This is the SAP infotype to which the SFSF field is mapped. In this example, we
are mapping the SFSF field ID RCM_APPLICATION_ADDRESS to the Address
Infotype (0006).
 Subtype 
This field is the SAP subtype to which the SFSF field is mapped. In this example,
we are mapping subtype 1.
 Field Name 
This is the SAP field name to which the SFSF field is mapped. In this example,
we entered the technical field name STRAS (Address Line) that the SFSF ID
should be mapped to.
 IT Record No. 
This is the SAP infotype record number to which the SFSF field is mapped. This
is used to differentiate between records that have the same key.

Now, let’s discuss checking field sets for required fields and correcting.
Check Field Sets for Required Fields and Correct
Once the SuccessFactors fields are mapped to the SAP ERP HCM fields, the user
can run a validation program to check if the fields marked as Required are
mapped correctly and do not contain errors.
This step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Management 
Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Integration
Scenario for Recruiting Data  Check Field Sets for Required Fields and Correct.
On the Insert and Check Required Fields in Field Sets screen, execute the
report for the SFSF object type in test mode. Then, deselect Test Run when you
are ready for the productive run (see Figure 10.57).
Figure 10.57  Insert and Check Required Fields in Field Sets
Note
If the configured fields or indicators are missing and they are required in SAP, then the
report will add these fields automatically. If the Required indicator is not set for fields
that the SAP ERP HCM system requires, then this report sets this indicator.
BAdIs for Transfer of Job Requisitions
SAP provides three BAdIs that support the data transfer of job requisition data for
recruiting integration from SAP ERP HCM to SuccessFactors BizX, which can be
accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Management  Integration
Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Integration Scenario
for Recruiting Data  Transfer of Job Applications from SuccessFactors BizX
to SAP ERP.
These three BAdIs are as follows:

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
469
 Determination of job requisition template from SFSF 
This BAdI can be used for custom logic for determining the appropriate ID of the
job requisition template from SuccessFactors for a specific position to be
staffed so that the job requisition for the position can be created. SAP ERP HCM
runs through the implementation of this BAdI when executing the Create and
Update Job Requisitions in SuccessFactors report (RH_SFI_TRIGGER_JOB_
REQUISITION).
 Mapping of SAP ERP infotype fields to SFSF fields 
This BAdI can be used for custom logic for mapping the SFSF to SAP fields. In
order for SAP to run through the implementation of this BAdI, you will need to
set Mapped via BAdI when mapping the SuccessFactors field.
 Mapping of SAP ERP infotype fields to SFSF fields—changing of mapping
results 
This BAdI can be used to further process the result of mapping SAP ERP HCM
fields to SuccessFactors fields. For example, you can distribute the content of
an SAP ERP field to multiple SuccessFactors fields.
SuccessFactors Data Tranfers
During the transfer of data to SuccessFactors, SAP ERP checks whether the SAP ERP info-
type fields are assigned to SuccessFactors fields. For fields that use the mapping mode
Mapped via BAdI, SAP ERP confirms the implementation of the BAdI mapping SAP ERP
infotype fields to SFSF fields and checks all fields for a suitable implementation of this BAdI.
For this case study example, MedTron is not using any BAdIs.
This completes the SAP ERP HCM configuration setup. Now, let’s discuss how to
define values of a job requisition status unused in SFSF.
Define Values of Job Requisition Status Used in SFSF
In this step, the user will specify the status labels that are used in SuccessFactors
HCM in the JobReqStatus selection list for the Status field of the job requisition
object. This customizing activity is only required if the statuses in SuccessFactors
HCM are different from the standard statuses.
The step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-
gration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Transfer of Job Requisition Data

from SAP ERP to SuccessFactors BizX  Define Values of Job Requisition Sta-
tus Used in SFSF.
Furthermore, this information is required for the transfer of job requisition data
for positions from the SAP ERP HCM system to SuccessFactors HCM so that the
web services can set the status correctly in SuccessFactors HCM (see Figure 10.58).
Here, you will insert the status in the parameter value and save your changes.
Figure 10.58  Inserting the Status Parameter
Specify Handling of Existing Vacancies during Data Transfer
In this step, the user will define how to handle existing vacancies in SAP ERP
HCM after activating the use of Infotype 1107 for job requisition transfer to Suc-
cessFactors HCM (Infotype 1107 was discussed in Section 10.4.2).

cies During Data Transfer, as shown in Figure 10.59.
Here, you will specify the type of transfer you want to handle current vacancies
by selecting No Transfer or Standard Transfer (see Figure 10.60):
 No Transfer 
You will make this selection if you do not want to transfer data on existing
vacancies to SuccessFactors HCM. Consider the following points:
 When No Transfer is selected, this report will generate SFSF Job Requisi-
tion Infotype records and set the transfer mode to No Transfer.
 When future changes are made to the vacancy record, they will not be trans-
ferred to SuccessFactors.
 This option is mainly used for job requisitions that have been already created
manually in SuccessFactors HCM for existing vacancies.
 Standard Transfer 
Make this selection if you want to transfer data for existing vacancies to Suc-
cessFactors HCM. This option is used when job requisitions have not been
created in SuccessFactors for existing vacancies.
Figure 10.60  Migrate Existing Vacancies after Activating Job Requisition Transfer
For the MedTron Inc. case study, we will select the No Transfer option. Once the
selection has been made, execute the report and exit the screen.
Let’s now discuss how to display Infotype 1107 in Organizational Management
applications.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
472
Display Infotype 1107 in Organizational Management Applications
In this step, the user will specify whether open SuccessFactors job requisitions for
positions of an organizational unit and the SFSF Job Requisition tab should
appear in Transactions PPOCE, PPOSE, and PPOME, which will be used by
administrators who need to review and edit records for Infotype 1107 stored for
the positions.

Now, let’s discuss the correct status of job requisitions in the SAP ERP system.
Correct Status of Job Requisitions in the SAP ERP HCM System
In this step, the user runs the report to change the status of a job requisition in
SAP ERP (RH_SFI_JOB_REQ_STATUS_CHANGE).
If the status is different from the one that the job requisition has in SuccessFactors
HCM (e.g., a change from Initial to Open status), then this change affects the
SAP ERP HCM system only. There is no communication with SuccessFactors in
MedTron’s case, and there were no job requisitions prior to the project that
required a status change.

On the Change Status of Job Requisitions screen, make the following adjust-
ments:
 Enter the position(s) for which you want to correct the status.
 Click on the Execute button to review the log that tells you the number of job
requisitions for which the status has been successfully changed:
 If errors occurred, then the positions in question are listed with relevant
error messages.
 In these cases, double-click on the row of choice to enter the ID of the job
requisition in the Change Status of Job Requisitions dialog box (see Figure
10.61). Click on Enter, then on Save, and exit the screen.
Figure 10.61  Change Status of Job Requisitions
The user must then execute the report to review the log and see the number of
job requisitions for which the status has been successfully changed.
If errors occur, the positions in question are listed with the relevant error mes-
sages. In these cases, double-click on the row of choice and enter the ID of the job
requisition in the Change Status of Job Requisitions dialog box, and press
(Enter).
This completes this step. We will now look at the BAdI used to transfer job appli-
cations from SuccessFactors to SAP.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
476
BAdI for Transfer of Job Applications
SAP provides three BAdIs that support the data transfer of job applications for the
recruiting integration from SuccessFactors HCM to SAP ERP HCM. For the pur-
poses of this case study, MedTron is not using any BAdIs.
The step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-
gration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Transfer of Job Applications from
SuccessFactors BizX to SAP ERP.
These BAdIs include the following uses:
 Mapping of SFSF Fields to SAP ERP Infotype Fields 
This BAdI can be used for custom logic for mapping SuccessFactors fields to
SAP infotype fields. You’ll need a separate BAdI implementation for each field.
 Mapping of SFSF Fields to SAP ERP IT Fields: Change of Mapping Result 
This BAdI can be used to further process the result of mapping SuccessFactors
HCM fields to SAP ERP HCM fields. For example, you can distribute the content
of a SuccessFactors HCM field to multiple SAP ERP HCM fields.
 Determination of Further Data for Recruiting Scenario from SFSF 
This BAdI can be used to derive the country grouping and one or more person-
nel action types from recruiting data that you transfer from SuccessFactors:
 When importing data from the SuccessFactors system, the SAP ERP HCM sys-
tem runs through the implementation of this BAdI and attempts to determine
the chosen information from the transferred SuccessFactors field contents.
 It then uses this information to map the field contents transferred from Suc-
cessFactors to infotype fields in the SAP ERP HCM system.
Next, we’ll discuss changing the application status values used in SuccessFac-
tors HCM.
Change Application Status Values Used in SuccessFactors HCM
In SuccessFactors HCM, the user will specify the labels for the status within the
Application Status field of the Job Application object in the Hire Status cate-
gory.
Importing recruiting data into SAP ERP HCM requires a certain status for the
application so that the web services can set the status correctly in SuccessFactors

HCM. You will only need to make settings in this activity if you use a status in
SuccessFactors HCM that is different from the standard delivered status.

ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX 
Integration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Transfer of Job Applications

Used in SuccessFactors BizX.
In the case of MedTron, when we imported the recruiting data into SAP ERP we
defined the standard statuses. If you use different settings than the standard deliv-
ered ones, then enter the values for the parameters of your choice (see Figure
10.62).
Figure 10.62  Define Status
This step is now completed. Next, we will look at defining additional display
fields.
Define Additional Display Fields
In this step, the user defines the fields that are displayed as additional columns in
the application for the further processing of imported applications (Transaction
HRSFI_RCT_HIRE). You will only need to configure this setting if you want to dis-
play other columns in addition to the default columns. For MedTron, we did not
configure this setting, because we did not want to display other columns in addi-
tion to the default columns.
If you want to display other columns, the step can be accessed using the SAP IMG
menu path Personnel Management  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM

cessing of Imported Applications  Define Additional Display Fields.
On the Custom Fields screen, you will enter the technical names of the Success-
Factors fields of your choice as the values for the parameters of your choice. If
you do not require any additional columns, then make sure that the parameter
value is empty for all parameters (see Figure 10.63).
Figure 10.63  Change View Custom Fields
Headers and Field Labels
You will need to define headers and field labels for all fields that you want to display as
additional columns.
Define Names of SuccessFactors HCM Fields
In this step, the user will specify the headers and field labels for recruiting that
you transfer from SuccessFactors HCM to SAP ERP HCM to display in the Job
Applications Transferred from the SuccessFactors program (Transaction HRSFI_
RCT_HIRE) or in the data overview as a PDF document. In SuccessFactors, the
field names can have up to 255 characters.
SAP ERP HCM requires shorter versions of the field names in order to display
them; headers can consist of up to 10 characters, and field labels can consist up to
40 characters. For MedTron, we defined the names of the SuccessFactors headers

Recruiting Process Integration

and field labels required for the recruiting data transfer within the character lim-
its for field names.

 Header 
Column headers in the table of transferred applications
 SFSF Field Label 
Field names in the detail view

With this step completed, we can now move onto discussing how to change print
forms used for a PDF overview.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10

Change Print Form Used for PDF Overview
In this step, the user will specify a customer-specific PDF-based print form that
the application for the further processing of imported applications (Transaction
HRSFI_RCT_HIRE) will use for the PDF overview of imported data. You will need
to verify that the customer-specific print form is based on the interface HRSFI_
RECRUIT_APPLICATIONDATA.

On the PDF Overview screen, enter the form name of your choice as the value of
the CUSTOM_APPLICATION_OVERVIEW parameter. Only set this value if you want to
use a different print form from the standard print form. Then, save your entries
(see Figure 10.65).
With respect to MedTron, we entered the form name “CUSTOM_APPLICATION_
OVERVIEW” and set it as the value.
Figure 10.65  Change View PDF
Now, let’s discuss choosing options for deriving the SuccessFactors user ID from
SAP ERP.
Choose Option for Deriving SuccessFactors HCM User ID from SAP ERP HCM
In this step, the user will define how SAP ERP HCM derives a user ID for Suc-
cessFactors from the SAP personnel number, if you have adopted a candidate
transferred from SuccessFactors as a new employee in SAP ERP Personnel
Administration.

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4
481
SAP ERP HCM transfers this user ID to SuccessFactors so that a connection can be
established there between the data of the external candidate who applied via Suc-
cessFactors and that of the new employee who has been hired via Personnel
Administration in the SAP ERP HCM system.
For MedTron, we defined the SuccessFactors user ID from the SAP central person
number.
This step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-
gration Scenario for Recruiting Data  Transfer of Job Applications from

User ID from SAP ERP.
On the User ID Provisioning Option screen, enter one of the following three
options as the value of the PROVISIONING_OPTION parameter:
 PROVISIONING_OPTION = 1 
Placing a “1” in the parameter value indicates that you will use the employee’s
Central Person (CP) ID.
 PROVISIONING_OPTION = 2 
Placing a “2” in the parameter value indicates that you will use the ID that is
stored for the employee in the External Person ID field (PERSONID_EXT) of
Infotype 0709 (Person ID).
 PROVISIONING_OPTION = X 
Placing an “X” in the parameter value indicates that you will define a customer-
specific implementation. To do so, use the method GET_USERID of the Replica-
tion of Employee Data BAdI (HRSFI_B_EMPL_DATA_ REPLICATION).
For MedTron, the parameter value of 1 has been set (to use the employee’s CP ID;
see Figure 10.66).
Figure 10.66  Change View—User ID Provisioning Option

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10

Enter ID of Candidate Template from SuccessFactors HCM
In this step, the user will define which template you use for candidates in Success-
Factors HCM. SAP ERP HCM will need this information in order to transfer the
user ID derived from the SAP Personnel Number to the correct applicant in Suc-
cessFactors HCM.
For MedTron, we defined the template we used for candidates in SuccessFactors
HCM so that we could transfer the user ID (derived from the SAP central person
number) to the appropriate applicant in SuccessFactors.
The step can be accessed using the SAP IMG menu path Personnel Manage-
ment  Integration Add-on for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors BizX  Inte-

template ID that you use for candidates in SuccessFactors as the value, then save
your changes (see Figure 10.67).

This completes the final step for SAP ERP HCM configuration setup.
10.4.4 Step 3: SuccessFactors Configuration
We are now shifting our focus to the SuccessFactors side of the recruiting integra-
tion that we did for MedTron.
This section covers the configuration activities for MedTron that take place in the
SuccessFactors Talent Management Solutions Tenant and Provisioning client to
support the recruiting integration between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors in
the cloud.

Consultant Note
Your consultant must complete the Introduction to SuccessFactors Academy training
course prior to performing the next steps.
SuccessFactors configuration settings consists of the following 12 steps:
 Activate the API
 Provide API access
 Enable Ad Hoc Report Builder
 Edit job requisition template
 Edit candidate profile template
 Edit job requisition application template
 Edit offer detail template
 Application status configuration
 Add status to candidate picklist
 Add status to job requisition status
 Map custom fields
 Create ad hoc report
Let’s now discuss the first step of the SuccessFactors configuration setup: activat-
ing the API.
Activate the API
In this step, we will log in to the SuccessFactors Provisioning tool to activate the
SuccessFactors API features. This step was covered in the basic settings of the
employee data integration case study (see Section 10.2.2). For more information,
refer to the Enable Web Services SuccessFactors API section (in Section 10.2.4).
Provide API Access
In this step, we will need to set up and grant Role-Based Permissions for the
MedTron API user to gain access to recruiting objects and API login.
For SuccessFactors instances that have RBP activated, follow this step to set per-
missions. This step can be accessed from the Admin Tools, under Manage

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

Employees  Set User Permissions  Select Manage Permission Roles (see Fig-
ure 10.68).
Admin Tool Access
The user must have the proper access to the Admin Tools in order to access administra-
tive settings for security and recruiting management activities.
Figure 10.68  Manage Permission Roles
From the Permission Role list, the user will need to specify the permission role.
To do this, type in the role name or search through the list. Then, click on the per-
mission role name (e.g., API_USER).
Under Permission Role Detail, click on the Permission button to make the fol-
lowing settings for the API Login Privileges and Recruiting Permissions:
 API Login Privileges 
Make the selection under General User Permission only if you are using RBP.
 SFAPI User Login 
Specify the SFAPI user login previously created e.g. “SAP_API_USER”.
Apply Role-Based Permissions for MedTron
For MedTron, we are using RBP. The specific steps we took for MedTron are as
follows.
On the Permission Settings screen, under Recruiting Permissions, make the fol-
lowing SuccessFactors API selections only if you are using RBP:
 Recruiting Permissions to Access the Recruiting Objects via API
 SFAPI Retrieve Candidate Permission

Recruiting Process Integration
10.4

 SFAPI Retrieve Job Code Permission
 SFAPI Update Job Code Permission
 SFAPI Insert Job Code Permission
 SFAPI Upsert Job Code Permission
 SFAPI Retrieve Job Requisition Permission
 SFAPI Update Job Requisition Permission
 SFAPI Insert Job Requisition Permission
 SFAPI Upsert Job Requisition Permission
 SFAPI Retrieve Job Posting Permission
 SFAPI Retrieve Job Applicant Permission
 SFAPI Retrieve Assessment Order Permission
For Non-Role-Based Permissions
If you have a client that prefers non-Role-Based Permissions, then you will need to do
take a different approach. Complete the settings in the Admin Tools  Manage API
Login Permission section. If RBP is active and turned on, then Manage API Login Per-
missions will not appear under Admin Tools.
Once you have completed granting permissions for all 18 SuccessFactors API
functionalities, save your changes, and return to the Admin Tools page.
The final task of granting API access is setting the API login exceptions for the API
user. For more information, refer to Section 10.2.4, under SuccessFactors API
Login Exception.
APIs
To prevent the API user from being able to log in to the application UI, deselect User
Login Permission from the Admin Tools.
When setting up the API and resolving errors, it’s useful to have access to the API data
dictionary and API audit log. This access can be granted in the Manager Integration

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
486
Tools Permissions page. Note that in the API audit log the full payload data (including
sensitive data) can be visible. Therefore, access should only be granted to only the
appropriate users.
Let’s move on to the next step, which will describe how to enable Ad Hoc Report
Builder.
Enable Ad Hoc Report Builder
In this step, we will activate the Ad Hoc Report Builder for recruiting for
MedTron.
This step can be accessed from the SuccessFactors Provisioning client home
page; follow the menu path Company  Edit Companies  Company Settings (see
Figure 10.69).
Figure 10.69  Company Settings
On the Company Settings screen, under Analytics and Dashboard Tabs & Misc
Reporting, activate the setting for Recruiting V2 by selecting the checkbox, and
save your changes to activate the Ad Hoc Report Builder for recruiting.
Edit Job Requisition Template
A job requisition template XML file defines the fields and functions for the type
of requisition as well as the application status set that is to be referenced.

Edit Candidate Profile Template
In this step, we will log in to the SuccessFactors provisioning tool to edit the can-
didate profile template and add the relevant fields that MedTron requires.
This step can be accessed from the SuccessFactors Provisioning client home page;
follow the menu path Company  Managing Recruiting  Edit Candidate Pro-
file Template.
On the Company screen, on the Edit Candidate Profile Template page, make
the relevant edits to the candidate profile template XML to include any required
fields, and save your changes (see Figure 10.71).

For MedTron, we will update an existing job requisition application template. To
open the existing template for editing, click on the Export icon (see Figure 10.72).
Figure 10.72  Edit Job Requisition Application Template (Upload)
Here, you’ll want to make the relevant changes to include any required fields, and
then upload the XML file. Be sure to make note of the resulting template ID. Also,
set the template to Active by clicking the corresponding checkbox, and save your
changes.
Let’s move on to the next step.
Edit Offer Detail Template
In this step, we could either login to the SuccessFactors provisioning tool to edit
the XML of an existing offer detail template or upload a new template. In the case
of MedTron, we imported a new offer detail, which will be used in candidate
communications, such as form letters or emails.
This step can be accessed from the SuccessFactors Provisioning client home page;
follow the menu path Company  Managing Recruiting  Import/Update/
Export Offer Detail Template.
On the Company screen, you will import/export a new offer detail template or
update an existing one. To update an existing offer, select the relevant template
and click on the Export icon (see Figure 10.73).
Then, make the relevant changes and upload the XML file. Be sure to make note
of the resulting template ID. Set the template to Active by clicking the corre-
sponding checkbox, and save your changes.
Let’s move on to the application status configuration step.

in MedTron’s recruiting integration from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM and vice
versa.
This step can be accessed from the SuccessFactors Provisioning client home page;
follow the menu path Company  Managing Recruiting  Applicant Status Con-
figuration.
On the Companies screen, you will edit the base set to make the status available
for the required applicant status sets used in the recruiting integration process. To
do this, click on Edit Base and then on Add New Status (see Figure 10.74).

On the Status Base Details screen, enter the base status details as shown in Fig-
ure 10.75.
Figure 10.75  Status Base Details
At this point, save the changes you have just made. Then, you repeat the preced-
ing steps for the following three remaining application status items:
 TransferredToSAP
 Type: In Progress
 Status Name: TransferredToSAP
 Category: Hired
 TransferredtoSAPError
 Type: In Progress
 Status Name: TransferredtoSAPError
 Category: Hired
 HiredAtSAP
 Type: In Progress
 Status Name: HiredAtSAP
 Category: Hired
Once you are done creating all four required application status items, click on the
I’m Done button near the bottom of the screen. From the Applicant Status
screen, click on Applicant Status Configuration link to take you back to the
Status Sets screen.
Under the Status Set list, locate the Status Set that is marked as default. Then,
click on the Take Action dropdown, and select Edit (see Figure 10.76).

screen, which will complete the provisioning activity necessary to create the
required application status for the recruiting integration.
You have now successfully completed this step!
Add Status to Candidate Picklist
For MedTron, in this step we added the four application statuses (SendToSAP,
TransferredToSAP, TransferredtoSAPError, HiredAtSAP) to the candidate pick-
lists in the SuccessFactors tenant.
This step can be accessed from the Admin Tools screen; go to Company Settings 
Picklist Management (see Figure 10.80).

Let’s move on to the next step.
Add Status to Job Requisition Status
For MedTron, in this step, we added the job requisition status (SAP closed, SAP
reopened, SAP deleted) to the picklists in the SuccessFactors tenant.
Similar to the previous step, this step can be accessed from the Admin Tools
screen; go to Company Settings  Picklist Management. From the Picklists
screen, select the radio button to Export all picklist(s). Then, click on Submit to
download the picklist CSV file.
In the picklist CSV file, ensure the following (see Figure 10.84):

Let’s now move on to the next step: mapping custom fields.
Map Custom Fields
In this step, you will enable MedTron’s custom fields from the job requisitions to
be reportable.
This step can be accessed from the Provisioning client home page; follow the
menu path Company  Managing Recruiting  Configure Reportable Custom
Fields.
On the Map Custom Fields to Extended Fields for Reporting screen, click on
Job Req, then click on the Configure Custom to Extended Field Mapping
option.
In the Text section header for Text1 to Text4, enter the following XML custom

In the Text section header for Text1, enter the following XML custom field ID:
“sapError”.
Save your changes to complete the activity for enabling custom fields from job
requisitions and applications to be reportable.
Let’s move on to the final step of the SuccessFactors configuration setup.
Create Ad Hoc Report
In this step, you will create the ad hoc report that will be used for exporting
MedTron’s recruiting data from SuccessFactors.
In the beginning of this chapter (in Section 10.4.2), we spoke about the ability to
import metadata from SuccessFactors to SAP ERP HCM for the recruiting integra-
tion. In the Define Additional Display Fields area, if we choose to import the
metadata, then we can see the additional columns in the application that were
created upon importing the metadata.

For MedTron, we chose not to import metadata; therefore, we did not have addi-
tional columns displayed in this application.
This step can be accessed from the SuccessFactors homepage, under Main Navi-
gation, following the menu path Analytics  Reporting  Ad Hoc Reports. On
the Welcome to Reports Center screen, click on Create Report.

In this section, via the MedTron example provided, we detailed the necessary
configuration and technical steps required to implement the SuccessFactors
recruitment integration with SAP ERP HCM using the Talent Hybrid deployment
model. The goal of this case study was to highlight the steps that you can follow
as you help your clients with their SuccessFactors Recruiting module for the Tal-
ent Hybrid integration with SAP ERP HCM.
10.5
User Authentication Integration
In this section, we will discuss the user authentication integration. Specifically,
we’ll discuss the implementation steps necessary for both SAP ERP HCM and Suc-
cessFactors to implement the SSO integration.
Prerequisites
There are three preliminary actions you must complete before you can begin to config-
ure SSO:
 Ensure that the relevant systems are available and access requirements have been
completed.
 Ensure that all systems have the minimum versions required:

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
502
 For SAP Netweaver, the minimum version required is 7.2 or above.
 For SuccessFactors, the system hosted by SuccessFactors is updated on a quarterly
basis. Therefore, all SuccessFactors systems will have the minimum version for
SSO.
 Ensure that you have the correct system access to complete the SSO setup:
 In order to setup SAP Enterprise Portal as the trusted identity provider, you will
need SAP Netweaver administrator access.
 On the SuccessFactors system, you will need provisioning access to set it up as the
service provider.
 You will need SAP Enterprise Portal content administration access to be able to
embed SuccessFactors transactions in the portal menu.
To enable SuccessFactors to communicate securely with SAP Netweaver, during the
installation you will need the SuccessFactors X509 certificate. This can be obtained by
contacting your SuccessFactors implementation team.
10.5.1
Case Study Parameters
This case study focuses on a customer who desires to implement SSO between
SuccessFactors and SAP ERP HCM. We’ll use a client scenario to demonstrate our
case. A snapshot of our client is presented next.
Client Scenario
During the preliminary presell activities, the sales team gathered that MedTron
had standardized on SAP ERP HCM ECC 6.0 EHP 6 to maintain all employee data
records. In addition, MedTron is running an ESS and MSS portal (SAP EP version
7.4) to allow users to access their employee and organizational information.
MedTron also uses OM and PA as well as SAP PI version 7.4 Java stack.
Throughout the upfront sales consultation process, MedTron became increasingly
interested in SuccessFactors, because the company appreciates the modularity of
the entire SuccessFactors platform. MedTron is also very intrigued with the SSO
capability of the system that makes it more user-friendly for employees to access
all of their data through one single point of entry.
One piece of low-hanging fruit that the sales team identified was to immediately
assist their users in removing barriers to get to their data. With that, MedTron
agreed to implement SSO.

User Authentication Integration
10.5
503
To do this, they embedded SuccessFactors transactions within the SAP portal so
that users have a single user interface for both SAP and SuccessFactors transac-
tions. In addition, we implemented SSO between SAP Netweaver and SuccessFac-
tors so that users do not have to enter their password again when accessing Suc-
cessFactors transactions.
Although implementing SSO is easy to execute, MedTron was concerned that this
single point of entry for SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors could confuse users.
The MedTron IT department would have to communicate this new change to all
of their global users.
Specifically, IT would need to explain the benefits of SSO to the end users. These
benefits include:
 Reducing help desk costs by decreasing the number of calls made to recover
passwords.
 Increasing productivity (and reducing downtime) by keeping users from having
to perform a unique login for both the SAP portal and SuccessFactors.
 Ensuring confidentiality through reliable, standards-based encryption during
data transmission.
There were a couple of requirements that were also agreed to, including:
 Once an end user logged into the SAP portal, all SuccessFactors transactions
would be embedded into the portal menu.
 MedTron made it clear that it did not want its users to enter their username and
password again to access any SuccessFactors transactions.
This case study focuses on the necessary configuration and technical steps
required to implement SSO between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors.
Process Overview
This process is intended for customers using the Talent Hybrid integration who
run SAP ERP HCM for Personnel Administration and Organizational Manage-
ment, as well as benefits, time, and payroll, and SuccessFactors Talent Manage-
ment Solutions and who desire the simplicity of SSO to access to their systems
through a single point of entry.
There is only one step to complete for this specific integration: SSO set up.

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations
10
504
The beauty of this integration is that installing SSO enables users to access both
SAP and SuccessFactors pages through the SAP Enterprise Portal without having
to sign in multiple times.
In order to begin this type of configuration, users will need to access transactions
from both SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors.
SSO
SSO uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) version 2.0, which is a standards-
based mechanism for SSO.
10.5.2
Single Sign-On Setup
There are five steps required to setup SSO, which are itemized ahead. We’ll dis-
cuss each step one-by-one in the following pages:
 Enable SAML 2.0 and set up SAP NetWeaver as a local provider
 Add the SuccessFactors system as a trusted provider
 Add SAP portal as a trusted identity provider in SuccessFactors (SAP Net-
Weaver configuration)
 Add SAP Enterprise Portal as a trusted identity provider in SuccessFactors (Suc-
cessFactors configuration)
 Create an SAP portal URL iView to SuccessFactors
Let’s begin by enabling SAML 2.0 and setting up SAP NetWeaver as a local pro-
vider.
Enable SAML 2.0 and Set Up SAP NetWeaver as a Local Provider
SAML is the standard that SSO uses to exchange authorization and authentication
between trusted systems. SAML 2.0 functionality must be activated to enable SAP
NetWeaver to participate in the SSO process. Subsequently, SAP NetWeaver will
also need to be set up as a local provider so that it can provide the trusted identity
to request resources from SuccessFactors.
To do this, log on to the SAP NetWeaver system, and perform the following tasks:
1. Open an Internet browser.
2. Go to <portalhost>:<port>/nwa—for example, dwg2131:1080/nwa.

User Authentication Integration
10.5
505
3. Go to the Authentication and Single Sign-On screen by navigating to the
Configuration tab and selecting the Authentication and Single Sign-On
link.
4. Select the SAML 2.0 tab, and click on the Enable SAML 2.0 Support button.
5. The system will then guide you through the steps to set up SAP NetWeaver as
a local provider.
In the initial settings, you will need to enter a provider name. This name can be
defined by the user; however, best practice is to include the system name and
landscape in the name to make it more meaningful—for example, portal731ED6
for the ED6 landscape (see Figure 10.88).
Figure 10.88  Initial Settings
The next task is to fill in the general settings. On the first screen, you need to per-
form the following steps:
1. In the Keystore View field, enter “SAML2”. In the Signing Key Pair field, cre-
ate a signing key pair by clicking on the Browse button next to the field and
then clicking on the Create button to create a new signing key pair.
Figure 10.89  General Settings
ED6

2. At this point, you will be prompted with the steps needed to create a signing
key pair. For the entry settings prompt, you will need to fill in the fields based
on the information below:
 Entry Name: <specify a entry name> for example, portal731ED6
 Algorithm: RSA
 Key Length: 2048
 Valid From and Valid To: Defaulted values
 Store Certificate: Selected
Figure 10.90  Entry Settings
3. The next step required for signing the key pair is to complete the Subject Prop-
erties screen. Perform the following steps (see Figure 10.91):
 In the commonName field, enter the Entry Name defined in the entry set-
tings step.
 When you have done this, click on the Finish button to complete the signing
key pair setup.
 Then, click on OK to go back to the SAML 2.0 provider configuration setup
screen.

4. Now that the signing key pair has been created, the signing key pair name and
encryption key fields are defaulted based on the information you have just set
up. Click on Next to go to the Service Provider Settings step. (No changes are
required in the service provider settings steps.)
5. Click on Finish to complete your setup.
You have now completed your SAP NetWeaver local provider setup. Let’s now
add the SuccessFactors system as a trusted provider.
Add SuccessFactors System as a Trusted Provider
In SAP NetWeaver, SuccessFactors must be set up as a trusted provider so that
SAP NetWeaver can securely communicate with SuccessFactors. The SuccessFac-
tors X509 security certificate must be loaded into SAP NetWeaver in order to
authorize SAP NetWeaver to communicate securely with SuccessFactors.
To do this, log on to the SAP NetWeaver system, and perform the following steps:
1. Open an Internet browser.
2. Go to <portalhost>:<port>/nwa—for example, dwg2131:1080/nwa.
ED6

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

3. Go to the Authentication and Single Sign On screen by navigating to the Con-
figuration tab and selecting the Authentication and Single Sign-On link.
4. Select the SAML 2.0 tab, and click on the Trusted Providers subtab.
Next, you will need to create a new trusted provider:
1. Click on the Add button.
2. Select the Manual button to manually add a new trusted provider.
3. On the provider step, enter the provider name for the SuccessFactors system.
For example, https://www.successfactors.com.
4. Click on Next to continue creating a trusted provider (see Figure 10.92).
Figure 10.92  Provider Name
Now, you will need to set up the security details of the SuccessFactors system. On
the Signature and Encryption screen, perform the following steps:
1. Upload the SuccessFactors certificate into the SAP NetWeaver system.
2. Next to the signing certificate, click on the Browse button.
3. Click on Import Entry to start importing the SuccessFactors certificate.
4. For Entry Type, select X509 certificate.
5. Click on the Browse button to find the path of the SuccessFactors certificate.
6. Click on Import to finish importing the certificate. The Signing Certificate
field should now be filled (see Figure 10.93).
7. Click on Next to continue creating a trusted provider.

User Authentication Integration
10.5
509
Figure 10.93  Signature and Encryption for Trusted Provider
The next task is to fill in the details of the SuccessFactors system that SAP
NetWeaver must communicate with. At this point, navigate to the Endpoints tab.
On the Single Sign-On Endpoints screen, perform the following steps:
1. Click on the Add button to add an SSO endpoint.
2. Enter HTTP POST for Binding.
3. Enter the SuccessFactors consumer service URL in the Location URL field.
4. Click on OK to go to the next screen.
 The consumer service URL is what you will use to log on to the SuccessFac-
tors system. The URL address should be in the following format: https://
<systemname.com>/saml2/SAMLAssertionConsumer?company=<companyid>–
for example: https://performancemanager10.SuccessFactors.com/saml2/SAM-
LAssertionConsumer?company=ACE1234 .
5. On the New Endpoint for Single Logout screen, enter the SuccessFactors
logout URL.
6. In the Binding field, enter HTTP Redirect. In the Location URL field, enter the
global logout response handler URL, which is in the format https://<systemname.
com>/saml2/LogoutServiceHTTPRedirectResponse?company=<companyid>–for ex-
ample, https://performancemanager10/saml2/LogoutServiceHTTPRedirectResponse?
company=ACE1234 .

7. At this point, the SSO Endpoint has been created; do not enter any other end-
points.
8. Click on Next, and then click on Finish to complete the trusted provider setup.
Now, navigate to the next tab to the right: Identity Federation. On this tab, per-
form the following steps:
1. Click on the Add button to add an identity federation.
2. Enter Unspecified in the Format field.
3. Enter your logon ID in the Source Name field.
4. Click on Save.
The last task is to activate the trusted provider that has just been created. Perform
the following steps:
1. Select the trusted provider www.SuccessFactors.com.
2. Click on Enable.
You have now added SuccessFactors as a trusted provider in SAP NetWeaver.
So far, you have completed two of the five steps required for setting up SSO.
Now, let’s discuss adding a portal as a trusted identity provider in SuccessFactors;
this is an SAP NetWeaver configuration.
Add a Portal as a Trusted Identity Provider in SuccessFactors—SAP NetWeaver 
Configuration
SAP NetWeaver acts as a trusted identity provider to confirm the identity of the
user on behalf of SuccessFactors. Specifically, SAP Netweaver validates the user
by requesting a logon and password. Subsequently, when a SuccessFactors URL is
requested, SAP NetWeaver identifies the user and confirms his or her identity for
SuccessFactors so that the user does not need to log on again.
In this section, you will download the SAP certificate from the list provided. In
the following section, you will subsequently upload this same certificate into Suc-
cessFactors. Let’s begin by first downloading the SAP certificate. To do this, log
on to the SAP NetWeaver system, and perform the following steps:
1. Open an Internet browser.
2. Go to <portalhost>:<port>/nwa—for example, dwg2131:1080/nwa.

User Authentication Integration
10.5
511
3. Go to the Certificates and Keys screen by navigating to the Configuration
tab and clicking on the Certificates and Keys link.
Next, you will want to export the SAP NetWeaver certificate. Under the Key Stor-
age tab (see Figure 10.94), perform the following steps:
1. Locate and select the row named SAML2.
2. Under the View Entries tab:
 Locate and select the provider name you created in the Enabling SAML 2.0
& Setting Up SAP Netweaver as a Local Provider section.
 Click on the Export Entry button.
 Select the format Base64 x 509.
 Click on Download to download the certificate.

You have just completed the third step required for setting up SSO. Now, let’s
turn our attention to adding a portal as a trusted identity provider in SuccessFac-
tors; this is a SuccessFactors configuration.
Add a Portal as a Trusted Identity Provider in SuccessFactors—
SuccessFactors Configuration
In the previous section, we downloaded the SAP NetWeaver certificate. Now, it’s
time to upload the SAP certificate to the SuccessFactors side. Here, we’ll focus on
completing the SSO setup in SuccessFactors.
To do this, log on to the SuccessFactors Provisioning system, and perform the fol-
lowing steps (see Figure 10.95):
1. Go to Company settings  Single Sign-On (SSO) Settings, and navigate to the
Single Sign-On Configuration screen.
2. In the SAML-Based SSO section, select SAML V2 SSO to activate SAML version
2.0-based SSO.
3. In the SAML Asserting party section, enter the following information:
 SAML Asserting Party Name: Specify an entry name—for example, por-
tal731ED6
 SAML Issuer: Enter the name of the identity provider that you have set up
in SAP NetWeaver
 Required Mandatory Signature: Assertion
 Enable SAML Flag: Enabled
 SAML Verifying certificate: Open the signing certificate of the portal iden-
tity provider that you downloaded in the previous step in a text editor. Copy
the text into the SAML Verifying Certificate field.
4. Once completed, click on Add an Asserting Party to create your entry.
5. To complete this aspect of the configuration, scroll down to the Single Sign On
Features section (see Figure 10.96). Perform the following steps:
 Enter the Reset Token (which can be any value).
 Click on Save Token to activate SSO in SuccessFactors.

Please note that there are some customers with a mix of both SSO and users who log on
directly to SuccessFactors. For example, you might want regular employees to log on
through SSO, but you may still want administrators to be able to log on directly to Suc-
cessFactors.
6. To setup partial organization SSO, select the Partial Organization SSO check-
box under Provisioning  Company Settings in SuccessFactors Provisioning
(see Figure 10.97).
ED6

Implementing the Talent Hybrid Integrations

514
Figure 10.97  Partial Organization Single Sign-On
When creating users in a partial organization SSO scenario, you will need to fill in
the login method when creating the users. This will indicate to the system
whether the user is logging on with single sign on. SSO will signify users that
logon via SSO, and PWD will indicate users who log on directly to SuccessFactors
(see Figure 10.98).
Figure 10.98  Login Method
Please note that in SuccessFactors usernames are case sensitive, whereas in SAP
usernames are not case sensitive. This can cause SSO syncing problems in which
usernames have been entered with mixed cases in SAP.
This can be avoided by ensuring that usernames are passed from SAP to Success-
Factors as lowercase values by implementing the following in SAP:
 Implement BAdI definition HRSFI_B_EMPL_DATA_REPLICATION
 Input the ABAP code into the method IF_HRSFI_EMPL_DATA_REPLICATION~GET_
USERNAME in order to convert username values to lowercase.
 Employee data integration (SAP program RH_SFI_SYNCHRONIZE_EMPL_
DATA) will use the BAdI and pass the username as lowercase values to Success-
Factors.
Let’s now focus on the final step required for setting up SSO: creating an SAP por-
tal URL iView to SuccessFactors.

User Authentication Integration
10.5
515
Create an SAP Enterprise Portal URL iView to SuccessFactors
Now that the SSO setup is complete, the final step is to add SuccessFactors URLs
into the SAP Enterprise Portal menu. To do this, you’ll need to create a new SAP
portal iView with an embedded SuccessFactors URL.
Log on to the SAP Enterprise Portal, and perform the following steps:
1. Go to the Content Administrator via Content administration  Portal con-
tent manager  Portal content.
2. Create a new URL iView with the following details:
 URL: <hostname>/saml2/idp/sso —for example, 
https://cl1-portal2. wdf.sap.corp:50102/saml2/idp/sso
 URL parameter 1: saml2sp
 URL parameter 1 (value): https://www.successfactors.com
 URL parameter 2: RelayState
 URL parameter 2 (value): Enter the deep link for the SuccessFactors page
you want to access. For example, if the full SuccessFactors URL is https://
salesdemo4.SuccessFactors.com/sf/goals?bplte_company=xxxxxx, then the deep
link is /sf/goals
3. When you click on the newly created iView in SAP Enterprise Portal, the Suc-
cessFactors screen will now be accessible without requiring the user to log in
again.
4. Note that to make the SuccessFactors URLs look more consistent with the SAP
Enterprise Portal look and feel, you can remove the SuccessFactors top menu in
the SuccessFactors system.
5. Login to SuccessFactors Provisioning, and go to Company Settings. Select the
Enable V12 embeddable mode checkbox.
You have now completed the final step required for setting up SSO.
This case study focused on the necessary configuration and technical steps to
implement SSO between SAP ERP HCM and SuccessFactors. The outcome made it
possible for MedTron’s employees to simply and easily access both their SAP and
SuccessFactors systems through the SAP Enterprise Portal via one single point of
entry—without having to sign on to their systems multiple times.

Summary
This chapter provided detailed case studies, which included the necessary config-
uration steps to implement the Talent Hybrid integration scenarios for employee
data integration, compensation process integration, and recruiting process inte-
gration using SAP PI on-premise as the integration middleware. In addition, SSO
integration was also covered. These case studies can be used to provide project
guidance in implementing the Talent Hybrid integrations.
For customers looking to move to Employee Central, in the next and final chapter
we will discuss the various data migration options available to support the migra-
tion of HR data to the cloud.

The key to a successful data migration is standardized and engineered 
rapid data migration content for a fast and simple go-live with valid and 
clean data. In this chapter, we’ll explain the migration of data from an 
SAP ERP HCM or third-party system into Employee Central, leveraging 
the rapid-deployment paradigm.

Data Migration
As we outlined in Chapter 2, migrating to the cloud may not be the same for all
customers (see Figure 11.1). Some customers may choose to move all HCM appli-
cations in one large step (Full Cloud HCM), some may choose to move talent solu-
tions to the cloud while keeping their investment in core HR intact (Talent
Hybrid), or a third type of customer may choose to move talent solutions for all
employees to the cloud along with core HR for a small set of employees, usually
from a subsidiary (Side-By-Side).

However, once customers have made the decision to implement Employee Central
for core HR via the Full Cloud HCM, Talent Hybrid, or Side-By-Side HCM deploy-
ment model, they are faced with the challenges of migrating their data along with
these integration tasks discussed earlier in this book. When moving functionality
to the cloud, there may be worries about losing any legacy data when the legacy
system (core HR on-premise) is retired. This is also the big difference between a
data migration and the integration scenarios discussed previously: in the case of a
migration, the legacy system will be switched off at some point in time and no lon-
ger used as the system of record.
The challenges facing customers migrating data to the cloud are just the same as
those migrating data to an on-premise application. However, long projects with
unpredictable post-implementation results and costs are no longer acceptable in
the cloud world, where LOB leaders are in the driver’s seat. Today, both business
and IT leaders want to know upfront what they can get, how fast they can get it,
and how much it will cost them. 
Given that migration is an often overlooked part of an implementation project,
this is especially true. To remedy this need, a new data onboarding methodology
is required. The aim of this chapter is to provide insight into this data migration
paradigm as it applies in the SuccessFactors space.
This chapter outlines the foundation for data migration to Employee Central (see
Section 11.1) and introduces two different types of migration: simple file loads
and a prepackaged data migration approach (see Section 11.2). Finally, we’ll go
into detail about the different migration technologies focusing on APIs (see Sec-
tion 11.3).
11.1
Migration Foundation
The two sections that follow discuss the foundation of a tool-based data migration
approach that includes data quality aspects and a guided implementation method-
ology.
11.1.1
Rapid-Deployment Solutions
SAP Rapid Data Migration is based on SAP Rapid-Deployment Solutions that enable
a best practices methodology for the way we approach the implementation of SAP
solutions today. In a nutshell, the new paradigm is based on the realization that it’s

faster and less risky to leverage available best business practices with rapid-deploy-
ment solutions, perform a fit/gap analysis, and restrict additional customizing,
add-ons, and interfaces to only those areas of a company’s operations in which sig-
nificantly more business value and differentiation can be achieved.
Rapid-deployment solutions simplify the implementation of SAP solutions in the
cloud, on-premise, or in hybrid landscapes, with faster, less costly, and predictable
business outcomes. These solutions include best practice-based implementation
content and proven, risk-reducing implementation methodologies, which acceler-
ates the deployment of new solutions via key technology and business capabilities
to help companies solve business problems and go live fast. Figure 11.2 shows
how SAP Rapid-Deployment Solutions fit into the overall deployment model with
its best business and implementation practices for faster time to value.
Figure 11.2  Best Practices for Faster Adoption with SAP Rapid-Deployment Solutions
With this method, customers will quickly see proposed solutions via comprehen-
sive and seamless guidance from the evaluation to go-live, with no surprises.
Modular scope options enable the assembly of end-to-end solutions, helping
companies to easily adopt the right combination of best business practices and IT
capabilities or to extend where necessary to meet the customer’s needs.
What does this approach mean for the cloud solutions that SAP offers? It brings
best practices to the cloud and makes cloud innovation adoption simple. At http://

Figure 11.3  Rapid-Deployment Solutions for Onboarding, Integration, and Migration to the Cloud
In the next section, we will look at another foundation for data migration: SAP
Data Services.
11.1.2
SAP Data Services
SAP Data Services is an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool for extracting, trans-
forming, and loading data from one or more source systems into one or more tar-
get systems. It is a product of SAP’s Enterprise Information Management portfo-
lio. SAP Data Services lets you improve, integrate, transform, and deliver trusted
data to critical business processes across the enterprise for both SAP and non-SAP
systems. SAP Data Services can also be used in almost any scenario that requires
you to move, enrich, transform, or cleanse data, and in this regard it functions as
the technology foundation for a data migration as one of its use cases.
If all you needed for a successful data migration project was software tooling, then
we wouldn’t provide a separate chapter for data migration. The primary software

products that you can leverage for data migration are SAP Data Services and SAP
Information Steward. Data migration projects require a deep knowledge of and
expertise in the target data structures. You must have the following knowledge:
 An understanding of the system you are migrating to
 The requirements for the data in the new system
 The expectations for the data to be successful in the new system
When migrating to SuccessFactors applications, the source system is completely
unknown to the SAP Rapid Data Migration developers of SAP’s rapid-deployment
solutions team. You could be migrating from a homegrown application, another
vendor’s software solution, a mainframe application, or any other datastores that
were used prior to your SuccessFactors system. Although SAP cannot provide
accelerators or deep knowledge of your non-SAP legacy source systems, SAP can
and certainly does provide data migration content for SAP ERP HCM as a legacy
source and details of your SuccessFactors target system. This knowledge, pro-
vided for you as out-of-the-box migration content, accelerates your SuccessFac-
tors implementation.
SAP Data Services Tutorial
If you’re new to SAP Data Services, you might want to start by going through the SAP
Data Services tutorial that is included in the documentation when you install the product.
Having looked at the foundation, let’s now turn our gaze to the different types of
migration available.
11.2
Types of Migration
In this section, we will look at the different types of migration to Employee Cen-
tral and the technologies they entail. The two migration types are the simple file
loads and the prepackaged SAP Rapid Data Migration content provided by SAP
Rapid-Deployment Solutions.
11.2.1
File Loads
Employee Central offers an administrator tool for importing and exporting data
using CSV (comma-separated values) files. While the import functionality allows

Data Migration
11
522
you to import data objects such as metadata, foundation data, and employment
data, you can also export existing data and download blank CSV templates to
familiarize yourself with the required structure. The templates also include the
import sequence to be used for the actual load (if necessary) and basic validations
(see Figure 11.4).
Figure 11.4  File Upload in Employee Central
Although Employee Central’s file interfaces allow for full and incremental loads,
this approach requires a high attention to detail (as with all file load techniques)
due to its manual nature and the high error rate associated with CSV files. File
encodings and security concerns can be troublesome as well. However, this
approach is great for quick and dirty loads and even for delta loads while testing
and setting up the system.
Automation and Data Cleansing
One of the best practices for dealing with data migration for longer periods of
time is to automate as much as possible and to allow processes that enable a full
data lineage during extraction, transformation, and loading.
Most companies will need to conduct a preliminary data cleanup and also look at
opportunities to consolidate data. The best example of this is the job catalog, in
which there may be redundant job codes that have been created over a long
period of time within the legacy system. The HR representatives should go
through the process of consolidating or eliminating job codes prior to the Suc-

Types of Migration
11.2

cessFactors cutover. Also, the conversion process must be repeatable in a limited
amount of time, so it’s important that there are no lengthy, time-consuming tasks
included in the cutover routine.
Overall, with the file load approach it is hard to handle errors that fall out of a
particular data load, because there is no built-in functionality to reprocess error
records. You want to have the data in the correct format and shape and include
this in the cost estimate, in case data quality checks and error handling have to be
implemented. Automation and data cleansing as enhanced data verifications are
rudimental only while following the file load approach. Now, let’s take a look at
a more sophisticated approach that also allows you to focus on data quality.
11.2.2
SAP Rapid Data Migration
In this section, we’ll introduce SAP Rapid Data Migration, which comes with
proven best practices. Migrating data using tried and tested tools that enable data
cleansing and error handling lays a good foundation for migrating core HR to the
cloud. We will begin by looking at the migration content and then move on to an
overview of its architecture. Following this section, we will look at the migration
technologies that enable these processes to function.
Migration Content
The SAP Rapid Data Migration content follows SAP’s best practices methodology
for data migration. It gains functionality to manage and complete six distinct activ-
ities that are critical to the transformation and migration of data (see Figure 11.5).
Figure 11.5  SAP Rapid Data Migration Methodology
As shown in Figure 11.5, there are six critical data migration activities:

1 Extract the data from the source system(s).
2 Analyze and profile the data from the source system(s).
3 Cleanse the data records to achieve a high data quality.
4 Validate the data against the target business context (i.e., the business rules of
the target system, such as checking if there are specific fields required or if the
country codes are correct).
5 Load the data into the target SuccessFactors system.
6 Reconcile the data between the target system and the source system.
SAP offers tools for governance and visualization to support the activities taking
place in each of these stages. The governance solutions help to ensure that only
authorized individuals can make changes to the data or mappings and that an
audit trail exists to capture each change. The visualization tools enable you to see
what is taking place during each step in the migration process.
Download the Solution
To download the latest content for SAP Rapid Data Migration to cloud solutions from
SAP, go to http://service.sap.com/rds-dm2cloud. You will find information on how to
install the software, deploy the data migration content, and use the SAP Rapid Data
Migration solution. This packaged SAP Rapid-Deployment Solution can be downloaded
at no additional cost.
The solution content consists of the following parts:
 Mapping sheets for source-to-target mapping to be used for mapping on paper or in
Microsoft Excel (prefilled with the target SuccessFactors structure and also for SAP
ERP HCM as the possible source)
 Documentation on each and every migration object, with step-by-step descriptions
of how to perform mapping and migration
 Migration content (jobs and data flows) to be imported into SAP Data Services for
mapping (field mapping) and validation
 SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence reports to be deployed in the SAP Business-
Objects BI platform for monitoring the data migration
 The Migration Services tool to map source data field values to SAP business context
(value mapping)
 Migration content for reconciling what was loaded in the target from the source for
a full data lineage
With a firm understanding of the migration content that this process entails, let’s
now move on to the architecture.

Architecture
In this section, we will provide a detailed overview of the architecture of SAP
Rapid Data Migration for Employee Central. SAP Rapid Data Migration is based
on rapid-deployment solutions from SAP and uses SAP Data Services to assess and
migrate your data (see Section 11.1).
There are a number of things that are included in the SAP Rapid Data Migration
architecture and package. First, there are predelivered templates and content that
transform the SAP Data Services data integration platform into a strong and easy-
to-use migration engine. This engine comes with built-in functionality to extract
and profile any legacy data directly from and on the source system. In addition,
there is a new tool for value mapping called Migration Services, plus packaged SAP
BusinessObjects Web Intelligence reports that deliver insight on the overall pro-
cess and show data quality issues to the deployment team at an early stage.
Figure 11.6 shows how data migration works using SAP Data Services and the
content provided with the SAP Rapid Data Migration package.

Data Migration
11
526
1 Legacy system  
The legacy data environment refers to the source systems for the migration.
The legacy environment can be any third-party source system that is supported
by SAP Data Services connectivity (almost everything, because SAP Data Ser-
vices supports the ODBC protocol). The legacy system can also be SAP ERP
HCM. The SAP Rapid Data Migration package comes with prebuilt content for
SAP ERP HCM as a source.
2 Extract and profile  
Data is extracted from the source and placed in a staging area in SAP Data Ser-
vices. At this point, you can conduct technical profiling with SAP Data Services.
In addition, you can start profiling very early on the source systems using SAP
Information Steward, a tool that allows you to discover, assess, define, and
monitor the quality of data along with SAP Data Services.
3 Cleanse, transform, and validate  
This includes updating the data so that it meets specific patterns, mapping and
transforming the data according to rules, and validating data against the Suc-
cessFactors business context. This can involve combining two fields into one,
splitting fields, updating the data in a field to match certain rules (for example,
telephone number formats), and validating data against required fields and
lookup values from the SuccessFactors business context and configuration.
4 SuccessFactors configuration extraction  
As part of a SuccessFactors implementation, the system is configured with
many values, such as cost centers and the state and country values. Mapping of
the source data normally requires mapping fields that comply with the Success-
Factors configuration.
5 Reconciliation  
Reconciliation looks at what was actually loaded versus what was expected to
be loaded. This functionality is the part of the SAP Rapid Data Migration pack-
age that proves the load was successful and hands it over to the business.
6 Dashboards and business reporting  
Throughout the process, dashboards are available for people involved to stay
informed about the status of the migration. The validation reports can help
resolve all processing errors even before the actual load to Employee Central
happens. In addition, the migration project often sets data quality expectations
and governance around data management.

Demo
For a complete demo of data migration, go to http://service.sap.com/public/rds-datami-
gration, and select Demo.
Once everything is installed and deployed according to the included configura-
tion guide, you will find a predefined project in SAP Data Services. This project
has jobs for each of the business objects, such as employee data or foundation
data. When drilling into the job, you will see the mapping and validation that
takes place (see Figure 11.7). The validation is shown against required lookup
fields in the SuccessFactors system, validating mandatory fields as well as the for-
mat (e.g., whether the phone numbers all include country codes and whether the
postal code is in the correct format).
Figure 11.7  Mapping and Validation of Employee Address Data in SAP Data Services

Data Migration
11
528
After the mapping has been done, the SAP Data Services jobs can be started in a
test mode to resolve all the remaining mapping and validation issues. Typically,
this iteration can happen until all the errors have been resolved, which helps to
avoid handling hundreds of conversion errors on a cutover weekend. Once the
actual values have been translated, enriched, and validated successfully, the SAP
Data Services job can start to load the data into the Employee Central target sys-
tem using one of the APIs described in Section 11.3. The tool does not use the file
load approach instead it uses either the SuccessFactors Adapter or SuccessFactors’
OData interface depending on the existing interface (see Section 11.3). This
approach is faster and more reliable while ensuring that the data is checked again
within SuccessFactors APIs for high quality and consistent data in the target
Employee Central cloud system.
In addition to the jobs, data flows, and mappings provided by SAP Rapid-Deploy-
ment Solutions, there are also reports and visualizations to keep you updated on the
status of the data migration. These reports are part of the migration content and
show overall project status, data quality, invalid data records, and data reconcilia-
tion. The data migration project can lay the ground work for data governance, data
ownership, and ongoing data quality. Governance of data and information is a topic
gaining increased interest, and data migration falls into this category, providing the
first opportunity to implement governance processes around management and data
quality expectations. Migration projects require iteration of data loads to better
understand the data and to allow close collaboration between business and IT.
Download
Migration content can be downloaded from http://service.sap.com/public/rds-dm2cloud
and loaded into SAP Data Services. This webpage also gives an overview of the existing
objects that are already covered in the predefined content. A data migration object
translates into an Employee Central entity that can be best interpreted as an SAP HR
infotype.
The SAP Rapid Data Migration approach can be used with virtually any source
system and saves time and effort by providing migration content that enables you
to map sources to target data structures, as well as reports and dashboards that
monitor the data migration jobs. This approach is the ideal choice for converting
from an existing SAP ERP HCM system to Employee Central, because the rapid-
deployment solutions package already comes with the source-to-target mapping
for this scenario.

Migration Technology
11.3
529
11.3
Migration Technology
In addition to the file load functionality, Employee Central offers a library of APIs
that can also be used by employing ETL tools other than SAP Data Services or cod-
ing to upload data. Indeed, these existing interfaces have been used for the SAP
Rapid Data Migration approach with SAP Data Services, as described in Section
11.2.2. SAP Data Services can connect either via the SuccessFactors Adapter lever-
aging SuccessFactors API web services or via the new OData interface.
In this section, an overview is provided of the interfaces that can be leveraged for
data migration. The advantage of using interfaces for a data migration is that they
provide a consistent mechanism for accessing the data on an object level rather
than on a database table level.
11.3.1
Web Services
SuccessFactors API is a SOAP web service that can be used for uploading data to
Employee Central (both creation and update operations are supported for the
data migration use case). Working with the SuccessFactors API requires some
technical understanding of the SOAP protocol, but metadata operations allow for
runtime discovery of the data structure. For example, you can list the objects
available to the API and also get a description of the fields in these Employee Cen-
tral entities.
This generic API offers the following benefits:
 Provides a consistent mechanism for accessing data in the SuccessFactors plat-
form
 Provides a mechanism to describe the data schema configuration, including the
entities that are available and fields that appear in these entities
To get started, you will need the right web service endpoint URL, which differs
from the SOAP version, and the SuccessFactors data center location—for exam-
ple, https://api.successfactors.com/sfapi/v1/soap.
11.3.2
OData
The Open Data (OData) protocol is used as the new API for SuccessFactors. The
OData technology already allows REST-based API calls for a number of Employee

Data Migration
11
530
Central objects. This API also allows for creating and updating operations to suit
data migration use cases. OData is an open standard that will be used for future
objects while most of the existing SuccessFactors APIs are still supported. The
SAP Rapid Data Migration content, as described in Section 11.2.2, will be
updated according to the new interfaces on a regular basis.
The endpoint URL for the OData interface also differs by data center location—for
example, https://api.successfactors.com/odata/v2.
The OData protocol not only enables data loads via web services, it also provides
much more functionality in terms of accessing the target data store, all by using
simple HTTP messages. Many operations are already supported, but they vary by
Employee Central entity. At the same time, OData also provides a secure and con-
sistent data migration interface for upcoming new Employee Central objects.
The best use case for this new interface is creating complex queries by simple
HTTP messages.
11.4
