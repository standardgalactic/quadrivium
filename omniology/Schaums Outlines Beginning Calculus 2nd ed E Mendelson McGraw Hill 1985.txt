Preface
This Outline is limited to the essentials of calculus. It carefully develops, giving all steps, the principles 
of differentiation and integration on which the whole of calculus is built. The book is suitable for 
reviewing the subject, or as a self-contained text for an elementary calculus course.
The author has found that many of the difficulties students encounter in calculus are due to weakness in 
algebra and arithmetical computation, emphasis has been placed on reviewing algebraic and 
arithmetical techniques whenever they are used. Every effort has been made—especially in regard to 
the composition of the solved problems—to ease the beginner's entry into calculus. There are also some 
1500 supplementary problems (with a complete set of answers at the end of the book). 
High school courses in calculus can readily use this Outline. Many of the problems are adopted from 
questions that have appeared in the Advanced Placement Examination in Calculus, so that students will 
automatically receive preparation for that test.
The Second Edition has been improved by the following changes:
1. A large number of problems have been added to take advantage of the availability of graphing 
calculators. Such problems are preceded by the notation 
. Solution of these problems is not 
necessary for comprehension of the text, so that students not having a graphing calculator will not 
suffer seriously from that lack (except insofar as the use of a graphing calculator enhances their 
understanding of the subject).
2. Treatment of several topics have been expanded:
(a) Newton's Method is now the subject of a separate section. The availability of calculators makes 
it much easier to work out concrete problems by this method.
(b) More attention and more problems are devoted to approximation techniques for integration, such 
as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and the midpoint rule.
(c) The chain rule now has a complete proof outlined in an exercise.
3. The exposition has been streamlined in many places and a substantial number of new problems have 
been added.
The author wishes to thank again the editor of the First Edition, David Beckwith, as well as the editor of 
the Second Edition, Arthur Biderman, and the editing supervisor, Maureen Walker.

Chapter 1 
Coordinate Systems on a Line 
1.1 THE COORDINATES OF A POINT 
Let 9 be a line. Choose a point 0 on the line and call this point the origin. 
Now select a direction along 9; 
say, the direction from left to right on the diagram. 
For every point P to the right of the origin 0, let the coordinate of P be the distance between 0 and P. 
(Of course, to specify such a distance, it is first necessary to establish a unit distance by arbitrarily 
picking two points and assigning the number 1 to the distance between these two points.) 
In the diagram 
the distance 
is assumed to be 1, so that the coordinate of A is 1. The point B is two units away from 
0; therefore, B has coordinate 2. Every positive real number r is the coordinate of a unique point on 9 
to the right of the origin 0; namely, of that point to the right of 0 whose distance from 0 is r. 
To every point Q on 9 
to the left of the origin 0, 
- 
we assign a negative real number as its coordinate; the number -Q0, 
the negative of the distance 
between Q and 0. For example, in the diagram 
the point U is assumed to be a distance of one unit from the origin 0; therefore, the coordinate of U is 
- 1. The point W has coordinate -4, which means that the distance 
is *. Clearly, every negative 
real number is the coordinate of a unique point on 9 to the left of the origin. 
The origin 0 is assigned the number 0 as its coordinate.

COORDINATE SYSTEMS ON A LINE 
This assignment of real numbers to the points on the line 9 
is called a coordinate system on 9. 
Choosing a different origin, a different direction along the line, or a different unit distance would result 
in a different coordinate system. 
1.2 ABSOLUTE VALUE 
For any real number b define the absolute value I b I to be the magnitude of b; that is, 
b 
i f b 2 0  
-6 
if b <O 
l b l =  
In other words, if b is a positive number or zero, its absolute value I b I is 6 itself. But if b is negative, its 
absolute value I b I is the corresponding positive number - b. 
EXAMPLES 
Properties of the Absolute Value 
Notice that any number r and its negative - r  have the same absolute value, 
Irl = 1-4 
(1.1) 
(1 4 
lal = lbl implies a =  +b 
(1 -3) 
la12 = a‘ 
(1.4) 
An important special case of (1.1) results from choosing r = U - U and recalling that -(U - U )  = U - U, 
lu - U 1  = l u  - U 1  
If I a I = I b I, then either a and b are the same number or a and b are negatives of each other, 
Moreover, since I a I is either a or -a, and ( -a)’ = a’, 
Replacing a in (1 4) by ab yields 
I ab l2 = (ab)2 = a2b2 = I U 1’ I b 1’ = (I U I I b I)’ 
whence, the absolute value being nonnegative, 
lab1 = lallbl 
Absolute Value and Distance 
Consider a coordinate system on a line 9 
and let A, and A2 be points on 9 
with coordinates a, 
and a 2 .  Then 
I a, - a2 I = A,A2 = distance between A ,  and A2

A special case of (1.6) is very important. If a is the coordinate of A, then 
I a I = distance between A and the origin

(1.9) 
EXAMPLE To find a simpler form for the condition I x - 3 I < 5, substitute x - 3 for U in (1.9), obtaining 
- 5 < x - 3 < 5. Adding 3, we have - 2 < x < 8. From a geometric standpoint, note that I x - 3 I < 5 is equivalent 
to saying that the distance between the point A having coordinate x and the point having coordinate 3 is less than 5.

The inequality (1.10) is known as the triangle inequality. In (1.20) the sign c applies if and only if a and 
b are of opposite signs.

ALGEBRA REVIEW Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reuerses the 
inequality: if U < b and c < 0, then uc > bc. 
To see this, notice that a < b implies b - a > 0. Hence, (b - U)C < 0, since the product of a positive 
number and a negative number is negative. So bc - ac < 0, or bc < ac.

We cannot simply multiply both sides by x - 3, because we do not know whether x - 3 is positive or 
negative. 
Case 1: x - 3 > 0. Multiplying (1) by this positive quantity preserves the inequality: 
x + 4 < 2~ - 6

Thus, if x > 3, (1) holds if and only if x > 10.

Thus, if x < 3, (1) holds if and only if x < 10. But x < 3 implies that x < 10. Hence, when x < 3, (1) is true. 
From cases 1 and 2, (1) holds for x > 10 and for x < 3.

Solve (x - 2Xx + 3) > 0. 
A product is positive if and only if both factors are of like sign. 
Case 1: x - 2 > 0 and x + 3 > 0. Then x > 2 and x > -3. But 
x > 2 implies x > - 3. 
Case2: x - 2 < 0  and x+3<0. Then x < 2  and x<-3, 
x < -3 implies x < 2. 
Thus, (x - 2)(x + 3) > 0 holds when either x > 2 or x < -3. 
these are equivalent to 
which are equivalent

Solve (x - 3Kx - 1)(x + 2) > 0. 
The crucial points are x = 3, x = 1, and x = -2, where the product is zero. When x > 3, all three 
factors are positive and the product is positive. As we pass from right to left through x = 3, the factor 
(x - 3) changes from positive to negative, and so the product will be negative between 1 and 3. As we pass 
from right to left through x = 1, the factor (x - 1) changes from positive to negative, and so the product 
changes back from negative to positive throughout the interval between x = -2 and x = 1. Finally, as we 
pass from right to left through x = -2, the factor (x + 2) changes from positive to negative, and so the 
product becomes negative for all x < -2.

Coordinate Systems in a Plane 
2.1 THE COORDINATES OF A POINT 
We shall establish a correspondence between the points of a plane and pairs of real numbers. 
Choose two perpendicular lines in the plane of Fig. 2-1. Let us assume for the sake of simplicity that 
one of the lines is horizontal and the other vertical. The horizontal line will be called the x-axis and the 
vertical line will be called the y-axis. 
c :L ‘I 
1 
- l t  
Fig. 2-1 
Next choose a coordinate system on the x-axis and one on the y-axis. The origin for both coordi- 
nate systems is taken to be the point 0, 
where the axes intersect. The x-axis is directed from left to right, 
the y-axis from bottom to top. The part of the x-axis with positive coordinates is called the positioe 
x-axis, and the part of the y-axis with positive coordinates the positive y-axis. 
Consider any point P in the plane. Take the vertical line through the point P, and let a be the 
coordinate of the point where the line intersects the x-axis. This number a is called the x-coordinate of P 
(or the a6scissa of P). Now take the horizontal line through P, and let 6 be the coordinate of the point 
where the line intersects the y-axis. The number 6 is called the y-coordinate of P (or the ordinate of P). 
Every point has a unique pair (a, b) of coordinates associated with it. 
EXAMPLES In Fig. 2-2, the coordinates of several points have been indicated. We have limited ourselves to 
integer coordinates only for simplicity. 
Conversely, every pair (a, 6) of real numbers is associated with a unique point in the plane. 
EXAMPLES In the coordinate system of Fig. 2-3, to find the point having coordinates (3, 2), start at the origin 0, 
move three units to the right and then two units upward. To find the point with coordinates (-2, 4), start at the 
origin 0, move two units to the left and then four units upward. To find the point with coordinates (- 1, - 3), start 
from the origin, move one unit to the left and then three units downward. 
Given a coordinate system, the entire plane except for the points on the coordinate axes can be 
divided into four equal parts, called quadrants. All points with both coordinates positive form the first 
quadrant, quadrant I, in the upper right-hand corner (see Fig. 2-4). Quadrant I1 consists of all points 
with negative x-coordinate and positive y-coordinate; quadrants I11 and IV are also shown in Fig. 2-4.

The points having coordinates of the form (0, b) are precisely the points on the y-axis. The points 
If a coordinate system is given, it is customary to refer to the point with coordinates (a, b) simply as 
having coordinates (a, 0) are the points on the x-axis. 
“the point (a, b).” Thus, one might say: “The point (1,O) lies on the x-axis.” 
2.2 THE DISTANCE FORMULA 
Let P1 and P, be points with coordinates (x,, y,) and (x,, y,) in a given coordinate system (Fig. 
2-5). We wish to find a formula for the distance PIP2. 
Let R be the point where the vertical line through P, intersects the horizontal line through P,. 
Clearly, the x-coordinate of R is x2 , the same as that of P,; and the y-coordinate of R is y,, the same as 
that of P,. By the Pythagorean theorem, 
- 
= Fp2 
+ P,R2 
Now if A, .and A, are the projections of P, and P2 on the x-axis, the segments P,R and A,& 
are opposite sides of a rectangle. Hence, P,R = A,& 
But A,A2 = Ix, - x, I by (1.6). Thus, 
- -  
= I x, - x2 I. Similarly, P, R = I y1 - y, I. Consequently, 
PlP,* = I x1 - x2 1, + I Y l  - Y, 1, 
= (x, - x2), + 011 - Y,), 
PlP, = Jbl - x2I2 + b1 - Y,), 
whence 
[Equation (2.1) is called the distance formula.] The reader should check that this formula also holds 
when P, and P, lie on the same horizontal line or on the same vertical line.

2.3 THE MIDPOINT FORMULAS 
Again considering two arbitrary points Pl(xl, y,) and P2(x2, y2), we shall find the coordinates (x, y) 
of the midpoint M of the segment P,P2 (Fig. 2-6). Let A, B, C be the perpendicular projections of P,, 
M, 
P2 on the x-axis. The x-coordinates of A, B, C are x,, x, x2, respectively. 
- -  
Since the lines P,A, MB, 
and P2 C are parallel, the ratios P1M/MP2 and B/BC are equal. But P,M = MP,; hence AB = E. 
Since AB = x - x1 and 
-- 
= x2 - x, 
x - x1= x2 - x 
2x = X I  + x2 
x1 +x2 
2 
x=- 
(The same result is obtained when P2 is to the left of P,, in which case AB = x1 - x and 
= x - x2.) 
Similarly, y = (yl + y2)/2. Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint M are determined by the midpoint 
formulas 
Y l  + Y 2  
and 
y = -  
x1+ x2 
x=-

In words, the coordinates of the midpoint are the averages of the coordinates of the endpoints.

BC2 = (-7 - 2)2 + (3 - 6)2 = 81 + 9 = 90 
AC2 = (-5 - 2)2 + (-3 - 6)2 = 49 + 81 = 130

Since AB2 + m2 = E2, 
AABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. 
GEOMETRY The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true: If x2

Vertex A has coordinates (b, 0), where b = CA; and vertex B has coordinates (0, a), where a = E. 
Let

Notice that the point (2, 6) satisfies the equation; that is, when the x-coordinate 2 is substituted for x 
and the y-coordinate 6 is substituted for y, the left-hand side, 2y - 3x, assumes the value of the right- 
hand side, 6. The graph of (i) consists of all points (a, b) that satisfy the equation when a is substituted 
for x and b is substituted for y. We tabulate some points that satisfy (i) in Fig. 3-l(a), and indicate these 
points in Fig. 3-l(b). It is apparent that these points all lie on a straight line. In fact, it will be shown 
later that the graph of (i) actually is a straight line.

(x, y) satisfying the equation. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Some points on the graph of y = x2 are computed in Fig. 3-2(a) and shown in Fig. 3-2(b). These points suggest 
that the graph looks like what would be obtained by filling in the dashed curve. This graph is of the type 
known as a parabola. 
(b) The graph of the equation xy = I is called a hyperbola. As shown in Fig. 3-3(b), the graph splits into two 
separate pieces. The points on the hyperbola get closer and closer to the axes as they move farther and farther 
from the origin.

Find the graphs of: (a) y = x2 + 2; (b) y = x2 - 2; (c) y = (x - 2)2; (6) Y = (x + 2)2. 
\ 
The graph of y = x2 + 2 is obtained from the graph of y = x2 (Fig. 3-2) by raising each point two units 
in the vertical direction [see Fig. 3-8(a)]. 
The graph of y = x2 - 2 is obtained from the graph of y = x2 by lowering each point two units [see 
Fig. 3-8(b)]. 
The graph of y = (x - 2)2 is obtained from the graph of y = x2 by moving every point of the latter 
graph two units to the right [see Fig. 3-8(c)]. To see this, assume (a, b) is on y = (x - 2)2. Then 
b = (a - 2)2. Hence, the,point (a - 2, b) satisfies y = x2 and therefore is on the graph of y = x2. But 
(a, b) is obtained by moving (a - 2, b) two units to the right. 
The graph of y = (x + 2)2 is obtained from the graph of y = x2 by moving every point two units to the 
left [see Fig. 3-8(d)]. The reasoning is as in part (c).

Find the graphs of: (a) x = 0) - 2)2; (b) x = ( y  + 2)2. 
(a) The graph of x = (y - 2)2 is obtained by raising the graph of x = y2 [Fig. 3-7(b)] by two units [see 
Fig. 3-9(a)]. The argument is analogous to that for Problem 3 3 4 .  
(b) The graph of x = (y + 2)2 is obtained by lowering the graph of x = y2 two units [see Fig. 3-9(b)]. 
These two results can be generalized as follows. If c is a positive number, the graph of the equation 
F(x, y - c) = 0 is obtained from the graph of F(x, y) = 0 by moving each point of the latter graph c units 
vertically upward. The graph of F(x, y + c) = 0 is obtained from the graph of F(x, y) = 0 by moving each 
point of the latter graph c units vertically downward.

4.1 SLOPE 
If P,(x,, y,) and P2(x2, y2) are two points on a line 9, the number m defined by the equation 
m=- Y2 - Y, 
x2 - x1 
is called the slope of 9. The slope measures the “steepness” of 9. It is the ratio of the change y, - y ,  
in the y-coordinate to the change x2 - x, in the x-coordinate. This is equal to the ratio RPz/P,R in 
Fig. 4l(a). 
-- 
Fig. 4-1 
Y 
Y 
Notice that the value m of the slope does not depend on the pair of points P,, P ,  selected. If 
another pair P3(x3, y3) and P4(x4, y4) is chosen, the same value of m is obtained. In fact, in Fig. 4-l(b), 
AP, P4 S is similar to M 1 P 2  
R. 
o m m y  The angles at R and S are both right angles, and the angles at PI and P, are equal because they are 
corresponding angles determined by the line 9 cutting the parallel lines P,R and P, S. Hence, AP, P, S is similar 
to M,P, R because two angles of the first triangle are equal to two corresponding angles of the second triangle.

The slope of a line may be positive, zero, or negative. Let us see what the sign of the slope indicates. 
Consider a line 9 
that extends upward as it extends to the right. From Fig. 4-3(a), we see that 
y2 > y,; hence, y ,  - y ,  > 0. In addition, x2 > x, and, therefore, x2 - x, > 0. Thus, 
m=- Y 2  - Y l  ,o

The slope of 9

Consider a line 9’ that extends downward as it extends to the right. From Fig. 4-3(b), we see that 
y ,  < y , ;  therefore, y ,  - y ,  < 0. But x2 > x,, so x2 - x, > 0. Hence, 
Y 2  - Y ,  < 0 
m=-

The slope of 9

Consider a horizontal line 9.

x2 - x, > 0. Hence,

Consider a vertical line 9.

x2 - x, = 0. Hence, the expression 
m=-=-= 
Y ,  - Y l  
x2 - x1 
is undefined. The concept of slope is not defined for 9. 
(Sometimes we express this situation by 
saying that the slope of 9 
is infinite.)

Now let us see how the slope varies with the “steepness” of the line. First let us consider lines with 
positive slopes, passing through a fixed point P,(x,, yJ. One such line is shown in Fig. 4-4. Take 
another point, P2(x2, y,), on A? such that x2 - x1 = 1. Then, by definition, the slope rn is equal to the 
distance RP, . Now as the steepness of the line increases, RP, increases without limit [see Fig. 4-5(a)J. 
Thus, the slope of 9 
increases from 0 (when 9 
is horizontal) to + CO (when 9 is vertical). By a similar 
construction we can show that as a negatively sloped line becomes steeper and steeper, the slope stead- 
ily decreases from 0 (when the line is horizontal) to - 
CQ (when the line is vertical) [see Fig. 4-5(b)].

4.2 EQUATIONS OF A LINE 
Consider a line 9’ that passes through the point P,(x,, y,) and has slope rn [Fig. 4-6(a)]. For any 
other point P(x, y) on the line, the slope rn is, by definition, the ratio of y - y, to x - xl. Hence, 
On the other hand, if P(x, y) is not on line 9 [Fig. 4-6(b)], then the slope (y - y,)/(x - x,) of the line 
PP, is different from the slope rn of 9, so that (4.1) does not hold. Equation (4.1) can be rewritten as 
Note that (4.2) is also satisfied by the point (x,, y,). So a point (x, y) is on line 14 if and only if it satisfies 
(4.2); that is, 9 is the graph of (4.2). Equation (4.2) is called a point-slope equation of the line 9.

Therefore, two point-slope equations of 9 are

and 
y - 2 = ~ + 1  
Equation (4.2) is equivalent to 
y-y, =mx-mx, 
or 
y=mx+(y, -mx,) 
Let b stand for the number y, - mx,. Then the equation becomes 
y = m x + b  
(4.3) 
When x = 0, (4.3) yields the value y = b. Hence, the point (0, b) lies on 9. Thus, b is the y-coordinate of 
the point where 9 intersects the y-axis (see Fig. 4-7). The number b is called the y-intercept of 9, and 
(4.3) is called the slope-intercept equation of 9.

Its slope-intercept equation must have the form y = 2x + b. Since the point (1, 3) is on line 14, (1,3) must satisfy the 
equation 
3 = 2(1) + b 
So, b = 1, giving y = 2x + 1 as the slope-intercept equation. 
An alternative method is to write down a point-slope equation, 
whence, 
y - 3 = 2(x - 1) 
y - 3 = 2x - 2 
y = 2 x + 1  
4 3  PARALLEL LINES 
Assume that 9, and 9, are parallel, nonvertical lines, and let P, and P, be the points where 2Yl 
and 9, cut the y-axis [see Fig. 4-8(u)]. Let R, be one unit to the right of P,, and R, one unit to the 
right of P,. Let Q, and Q2 be the intersections of the vertical lines through RI and R2 with 2Yl and 
Y 2 .  
Now AP,RIQ1 is congruent to AP, R2 Qz .

Thus, parallel lines have equal slopes. 
Conversely, if different lines Yl and Y 2  
are not parallel, then their slopes must be different. For if 
Yl and 9, meet at the point P [see Fig. 4-8(b)] and if their slopes are the same, then Yl and Y 2  
would have to be the same line. Thus, we have proved: 
Theorem 4.1: 
Two distinct lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. 
EXAMPLE Let us find an equation of the line 9 
through (3, 2) and parallel to the line A having the equation 
3x - y = 2. The line A has slope-intercept equation y = 3x + 2. Hence, the slope of A is 3, and the slope of the 
parallel line 9 
also must be 3. The slope-intercept equation of 9 must then be of the form y = 3x + b. Since (3, 2) 
lies on 9, 2 = 3(3) + b, or b = -7. Thus, the slope-intercept equation of 9 
is y = 3x - 7. An equivalent equation 
is 3x - y = 7. 
4.4 
PERPENDICULAR LINES 
Theorem 4.2: Two nonvertical lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is - 1. 
Hence, if the slope of one of the lines’is rn, then the slope of the other line is the negative 
reciprocal - l/m. 
For a proof, see Problem 4.5. 
4.1 
Find the slope of the line having the equation 5x - 2y = 4. Draw the line and determine whether 
the points (10,23) and (6, 12) are on the line.

Thus, we have the slope-intercept form; the slope is # and the y-intercept is -2. The line goes through the 
point (0, -2). To draw the line, we need another point on the line. Substitute 2 for x in ( I ) ,  obtaining y = 3. 
Hence, (2, 3) is a point on the line (see Fig. 4-9). (We could have found other points on the line by substitut- 
ing numbers other than 2 for x.) To test whether (10, 23) is on the line, substitute 10 for x and 23 for y and 
see whether the equation 5x - 2y = 4 holds. The two sides turn out to be equal; so (10, 23) is on the line. A 
similar check shows that (6, 12) is not on the line.

Find an equation of the line 9 which is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connect-

Assume that 9,

Let 14: be the line through the origin 0 and parallel to 9,, 
and let 14: be the line through the origin 
and parallel to 14, [see Fig. 4-12(a)]. Since 147 is parallel to 14, and 2’; 
is parallel to 9,, 
the slope of 147 
is m, and the slope of 9: 
is m2 (by Theorem 4.1). Also 14: is perpendicular to 9; 
since 9, 
is perpendicu- 
lar to 14,. Let R be the point on 9f with x-coordinate 1, and let Q be the point on 93 with x-coordinate 
1 [see Fig. 4-12(b)]. The slope-intercept equation of 14: is y = mlx, and so the y-coordinate of R is m, since 
its x-coordinate is 1. Similarly, the y-coordinate of Q is m, . By the distance formula,

Conversely, assume that mlm2 = - 1, where rn, and m, are the slopes of lines 9,

then, by what we have just shown, 
m1m3 = - 1 = m1m2 or

Sketch the graph of the equation I x I + I y I = 1. 
Consider each quadrant separately. In the first quadrant, Ix I = x and I y l  = y. Hence, the equation 
becomes x + y = 1; that is, y = -x + 1. This yields the line with slope - 1 and y-intercept 1. This line 
intersects the x-axis at (1,O). Hence, in the first quadrant our graph consists of the line segment connecting 
(1, 0) and (0, 1) (see Fig. 4-15). In the second quadrant, where x is negative and y is positive, 1x1 = -x 
and I y( = y, and our equation becomes -x + y = 1, or y = x + 1. This yields the line with slope 1 and

Intersections of Graphs 
The intersection of two graphs consists of the points that the graphs have in common. These points 
can be found by solving simultaneously the equations that determine the graphs. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) To find the intersection of the lines 9 and A determined by 
9: 4 x - 3 ~ ~ 1 5  A: 3x+2y=7 
multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, 
8x - 6y = 30 
9x + 6y = 21 
Now y has the coefficients - 6 and 6 in the two equations, and we add the equations to eliminate y, 
17x=51

x = - =

From the eqilation for A, when x = 3,3(3) + 2y = 7. Hence, 
9 + 2 y = 7  
or 
2 y = - 2  
or 
y = - 1  
Thus, the only point of intersection is (3, - 1) (see Fig. 5-1).

(b) Let us find the intersection of the line 2’: y = 2x + 1 and the circle (x - 1)2 + 0, + 1)2 = 16. We must solve 
the system 
y = 2 x + 1  
(1) 
(2) 
(X - 1)2 + (J + 1)2 = 16 
By (Z), substitute 2x + 1 for y in (2), 
(X - 1)2 + ( 2 ~

(x’ - 2~ + 1) + (4x2 + 8x + 4) = 16 
5x2 + 6x + 5 = 16 
5x2 +6x- 11 = O  
(5x + llXx - 1) = 0 
Hence, either 5x + 11 = 0 or x - 1 = 0; that is, either x = - 11/5 = - 2.2 or x = 1. By (Z), when x = 1, y = 3; 
and when x = - 2.2, y = - 3.4. Thus, there are two intersection points, (1, 3) and (- 2.2, - 3.4), as indicated in

when x = - 1, y = 1. Thus, the intersection points are (2,4) and (- 1, 1) (see Fig. 5-3).

Two points P and Q are said to be symmetric with respect to a line 9 if P and Q are mirror images 
in 9. More precisely, the segment PQ is perpendicular to 9 at a point A such that PA = QA (see 
Fig. 6-1).

A graph is said to be symmetric with respect to a line 9 if, for any point P on the graph, the point Q 
that is symmetric to P with respect to 9 is also on the graph. 9 is then called an axis of symmetry of 
the graph. See Fig. 6-3.

Assume that f(x, y) = 0; we must prove that f( - x, - y) = 0. Since f(x, y) = 0 and the graph is sym-

If the graph of 3x2 + xy = 5 is reflected in the y-axis (that is, each point on the graph is replaced 
by the point symmetric to it with respect to the y-axis), find an equation of the new graph. 
A point (x, y) lies on the new graph if and only if (- x, y) is on the original graph; that is, if and only if 
3( -x)’ + (- x)y = 5. This is equivalent to 3x2 - xy = 5. Note that the new equation is obtained from the 
old equation by replacing x by -x.

Functions and Their Graphs 
7.1 THE NOTION OF A FUNCTION 
To say that a quantity y is afunction of some other quantity x means, in ordinary language, that the 
value of y depends on the value of x. For example, the volume V of a cube is a function of the length s 
of a side. In fact, the dependence of V on s can be made precise through the formula V = s3. Such a 
specific association of a number s3 with a given number s is what mathematicians usually mean by a 
function. 
In Fig. 7-1, we picture a functionfas some sort of process which, from a number x, produces a 
numberf(x); the number x is called an argument off and the numberf(x) is called the value off for the 
argument x. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) The square-root function associates with each nonnegative real number x the value &; that is, the unique 
nonnegative real number y such that y2 = x. 
(b) The doubling function g associates with each real number 
x the value 2x. Thus, g(3) = 6, 
g( - 1) = -2, g(&) = 2a. 
The graph of a functionfconsists of all points (x, y) such that y =f(x). Thus, the graph off is the 
graph of the equation y = f ( x ) .  
EXAMPLES 
(a) Consider the functionfsuch thatf(x) = x + 1 for all x. The graph off is the set of all points (x, y) such that 
y = x + 1. This is a straight line, with slope 1 and y-intercept 1 (see Fig. 7-2). 
(b) The graph of the functionfsuch thatf(x) = x2 for all x consists of all points (x, y) such that y = x2. This is the 
parabola of Fig. 3-2. 
(c) Consider the function f such that f ( x )  = x3 for all x. In Fig. 7-3(a), we have indicated a few points on the 
graph, which is sketched in Fig. 7-3(b). 
The numbers x for which a functionfproduces a valuef(x) form a collection of numbers, called the 
domain off. For example, the domain of the square-root function consists of all nonnegative real

numbers; the function is not defined for negative arguments. On the other hand, the domain of the 
doubling function consists of all real numbers. 
The numbers that are the values of a function form the range of the function. 
The domain and the range of a functionfoften can be determined easily by looking at the graph 
offi The domain consists of all x-coordinates of points of the graph, and the range consists of all 
y-coordinates of points of the graph. 
EXAMPLES 
(U) The range of the square-root function consists of all nonnegative real numbers. Indeed, for every nonnegative 
real number y there is some number x such that & = y ;  namely, the number y2. 
(b) The range of the doubling function consists of all real numbers. Indeed, for every real number y there exists a 
real number x such that 2x = y ;  namely, the number y/2. 
(c) Consider the absolute-value function h, defined by h(x) = I x I. The domain consists of all real numbers, but the 
range is made up of all nonnegative real numbers. The graph is shown in Fig. 7-4. When x 2 0, y = I x l  is 
equivalent to y = x, the equation of the straight line through the origin with slope 1. When x < 0, y = I x I is 
equivalent to y = -x, the equation of the straight line through the origin with slope - 1. The perpendicular 
projection of all points of the graph onto the y-axis shows that the range consists of all y such that y 2 0. 
b Y  
Fig. 7-4 
(d) Consider the function g defined by the formula g(x) = ,/=, 
whenever this formula makes sense. Here the 
value ,/= 
is defined only when 1 - x 2 0; that is, only when x _< 1. So the domain of g consists of all real 
numbers x such that x I 1. It is a little harder to find the range of g. Consider a real number y ;  it will belong 
to the range of g if we can find some number x such that y = ,/=. 
Since ,/= 
cannot be negative 
(by definition of the square-root function), we must restrict our attention to nonnegative y. Now if

y = ,/=, 
then y2 = 1 - x, and, therefore, x = 1 - y2. Indeed, when x = 1 - y2, then 
The range of g therefore consists of all nonnegative real numbers. This is clear from the graph of g [see Fig. 
7-5(b)]. The graph is the upper half of the parabola x = 1 - y2.

Note: In many treatments of the foundations of mathematics, a function is identified with its graph. In 
other words, a function is defined to be a setfof ordered pairs such thatfdoes not contain two pairs 
(a, b) and (a, c) with b # c. Then “y =j(x))’ is defined to mean the same thing as “(x, y) belongs to 5’’ 
However, this approach obscures the intuitive idea of a function.

Thus, the domain off is the closed interval [ - 1, 13. To determine the range off; notice that as x varies from - 1 to 
0, x2 varies from 1 to 0, 1 - x2 varies from 0 to 1, and ,/= 
also varies from 0 to 1. Similarly, as x varies from 0 
to 1, ,/= 
varies from 1 to 0. Hence, the range offis the closed interval [0, 13. This is confirmed by looking at 
the graph of the equation y = ,/= 
in Fig. 7-7. This is a semicircle. In fact, the circle x2 + y2 = 1 is equivalent 
to 
y2 = 1 - x2

7.3 EVEN AND ODD FUNCTIONS 
A function f is called even if, for any x in the domain off, - x  is also in the domain off and 
f(-4 =f(x). 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Letf(x) = x2 for all x. Then 
f( -x) = (-Xy = x2 =f(x) 
and so f is even. 
(b) Letf(x) = 3x4 - 5x2 + 2 for all x. Then 
f(-x) = 3(-x)4 - 5 ( - X y  + 2 = 3x4 - 5x2 + 2 = f ( x )  
Thus, f is even. More generally, a function that is defined for all x and involves only even powers of x is an 
even function. 
(c) Letf(x) = x3 + 1 for all x. Then 
j-(-X) = (
4
 
+ 1 = 4 + 1 
Now -x3 + 1 is not equal to x3 + 1 except when x = 0. Hence,fis not even. 
A function f is even if and only if the graph off is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. For the 
symmetry means that for any point (x, f (x)) on the graph, the image point ( - x, f (x)) also lies on the 
graph; in other words, f (- x) = f ( x )  (see Fig. 7-8).

A function f is called odd if, for any x in the domain off, --x is also in the domain off and 
f(--x) = -f(-x). 
EXAMPLES 
(U) Letf(x) = x3 for all x. Then 
f( -x) = (-x)3 = -x3 = -f(x) 
Thus,fis odd. 
(b) Letf(x) = 4x for all x. Then 
f(-x) = q-x) = -4x = -f(x) 
Thus,fis odd. 
(c) Letf(x) = 3x5 - 2x3 + x for all x. Then 
f(-X) = 3(-x)5 - 2(-x)3 + (-x) = 3(-x5) - 2+3) - x 
= - 3 2  + 2x3 - = 4 3 2  - 2x3 + x) = -f(x) 
Thus,fis odd. More generally, iff(x) is defined as a polynomial that involves only odd powers of x (and lacks 
a constant term), thenf(x) is an odd function. 
(d) The functionf(x) = x3 + 1, which was shown above to be not even, is not odd either. In fact, 
but 
f(1) = (1)3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 
-f(-1) = -[(-1)3 + 13 = -[-1 + 13 = 0 
A function f is odd if and only if the graph off is symmetric with respect to the origin. For the 
symmetry means that for any point (x,~(x)) on the graph, the image point (-x, -f(x)) is also on the 
graph; that is,f( - x) = -f(x) (see Fig. 7-9).

(that is, the numbers a,,, a,,-,, . . . , a,, a, are integers), and if r is an integer that is a root 
off, then r must be a divisor of the constant term a,. 
EXAMPLE By Theorem 7.1, any integral root of x3 - 2x2 - 5x + 6 must be among the divisors of 6, which are 
f 
1, f 2, f 3, and f 6. By actual substitution, it is found that 1, - 2, and 3 are roots.

A number r is a root of the polynomial 
f ( x )  = a,x" + a,-,xn-~ + * * *  + a,x + a0 
if and only iff(x) is divisible by the polynomial x - r. 
EXAMPLES 
Consider the polynomialf(x) = x3 - 4x2 + 14x - 20. By Theorem 7.1, any integral root must be a divisor of 
20; that is, f 1, f 
2, f 4, f 
5, f 10, or 
20. Calculation reveals that 2 is a root. Hence (Theorem 7.2), x - 2 
must divide f(x); we carry out the division in Fig. 7-1qa). Since f ( x )  = (x - 2)(x2 - 2x + lO), its remaining 
roots are found by solving 
x2 - 2x + 10 = 0 
Applying the quadratic formula (see Problem 5.2), 
Thus, the other two roots off(x) are the complex numbers 1 + 3-

Let us find the roots of f(x) = x3 - 5x2 + 3x + 9. The integral roots (if any) must be divisors of 9: f 1, +, 3, 
f9. 1 is not a root, but - 1 is a root. Hencef(x) is divisible by x + 1 [see Fig. 7-1qb)l. The other roots off(x) 
must be the roots of x2 - 6x + 9. But x2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)2. Thus, - 1 and 3 are the roots off(x); 3 is called 
a repeated root because (x - 3)' is a factor of x3 - 5x2 + 3x + 9.

Find the domain and the range of the functionfsuch thatf(x) = -x2. 
Since -x2 is defined for every real number x, the domain offconsists of all real numbers. To find the 
range, notice that x2 2 0 for all x and, therefore, -x2 I 
0 for all x. Every non ositive number y appears as 
a value -xz for a suitable argument x; namely, for the argument x = &(and 
also for the argument 
x = -A). 
Thus the range off is (- 00, 01. This can be seen more easily by looking at the graph of

The formula makes sense whenever the denominator x - 1 is not 0. Hence, the domain offis the set of

some point (xo , w), letf(x,) = w. Then at is the graph of$

Limits 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
To a great extent, calculus is the study of the rates at which quantities change. It will be necessary 
to see how the valuef(x) of a functionfbehaves as the argument x approaches a given number. This 
leads to the idea of limit. 
EXAMPLE Consider the function fsuch that 
whenever this formula makes sense. Thus,fis defined for all x for which the denominator x - 3 is not 0; that is, for 
x # 3. What happens to the value f ( x )  as x approaches 3? Well, x2 approaches 9, and so x2 - 9 approaches 0; 
moreover, x - 3 approaches 0. Since the numerator and the denominator both approach 0, it is not clear what 
x2 - 9  
happens to - 
x - 3 ’  
However, upon factoring the numerator, we observe that 
x2 - 9 
x - 3  
x - 3  
(X - 3)(x + 3) = x + 3  
-- - 
Since x + 3 unquestionably approaches 6 as x approaches 3, we now know that our function approaches 6 as x 
approaches 3. The traditional mathematical way of expressing this fact is 
x2 - 9 
lim - 
- 
- 6  
x+3 x - 3  
x2 - 9 
x - 3  
This is read: “The limit of - 
as x approaches 3 is 6.” 
approaches 4, x2 - 9 approaches 7 and x - 3 approaches 1. Hence, 
Notice that there is no problem when x approaches any number other than 3. For instance, when x

Properties IV-VII have a common structure. Each tells us that, providedfand/or g has a limit as x 
approaches a (see Section 8.3), another, related function also has a limit as x approaches a, and this 
limit is as given by the indicated formula. 
83 EXISTENCE OR NONEXISTENCE OF THE LIMIT 
In certain cases, a functionf(x) will not approach a limit as x approaches a particular number. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Figure 8-l(a) indicates that 
1 
lim - 
x-ro x 
does not exist. As x approaches 0, the magnitude of l/x becomes larger and larger. (If x > 0, l/x is positive and 
very large when x is close to 0. If x < 0, l/x is negative and very “small” when x is close to 0.) 
(b) Figure 8-l(b) indicates that 
1x1 
lim - 
x-ro x 
does not exist. When x>O, 1x1 = x  and IxI/x= 1; when x<O, 1x1 = -x and IxI/x= -1. Thus, as x 
approaches 0, IxI/x approaches two different values, 1 and -1, depending on whether x nears 0 through 
positive or through negative values. Since there is no unique limit as x approaches 0, we say that 
1x1 
lim - 
x-ro x 
does not exist. 
(4 Let 
Then [see Fig. 8-l(c)], limf(x) does not exist. As x approaches 1 from the left (that is, through values of x < l), 
f ( x )  approaches 1. But as x approaches 1 from the right (that is, through values of x > l),f(x) approaches 2.

LIMITS 
[CHAP. 8 
Notice that the existence or nonexistence of a limit for f ( x )  as x 4 
a does not depend on the value 
f(a), nor is it even required that f be defined at a. If lirn f ( x )  = L, then L is a number to which f ( x )  can 
be made arbitrarily close by letting x be sufliciently close to a. The value of L - o r  the very existence of 
L-is 
determined by the behavior offnear a, not by its value at a (if such a value even exists).

as x approaches 2 from the left (that is, with x < 2), [x] remains equal to 1. Hence, there is no unique 
number that is approached by [x] as x approaches 2. Therefore, lirn [x] does not exist.

(a) Intuitively, lim f(x) = L means that f ( x )  can be made as close as we wish to L if x is taken suficiently 
close to a. A mathematically precise version of this assertion is: For any real number E > 0, there exists 
a real number 6 > 0 such that 
0 < Ix - a1 < 6 implies If(x) - LI c E 
for any x in the domain off. Remember that I x - a I < 6 means that the distance between x and a is 
smaller than 6, and that I f(x) - L I < E means that the distance between f ( x )  and L is smaller than E. 
We assume that the domain off is such that it contains at least one argument x within distance 6 of a 
for arbitrary 6 > 0. Observe also that the condition 0 < I x - a I excludes consideration of x = a, in line 
with the requirement that the value (if any) off@) has nothing to do with limf(x). 
A pictorial version of this definition is shown in Fig. 8-2. No matter how thin a horizontal strip (of 
width 2 4  that may be taken symmetrically above and below the line y = L, there is a thin vertical strip 
(of width 26) around the line x = a such that, for any x-coordinate of a point in this strip except x = a, 
the corresponding point (x,f(x)) lies in the @ven horizontal strip. The number 6 depends on the given 
number E; if is made smaller, then 6 may also have to be chosen smaller. 
The precise version just given for the limit concept is called an epsilon-delta definition because of 
the traditional use of the Greek letters 6 and 6. 
(b) Let E > 0 be given. Then 4 2  > 0 and, since limf(x) = L, there is a real number 6 ,  > 0 such that

9.2 INFINITE LIMITS: VERTICAL ASYMPTOTES 
If the valuef(x) of a function gets larger without bound as x approaches a, then limf(x) does not

limf(x) = + GO 
x-a 
to indicate thatf(x) does get larger without bound. 
EXAMPLE Let f ( x )  = 1/x2 for all x # 0. The graph off is shown in Fig. 9-2. As x approaches 0 from either side, 
l/x2 grows without bound. Hence,

Whenf(x) has an infinite limit as x approaches a from the right and/or from the left, the graph of 
the function gets closer and closer to the vertical line x = a as x approaches U. In such a case, the line 
x = a is called a oertical asymptote of the graph. In Fig. 9-4, the lines x = a and x = 6 are vertical 
asymptotes (approached on one side only). 
If a function is expressed as a quotient, F(x)/G(x), the existence of a vertical asymptote x = U is 
usually signaled by the fact that Gfa) = 0 [except when F(a) = 0 also holds].

9.3 LIMITS AT INFINITY: HORIZONTAL ASYMPTOTES 
As x gets larger without bound, the value f ( x )  of a function f may approach a fixed real number c. 
In that case, we shall write 
lim f ( x )  = c 
In such a case, the graph off gets closer and closer to the horizontal line y = c as x gets larger and 
larger. Then the line y = c is called a horizontal asymptote of the graph-more 
exactly, a horizontal 
asymptote to the right.

EXAMPLE Consider the functionf(x) = - 
whose graph is shown in Fig. 9-5. Then lirn f ( x )  = 1 and the line 
x - 3  
X-.+aD 
y = 1 is a horizontal asymptote to the right. 
Iff(x) approaches a fixed real number c as x gets smaller without bound,' we shall write 
lim f ( x )  = c 
X ' - W  
In such a case, the graph offgets closer and closer to the horizontal line y = c as x gets smaller and 
smaller. Then the line y = c is called a horizontal asymptote to the left. 
EXAMPLES For the function graphed in Fig. 9-5, the line y = 1 is a horizontal asymptote both to the left and to 
the right. For the function graphed in Fig. 9-2, the line y = 0 (the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote both to the left 
and to the right. 
If a function f becomes larger without bound as its argument x increases without bound, we shall 
write lim f ( x )  = + 00.

case, the absolute value I x I becomes larger without bound.

sequence of line segments, as shown in Fig. 9-6. Then lirn f ( x )  is undefined, since the valuef(x) neither approaches 
a fixed limit nor does it become larger or smaller without bound. Similarly, lim f ( x )  is undefined.

be continuous at a if the following three conditions hold: 
0 i f x = O  
1 ifx+O' The function is discontinuous (that is, not continuous) at 0. Condition (i) is satisfied: 
Letf(x) = 
lirn f(x) = 1. Condition (ii) is satisfied: f(0) = 0. However, condition (iii) fails: 1 # 0. There is a gap in the 
graph off(see Fig. 10-1) at the point (0, 1). The function is continuous at every point different from 0. 
Let f(x) = x2 for all x. This function is continuous at every a, since lim f ( ~ )  
= lim x2 = a2 =f(a). Notice that 
there are no gaps or jumps in the graph off(see Fig. 10-2). 
The function f such that f(x) = [x] for all x is discontinuous at each integer, because condition (i) is not 
satisfied (see Fig. 7-12). The discontinuities show up as jumps in the graph of the function. 
The functionfsuch thatf(x) = I x I/x for all x # 0 is discontinuous at 0 [see Fig. 8-1(b)]. lirn f(x) does not exist 
andf(0) is not defined. Notice that there is a jump in the graph at x = 0.

EXAMPLES In example (a) above, the discontinuity at x = 0 is removable, since if we redefined f so that f(0) = 1, 
then the resulting function would be continuous at x = 0. The discontinuities of the functions in examples (c) and 
(d) above are not removable. 
A discontinuity of a function fat a is removable if and only if lim f ( x )  exists. In that case, the value 
x-a 
of the function at a can be changed to limf(x).

CONTINUITY

A function f i s  said to be continuous on a set A iffis continuous at each element of A. Iffis 
continuous at every number of its domain, then we simply say thatfis continuous or thatfis a contin- 
uous function. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Every polynomialfunction is a continuousfunction. This follows from example (b) of Property V in Section 8.2. 
(b) Every rational function h(x) = fo , where f and g are polynomials, is continuous at eoery real number a except 
g(x) 
the real roots (ifany) ofg(x). This follows from Property VI in Section 8.2. 
There are certain properties of continuity that follow directly from the standard properties of limits 
8.2). Assumefand g are continuous at a. Then, 
The sumf+ g and the differencef- g are continuous at a. 
NOTATION f+ g is a function, such that (f+ gxx) = f ( x )  + g(x) for every x, that is in both the domain of 
fand the domain of g .  Similarly, (f- gxx) = f ( x )  - g(x) for all x common to the domains offand g. 
If c is a constant, the function cfis continuous at a. 
~ 
~~ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
NOTATION cfis a function such that (cf)(x) = c - f ( x )  for every x in the domain off: 
The product fg is continuous at a, and the quotient f l s  is continuous at a provided that 
s(4 + 0- 
NOTATION fg is a function, such that (fg)(x) = f ( x )  g(x) for every x, that is in both the domain off and 
the domain of g. Similarly, (f/gXx) = - 
for all x in both domains such that g(x) # 0. 
f (4 
d x )  
is continuous at a iff(a) > 0. 
Note: Sincefis continuous at a, the restriction thatf(a) > 0 guarantees that, for x close to a, 
S(x) > 0, and therefore that 
is defined. 
10.2 ONE-SIDED CONTINUITY 
A functionfis said to be continuous on the right at a if it satisfies conditions (i)-(iii) for continuity at 
a, with lirn replaced by lim; that is, (i) lirn f ( x )  exists; (ii)f(a) is defined; (iii) lirn f ( x )  =f(a). Simi- 
larly,fis continuous on the Zeft at a'if it satisfies the conditions for continuity at a with lirn replaced by 
lim . Note that fis continuous at a if and only iffis continuous both on the right and on the left at a, 
since lim f ( x )  exists if and only if both lim f ( x )  and lim f ( x )  exist and lim f ( x )  = lirn f(x).

ignoring the function’s behavior at any other points at which it may be defined. 
Definition: A functionfis continuous ouer [a, b] if: 
(i) fis continuous at each point of the open interval (a, b). 
(ii) fis continuous on the right at U. 
(iii) fis continuous on the left at b.

Consider the function f such that f ( x )  = x - [x] for all x. (See the graph off in Fig. 9-6.) Find 
the points at whichf is discontinuous. At those points, determine whether f is continuous on the 
right or continuous on the left (or neither). 
For each integer n,f(n) = n - [n] = n - n = 0. For n < x < n + l,f(x) = x - [x] = x - n. Hence, 
lim f ( x )  = lim (x - n) = 0 = f ( n )

Thus,fis continuous on the right at n. On the other hand, 
lim f(x) = lim [x - (n - l)] = n - (n - 1) = 1 # 0 =f(n) 
so that f is not continuous on the left at n. It follows thatfis discontinuous at each integer. On each open 
interval (n, n + l),fcoincides with the continuous function x - n. Therefore, there are no points of discon- 
tinuity other than the integers.

removable. Since -

The Slope of a Tangent Line 
The slope of a tangent line to a curve is familiar in the case of circles [see Fig. 11-l(u)]. At each 
point P of a circle, there is a line 9 such that the circle touches the line at P and lies on one side of the 
line (entirely on one side in the case of a circle). For the curve of Fig. 11-l(b), shown in dashed lines, Y 1  
is the tangent line at P,, 9, the tangent line at P,, and 9, 
the tangent line at P,. Let us develop a 
definition that corresponds to these intuitive ideas about tangent lines. 
Figure ll-2(u) shows the graph (in dashed lines) of a continuous function f: Remember that the 
graph consists of all points (x, y )  such that y =f(x). Let P be a point of the graph having abscissa x. 
Then the coordinates of P are (x,~(x)). Take a point Q on the graph having abscissa x + h. Q will be 
close to P if and only if h is close to 0 (becausefis a continuous function). Since the x-coordinate of Q is 
x + h, the y-coordinate of Q must bef(x + h). By the definition of slope, the line PQ will have slope 
f ( x  + h) -fW -

Observe in Fig. ll-2(6) what happens to the line PQ as Q moves along the graph toward P. Some of 
the positions of Q have been designated as Q1,

The Derivative 
The expression for the slope of the tangent line

h-+O 
determines a number which depends on x. Thus, the expression defines a function, called the derivative 
Definition: The derivativef’ offis the function defined. by the formula 
off. 
NOTATION There are other notations traditionally used for the derivative: 
dY 
D , f ( x )  
and - 
dx 
dY 
When a variable y representsf(x), the derivative is denoted by y’, D,y, or - We shall use whichever notation is 
dx * 
most convenient or customary in a given case. 
The derivative is so important in all parts of pure and applied mathematics that we must devote a 
great deal of effort to finding formulas for the derivatives of various kinds of functions. If the limit in the 
above definition exists, the functionfis said to be dz@erentiabZe at x, and the process of calculatingf‘ is 
called diferentiation off. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Letf(x) = 3x + 5 for all x. Then, 
Hence, 
f(x + h) = 3(x + h) + 5 = 3x + 3h + 5 
f(x + h) -f(x) = ( 3 ~  
+ 3h + 5) - ( 3 ~  
+ 5) = 3x + 3h + 5 - 3x - 5 = 3h

- - = 3  
3h

f(x + h) -f(x) = lim 
= 
h 
h+O 
f’(x) = lim 
h+O 
or, in another notation, D,(3x + 5) = 3. In this case, the derivative is independent of x. 
(b) Let us generalize to the case of the functionf(x) = Ax + B, where A and B are constants. Then, 
f(x + h) - f ( x )  
[A(x + h) + B] - (Ax + B)

We shall need to know how to differentiate functions built up by arithmetic operations on simpler 
functions. For this purpose, several rules of differentiation will be proved. 
RULE 1. (0 
D X ( f ( 4  + g(4) = Dxf (4 + D x  g(x) 
Dx(f (4 - g(xN = Dxf (4 - D x  g(x) 
The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. 
The derivative of a diflerence is the diflerence of the derivatives. 
For proofs of (i) and (ii), see Problem 12.1(a). 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Dx(x3 + x2) = D,(x3) + D,(x2) = 3x2 + 2x 
(b) D,(x2 - 1) = DX(x2) - Dx(-!) = 2x - (- -$) = 2~ + -

RULE 2. D,(c *f(x)) = c D, f (x) 
where c is a constant. 
For a proof, see Problem 12.1(b). 
EXAMPLES 
DX(7x2) = 7 D,(x2) = 7 2x = 14x 
D,(12x3) = 12 D,(x3) = 12(3x2) = 36x2 
D,(3x3 + 5x2 + 2x + 4) = D,(3x3) + Dx(5x2) + DA2x) + Dx(4) 
= 3 Dx(x3) + 5 D,(x2) + 2 Dx(x) + 0 
= 3(3x2) + 5(2x) + 2(1) = 9x2 + 1Ox + 2 
RULE 3 (Product Rule). Dx( f (x) g(x)) = f (x) Dxg(x) + g(x) Dx f (x)

(a) Forf(x) = 3x2 - 5x + 1, Rule 5 givesf'(x) = 6x - 5. Then, 
(b) f ( x )  = x7 - 12x4 + 2x, at x = 1

f(2) = 3(2)2 - 5(2) + 1

3(4) - 10 + 1 = 12 - 9 = 3 
Thus, the slope of the tangent line to the graph at (2, f(2)) = (2, 3) is f'(2) = 7, and we have as a

Maximum and Minimum Problems 
14.1 RELATIVE EXTREMA 
A function f is said to have a relative maximum at x = c if 
f ( x )  s f ( c )  
for all x near c. More precisely, f achieves a relative maximum at c if there exists 6 > 0 such that 
I x - c I -c 6 impliesf(x) <f(c). 
EXAMPLE For the function f whose graph is shown in Fig. 14-1, relative maxima occur at x = c1 and x = c 2 .  
This is obvious, since the point A is higher than nearby points on the graph, and the point B is higher than nearby 
points on the graph. 
The word “relative” is used to modify “maximum” because the value of a function at a relative maximum is 
not necessarily the greatest value of the function. Thus, in Fig. 14-1, the valuef(c,) at c1 is smaller than many other 
values off@); in particular,f(c,) <f(c2). In this example, the valuef(c,) is the greatest value of the function. 
A functionfis said to have a relative minimum at x = c if 
f (4 2 f (4 
for x near c. In Fig. 14-1,fachieves a relative minimum at x = d, since point D is lower than nearby 
points on the graph. The value at a relative minimum need not be the smallest value of the function; for 
example, in Fig. 14-1, the valuef(e) is smaller thanf(d). 
By a relative extrernum is meant either a relative maximum or a relative minimum. Points at which 
a relative extremum exists possess the following characteristic property. 
ty 
B 
Fig. 14-1 
Theorem 14.1: Iffhas a relative extremum at x = c and iff’(c) exists, thenf’(c) = 0. 
The theorem is intuitively obvious. Iff’(c) exists, then there is a well-defined tangent line at the 
point on the graph offwhere x = c. But at a relative maximum or relative minimum, the tangent line is 
horizontal (see Fig. 14-2), and so its slopef’(c) is zero. For a rigorous proof, see Problem 14.28. 
The converse of Theorem 14.1 does not hold. Iff’(c) = 0, thenfneed not have a relative extremum 
at x = c.

EXAMPLE Consider the functionf(x) = x3. Becausef’(x) = 3x2,f’(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. But from the graph 
offin Fig. 14-3 it is clear thatfhas neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum at x = 0. 
In Chapter 23, a method will be given that often will enable us to determine whether a relative 
extremum actually exists whenf’(c) = 0. 
14.2 ABSOLUTE EXTREMA 
Practical applications usually call for finding the absolute maximum or absolute minimum of a 
function on a given set. Letfbe a function defined on a set d (and possibly at other points, too), and let 
c belong to b. Then f is said to achieve an absolute maximum on Q at c if f ( x )  <f(c) for all x in b. 
Similarly,fis said to achieve an absolute minimum on E at d iff(x) >f(d) for all x in 8. 
If the set d is a closed interval [a, b], and if the functionfis continuous over [a, b] (see Section 
10.3), then we have a very important existence theorem (which cannot be proved in an elementary way). 
Theorem 14.2 (Extreme-Value Theorem): Any continuous function f over a closed interval [a, b] has 
an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on [a, b]. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Letf(x) = x + 1 for all x in the closed interval [0, 21. The graph offis shown in Fig. 14-*a). Thenfachieves 
an absolute maximum on CO, 2) at x = 2; this absolute maximum value is 3. In additionJachieves an absolute 
minimum at x = 0; this absolute minimum value is 1. 
(b) Let f(x) = l/x for all x in the open interval (0, 1). The graph off is shown in Fig. 14-4(b). f has neither an 
absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum on (0, 1). If we extended f to the half-open interval (0, 11, then 
there is an absolute minimum at x = 1, but still no absolute maximum.

for the graph off: f has neither an absolute maximum nor an absolute minimum on the 
closed interval [- 1, 13. Theorem 14.2 does not apply, becausefis discontinuous at 0. 
Critical Numbers 
To actually locate the absolute extrema guaranteed by Theorem 14.2, it is useful to have the follow- 
ing notion.

MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM PROBLEMS 
[CHAP. 14 
(6) 
Fig. 14-4 
Definition: A critical number of a functionfis a number c in the domain off for which eitherf’(c) = 0 
orf’(c) is not defined. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Let f ( x )  = 3x2 - 2x + 4. Then f‘(x) = 6x - 2. Since 6x - 2 is defined for all x, the only critical numbers are 
given by 
6 ~ - 2 = 0  
6x = 2 
X = $ = i  
Thus, the only critical number is 3. 
(b) Letf(x) = x3 - x2 - 5x + 3. Thenf’(x) = 3x2 - 2x - 5, and since 3x2 - 2x - 5 is defined for all x, the only 
critical numbers are the solutions of 
3x2 - 2x - 5 = 0 
(3x - 5)(x + 1) = 0 
3 x - 5 = 0  
or 
x + 1 = 0  
3x = 5 or 
x =  - 1  
x = 3  or 
x -  -1 
Hence, there are two critical numbers, - 1 and 3. 
We already know from the example in Section 13,l that f’(0) is not defined. Hence, 0 is a critical number. 
Since D,(x) = 1 and DA -x) = - 1, there are no other critical numbers. 
Method for Finding Absolute Extrema 
Let f be a continuous function on a closed interval [a, b]. Assume that there are only a finite 
number of critical numbers c1, c2, . . . , ck off inside [a, b]; that is, in (a, b). (This assumption holds for 
most functions encountered in calculus.) Tabulate the values off at these critical numbers and at the 
endpoints U and b, as in Table 14-1. Then the largest tabulated value is the absolute maximum off on 
[a, b], and the smallest tabulated value is the absolute minimum off on [a, b]. (This result is proved in 
Problem 14.1.)

f(x) = x3 - 5 2  + 3x + 1 
on CO, 13 and find the arguments at which these values are achieved. 
The function is continuous everywhere; in particular, on CO, 13. Since f '(x) = 3x2 - 1Ox + 3 is defined for all x, 
the only critical numbers are the solutions of 
3x2 - 1ox + 3 = 0 
(3x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 
3 x - 1 = 0  
or 
x - 3 = 0  
3x = 1 or 
x = 3  
x = 4  or 
x = 3

By the extreme-value theorem (Theorem 14.2), a functionfcontinuous on [a, b] must have an absolute 
maximum and an absolute minimum on [a, b]. Let p be an argument at which the absolute maximum is 
achieved. 
CaseZ: 
p is one of the endpoints, a or b. Thenf(p) will be one of the values in our table. In fact, it will be 
the largest value in the table, sincef(p) is the absolute maximum offon [a, b]. 
Case 2: 
p is not an endpoint andf’(p) is not defined. Then p is a critical number and will be one of the 
numbers c1, c2, . . . , ck in our list. Hence,f(p) will appear as a tabulated value, and it will be the largest of 
the tabulated values. 
Case 3.- p is not an endpoint and f‘b) 
is defined. Since p is the absolute maximum off on [a, b], 
f(p) 2f(x) for all x near p. Thus,fhas a relative maximum at p, and Theorem 14.1 givesf’b) = 0. But then 
p is a critical number, and the conclusion follows as in Case 2. 
A completely analogous argument shows that the method yields the absolute minimum.

Let P = uu. Since U + U = 10, U = 10 - u, and so

Here, 0 < u < 10. But since P would take the value 0 at U = 0 and U = 10, and 0 is clearly not the absolute 
maximum of P, we can extend the domain of P to the closed interval CO, 101. Thus, we must find the 
absolute maximum of P = 1Ou - u2 on the closed interval [0, 101. The derivative dP/du = 10 - 214 vanishes 
only at U = 5, and this critical point must yield the maximum. Thus, the absolute maximum is 
P(5) = 5(10 - 5) = 5(5) = 25, which is attained for u = 5. When u = 5, u = 10 - U = 10 - 5 = 5.

An orchard has an average yield of 25 bushels per tree when there are at most 40 trees per acre. 
When there are more than 40 trees per acre, the average yield decreases by 9 bushel per tree for 
every tree over 40. Find the number of trees per acre that will give the greatest yield per acre. 
Let x be the number of trees per acre, and let f(x) be the total yield in bushels per acre. When 
0 s x 5 40, f(x) = 25x. If x > 40, the number of bushels produced by each tree becomes 25 - i(x - 40). 
[Here x - 40 is the number of trees over 40, and i(x - 40) is the corresponding decrease in bushels per 
tree.] Hence, for x > 40,f(x) is given by 
1 
X 
(X - 40)).

Thus, 
X 
f ( x )  is continuous everywhere, since 25x = - (90 - x) when x = 40. Clearly, f(x) < 0 when x > 90. Hence, 
we may restrict attention to the interval CO, 901. 
For 0 < x < 40, f ( x )  = 25x, and f’(x) = 25. Thus, there are no critical numbers in the open interval 
(0,40). For 40 < x < 90,

and 
f’(x) = 45 - x 
Thus, x = 45 is a critical number. In addition, 40 is also a critical number sincef‘(40) happens not to exist. 
We do not have to verify this fact, since there is no harm in adding 40 [or any other number in (0, 9O)J to 
the list for which we computef(x). 
We now construct Table 14-6:

The Chain Rule 
lS.l COMPOSITE FUNCTIONS 
There are still many functions whose derivatives we do not know how to calculate; for example, 
(i) J- 
(ii) $Z7 
(iii) 
(x2 + 3x - 1)23 
In case (iii), we could, of course, multiply x2 + 3x - 1 by itself 22 times and then differentiate the 
resulting polynomial. But without a computer, this would be extremely arduous. 
The above three functions have the common feature that they are combinations of simpler func- 
tions : 
(i) d

is the result of starting with the functionf(x) = x3 - x + 2 and then applying the 
function g(x) = fi to the result. Thus, 
Jx’ - x + 2 = g(f(x)) 
dZ4 = G(F(x)) 
(x2 + 3x - 1)23 = K ( H ( ~ ) )  
(ii) 1 5  
is the result of starting with the function F(x) = x + 4 and then applying the function 
G(x) = fi. 
Thus, 
(iii) (x2 + 3x - 1)23 is the result of beginning with the function H(x) = x2 + 3x - 1 and then applying 
the function K(x) = x23. Thus, 
Functions that are put together this way out of simpler functions are called composite functions. 
Definition: Iff and g are any functions, then the composition g 0 f off and g is the function such that 
(9

 = g(f(x)) 
The “process” of composition is diagrammed in Fig. 15- 1.

(9 0 fXx) = g(f(x)) = g(x - 1) = (X -

15.2 DIFFERENTIATION OF COMPOSITE FUNCTIONS 
First, let us treat an important special case. The function [f(x)]” is the composition g 0 f off and 
the function g(x) = x”. We have:

Theorem 15.3 (Chain Rule): Assume that f is differentiable at x and that g is differentiable at f ( x ) .  
Then the composition g 0 fis differentiable at x, and its derivative (g 0 f)’ is given by 
(25.2) 
that is, 
W g ( f ( x ) )  = g’(f(x))Dx f(4 
The proof of Theorem 15.3 is tricky; see Problem 15.27. The power chain rule (Theorem 15.2) 
follows from the chain rule (Theorem 15.3) when g(x) = x”. 
Applications of the general chain rule will be deferred until later chapters. Before leaving it, 
however, we shall point out a suggestive notation. If one writes y = g(f(x)) and u = f ( x ) ,  then y = g(u), 
and (25.2) may be expressed in the form 
dy 
dy du 
dx - du dx 
---- 
(25.3) 
just as though derivatives were fractions (which they are not) and as though the chain rule were an 
identity obtained by the cancellation of the du’s on the right-hand side. While this “identity” makes for 
an easy way to remember the chain rule, it must be borne in mind that y on the left-hand side of (25.3) 
stands for a certain function of x [namely (g of)(x)], whereas on the right-hand side it stands for a 
different funcion of u [namely, g(u)].

Differentiation of Rational Powers 
We want to be able to differentiate the functionf(x) = x', where r is a rational number. The special 
case of r an integer is already covered by Rule 7 of Chapter 13. 
ALGEBRA A rational number r is one that can be represented in the form r = n/k, where n and k are integers, with 
k positive. By definition, 
anlk = ( f i y  
except when a is negative and k is even (in which case the kth root of a is undefined). For instance,

Observe that

= .\tJ;;;; 
whenever both sides are defined. In fact, 
which shows that (fi)" 
is the kth root of a". In calculations we are free to choose whichever expression for a"Ik is 
the more convenient. Thus: (i) 642/3 is easier to compute as 
than as 
but (ii) (J8)2/3 
is easier to compute as

Implicit Differentiation 
A function is usually defined explicitly by means of a formula. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) f(x) = x 2  - x + 2 
(b) f ( x ) =  J;; 
(c) f(x)= (" - 1  
i f x r l  
1 - x  
i f x < l  
However, sometimes the value y = f ( x )  is not given by such a direct formula. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) The equation y 3  - x = 0 implicitly determines y as a function of x. In this case, we can solve for y explicitly, 
y 3 = x  
or 
y = f i  
(b) The equation y3 + 12y2 + 48y - 8x + 64 = 0 is satisfied when y = 2
6
 - 4, but it is not easy to find this 
solution. In more complicated cases, it will be impossible to find a formula for y in terms of x. 
(c) The equation x2 + y2 = 1 implicitly determines two functions of x, 
y = , / ' D  
and 
y = - , / ' D -  
The question of how many functions an equation determines and of the properties of these func- 
tions is too complex to be considered here. We shall content ourselves with learning a method for 
finding the derivatives of functions determined implicitly by equations. 
EXAMPLE Let us find the derivative of a function y determined by the equation x2 + y2 = 4. Since y is assumed 
to be some function of x, the two sides of the equation represent the same function of x, and so must have the same 
derivative, 
D,(x2 + y') = D,(4) 
2x + 2yD,y = 0 
[by the power chain rule] 
2yD,y = -2x 
2x 
x 
D,y = - - - - -  
- 
2Y 
Y 
Thus, D,y has been found in terms of x and y. Sometimes this is all the information we may need. For example, if 
we want to know the slope of the tangent line to the graph of x2 + y 2  = 4 at the point (fi, 
l), then this slope is the 
derivative 
D,y = - - x f i  
= --=-fi 
Y 
1 
The process by which D, y has been found, without first solving explicitly for y, is called implicit diflerentiation. 
Note that the given equation could, in this case, have been solved explicitly for y, 
and from this, using the power chain rule, 
D, y = DJk(4 - x2)1/2) = f

The Mean-Value Theorem and 
the Sign of the Derivative 
17.1 ROLLE’S THEOREM AND THE MEAN-VALUE THEOREM 
Let us consider a function f that is continuous over a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable at 
every point of the open interval (a, b). We also suppose thatf(a) = f (b) = 0. Graphs of some examples of 
such a function are shown in Fig. 17-1. It seems clear that there must always be some point between 
x = a and x = b at which the tangent line is horizontal and, therefore, at which the derivative offis 0.

Theorem 17.1 (Rolle’s Theorem): Iffis continuous over a closed interval [a, b], differentiable on the 
open interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f (b) = 0, then there is at least one number c in (a, b) 
such thatf’(c) = 0. 
See Problem 17.6 for the proof. 
Rolle’s theorem enables us to prove the following basic theorem (which is also referred to as the law 
of the mean for derivatives).

tiable on the open interval (a, b). Then there is a number c in the open interval (a, b) such

For a proof, see Problem 17.7. 
EXAMPLE In graphic terms, the mean-value theorem states that at some point along an arc of a curve, the 
tangent line is parallel to the line connecting the initial and the terminal points of the arc. This can be seen 
in Fig. 17-2, where there are three numbers (c1, c2, and cj) between a and b for which the slope of the 
tangent line to the graph f ’(c) is equal to the slope of the line AB, f (b) - f (4

Similarly,fis decreasing on a set at if, for any U and t, in d, U < t, impliesf(u) >f(t,). 
A function f is said to be increasing on a set d if, for any U and U in d, U < U implies f(u) <f(o). 
Of course, on a given set, a function is not necessarily either increasing or decreasing (see Fig. 17-3).

Theorem 17.3: Iff’(x) > 0 for all x in the open interval (a, b), thenfis increasing on (a, b). Iff’(x) < 0 
for all x in (a, b), thenfis decreasing on (a, b). 
For the proof, see Problem 17.8. The converse of Theorem 17.3 does not hold. In fact, the function 
f ( x )  = x3 is differentiable and increasing on (- 1, 1)-and 
everywhere else-but 
f’(x) = 3x2 is zero for 
x = 0 [see Fig. 7-3(b)]. 
Theorem 17.4 (Intermediate-Value Theorem): Let f be a continuous function over a closed interval 
[a, 61, with f(a) # f(6). Then any number between f(a) and f(b) is assumed as the value 
offfor some argument between a and 6. 
While Theorem 17.4 is not elementary, its content is intuitively obvious. The function could not 
“skip” an intermediate value unless there were a break in the graph; that is, unless the function were 
discontinuous. As illustrated in Fig. 17-4, a functionfsatisfying Theorem 17.4 may also take on values 
that are not betweenf(a) andf(b). In Problem 17.9, we prove: 
The following important property of continuous functions will often be useful.

Determine when the function f ( x )  = x3 - 6x2 + 9x + 2 is increasing and when it is decreasing, 
and sketch its graph. 
We havef’(x) = 3x2 - 12x + 9 = 3(x2 - 4x + 3) = 3(x - 1Xx - 3). The crucial points are 1 and 3 [see 
Fig. 17-5(a)]. 
(i) When x < 1, both (x - 1) and (x - 3) are negative and sof’(x) > 0 in (- 00, 1). 
(ii) When x moves from (-CO, 1) into (1, 3), the factor (x - 1) changes from negative to positive, but 
(x - 3) remains negative. Hence,f’(x) < 0 in (1, 3). 
(iii) When x moves from (1, 3) into (3, CO), (x - 3) changes from negative to positive, but (x - 1) remains 
positive. Hence,f’(x) > 0 in (3, CO). 
Thus, by Theorem 17.3, f is increasing for x < 1, decreasing for 1 < x < 3, and increasing for x > 3. 
Note that f(1) = 6, f(3) = 2, 
lim f ( x )  = +CO, and lim f(x) = -CO.

Assume that f ‘ ( x )  > 0 for all x in (a, b) and that a < U < U < b. We must show that f(u) <f(u). By the 
mean-value theorem, applied tofon the closed interval [U, U], there is some number c in (U, U) such that 
Butf’(c) > 0 and U - U > 0; hence,f(u) -f(u) > O,f(u) <f(u). 
The casef’(x) < 0 is handled similarly.

and its range is the single point k. Iff(c) #f(d), then the intermediate-value theorem, applied to the closed 
subinterval bounded by d and c, ensures that f assumes every value between f(c) and f(d). The range off is 
then the closed interval [f(c),f(d)] (which includes the values assumed on that part of [a, b] that lies 
outside the subinterval).

Rectilinear Motion and Instantaneous Velocity 
Rectilinear motion is motion along a straight line. Consider, for instance, an automobile moving 
along a straight road. We can imagine a coordinate system imposed on the line containing the road (see 
Fig. 18-1). (On many highways there actually is such a coordinate system, with markers along the side 
of the road indicating the distance from one end of the highway.) Ifs designates the coordinate of the 
automobile and t denotes the time, then the motion of the automobile is specified by expressing s, its 
position, as a function oft: s =f(t).

The speedometer indicates how fast the automobile is moving. Since the speedometer reading often 
varies continuously, it is obvious that the speedometer indicates how fast the car is moving at the 
moment when it is read. Let us analyze this notion in order to find the mathematical concept that lies 
behind it. 
If the automobile moves according to the equation s = f ( t ) ,  its position at time t isf(t), and at time 
t + h, very close to time t, its position isf(t + h). The distance’ between its position at time t and its 
position at time t + h isf(t + h) - f ( t )  (which can be negative). The time elapsed between t and t + h is 
h. Hence, the average velocity2 during this time interval is 
f ( t  + h) -m 
h 
(Average velocity = displacement - time.) Now as the elapsed time h gets closer to 0, the average veloc- 
ity approaches what we intuitively think of as the instantaneous velocity U at time t. Thus, 
v = lim f ( t  + h) -f(O 
h 
h-0 
In other words, the instantaneous velocity v is the derivative f’(t). 
EXAMPLES 
(a) The height s of a water column is observed to follow the law s =f(t) = 3t + 2. Thus, the instantaneous veloc- 
ity U of the top surface isf’(t) = 3. 
(6) The position s of an automobile along a highway is given by s =f(t) = t2 - 2t. Hence, its instantaneous 
velocity is U =f‘(t) = 2t - 2. At time t = 3, its velocity U is 2(3) - 2 = 4. 
The sign of the instantaneous velocity v indicates the direction in which the object is moving. If 
U = ds/dt > 0 over a time interval, Theorem 17.3 tells us that s is increasing in that interval. Thus, if the 
s-axis is horizontal and directed to the right, as in Fig. 18-2(a), then the object is moving to the right; 
but if the s-axis is vertical and directed upward, as in Fig. 18-2(b), then the object is moving upward. On 
More precisely, the displacement, since it can be positive, negative, or zero. 
’ We use the term velocity rather than speed because the quantity referred to can be negative. Speed is defined as the magnitude of 
the velocity and is never negative.

the other hand, if U = ds/dt -c 0 over a time interval, then s must be

VELOCITY 
decreasing in that interval. In 
Fig. 18-2(a), the object would be moving to the left (in the direction of decreasing s); in Fig. 18-2(b), the 
object would be moving downward. 
A consequence of these facts is that at an instant t when a continuously mooing object reverses 
direction, its instantaneous oelocity o must be 0. For if U were, say, positive at t, it would be positive in a 
small interval of time surrounding t ;  the object would therefore be moving in the same direction just 
before and just after t. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly different way, a reversal in direction means 
a relative extremum of s, which in turn implies (Theorem 14.1) ds/dt = 0. 
\ 
EXAMPLE An object moves along a straight line as indicated in Fig. 18-3(a). In functional form, 
s = f ( t )  = (t + 2)2 [s in meters, t in seconds] 
as graphed in Fig. 18-3(b). The object’s instantaneous velocity is 
t, =f’(t) = 2(t + 2) [meters per second] 
For t + 2 < 0, or t < -2, o is negative and the object is moving to the left; for t + 2 > 0, or t > -2, 
t, is positive 
and the object is moving to the right. The object reverses direction at t = -2, and at that instant U = 0. [Note that 
f ( t )  has a relative minimum at t = -2.1

Fig. 18-3 
Consider an object that has been thrown straight up or down, or has been dropped from rest, and 
which is acted upon solely by the gravitational pull of the earth. The ensuing rectilinear motion is called 
jiee fall. 
Let us put a coordinate system on the vertical line along which the object moves, such that the 
s-axis is directed upward, away from the earth, with s = 0 located at the surface of the earth (Fig. 18-4).

Then the equation of free fall is 
s 
SO + VO t - 16t2 
(18.1) 
where s is measured in feet and t in seconds? Here so and tro are, respectively, the position (height) and 
the velocity of the object at time t = 0. The instantaneous velocity U is obtained by differentiating (18.1), 
( I  8.2) 
EXAMPLES 
At t = 0, a rock is dropped from rest from the top of a building 256 feet high. When, and with what velocity, 
does it strike the ground? 
With so = 256 and uo = 0, (18.1) becomes s = 256 - 16t2 and the time of striking the ground is given by 
the solution of 
0 = 256 - 16t2 
16t2 = 256 
t2 = 16 
t = +,4 seconds 
Since we are assuming that the motion takes place when t 2 0, the only solution is t = 4 seconds. 
The velocity equation (18.2) is U = -32t, and so, for t = 4, 
U = - 32(4) = - 128 feet per second

A rocket is shot vertically from the ground with an initial velocity of 96 feet per second. When does the rocket 
reach its maximum height, and what is its maximum height? 
With so = 0 and uo = 96, (18.1) and (28.2) become 
d S  
dt 
s = 96t - 16t2 
and 
U = - = 96 - 32t 
If the position is measured in meters, the equation reads s = so + uo t - 4.9t2. 

CHAP. 18) 
RECTILINEAR MOTION AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY 
139 
At a maximum value, qr turning point, U = 0. Hence, 
0 = 96 - 32t 
32t = 96 
t = 3  
Thus, it takes 3 seconds for the rocket to reach its maximum height, which is 
s = 96(3) - 16(3)2 = 288 - 16(9) = 288 - 144 = 144 feet 
(c) When does the rocket of part (b) hit the ground? 
It suffices to set s = 0 in the free-fall equation (18J), 
0 = 96t - 16t2 
0 = 6t - t2 
[divide by 163 
0 = t(6 - t) 
from which t = 0 or t = 6. Hence, the rocket hits the ground again after 6 seconds. 
Notice that the rocket rose for 3 seconds to its maximum height, and then took 3 more seconds to fall 
back to the ground. In general, the upward flight from point P to point Q will take exactly the same time as 
the downward flight from Q to P. In addition, the rocket will return to a given height with the same speed 
(magnitude of the velocity) that it had upon leaving that height. 
Solved Problems 
18.1 
A stone is thrown straight down from the top of an 80-foot tower. If the initial speed is 64 feet 
per second, how long does it take to hit the ground, and with what speed does it hit the ground? 
Here so = 80 and uo = -64. (The speed is the magnitude of the velocity. The minus sign for uo indi- 
cates that the object is moving downward.) Hence, 
ds 
dt 
s = 80 - 64t - 16t2 
and 
U = - = -64 - 322 
The stone hits the ground when s = 0, 
0 = 80 - 64t - 16t2 
0 = t2 + 4t - 5 
t + 5 =  
0 or t - 1 = 0  
t = - 5  
or 
t = l  
[divide by -161 
0 = (t + 5Xt - 1) 
Since the time of fall must be positive, t = 1 second. The velocity U when the stone hits the ground is 
o(1) = -64 - 32(1) = -64 - 32 = -96 feet per second

When t = 2, s = 256, 
256 = 00(2) - 16(2)2 
256 = 200 - 64 
320 = 20, 
160 = 00 
The initial velocity was 160 feet per second, so that 
s = 160t - 16t2 
and

To find the time when the maximum height is reached, set D = 0,

To find the maximum height, substitute t = 5 in the formula for s,

A car is moving along a straight road according to the equation 
= f ( t )  = 2t3 - 3 t 2  - 12t 
Describe its motion by indicating when and where the car is moving to the right, and when and 
where it is moving to the left. When is the car at rest? 
We have U =f'(t) = 6t2 - 6t - 12 = 6(t2 - t - 2) = 6(t - 2)(t + 1). The key points are t = 2 and 
t = - 1 (see Fig. 18-5).

t 
Fig. 18-5 
(i) When t > 2, both t - 2 and t + 1 are positive. So, U > 0 and the car is moving to the right. 
(ii) As t moves from (2, CO) through t = 2 into (-1, 2), the sign of t - 2 changes, but the sign of t + 1 
remains the same. Hence, U changes from positive to negative. Thus, for - 1 < t < 2, the car is moving 
to the left. 
(iii) As t moves through t = - 1 from (- 1, 2) into (- a, - l), the sign of t + 1 changes but the sign of 
t - 2 remains the same. Hence, U changes from negative to positive. So, the car is moving to the right 
when t < - 1. 
When t = -1, 
s = 2(- 1)3 - 3(- 1)2 - 12(- 1) = -2 - 3 + 12 = 7 
When t = 2 
s = 2(2)3 - 3(2)2 - 12(2) = 16 - 12 - 24 = -20 
Thus, the car moves to the right until, at t = - 1, it reaches s = 7, where it reverses direction and moves left 
until, at t = 2, it reaches s = -20, where it reverses direction again and keeps moving to the right thereafter 
(see Fig. 18-6).

The car is never at rest. It makes sense to talk about the car being at rest only when the position of the 
car is constant over an interval of time (not at just a single point). In such a case, the velocity would be zero

Chapter 19 
Instantaneous Rate of Change 
One quantity, y, may be related to another quantity, x, by a functionf: 
y =f(x). A change in the 
value of x usually induces a corresponding change in the value of y. 
EXAMPLE Let x be the length of the side of a cube, and let y be the volume of the cube. Then y = x3. In the case 
where the side has length x = 2 units, consider a small change Ax in the length. 
NOTATION Ax (read “delta-ex”) is the traditional symbol in calculus for a small change in x. Ax is considered a 
single symbol, not a product of A and x. In earlier chapters, the role of Ax often was taken by the symbol h. 
The new volume will be (2 + Ax)~, 
and so the change in the value of the volume y is (2 + A x ) ~  - Z3. This change in 
y is denoted traditionally by Ay, 
Ay = (2 + A x ) ~  - 23 
Now the natural way to compare the change Ay in y to the change Ax in x is to calculate the ratio Ay/Ax. This 
ratio depends of course on Ax, but if we let Ax approach 0, then the limit of Ay/Ax will define the instantaneous rate 
of change of y compared to x, when x = 2. We have (ALGEBRA, Problem 11.2) 
Ay = (2 + A x ) ~  - 23 = [(2)3 + 3(2)2(A~)1 + 3(2)’(A~)~ 
+ (Ax)~] - 23 
= 1 2 6 ~  
+ ~ ( A x ) ~  
+ (Ax)~ = (AxX12 + 6Ax + (Ax)~) 
Hence, 
-- 
Ay - 12 + 6Ax + (Ax)’ 
Ax 
and 
AY 
lim - 
= lim (12 + 6Ax + (AX)~) = 12 
Ax-0 Ax 
Ax+O 
Therefore, when the side is 2, the rate of change of the volume with respect to the side is 12. This means that, for 
sides close to 2, the change Ay in the volume is approximately 12 times the change Ax in the side (since Ay/Ax is 
close to 12). Let us look at a few numerical cases. 
If Ax = 0.1, then the new side x + Ax is 2.1, and the new volume is (2.1)3 = 9.261. So, Ay = 9.261 - 8 = 1.261, 
and 
Ay 1.261 
Ax 
0.1 
-- - - 
= 12.61 
If Ax = 0.01, then the new side x + Ax is 2.01, and the new volume is (2.01)3 = 8.120601. So, 
Ay = 8.120601 - 8 = 0.120601, and

(b) In economics, the rate of change of profit with respect to the production level is called the marginal 
pro& According to (29.2), the marginal profit is an approximate measure of how much the profit will 
change when the production level is increased by one unit. In the present case, we have 
P(1000) = 75(1OOO) - 0.03(1000)2 - 15000 
= 75000 - 30000 - 15000 = 30000 
P(1001) = 75(1001) - 0.03(1001)2 - 15000 
= 75075 - 30060.03 - 15000

Most quantities encountered in science or in everyday life vary with time. If two such quantities are 
related by an equation, and if we know the rate at which one of them changes, then, by differentiating 
the equation with respect to time, we can find the rate at which the other quantity changes.

the top of the ladder from the base of the wall. Since the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the base

Approximation by Differentials; Newton's Method 
In Chapter 19, we obtained an approximate relation between the change 
Ay =f(x + Ax) -f(x) 
in a differentiable functionfand the change Ax in the argument off. For convenience, we repeat (19.1) 
here and name it the approximation principle, 
Ay e f ' ( x )  Ax 
(21.1) 
21.1 ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF A FUNCTION 
Many practical problems involve finding a value f(c) of some function f: A direct calculation of f(c) 
may be difficult or, quite often, impossible. However, let us assume that an argument x close to c, the 
closer the better, can be found such that f ( x )  and f'(x) can be computed exactly. If we set Ax = c - x, 
then c = x + Ax and the approximation principle (21.1) yields 
(21.2) 
EXAMPLE Let us estimate m. Here f is the square root function and c = 9.2. If we choose x = 9, then 
Ax = 9.2 - 9 = 0.2. Bothf(x) andf'(x) can be computed easily, 
f(x) = fi = 3 
and (21.2) yields 
1 
,/% =f(9.2) x 3 + 6 (0.2) = 3 + 0.0333 . . . = 3.0333 . . . 
The actual value of m, 
correct to four decimal places, is 3.0331. 
21.2 THE DIFFERENTIAL 
The product on the right side of (21 .l) is called the dzflerential off and is denoted by df: 
Definition: Let f be a differentiable function. Then, for a given argument x and increment Ax, the 
diflerential dfoffis defined by 
df=f'(~) AX 
Notice that dfdepends on two quantities, x and Ax. Although Ax is usually taken to be small, this 
is not explicitly required in the definition. However, if Ax is small, then the content of the approx- 
imation principle is that 
f(x + Ax) -f(x) x df

In particular, iff(x) = x, we shall write

Assuming that dx = Ax # 0, we may divide both sides by dx, obtaining the result

and let us also assume that we know that xo is close to a solution. If we draw the tangent line 3 to the 
graph off at the point with abscissa xo, then F will usually intersect the x-axis at a point whose 
abscissa x1 is closer to the solution of (21.4) than xo (see Fig. 21-2). 
A point-slope equation of the tangent line F is 
If F intersects the x-axis at the point (xl, 0), then 
0 - f (xo) = f ’(xoXxi - xo) 
Iff l x o )  z 0, 
If we repeat the same procedure, but now starting with x1 instead of xo, we obtain a value x2 that 
should be still closer to the solution of ( 2 1 4 ,  
If we keep applying this procedure, the resulting sequence of numbers xo, xl, x2, . . . , x,, . . . is deter- 
mined by the formula 
(21.5) 
This process for finding better and better approximations to a solution of the equation f ( x )  = 0 is 
known as Newton’s method. It is not always guaranteed that the numbers generated by Newton’s 
method will approach a solution off(x) = 0. Some difficulties that may arise will be discussed in the 
problems below. 
EXAMPLE If we wish to approximate ,/?, we should try to find an approximate solution of x2 - 2 = 0. Here 
f ( x )  = x2 - 2. Thenf’(x) = 2x, and (22.5) becomes 
(22.6) 
If we take the first approximation xo to be 1 (since we know that ,/? is between 1 and 2), then we obtain by 
successively substituting n = 0, 1, 2, . . . in (21.6),’ 
The computations required by Newton’s method are usually too tedious to be done by hand. A calculator, preferably a pro- 
grammable calculator, should be used.

213 Measurement of the side of a square room yields the result of 18.5 feet. Hence, the area is 
A = (18.5)2 = 342.25 square feet. If the measuring device has a possible error of at most 0.05 foot, 
estimate the maximum possible error in the area.

The formula for the area is A = x2, where x is the side of the room. Hence, dA/dx = 2x. Let x = 18.5, 
and let 18.5 + Ax be the true length of the side of the room. By assumption, I Axl I 0.05. The approx-

Hence, the error in the area should be at most 1.85 square feet, putting the actual area in the range of 
(342.25 +_ 1.85) square feet. See Problem 21.13.

Use Newton’s method to find the positive solutions of 
x 4 + x - 3 = 0  
Let f(x) = x4 + x - 3. Then f’(x) = 4x3 + 1. Since f(1) = - 1 and f(2) = 15, the intermediate-value 
theorem tells us that there is a solution between 1 and 2. [The interval (1, 2) is suggested by drawing the 
graph off with a graphing calculator.] Since f’(x) > 0 for x 2 0, f is increasing for x > 0, and, therefore, 
there is exactly one positive real solution. Start with xo = 1. Equation (22.5) becomes 
x: + x, - 3

x5 = 1.164035 141. Thus, the approximate solution is x = 1.164035 141.

Show that if Newton’s method is applied to the equation x113 = 0 with xo = 1, the result is a

Hence, x1 = -2, x2 = 4, x3 = -8, and, in general, x, = (-2)”. 
Note: If we are seeking a solution r of an equation f(x) = 0, then it can be shown that a sufficient 
condition that Newton’s method yields a sequence of values tht converges to r is that 
for all x in an interval around r that includes xo . However, this is not a necessary condition.

Acceleration 
Let an object move along a coordinate axis according to the equation s =f(t), where s is the 
coordinate of the object and t is the time. From Chapter 18, the object’s velocity is given by 
ds

U = - - -  -f ‘@) 
The rate at which the velocity changes is called the acceleration a.

Definition: a = - 
dt = -

EXAMPLES 
(a) For an object in free fall, s = so + oo t - 16t2, where s, measured in feet, is positive in the upward direction and 
t is measured in seconds. Recall that so and oo denote the initial position and velocity; that is, the values of s 
and o when t = 0. Hence, 
ds 
dt 
U = - -  - UO - 32t 
do 
dt 
a = - =  - 32 
Thus, the velocity decreases by 32 feet per second every second. This is sometimes expressed by saying that the 
(downward) acceleration due to gravity is 32 feet per second per second, which is abbreviated as 32 ft/sec2. 
(b) An object moves along a straight line according to the equation s = 2t3 - 3t2 + t - 1. Then, 
do 
dt 
a = - = l 2 t - 6  
In this case, the acceleration is not constant. Notice that a > 0 when 12t - 6 > 0, or t > 4. This implies (by 
Theorem 17.3) that the velocity is increasing for t > 4.

measured in feet and t in seconds. (a) What is the acceleration due to “gravity” on the moon? (b) If an 
object is thrown upward from the surface of the moon with an initial velocity of 54 feet per second, what is 
the maximum height it will reach, and when will it reach that height?

23.1 CONCAVITY 
If a curve has the shape of a cup or part of a cup (like the curves in Fig. 23-l), then we say that it is 
concuue upward. (To remember the sense of “concave upward,” notice that the letters c and up form the 
word cup.) A mathematical description of this notion can be given. A curve is concave upward if the 
curve lies above the tangent line at any given point of the curve. Thus, in Fig. 23-l(a) the curve lies 
above all three tangent lines.

Fig. 23-1 Concavity *ward 
A curve is said to be concave downward if it has the shape of a cap or part of a cap (see Fig. 23-2). In 
mathematical terms, a curve is concave downward if it lies below the tangent line at an arbitrary point 
of the curve [see Fig. 23-2(a)].

Fig. 23-2 Concavity downward 
A curve may, of course, be composed of parts of different concavity. The curve in Fig. 23-3 is 
concave downward from A to B, concave upward from B to C, concave downward from C to D, and 
concave upward from D to E. A point on the curve at which the concavity changes is called an inflection 
point. B, C, and D are inflection points in Fig. 23-3.

[CHAP. 23 
Fig. 23-3 
From Fig. 23-1 we see that if we move from left to right along a curve that is concave upward, the 
slope of the tangent line increases. The slope either becomes less negative or more positive. Conversely, 
if the tangent line has this property, the curve must be concave upward. Now for a curve y =f(x), the 
tangent line will certainly have this property iff”(x) > 0 since, in that case, Theorem 17.3 implies that 
the slopef’(x) of the tangent line will be an increasing function. By a similar argument, we see that if 
f”(x) < 0, the slope of the tangent line is decreasing, and from Fig. 23-2 we see that the curve y = f ( x )  is 
concave downward. This yields: 
Theorem 23.l: 
Iff”(x) > 0 for all x in (a, b), then the graph off is concave upward between x = a and 
x = b. Iff”(x) < 0 for all x in (a, b), then the graph offis concave downward between 
x = a and x = b. 
For a rigorous proof of Theorem 23.1, see Problem 23.17. 
Corollary 23.2: If the graph off has an inflection point at x = c, and f” exists and is continuous at 
x = c, then$”@) = 0. 
In fact, if f”(c) # 0, the f”(c) > 0 or f”(c) < 0. If f”(c) > 0, then f”(x) > 0 for all x in some open 
interval containing c, and the graph would be concave upward in that interval, contradicting the 
assumption that there is an inflection point at x = c. We get a similar contradiction iff”(c) < 0, for in 
that case, the graph would be concave downward in an open interval containing c. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Consider the graph of y = x3 [see Fig. 23-4(a)]. Here y’ = 3x2 and y” = 6x. Since y” > 0 when x > 0, and 
y” < 0 when x < 0, the curve is concave upward when x > 0, and concave downward when x < 0. There is an 
inflection point at the origin, where the concavity changes. This is the only possible inflection point, for if 
y” = 6x = 0, then x must be 0. 
(b) Iff”(c) = 0, the graph offneed not have an inflection point at x = c. For instance, the graph off($ = x4 [see 
Fig. 23-4(b)] has a relative minimum, not an inflection point, at x = 0, wheref”(x) = 12x2 = 0.

23.2 TEST FOR RELATIVE EXTREMA 
We already know, from Chapter 14, that the conditionf'(c) = 0 is necessary, but not sufficient, for a 
differentiable function f to have a relative maximum or minimum at x = c. We need some additional 
information that will tell us whether a function actually has a relative extremum at a point where its 
derivative is zero. 
Theorem 23.3 (Second-Derivative Test for Relative Extrema): If f'(c) = 0 and f"(c) < 0, then f has a 
relative maximum at c. Iff'(c) = 0 andf"(c) > 0, thenfhas a relative minimum at c. 
Proof: 
Iff'(c) = 0, the tangent line to the graph off is horizontal at x = c. If, in addition,f"(c) -c 0, 
then, by Theorem 23.1,' the graph off is concave downward near x = c. Hence, near x = c, the graph 
off must lie below the horizontal line through (c, f(c));f thus has a relative maximum at x = c [see 
Fig. 23-5(a)]. A similar argument leads to a relative minimum whenf"(c) > 0 [see Fig. 23-5(b)].

EXAMPLE Consider the functionf(x) = 2x3 + x2 - 4x + 2. Then, 
f'(x) =r 6x2 + 2x - 4 = 2(3x2 + x - 2) = 2(3x - 2Xx + 1) 
Hence, iff'(x) = 0, then 3x - 2 = 0 or x + 1 = 0; that is, x = 3 or x = - 1. Nowf"(x) = 12x + 2. Hence, 
f"(-1) = 12(-1) + 2 = -12 + 2 = -10 < 0 
f''(4) = 12(3) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 > 0 
Fig. 23-6 
In order to use Theorem 23.1, we must assume that f" is continuous at c and exists in an open interval around c. However, a 
more complicated argument can avoid that assumption.

( 3 [ (-81 
f"(x) > 0 when x > -4, andf"(x) < 0 when x < -4. Hence, the curve is concave upward for x > -4 and concave 
downward for x < -&. So there must be an inflection point I ,  where x = -&. 
From Problem 9.1 we know that

lirn f ( x )  = lirn 2x3 = -a

Thus, the curve moves upward without bound toward the right, and downward without bound toward the left. 
The second-derivative test tells us nothing whenf'(c) = 0 andf"(c) = 0. This is shown by the exam- 
ples in Fig. 23-7, where, in each case,f'(O) =f"(O) = 0. 
To distinguish among the four cases shown in Fig. 23-7, consider the sign of the derivativef' just to 
the left and just to the right of the critical point. Recalling that the sign of the derivative is the sign of 
the slope of the tangent line, we have the four combinations shown in Fig. 23-8. These lead directly to 
Theorem 23-4.

Sketch the graph off(x) = 4x4 - x3 + 4x + 2. 
The first derivative isf’(x) = x3 - 3x2 + 4. We can determine that - 1 is a root of x3 - 3x2 + 4. 
ALGEBRA When looking for roots of a polynomial, first test the integral factors of the constant. In this 
case, the factors of 4 are f 1, f 2, +4. 
So (Theorem 7.2),f’(x) is divisible by x + 1. The division yields 
X’ - 3x2 + 4 = (X + l)(x2 - 4~ + 4) = (X + 1Xx - 2)2 
Hence, the critical numbers are x = - 1 and x = 2. Now 
f”(x) = 3x2 - 6~ = ~ X ( X  - 2) 
Thus, f”( - 1) = 3( - 1X- 1 - 2) = 9. Hence, by the second-derivative test, f has a relative minimum at 
x =  -1. 
Sincef”(2) = 3(2)(2 - 2) = 0, we do the first-derivative test at x = 2. 
f‘(x) = (X + 1Xx - 2)2 
On both sides of x = 2, f’(x) > 0, since x + 1 > 0 and (x - 2)’ > 0. This is the case { +, + }. There is an 
inflection point at (2,6). Furthermore,f”(x) changes sign at x = 0, so that there is also an inflection point at 
(0,2). Because

More Maximum and Minimum Problems 
Until now we have been able to find the absolute maxima and minima of differentiable functions 
only on closed intervals (see Section 14.2). The following result often enables us to handle cases where 
the function is defined on a half-open interval, open interval, infinite interval, or the set of all real 
numbers. Remember that, in general, there is no guarantee that a function has an absolute maximum or 
an absolute minimum on such domains. 
Theorem 24.1: 
Let f be a continuous function on an interval 9, 
with a single relative extremum within 
9. 
Then this relative extremum is also an absolute extremum on 9. 
Intuitive Argument: Refer to Fig. 24-1. Suppose that f has a relative maximum at c and no other 
relative extremum inside 3. Take any other number d in 9. 
The curve moves down- 
ward on both sides of c. Hence, if the valuef(d) were greater thanf(c), then, at some 
point U between c and d, the curve would have to change direction and start moving 
upward. But then f would have a relative minimum at U, contradicting our assumption. 
The result for a relative minimum follows by applying to -f the result just obtained 
for a relative maximum. 
For a rigorous proof, see Problem 24.20.

U = J -

=Jx2-2X+l+x=J- 
But minimizing U is equivalent to minimizing u2 = F(x) = x2 - x + 1 on the interval CO, + co) (the value of x 
is restricted by the fact that x = y2 2 0). 
F(x) = 2x - 1 
F”(x) = 2 
or 
x = 3 
The only critical number is the solution of 
F(x) = 2x - 1 = 0 
Now F”(3) = 2 > 0. So by the second-derivative test, the function F has a relative minimum at x = 3. Theorem

(b) An open box (that is, a box without a top) is to be constructed with a square base [see Fig. 24-2(b)] and is 
required to have a volume of 48 cubic inches. The bottom of the box costs 3 cents per square inch, whereas the 
sides cost 2 cents per square inch. Find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the box. 
Let x be the side of the square bottom, and let h be the height. Then the cost of the bottom is 3x2 and the 
cost of each of the four sides is 2xh, giving a total cost of 
C = 3x2 + 4(2xh) = 3x2 + 8xh

Angle Measure 
25.1 ARC LENGTH AND RADIAN MEASURE 
Figure 25-l(a) illustrates the traditional system of angle measure. A complete rotation is divided 
into 360 equal parts, and the measure assigned to each part is called a degree. In modern mathematics 
and science, it is useful to define a different unit of angle measure. 
Definition: Consider a circle with a radius of one unit [see Fig. 25-l(b)]. Let the center be C, and let 
CA and CB be two radii for which the intercepted arc A% of the circle has length 1. Then 
the central angle ACB is taken to be the unit of measure, one radian. 
Let X be the number of degrees in 3;ACB of radian measure 1. Then the ratio of X to 360" (a 
complete rotation) is the same as the ratio of A% to the entire circumference, 211. Since A% = 1,

Consider now a circle of radius r with center 0 (see Fig. 25-2). Let <DOE contain 8 radians and let

as the ratio of s to the entire circumference 2713, 8/2n = s/2nr. Hence, 
s = r8

25.2 DIRECTED ANGLES 
Angles can be classified as positive or negative, according to the direction of the rotation that 
generates them. In Fig. 25-3(a), we shall agree that the directed angle AOB is taken to be positive when 
it is obtained by rotating the arrow OA counterclockwise toward arrow OB. On the other hand, the 
directed angle AOB in Fig. 25-3(b) is taken to be negative if it is obtained by rotating arrow OA 
clockwise toward arrow OB. Some examples of directed angles and their radian measures are shown in 
Fig. 25-4.

The fundamental trigonometric functions, the sine and the cosine, will play an important role in 
calculus. These functions will now be defined for all real numbers. 
Definition: Place an arrow 03 of unit length so that its initial point 0 is the origin of a coordinate 
system and its endpoint A is the point (1, 0) of the x-axis (see Fig. 26-1). For any given 
number 8, rotate 
about the point 0 through an angle with radian measure 8. Let 0 
be the final position of the arrow after the rotation. Then: (i) the x-coordinate of B is 
defined to be the cosine of 8, denoted by cos 8; (ii) the y-coordinate of B is defined to be 
the sine of 8, denoted by sin 8. Thus, B = (cos 8, sin 8).

PROPERTIES 
We list the following theorems, which give the most important properties of the sine and cosine 
functions. 
Theorem 26.1: sin’ 8 + cos’ 8 = 1. 
Proof: 
In Fig. 26-1, the length of 03 is given by (2.1), 
1 = ,/(COS 
e - 0)’ + (sin e - o ) ~  
= ,/(COS el2 + (sin 8)’ 
Squaring both sides, and using the conventional notations (sin 8)’ E sin2 8 and (cos 8)’ = cos2 8 gives 
Theorem 26.1. 
Corollary: 
1 - sin2 8 = cos2 8 and 1 - cos2 8 = sin’ 8. 
EXAMPLE Let 8 be the radian measure of an acute angle such that sin 8 = 3. By Theorem 26.1, 
9 
16 
cos28= 1 --=- 
25

Since 8 is an acute angle, cos 8 is positive; cos 8 = 4. 
We have already seen (Chapter 25) that two angles that differ by a multiple of 211 radians (360”) 
have the same sides. This establishes:

Theorem 26.2: 
The cosine and sine functions are periodic, of period 211; that is, for all 8, 
cos (e + 2 4  = cos e 
sin (8 + 2n) = sin 8 
(Moreover, 211 is the smallest positive number with this property.) 
In view of Theorem 26.2, it is sufficient to know the values of cos 8 and sin 8 for 0 I 8 < 2n.

Theorem 26.3; 
cos 8 is an even function, and sin 8 is an odd function. 
The proof is obvious from Fig. 26-5. Points B' and B have the same x-coordinates, 
but their y-coordinates differ in sign, 
sin (- 8) = -sin 8 
Because of Theorem 26.3, we now need to know the values of cos 8 and sin 8 only for 0 5 8 5 n. 
Consider any point A(x, y) different from the origin 0, 
as in Fig. 26-6. Let r be its distance from the 
origin and let 8 be the radian measure of the angle that line OA makes with the positive x-axis. We call 
r and 8 polar coordinates of point A.

Theorem 26.6 (Sum and Diflerence Formulas):

(6) cos (U - U) = cos U cos U + sin U sin U 
(c) sin (U + U) = sin U cos U + cos U sin U 
(d) sin (U - U) = sin U cos U - cos U sin U 
Once any one of these four formulas has been proved, the other three can be derived as corollaries. 
A proof of the difference formula for the cosine is sketched in Problem 26.14.

Thus we have: 
Theorem 26.7: cos (i - 8) = sin 8 and sin (;,- 8) = cos 8; that is, the sine of an angle is the cosine 
of its complement. 
We also have the useful double-angle formulas : 
Theorem 26.8: cos 28 = cos2 8 - sin2 8 = 2 cos2 8 - 1 = 1 - 2 sin2 8 and sin 28 = 2 sin 8 cos 8. 
For cos 28, note that:

(d) 17" cannot be expressed in terms of more familiar angles (such as 30", 45", 60") in such a way as to

Prove Theorem 26.4. 
Refer to Fig. 26-9. Let D be the foot of the perpendicular from A to the x-axis. Let F be the point on

result of moving the graph of y = cos x to the right by 4 2  units. This can be verified by observing that 
cos (x - ;) 
= sin x 
The graphs of y = cos x and y = sin x have the shape of repeated waves, with each complete wave 
extending over an interval of length 2n (the period). The length and height of the waves can be changed 
by multiplying the argument and the functional value, respectively, by constants. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) y = cos 3x. The graph of this function is sketched in Fig. 27-3. Because 
cos 3 x + - = cos (3x + 2n) = cos 3x 
( 3 
the function is of period p = 2n/3. Hence, the length of each wave is 2n/3. The number of waves over an 
interval of length 2n (corresponding to one complete revolution of the ray determining angle x) is 3. This 
number is called thefrequencyfof cos 3x. In genera), 
pf= (length of each wave) x (number of waves in an interval of length 2n) = 2% 
and so 
2R 
P 
f = -  
For an arbitrary constant b > 0, the function cos bx (or sin bx) has frequency b and period 2n/b. 
Fig. 27-3 
(b) y = 2 sin x. The graph of this function (see Fig. 27-4) is obtained from the graph of y = sin x (see Fig. 27-2) by 
multiplying each ordinate by 2. The period (wavelength) and the frequency of the function 2 sin x are the same 
as those of the function sin x: p = 27c,f= 1. But the amplitude, the maximum height of each wave, of 2 sin x 
is 2, or twice the amplitude of sin x. 
NOTE The total oscillation of a sine or cosine function, which is the vertical distance from crest to trough, is 
twice the amplitude.

Find the absolute extrema of the functionf(x) = 2 sin x - cos 2x on the closed interval [0, lt]. 
For this simple function it is unnecessary to resort to the tabular method of Section 14.2. It suffices to 
observe that the sine and cosine functions have maximum absolute value 1. Thus, if there is an argument x 
in [0, n] such that 
f(x) = 2(+1) - (-1) = 3 
that argument must represent an absolute maximum (on any interval whatever). Clearly, there is one and 
only one such argument, x = n/2. 
On the other hand, since sin x 2 0 on [0, n], the arguments x = 0 and x = n minimize sin x and, at the 
same time, maximize cos 2x. Hence, 
f(0) =f(n) = 2(0) - (+I) = -1 
is the absolute minimum value on [0, n].

Theorem 28.2 (Deriuatiues): D,(tan x) = sec2 x

D,(cot x) = -csc2 x

For the proofs, see Problem 28.1.

D,2(tan x) = D,((sec x)’) = 2(sec x)D,(sec x)

Now in (0, n/2), tan x > 0 (since both sin x and cos x are positive), making D:(tan x) > 0. Thus (Theorem 23.1), the 
graph of y = tan x is concave upward on (0, 42). Knowing this, we can easily sketch the graph on (0, n/2), and 
hence everywhere (see Fig. 28-1).

Differentiating the first identity of Theorem 28.3, 
2(tan x)(sec2 x) = 2(sec x)D,(sec x) 
and dividing through by 2(sec x), which is never zero, gives 
D,(sec x) = tan x sec x 
Similarly, differentiation of the second identity of Theorem 28.3 gives 
D,(csc x) = -cot x csc x

Chapter 29 
Antiderivatives 
29.1 DEFINITION AND NOTATION 
Definition: An antideriuatiue of a functionf is a function whose derivative is$ 
EXAMPLES 
(a) x2 is an antiderivative of 2x, since D,(x2) = 2x. 
(b) x4/4 is an antiderivative of x3, since D,(x4/4) = x3. 
(c) 3x3 - 4x2 + 5 is an antiderivative of 9x2 - 8x, since D,(3x3 - 4x2 + 5 )  = 9x2 - 8x. 
(d) x2 + 3 is an antiderivative of 2x, since D,(x2 + 3) = 2x. 
(e) sin x is an antiderivative of cos x, since D,(sin x) = cos x. 
Examples (a) and (d) show that a function can have more than one antiderivative. This is true for all 
functions. If g(x) is an antiderivative off(x), then g(x) + C is also an antiderivative off(x), where C is 
any constant. The reason is that Dx(C) = 0, whence 
Let us find the relationship between any two antiderivatives of a function. 
Theorem 29.1: 
If F'(x) = 0 for all x in an interval Y, then F(x) is a constant on 9. 
The assumption F'(x) = 0 tells us that the graph of F always has a horizontal tangent. It is then 
obvious that the graph of F must be a horizontal straight line; that is, F(x) is constant. For a rigorous 
proof, see Problem 29.4. 
Corollary 29.2: 
If g'(x) = h'(x) for all x in an interval Y, then there is a constant C such that 
g(x) = h(x) + C for all x in Y. 
Indeed, 
D,(g(x) - h(x)) = g'(x) - h'(x) = 0 
whence, by Theorem 29.1, g(x) - h(x) = C, or g(x) = h(x) + C. 
Thus, if we know one antiderivative of a function, we know them all. 
According to Corollary 29.2, any two antiderivatives of a given function differ only by a constant. 
NOTATION If(.) 
dx stands for any antiderivative ofJ Thus, 
OTHER TERMINOLOGY Sometimes the term indefinite integral is used instead of antiderivative, and the process of 
finding antiderivatives is termed integration. In the expression I f ( x )  d x , f ( x )  is called the integrand. The motive for 
this nomendature will become clear in Chapter 31.

30.2 AREA UNDER A CURVE 
Letfbe a function such thatf(x) 2 0 for all x in the closed interval [a, b]. Then its graph is a curve 
lying on or above the x-axis (see Fig. 30-1). We have an intuitive idea of the area A of the region 9 lying 
under the curve, above the x-axis, and between the vertical lines x = a and x = 6. Let us set up a 
procedure for finding the value of the area A. 
Select points xl, x2,. . . , x,- 
inside [a, 61 (see Fig. 30-2). Let xo = a and x, = 6, 
a = xo < x1 < x2 < * '  < x,-1 < x, = b 
These divide [a, b] into the n subintervals [xo, xl], [xl, x2], ..., [ x ~ - ~ ,  
x,]. Let the lengths of these 
subintervals be Alx, A2 x, . . . , A,, x, where 
Aix E xi - x1-1 
Draw vertical lines x = xi from the x-axis up to the graph, thereby dividing the region 9 into n strips. If 
Ai A is the area of the ith strip, then

A =  C A i A

Approximate the area AiA as follows. Choose any point x,* in the ith subinterval [xi-1, xi] and draw 
the vertical line segment from the point x,* up to the graph (see the dashed lines in Fig. 30-3); the length 
of this segment is f(x,*). The rectangle with base Ai x and height f ( x f )  has area f(x,*) Ai x, which is 
approximately the area AiA of the ith strip. So, the total area A under the curve is approximately the 
sum 
(30.1) 
The approximation becomes better and better as we divide the interval [a, b] into more and more 
subintervals and as we make the lengths of these subintervals smaller and smaller. If successive approx-

EXAMPLE Approximating the definite integral by a small number n of rectangular areas does not usually give 
good numerical results. To see this, consider the functionf(x) = x2 on CO, 13. Then 
x2 dx is the area under the 
parabola y = x2, above the x-axis, between x = 0 and x = 1. Divide CO, 13 into n = 10 equal subintervals by the 
points 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9 (see Fig. 30-4). Thus, each A i x  equals 1/10. In the ith subinterval, choose xi* to be the 
left-hand endpoint (i - l)/lO. Then,

So the above approximation is not too good. In terms of Fig. 30-4, there is too much unfilled space between the 
curve and the tops of the rectangles. 
Now, for an arbitrary (not necessarily nonnegative) functionfon [a, b], a sum of the form (30.1) can 
be defined, without any reference to the graph off or to the notion of area. The precise epsilon-delta 
procedure of Problem 8.4(a) can be used to determine whether this sum approaches a limiting value as n 
approaches co and as the maximum of the lengths Aix approaches 0. If it does, the functionfis said to

Forf(x) 2 0, the theorem is obvious: the area under the graph from a to b must be the s u m  of the areas 
from a to c and from c to b.

That is, the definite integral may be considered a total area, in which areas aboue the x-axis are counted as positioe, 
and areas below the x-axis are counted as negatioe. Thus, we can infer from Fig. 27-2(b) that 
['sin

because the positive area from 0 to ?I is just canceled by the negaive area from n to 2n.

31.1 CALCULATION OF THE DEFINIT~ INTEGRAL 
We shall develop a simple method for calculating 
l f ( x )  dx 
a method based on a profound and surprising connection between differentiation and integration. This 
connection, discovered by Isaac Newton and Gottfried von Leibniz, the co-inventors of calculus, is 
expressed in the following: 
Theorem 31J: Letfbe continuous on [a, b). Then, for x in [a, b], 
is a function of x such that 
A proof may be found in Problem 31.5. 
Now for the computation of the definite integral, let F(x) = f ( x )  dx denote some known anti- 
derivative off(x) (for x in [a, b)). According to Theorem 31.1, the function 
f(t) dt is also an anti- 
derivative off(x). Hence, by Corollary 29.2, 
p ( t )  
dt = F(x) + c 
for some constant C. When x = a, 
Thus, when x = b,

dt = F(b) - F(a) 
and we have proved: 
Theorem 31.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus): Let f be continuous on [a, b), and let 
F(x) = j f ( x )  dx. Then, 
[ f ( x )  dx = F(b) - F(a)

derivative (here, - cos x) for use in the fundamental theorem.

313 CHANGE OF VARIABLE IN A DEFINITE INTEGRAL 
To evaluate a definite integral by the fundamental theorem, an antiderivative j f ( x )  dx is required. 
It was seen in Chapter 29 that the substitution of a new variable U may be useful in finding If(.) 
dx. 
When the substitution is made in the definite integral too, the limits of integration a and b must be 
replaced by the corresponding values of U .

Since x2 + 2x 2 0 for x 2 0, we know that the graph of y = x2 + 2x is on or above the x-axis between 
x = 0 and x = 1. Hence, the area A is given by the definite integral 
[(x2 + 2x) dx 
Evaluating by the fundamental theorem, 
sin x dx. (Compare the example following Theorem 30.4, where U = 0.)

This average value, 3, is the value of & when x = (3)' = 9. Note that 0 < 4f < 4.

Prove the mean-value theorem for integrals (Theorem 31.3). 
Write 
Let m and M be the minimum and maximum values offon [a, b]. (The existence of m and M is guaranteed

35.1 INTRODUCTION 
x is rational. For example, we want to obtain the results 
Let a be any positive real number. We wish to define a function ax that has the usual meaning when

43 = 4 4 4 = 64 
In addition, an expression such as 5J5, which does not yet

Definition: aX is the unique positive real number such that 
In ax = x In a 
8213 = (fi)2 = 22 = 4 
have any meaning, will be assigned a 
(35.2) 
To see that this definition makes sense, observe that the equation In y = x In a must have exactly 
one positive solution y for each real number x. This follows from the fact that In y is an increasing 
function with domain (0, + 00) and range the set of all real numbers. (See the graph of the In function in 
Fig. 34-2.) 
35.2 PROPERTIES OF ax 
It is shown in Problem 35.4 that the function ax possesses all the standard properties of powers: 
(I) ao = I. 
(11) a' = a. 
(111) a"+' = aUaV.

35.3 THE FUNCTION ex 
For a particular choice of the positive real number a, the function ax becomes the inverse of the 
function In x. 
TERMINOLOGY Two functionsfand g are inoerses of each other iffundoes the effect of 9, and g undoes the effect of 
f. In terms of compositions (Section 15.1), this means:

Definition: Let e denote the unique positive real number such that 
l n e = 1  
(35.2) 
Since the range of In x is the set of all real numbers, there must exist such a number e. It can be 
shown that e = 2.718 .... [See Problem 35.3o(c).] 
Tkorem 35.1: The functions e" and In x are inverses of each other: 
In ex = x 
and 
elnx - x  
- 
Indeed, substituting e for U in (354, 
In ex = x In e = x 1 = x 
If we replace x in this result by In x, 
In elnx = In x 
Hence, 
,1nx - 
- x 
[since In u = In U implies u = U by Property 10, Section 34.21 
Theorem 35.1 shows that the natural logarithm In x is what one would call the "logarithm to the 
base e"; that is, In x is the power to which e has to be raised to obtain x: 
, I n x  - 
- x. 
Theorem 35.2: 
ax = e" I n  '. 
Thus, every exponential function a" is definable in terms of the particular exponential function ex, 
which for this reason is often referred to as the exponential function. To see why Theorem 35.2 is true, 
notice that, by Theorem 35.1, 
In ex'"' = x In a 
But y = ux is the unique solution of the equation In y = x In a. Therefore, 
,xlna - 
- ax 
In Problem 35.9 it is shown that ex is differentiable and that: 
Theorem 35.3: Dx(e") = ex. 
Thus, ex has the property of being its own derivative. All constant multiples Ce" share this property, 
since Dx(Cex) = C Dx(ex) = Ce". Problem 35.28 shows that these are the only functions with this 
property. 
From Theorem 35.3, we have 
ex dx = ex + C 
(35.3) 
s 
Knowing the derivative of ex, we obtain from Theorem 35.2 
D,(aX) = DX(ex'"') = e"In' D,(x In a)

In a = ax In a

- ex In a . 
This proves : 
Theorem 35.4:

We know that Dx(Y) = r$-' 
for any rational number T. Now the formula can be extended to 
arbitrary exponents. If, in Theorem 35.2, we replace x by T and U by x (thereby making x positive), we

Dx(e3 = ex > 0, and a function with positive derivative is increasing. More generally, the definition of 
a", together with the fact that In y is increasing, implies that ax is increasing if U > 1. 
We know (Problem 34.8) that In U < U. Hence, x = In ex < ex. 
This is a direct consequence of part (c). 
Let U = -x; then, by Property (V),

Hence, the fraction becomes arbitrarily small.

Sketch the graph of y = ex, and show that it is the reflection in the diagonal line y = x of the 
graph of y = In x. 
From Problem 35.7 we know that ex is positive and increasing, and that it approaches + m  on the 
right and approaches 0 on the left. Moreover, since D;(e? = ex > 0, the graph will be concave upward for 
all x. The graph is shown in Fig. 35-l(a). 
By Theorem 35.1, y = ex is equivalent to x = In y. So, a point (a, b) is on the graph of y = ex if and 
only if (b, a) is on the graph of y = In x. But the points (a, b) and (b, a) are symmetric with respect to the line 
y = x, by Problem 6.4. 
In general, the graphs of any pair of inverse functions are mirror images of each other in the line y = x.

Prove: (a) ex is continuous

ex is differentiable, and &(ex) = ex

I e" - ex I < E. Let E, be the minimum of ~ / 2  
and 8/2. Since In is increasing and continuous, the range of 
In on (ex - E,, ex + E

is an interval (c, d) containing x. Let 6 > 0 be such that (x - 6, x + 6) is 
included within (c, d). Then, for any U, if I U - x I < 6, it follows that I e" - ex I < E, < E.

36.2 EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND DECAY 
Example (d) above shows that ex grows much faster than any power of x. There are many natural 
processes, such as bacterial growth or radioactive decay, in which quantities increase or decrease at an 
"exponential rate." 

286 
L'HOPITAL'S RULE; EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND DECAY 
[CHAP. 36 
Definition: Assume that a quantity y varies with time t. Then y is said to grow or decay exponentially if 
its instantaneous rate of change (Chapter 19) is proportional to its instantaneous value; 
that is, 
* = K y  
dt 
(36.2) 
where K is a constant. 
Suppose that y satisfies (36.1). Let us make the change of variable U = Kt. Then, by the chain rule, 
dy 
dydu - d ~ K  or 
- = y  
dY 
du 
K Y = - = - - - -  
dt 
du dt 
du 
and so, by Problem 35.28, 
y = Ce" = CeKt 
(36.2) 
where C is another constant. 
We can now see why the process y is called exponential. If K > 0, K is called a growth constant, and 
y increases exponentially with time. If K < 0, K is called a decay constant, and y decreases exponentially 
with time. 
Let y, be the value of y at t = 0. Substituting 0 for t in (36.2), we obtain 
y, = Ceo = C(1) = C 
so that (36.2) can be rewritten as 
y = y,eK' 
(36.3) 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Assume that a culture consisting of loo0 bacteria increases exponentially with a growth constant K = 0.02, 
where time is measured in hours. Let us find a formula for the number y of bacteria present after t hours, and 
let us compute how long it will take until 1OOOOO bacteria are present in the culture.' 
Since y, = 10o0, the desired formula for y is given by (36.3), 
y = 1O()OeO.O2* 
Now set y = 1OOOOO and solve for t, 
1OOOOO = 1000e0*02' 
100 = eo.02* 
In 1OO = In eo.OZ' 
2 In 10 = 0.02t 
pn 10' = 2 In 10; In e" = U] 
t = 100 In 10 
Appendix E gives the approximate value of 2.3026 for In 10. Thus, 
t x 230.26 hours 
Note: Sometimes, instead of specifying the growth constant K, say, K = 0.02, one says that the quantity is 
increasing at the rate of 2 percent per unit time. This is not quite accurate. A rate of increase of r percent per 
unit time is approximately the same as a value of K = O.Or when r is relatively small (say, r 5 3). In fact, with 
Although populations are measured in positive integers, (36.3) seems to be applicable, even though that formula was derived for 
a quantity measured in real numbers. 

CHAP. 363 
L'H~PITAL'S RULE; EXPONENTIAL GROWTH' AND DECAY 
287 
an r percent growth rate, y = yo(l + O.Or) after one unit of time. Since y = yoeK when t = 1, eR = 1 + O.Or, 
and, therefore, K = In (1 + 0.Or). This is close to O.Or, since In (1 + x) x x for small x. [For example, 
In (1.02) x 0.0198 and In (1.03) x 0.02956.1 Thus, many textbooks will automatically interpret a rate of 
increase of r percent per unit time to mean that K = O.Or. 
If the decay constant of a given radioactive element is K < 0, compute the time T after which only half of any 
original quantity remains. 
At t = T, (36.3) gives 
- I n 2 = K T  
I n - = - l n x  
[I 1 
In 2 
K 
--- - T  
(36.4) 
The number T is called the half-life of the given element. Knowing either the half-life or the decay constant, we 
can find the other from (36.4).

Sketch the graph of y = xex.

So, by the second-derivative test there is a relative minimum at the point P( - 1, - l/e). From the expression 
for y", the curve is concave upward (that is, y" > 0) when x > -2, and concave downward (y" < 0) when 
x < - 2. Thus, the point I( - 2, - 2/e2) is an inflection point. 
It is clear that the curve rises without bound as x + + 00. To see what happens as x + -00, 
let

it provides a useful description of exponential processes: the change in a quantity over any time intervul is

If the bacteria in a culture grow exponentially and if their number y doubles in 1 hour, how long

2y, = y, 8')

37.1 ONEONE FUNCTIONS 
In Section 35.3, we introduced the notion of the inverse of a function, and we showed that the 
inverse of In x is ex, and vice versa. Not all functions, however, have inverses. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Consider the function f such that f ( x )  = x2 for all x. Then f( 1) = 1 and f( - 1) = 1. If there were an inverse g 
of f, then g(f(x)) = x. Therefore, g(1) = g(f(1)) = 1 and g(1) = g(f(- 1)) = - 1, implying that 1 = - 1, 
which is impossible. 
(b) Letfbe any periodic function,f(x + p )  =f(x), for all x (see Section 26.2). The argument of example (a), for two 
points xo and xo + p, shows that f cannot have an inverse. Now all the trigonometric functions are periodic 
(with either p = 2n or p = n). Hence, the trigonometric functions do not have inverses! 
The functions that have inverses turn out to be the one-one functions. 
Definition: A functionfis one-one if, whenever U # v, 
f (U) # f (0) 
Thus, a one-one function takes different numbers into different numbers. A function is one-one if 
and only if its graph intersects any horizontal line in at most one point. Figure 37-l(a) is the graph of a 
one-one function; Fig. 37-l(b) graphs a function that is not one-one because f (U) =f(t)) = c.

If a one-one function f is defined by means of a formula, y = f ( x ) ,  we can sometimes solve this 
equation for x in terms of y. This solution constitutes the formula for the inverse function, x =f- '(y). 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Letf(x) = 3x + 1 (a one-one function). Let y stand forf(x); then y = 3x + 1. Solve this equation for x in terms 
of Y, 
y - l = 3 x  
-- 
Y - L x  
3 
Therefore, the inversef-' is given by the formula 
Y-1 
f-'(y) = - 
3 
(6) Consider the one-one functionf(x) = 2e" - 5, 
y = 2e" - 5 
y + 5 = 2e" 
Y + 5  
2 
-- - ex 
Y + 5  
In - 
= In ex = x 
2 
Thus, 
(c) Let f(x) = xs + x. Since f'(x) = 5x4 + 1 > 0, f is an increasing function, and therefore one-one (see Problem 
37.12). But if we write y = xs + x, we have no obvious way of solving the equation for x in terms of y. 
37.2 INVERSES OF RESTRICTED TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
restricted to some subset of one period. 
For a periodic function to become one-one-and 
so to have an inverse-its 
domain has to be 
Inverse Sine 
The domain off(x) = sin x is restricted to [ - 4 2 ,  421, on which the function is one-one [in fact, 
increasing; see Fig. 37-2(a)]. The inverse function f - '(x) = sin - ' x is called the inverse sine of x (or, 
sometimes, the arc sine of x, written arc sin x or arcsin x). Its domain is [ - 1, 13. Thus, 
t Y  
( a )  y = sin x

(b) y = sin-'x 

294 
INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
[CHAP. 37 
The graph of sin-' x is given in Fig. 37-2(6). By a general theorem, the inverse of an increasing 
function is itself an increasing function. You will find it helpful to think of sin- ' x as the angle (between 
-n/2 and 4 2 )  whose sine is x.

The importance of the inverse sine function in calculus lies mainly in the integration formula (37.1). 
The procedure for the other trigonometric functions is exactly analogous to that for the sine func- 
tion. In every case, a restriction of the domain is chosen that will lead to a simple formula for the 
derivative of the inverse function.

37.1 
A one-one function has an inverse. Prove, conversely, that a function with an inverse is one-one. 
If the domain off consists of a single point, there is nothing to prove. Let f have the inverse g, but 
suppose, contrary to hypothesis, that the domain off contains two distinct numbers, U and U, such that 
f(u) = f ( v ) .  Then, 
= g(f(u)) = g(f(d) = " 
a contradiction. We must then admit thatf(u) #f(o); that is, thatfis one-one.

g be differentiable functions. The product rule tells us that 
d 
dx - 
(f(x)g(x)) = f(x)g’(x) + g(x)f’(x) 
or, in terms of antiderivatives, 
The substitutions U = f ( x )  and v = g(x) transform this into’ 
uv = [ U  do + [ V  du

U dv = uv - v du

The idea behind integration by parts is to replace a “difficult” integration 1 U do by an “easy” 
integration 1 v du. 
EXAMPLES

d u = e “ d x  
Since d t ~  = u’(x) dx and do = ex dx, we must have U’@) = ex. Hence, 
u = I e x  dx = ex + C

and we take the simplest case, C = 0, making U = ex. 
Since du = dx, the integration by parts procedure assumes the following form: 
U d v = u ~ -  v du

s 
xex dx = xe” - ex dx 
= xex -ex + C = ex(x - 1) + C 
For example, 1 f(x)g’(x) dx = U do, where, in the result of the integration on the right, we replace U byf(x) and U by g(x). In 
fact, by the chain rule, 
Hence, j U do = f(x)g’(x) dx. Similarly, o du = g(x)f’(x) dx.

INTEGRATION BY PARTS 
[CHAP. 38 
Integration by parts can be made easier to apply by setting up a box such as the following one for 
example (a) above: 
u = x  
do = ex dx 
~ 
d u = d x  
U = ex 
In the first row, we put U and do. In the second row, we write du and U. The result U D  - U du is 
obtained from the box by first multiplying the upper left corner U by the lower right corner o and then 
subtracting the integral { D du of the two entries in the second row. 
Notice that everything depends on a wise choice of U and U. If we had instead picked U = ex and 
du = x dx, then U = j x dx = x2/2 and we would have obtained 
I 
which is true enough, but of little use in evaluating 
integration 5 xe“ dx by the even more “difficult” integration 1 (x2/2) ex dx.

39.1 INTEGRATION OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
We already know the antiderivatives of some simple combinations of the basic trigonometric func- 
tions. In particular, we have derived all the formulas given in the second column of Appendix B. Let us 
now look at more complicated cases. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) Consider I sink x cos" x dx, where the nonnegative integers k and n are not both even. If, say, k is odd 
(k = 2j + l), rewrite the integral as 
sin2' 
s 
x cos" x sin x dx = (sin2 x)' cos" x sin x dx 
= J ( 1 -  cos2 x)' cos" x sin x dx 
s 
Now the change of variable u = cos x, du = -sin x dx, produces a polynomial integrand. (For n odd, the 
substitution u = sin x would be made instead.) For instance, 
I-

cos2 x sin5 x dx = cos2 x sin* x sin x dx

view of the half-angle identities

On the right-hand side of ( I )  are antiderivatives of odd powers of cos 2x, which may be evaluated by the 
method of example (U), and antiderivatives of etfen powers of cos 2x, to which the half-angle formula may be 
applied again. Thus, if the sixth power were present, we would write 
and expand the polynomial in cos 4x, and so forth. Eventually the process must end in a final answer, as is 
shown in the following specific case:

The sum and difference formulas of Theorem 26.6 give

sin ( A  - B)x = sin (Ax - Bx) = sin Ax cos Bx - cos Ax sin Bx

Chapter 40 
Integration of Rational Functions ; 
The Method of Partial Fractions 
This chapter will give a general method for evaluating indefinite integrals of the type 
where N(x) and D(x) are polynomials. That is to say, we shall show how to find the antiderivative of any 
rational functionf(x) = N(x)/D(x) (see Section 9.3). Two assumptions will be made, neither of which is 
really restrictive: (i) the leading coeficient (the coefficient of the highest power of x) in D(x) is +l; 
(ii) N(x) is of lower degree than D(x) [that is,j'(x) is a proper rational function]. 
EXAMPLES 
(a) - 4 ~ ' ~

The theorems that follow hold for polynomials with arbitrary real coefficients. However, for sim- 
plicity we shall illustrate them only with polynomials whose coefficients are integers. 
Theorem 40.1: Any polynomial D(x) with leading coefficient 1 can be expressed as the product of 
linear factors, of the form x - a, and irreducible quadratic factors (that cannot be fac- 
tored further), of the form x2 + bx + c, repetition of factors being allowed. 
As explained in Section 7.4, the real roots of D(x) determine its linear factors.

Here, the polynomial has two real roots (k

The root x = 3, which

formula, its roots are

Theorem 40.2 (Partial Fractions Representation): Any (proper) rational function f (x) = N(x)/D(x) may 
be written as a sum of simpler, proper rational functions. Each summand has as denomi- 
nator one of the linear or quadratic factors of D(x), raised to some power. 
By Theorem 40.2, 
f ( x )  dx is given as a sum of simpler antiderivatives-antiderivatives which, in
