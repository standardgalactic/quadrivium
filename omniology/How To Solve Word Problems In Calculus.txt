Preface
This book is designed to enable students of calculus to develop
their skills in solving word problems. Most calculus textbooks
present this topic in a cursory manner, forcing the student to
struggle with the techniques of setting up and solving com-
plex verbal problems. This book, which may be used as a sup-
plement to all calculus textbooks, is presented in a manner
that has proved so successful with the other books in the How
to Solve Word Problems series:
r Concise deﬁnitions and discussion of appropriate the-
ory in easily understood terms.
r Fully worked out solutions to illustrative examples.
r Supplementary problems with complete solutions.
The purpose of this book is to increase the student’s conﬁ-
dence in his or her ability to solve word problems. The material
is presented in an easy-to-understand, readable manner and if
the reader is willing to invest a little time and effort, he or she
will be rewarded with a skill which will prove invaluable.

Introduction
Strategies for Solving
Word Problems
The power of calculus lies in its ability to solve applied prob-
lems in such diverse areas as physics, chemistry, biology, busi-
ness, economics, and the social sciences. Invariably, human
beings, using words that attempt to describe some realistic
situation, pose such problems. This book addresses the diff-
iculties many students have solving word problems in their
calculus courses.
The ﬁrst task in solving a word problem is to develop a
model for the problem at hand. A mathematical model is a
description of the problem in terms of variables, functions,
equations, and other mathematical entities. Once it has been
modeled, the second task is to solve the problem using the
appropriate mathematical tools.
Setting up and solving a calculus problem from a verbal
description is a skill, which is best learned by example, fol-
lowing appropriate guidelines. By studying the steps set forth
in each chapter, you will develop techniques that can be ap-
plied to a variety of different applications.
Try to avoid memorizing procedures applicable only to
speciﬁc problems. Although this will give you instant gratiﬁ-
cation when you get the correct answer, you will ﬁnd that
if a problem deviates even slightly from the one you mem-
orized, you will be hopelessly lost. A better approach is to learn

general procedures, which can be applied to all problems
within a speciﬁc category.
Reading a word problem is not like reading a novel.
Every word is important and must be clearly understood if
you are to successfully arrive at the solution. Feel free to use
a dictionary, if necessary, to clarify the meaning of seemingly
vague words. Use your math book to clarify the meaning of
any technical words used in the problem. Read and re-read
the problem until it is absolutely clear what you are given and
what it is you are looking for. Then, and only then, should
you begin the solution.
This book contains many worked out examples. However,
you must understand that there is a big difference between
viewing the solution of a problem and solving the problem by
yourself. When you read an example in this book, you may
be able to follow every step but you should not be misled
into thinking that you completely understand the solution.
Learning to solve problems is like learning to play a musical
instrument. You may think a musical selection is simple while
watching your teacher play it with ease, but it is not until you
attempt the piece yourself that you begin to see what technical
difﬁculties actually lie within the music.
One suggestion, which you might ﬁnd useful, is to pick
a problem from this book and read the solution. When you
think you understand what you have read, cover the solution
and attempt the problem yourself. Most likely you will ﬁnd
that you have some difﬁculty. If you have trouble sneak a
peek at the solution to determine the step that caused you
difﬁculty. Then cover the solution again and continue. Repeat
this process every time you get stuck.
When you ﬁnally get to the end, take a deep breath and
then attempt the problem again from the beginning. You have
truly mastered the problem only if you can go from the begin-
ning to the end by yourself without looking at the authors’
solution.
Solving word problems is more of an art than a science.
Like all artistic endeavors, perfection takes practice, patience,
and perseverance. You may be frustrated at ﬁrst but if you
follow the guidelines described in this book, you will master
this all-important skill.

Chapter 1
Extracting Functions from
Word Problems
Calculus is the study of the behavior of functions. The ability to
solve “real life” problems using calculus hinges upon the abi-
lity to extract a function from a given description or physical
situation.
Students usually ﬁnd that a word problem is easily solved
once the underlying mathematical function is determined. In
this chapter we discuss techniques that will form the basis for
solving a variety of word problems encountered in calculus
courses.
One deﬁnition of a function found in calculus texts reads:
A function is a rule that assigns to each number x ε A, a
unique number y ε B.
In calculus, A and B are sets of real numbers. A is called the
domain and B the range. It is important to understand that a
function is not a number, but a correspondence between two
sets of numbers. In a practical sense, one may think of a func-
tion as a relationship between y and x. The important thing
is that there be one, and only one, value of y corresponding to
a given value of x.
EXAMPLE 1
If y = x2 + 5x + 2, then y is a function of x. For each value of
x there is clearly one and only one value of y. However, if the
1

equation x2 + y2 = 25 deﬁnes the correspondence between x
and y, then y is not a function of x. If x = 3, for example, then
y could be 4 or −4.
Functions are usually represented symbolically by a letter
such as f or g. For convenience, function notation is often used
in calculus. In terms of the deﬁnition above, if f is a function
and x ε A, then f (x) is the unique number in B corresponding
to x.
It is not uncommon to use a letter that reminds us of
what a function represents. Thus for example, A(x) may be
used to represent the area of a square whose side is x or V(r)
may represent the volume of a sphere whose radius is r.
EXAMPLE 2
Suppose f represents the “squaring” function, i.e., the func-
tion that squares x. We write
f (x) = x2
To compute the value of this function for a particular
value of x, simply replace x by that value wherever it appears
in the deﬁnition of the function.
f (3) = 32 = 9
f (−5) = (−5)2 = 25
f (π) = π2
f (
√
7) = (
√
7)2 = 7
f (a + b) = (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
The domain of a function is the set of numbers for which
the function is deﬁned. While polynomials have the set of
all real numbers as their domain, many functions must,
by their very deﬁnition, have restricted domains. For ex-
ample, f (x) = √x has, as its domain, the set of nonnegative
real numbers. (The square root of a negative number is unde-
ﬁned.) The domain of g(x) = 1/x is the set of all real numbers
except 0.
2

Because of the geometric or physical nature of a prob-
lem, many word problems arising from everyday situations
involve functions with restricted domains. For example, the
squaring function f (x) = x2 discussed in Example 2 allows all
real x, but if f (x) represents the area of a square of side x, then
negative values make no sense. The domain would be the set
of all nonnegative real numbers. (We shall see later that it is
sometimes desirable to allow 0 as the dimension of a geomet-
ric ﬁgure, even though a square or rectangle whose side is 0 is
difﬁcult to visualize).
Finally, please note that when dealing with problems in
elementary calculus, such as those discussed in this book, only
functions of a single variable are considered. We may write
A = xy to represent the area of a rectangle of width x and
length y, but A is not a function of a single variable unless
it is expressed in terms of only one variable. Techniques for
accomplishing this are discussed in the pages that follow.
Strategy for Extracting Functions
The most important part of obtaining the function is to read
and understand the problem. Once the problem is understood,
and it is clear what is to be found, there are three steps to
determining the function.
Step 1
Draw a diagram (if appropriate). Label all quantities,
known and unknown, that are relevant.
Step 2
Write an equation representing the quantity to be ex-
pressed as a function. This quantity will usually be repre-
sented in terms of two or more variables.
Step 3
Use any constraints speciﬁed in the problem to elimi-
nate all but one independent variable. A constraint deﬁnes
a relationship between variables in the problem. The pro-
cedure is not complete until only one independent variable
remains.
3

Number Problems
Although number problems are relatively simple, they illus-
trate the above steps quite clearly.
EXAMPLE 3
The sum of two numbers is 40. Express their product as a func-
tion of one of the numbers.
Solution
Step 1
In most number problems a diagram is not called for. We
label the numbers using the variables x and y.
Let x be the ﬁrst number
y be the second number
Step 2
We wish to express the product P as a function, so P = xy.
Step 3
Since x + y = 40, y = 40 −x. We substitute into the equa-
tion involving P obtained in step 2 and express using function
notation.
P(x) = x(40 −x)
P(x) = 40x −x2
EXAMPLE 4
The product of two numbers is 32. Find a function that repre-
sents the sum of their squares.
Solution
Step 1
Let x be the ﬁrst number and y the second.
Step 2
S = x2 + y2
Step 3
Since xy = 32, y = 32
x . It follows that S(x) = x2 +

Two–Dimensional Geometry Problems
Most geometry problems are composed of rectangles, trian-
gles, and circles. It is therefore useful to review the formulas
for the perimeter and area of these standard geometric shapes.
A rectangle of length l and width w has a perimeter equal
to the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Its area is the product
of its length and width.
P = 2l + 2w
A = lw
A special case arises when l and w are equal. The resulting
ﬁgure is a square, whose side is s.
P = 4s
A = s2

P = 2l + 2w
A = lw
P = 4s
A = s2

A triangle with base b and altitude h has an area of 1

Special cases include right triangles and equilateral triangles.
One often encounters triangles where two sides and their in-
cluded angle are known.

A circle is measured by its radius r. The perimeter of a
circle is known as its circumference. Occasionally the diameter
d will be given in place of the radius. Since r = d

circumference may also be expressed in terms of d.

EXAMPLE 5
A farmer has 1500 feet of fencing in his barn. He wishes to
enclose a rectangular pen, subdivided into two regions by a
section of fence down the middle, parallel to one side of the
rectangle. Express the area enclosed by the pen as a function
of its width x. What is the domain of the function?
Solution
Step 1
We draw a simple diagram, labeling the dimensions of
the rectangle.
x

Step 2
We express the area of the rectangle in terms of the vari-
ables x and y. Observe that the area of the pen is determined
by its outer dimensions only; the inner section has no affect
on the area.
A = xy
Step 3
We use the constraint of 1500 feet of fence to obtain a
relationship between x and y.
3x + 2y = 1500
Next we solve for y in terms of x.
2y = 1500 −3x
y = 750 −3

Finally, we substitute this expression for y into the area
equation obtained in step 2.
A = xy
A = x

A(x) = 750x −3

Mathematically, the domain of A(x) is the set of all real
numbers. However, in this problem, as with all geometry prob-
lems, negative dimensions are unrealistic. Although x = 0 may
appear to be unrealistic as well, we generally allow a rectangle
of zero width or length with the understanding that its area
is 0. Such a rectangle is called a degenerate rectangle. Since the
perimeter is ﬁxed, y gets smaller as x gets larger so the largest
value of x occurs when y = 0.
3x + 2y = 1500
3x = 1500
(y = 0)
x = 500
The function describing the area of the farmer’s pen is
A(x) = 750x −3

EXAMPLE 6
A piece of wire 12 inches long is to be used to form a square
and/or a circle. Determine a function that expresses the com-
bined area of both ﬁgures. What is its domain?
Solution
Step 1
Let x be the side of the square and r the radius of the
circle. We shall express the area as a function of x.

Step 2
A = x2 + πr 2
Step 3
Since the combined perimeter of the two ﬁgures must be
12 inches, we have
4x + 2πr = 12
It follows that
2πr = 12 −4x
r = 12 −4x

Replacing r in terms of x in step 2 gives the area as a function
of x.

If all the wire is used to form the circle, x = 0. If all the wire is
used for the square, 4x = 12 and x = 3. Our function is
A(x) = x2 + (6 −2x)2

Step 2
The enclosed area consists of a rectangle whose dimen-
sions are x and 2r and two semicircles of radius r whose com-
bined area is πr 2.
A = 2rx + πr 2
Step 3
The perimeter of the ﬁgure is the length of the two
straight sides added to the lengths of the two semicircular arcs.
Thus
Each semicircular arc has length
πr. Together, they form a com-
plete circle whose circumference
is 2πr.
2x + 2πr = 1
2x = 1 −2πr
x = 1 −2πr

We substitute into the equation obtained in step 2.
A(r) = 2r

= r −2πr 2 + πr 2

Since r cannot be negative, r ≥0. The perimeter of the track

is ﬁxed so the maximum value of r occurs when x = 0.
2x + 2πr = 1
2πr = 1
(x = 0)
r = 1

The area function and its domain are
A(r) = r −πr 2

Three–Dimensional Geometry Problems
Most three-dimensional word problems involve boxes, right
circular cylinders, spheres, and cones.
A box has a volume equal to the product of its length,
width, and height. The surface area of a closed box is the sum
of the areas of its six sides. An open box has no top; its volume
is the same as for a closed box, but its surface area involves
only ﬁve sides. A cube is a box whose edges are all equal.

A right circular cylinder of length h and radius r has volume

these is to multiply the area and circumference of a circle by h.

A closed box has a base twice as long as it is wide. If its volume
is 100 in3, express its surface area as a function of the width x
of its base.
Solution
Step 1
Since the base of the box is a rectangle whose length
is twice its width, we can represent its dimensions by x and
2x. The height, however, must be represented by a different
variable.
2x
y

Step 2
The surface area of the box S is the sum of the areas of
its six sides. The top and bottom areas are each 2x2, the front
and back areas are each 2xy, and the left and right sides each
have an area of xy.
S = 2x2 + 2x2 + 2xy + 2xy + xy + xy
S = 4x2 + 6xy
Step 3
The volume of the box (l × w × h), 2x2y, is 100 in3.

Business and Economics Problems
Problems arising in business and economics generally deal
with money. Revenue is the amount of money taken in by a
company when selling a product, cost is the money paid out
by the company for wages, material, rent, and so forth, and
proﬁt is the difference between revenue and cost. Negative
proﬁt indicates a loss.
EXAMPLE 11
A machine can produce 12 clay ﬁgures per hour. It costs
$750 to set up the machine and $6 per hour to run the
machine. Each clay ﬁgure requires $2 of material (clay) to pro-
duce. If each clay ﬁgure will sell for $10, express the revenue,
16

cost, and proﬁt in producing x clay ﬁgures as a function of
time.
Solution
Step 1
Let x represent the number of clay ﬁgures produced
and let t represent the number of hours needed to produce
them. Let R, C, and P represent the revenue, cost, and proﬁt,
respectively.
Step 2
Since each ﬁgure sells for $10,
R = 10x
The cost consists of three parts. Fixed cost is $750, the cost of
running the machine for t hours is 6t dollars, and the cost of
material to produce x ﬁgures is 2x dollars. Thus
C = 750 + 6t + 2x
Since Proﬁt = Revenue −Cost
P = R −C
= 10x −(750 + 6t + 2x)
= 8x −6t −750
Step 3
Since 12 clay ﬁgures are produced per hour, x = 12t.
Substituting into the results of step 2,
R = 10x = 10(12t)
R(t) = 120t
C = 750 + 6t + 2x
= 750 + 6t + 2(12t)
= 750 + 6t + 24t
17

C(t) = 750 + 30t
P = 8x −6t −750
= 8(12t) −6t −750
= 96t −6t −750
P(t) = 90t −750

costs $300, all seats on the bus will be sold. For each addi-

a function that represents the revenue derived from a single
bus tour.
Solution
Step 1
In this type of problem it is convenient to let x represent
the number of $10 increments above the base price of $300.
Thus, for example, if x = 2 the price is $320. We let n represent
the number of seats sold and p the price per seat.
Step 2
The revenue R is the product of the number of seats sold
and the price per seat.
R = np
Step 3
For each unit increment in x, n decreases by 2 and p in-
creases by 10.
n = 80 −2x
p = 300 + 10x
Substituting into step 2,
R = np = (80 −2x)(300 + 10x)
R(x) = 24,000 + 200x −20x2

EXAMPLE 13
A river is 100 feet wide. The local telephone company wants
to run a cable from point A on one side of the river to a point
B on the other side, 500 feet downstream. It costs 3 dollars per
foot to run the cable under water while only 2 dollars per foot
to run the cable on land. Determine a function representing
the total cost to lay the cable.
Solution
Step 1
Let x represent the number of feet from C, directly
opposite A, where the cable will emerge from the water, and
let y represent the number of feet of cable to be laid under
water.

Step 2
The total cost is the sum of the costs to run the cable on
land and under water.
C = Cland + Cwater
= 2(500 −x) + 3y
= 1000 −2x + 3y
Step 3
By the Pythagorean theorem, y =

cost function is

If 10 or fewer computers are sold, the price is $1500 per computer, so
the company’s revenue R = 1500x. The proﬁt,
P = R −C
= 1500x −(2000 + 800x)
= 700x −2000
If more than 10 computers are sold, the number of computers in
excess of 10 is x −10. The price per computer then becomes
1500 −10(x −10) = 1600 −10x dollars. In this case the
company’s revenue becomes R = (1600 −10x)x = 1600x −10x 2
and the proﬁt
P = R −C
= 1600x −10x 2 −(2000 + 800x)

Combining these results,

Rates of Change in the
Natural and Social Sciences
The average rate of change of a function f with respect to its in-
dependent variable x is the quotient 	f (x)
	x
= f (x + h) −f (x)
h
.
The instantaneous rate of change is lim
h→0
f (x + h) −f (x)
h
which,
by deﬁnition, is f ′(x).
The instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect
to its independent variable is the derivative of the function
with respect to that variable.
Most problems dealing with rates of change involve instanta-
neous rates of change, and the word “instantaneous” is usually
omitted. In these problems we simply compute the derivative
of the function and evaluate it at the point in question. If the
average rate is required, the word “average” will usually be
mentioned.
Graphically, the (instantaneous) rate of change of a func-
tion is the slope of the tangent line at a point. The average
rate of change over an interval is the slope of the secant line
connecting the points on the curve corresponding to the end-
points of the interval.

Motion along a Straight Line
Velocity is the rate of change of the position of a moving object
with respect to time.
If we are told that a car travels a distance of 100 miles
along a straight road, we get a sense of how far the car
has traveled but we are given no clue as to how fast the car
moves. On the other hand, if we are told that the car travels
100 miles in 2 hours, we can judge that the car moved an aver-
age of 50 miles per hour. We say that the car’s average velocity
over this 2-hour time interval is 50 mi/h.
The car’s average velocity is deﬁned by
s represents the car’s position re-
lative to a ﬁxed point.
vav = 	s
	t
The instantaneous velocity v is deﬁned as the limit of the
average velocity, as the length of the time interval ap-
proaches 0.
v = lim
	t→0
	s
	t
30

This quantity is the derivative of s with respect to t:
v = ds
dt
EXAMPLE 4
A bicycle travels along a straight road. At 1:00 it is 1 mile from
the end of the road and at 4:00 it is 16 miles from the end of
the road. Compute (a) its average velocity from 1:00 to 4:00
and (b) its instantaneous velocity at 3:00.
Solution
(a) Let s represent the bicycle’s position relative to the end of
the road.
vav = 	s
	t = 16 −1
4 −1 = 15
3 = 5 mi/h
(b) We cannot solve this part of the problem since we do not
know the bicycle’s location at every point in time. There
is not enough information given to compute its instanta-
neous velocity.
In order to compute instantaneous velocity we need the bi-
cycle’s position as a function of time.
EXAMPLE 5
A bicycle travels along a straight road. At t o’clock it is t2 miles
from the end of the road. Compute (a) its average velocity
from 1:00 to 4:00 and (b) its instantaneous velocity at 3:00.
Solution
(a) Observe that as far as the average velocity is concerned, the
problem is identical to Example 4. If s = t2, when t = 1,
s = 1 and when t = 4, s = 16.
vav = 	s
	t = 16 −1
4 −1 = 15
3 = 5 mi/h
31

(b) Since the position of the bicycle is known at every point
in time, the instantaneous velocity can be computed.
Let s(t) = t2. Then v (t) = s′(t) = 2t
At 3 o’clock, t = 3 so v (3) = s′(3) = 6 mi/h.
The derivative determines the velocity of a moving object,
which indicates its speed as well as its direction. Often the
phrase “how fast” will be used in the formulation of a word
problem. “How fast” indicates that only the speed of the object
is desired. Unlike velocity, which may be positive, zero, or
negative, the speed of a moving object is always nonnegative.
Mathematically, speed is the absolute value of velocity:
speed = |velocity|
EXAMPLE 6
A particle’s position (in inches) along the x axis after t seconds
of travel is given by the equation
x = 24t2 −t3 + 10
(a) What is the particle’s average velocity during the ﬁrst
3 seconds of travel?
(b) Where is the particle and how fast is it moving after
3 seconds of travel?
(c) Where is the particle and how fast is it moving after
20 seconds of travel?
(d) When is the velocity of the particle 0? What is the particle’s
position at that instant?
(e) Describe the motion of the particle during the ﬁrst
20 seconds of travel.
Solution
(a) The particle’s position when t = 0 is x = 10 inches. When
t = 3, x = 199 inches.
vav = 	x
	t = 199 −10
3 −0
= 189
3
= 63 in/sec
32

(b) When t = 3, its position x = 199. The particle’s instanta-
neous velocity is determined using the derivative.
v = dx
dt = 48t −3t2
When t = 3, v = 117 in/sec. Since this is a positive number,
it represents the speed as well.
(c) When t = 20, its position x = 24(20)2 −203 + 10 = 1610.
Its velocity,
v = dx
dt = 48t −3t2
When t = 20, v = −240 in/sec. The negative velocity indi-
cates that the particle is moving in the negative direction.
The speed of the particle is 240 in/sec.
(d)
v = 48t −3t2
0 = 48t −3t2
0 = 3t(16 −t)
t = 0
t = 16
The velocity of the particle is 0 when t = 0 and when
t = 16. When t = 0, x = 10 and when t = 16, x = 2058.
(e) The particle begins at rest at x = 10. For the ﬁrst 16
seconds, the particle has a positive velocity and moves
in the positive direction. When t = 16, the particle
stops momentarily (v = 0) at x = 2058. It then moves
in the negative direction and returns to x = 1610 when
t = 20.
The acceleration of a moving object is the rate of change of
its velocity with respect to time. Thus a(t) = v ′(t). If s(t) repre-
sents the position of the particle at time t, then a(t) = s′′(t).
EXAMPLE 7
Compute the acceleration of the particle in Example 6 at times
t = 3, 5, 10, and 15.
33

Solution
Since v(t) = 48t −3t2, a(t) = v ′(t) = 48 −6t.
When t = 3, a = 30 in/sec2
When t = 5, a = 18 in/sec2
When t = 10, a = −12 in/sec2
When t = 15, a = −42 in/sec2
Since the units of velocity in
this example are inches per
second, the units of accel-
eration would be inches per
second per second. This is
usually written in/sec/sec or
in/sec2. Other common units
of acceleration are ft/sec2,
mi/h2, and meters/sec2.
EXAMPLE 8
The height (in feet) at any time t (in seconds) of a projectile
thrown vertically is
h(t) = −16t2 + 256t
(a) What is the projectile’s average velocity for the ﬁrst
5 seconds of travel?
(b) How fast is the projectile traveling 6 seconds after it is
thrown? How high is it?
(c) How fast is the projectile traveling 10 seconds after it is
thrown? How high is it?
(d) When is the maximum height reached by the projectile?
What is its maximum height?
(e) When does the projectile return to the ground and with
what velocity?
(f ) Describe the motion of the projectile.
Solution
(a) h(t) = −16t2 + 256t. When t = 0, h = 0 and when t = 5,
h = −16(5)2 + 256(5) = 880 ft.
vav = 	h
	t = 880 −0
5 −0
= 176 ft/sec
(b) Since we are looking for the instantaneous velocity we
compute the derivative dh
dt . v = dh
dt = −32t + 256. When
34

t = 6, v = −32(6) + 256 = 64 ft/sec. The height of the pro-
jectile when t = 6 is h = −16(6)2 + 256(6) = 960 ft.
(c) v = dh
dt = −32t + 256. When t = 10, v = −64 ft/sec. The
negative velocity indicates that the projectile is moving in
the negative direction (downward) at a speed of 64 ft/sec.
The height of the projectile when t = 10 is h = −16(10)2 +
256(10) = 960 ft.
(d)
v = −32t + 256
0 = −32t + 256
←Maximum height is reached
when v = 0
32t = 256
t = 8 sec
hmax = −16(8)2 + 256(8)
←Maximum height is reached
after 8 sec
= 1024 feet
(e) The projectile returns to the ground when h = 0.
h(t) = −16t2 + 256t
0 = −16t2 + 256t
0 = −16t(t −16)
t = 0
t = 16
Since the ball was thrown at time t = 0, the ball returns to
the ground after 16 seconds. Its velocity at this time, from
the velocity function v(t) = −32t + 256 is
v (16) = −32(16) + 256 = −256 ft/sec
The negative velocity indicates that the ball is travel-
ing downward at a speed of 256 ft/sec when it hits the
ground.
(f ) When t = 0, h = 0 (the projectile is at ground level) and
v = 256 ft/sec. This is the initial velocity. As t increases,
the height h increases and the velocity v decreases, reach-
ing a value of 0 when t = 8 sec. At this point the max-
imum height of the projectile is reached, 1024 ft. As
t increases past 8 sec, v becomes negative and h gets
35

smaller, indicating that the projectile is returning to the
ground. The projectile returns to the ground after 16 sec.

An environmental study of a small town indicates that in t
years the level of carbon monoxide will be q(t) = 0.005t3 +
0.02t2 + 0.01t + 2.5 parts per million (ppm). At what rate
will the CO level be increasing 1 and 2 years from now?
Solution
The rate of change of the CO level after t years is
q′(t) = 0.015t2 + 0.04t + 0.01
After 1 year q′(1) = 0.015 + 0.04 + 0.01 = 0.065 ppm per year
After 2 years q′(2) = 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.01 = 0.15 ppm per year

Business and Economics
The marginal cost of producing an item is the rate at which its
cost changes with respect to the number of items produced.
Thus if C(x) is the cost of producing x items, the marginal cost
is C′(x).
The marginal cost approximates the additional cost nec-
essary to produce one additional item. Thus C′(x) is the ap-
proximate cost incurred to produce the (x + 1)st item.
Similarly, if R(x) and P(x) represent the revenue and
proﬁt, respectively, in selling a quantity of x units, then R′(x)
represents marginal revenue and P ′(x) the marginal proﬁt.
EXAMPLE 14
Suppose the total cost of producing x items is given by the
function
C(x) = 0.001x3 + 0.025x2 + 3x + 5
Compute the marginal cost of producing the 51st item.
Solution
Since C′(x) is the approximate cost incurred to produce
the (x + 1)st item we need to compute C′(50).
C′(x) = 0.003x2 + 0.05x + 3
C′(50) = 0.003(50)2 + 0.05(50) + 3
= 7.50 + 2.50 + 3
= $13.00
The marginal cost is $13.00. For comparison, the exact cost to
produce the 51st item is
C(51) −C(50) = [0.001(51)3 + 0.025(51)2 + 3(51) + 5]
−[0.001(50)3 + 0.025(50)2 + 3(50) + 5]
= 355.676 −342.50
= $13.176

is
V(t) = 100t2 −3000t + 20,000 dollars. At what rate does the
machine depreciate after 5 years?
Solution
The rate of depreciation is the rate at which value is lost.
If V(t) represents the value of the machine after t years, V′(t)
represents the rate at which its value changes.
V′(t) = 200t −3000
V′(5) = −2000
The machine depreciates at the rate of $2000 per year after
5 years.

in the positive direction until its position s = 101. For the next 5
minutes (2 ≤t ≤7) its velocity is negative so the object moves
in the negative direction until its position becomes s = −24. The
velocity then becomes positive again and for the next 3 minutes
(7 ≤t ≤10) it moves in the positive direction until its position is
s = 165.

Chapter 3
Related Rates
In Chapter 2 we discussed the rate of change of a function. It
is not uncommon for a problem to involve several rates of
change. Related rates problems are concerned with the relation-
ships between several variables and how the rate of change of
one affects the rate of change of another.
In this chapter we consider related rates problems invol-
ving algebraic functions. Problems involving trigonometric
functions are considered in Chapter 6.
The predominant tool used in the solution of related rates
problems is the chain rule. Since most related rates problems
deal with time as the independent variable, we state the chain
rule in terms of t:
dy
dt = dy
dx · dx
dt
Before we discuss how to solve related rates problems, let’s
review some important implications of the chain rule.
EXAMPLE 1
Compute the derivative of x3 with respect to t.
Solution
The derivative of x3 with respect to x is 3x2. However,
its derivative with respect to t is somewhat different. To

dy
dt = dy
dx · dx
dt
= 3x2 dx
dt
Thus the derivative of x3 with respect to t, d
dt(x3), is 3x2 dx
dt .
Unless we know the relationship between x and t we cannot
simplify any further.
The result of Example 1 can be stated in a more general
form.
d
dt f (x) = f ′(x)dx
dt
Of course, the argument of f will not always be x, but the
independent variable is usually t in a related rates problem.

The following example illustrates the use of the chain rule.
Although not a word problem, it will help clarify basic ideas.
EXAMPLE 3
If y = x3 + 4x2 and dx
dt = 3, compute dy
dt when x = 1.
Solution
dy
dt = d
dt(x3 + 4x2)
= (3x2 + 8x)dx
dt
47

Since dx
dt = 3,
dy
dt = (3x2 + 8x) · 3
Even though dx
dt is constant, dy
dt changes as x changes. When
x = 1
dy
dt = 11 · 3 = 33
In solving word problems, the following steps should be
followed:
Step 1
Draw a diagram (if applicable). Label all variables with
an appropriate symbol. Label constants with their numer-
ical values.
Step 2
Determine which rates are given and which rate you
need to ﬁnd. Write them down for future reference.
Step 3
Find an equation (or several equations) relating the vari-
ables deﬁned in step 1.
Step 4
Differentiate the equation(s) in step 3 with respect to
time.
Step 5
Substitute all given information into the result of step 4
and solve for the unknown rate. Insert appropriate units.
The basic technique is illustrated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 4
A ladder 20 feet long is placed against a wall. The foot of the
ladder begins to slide away from the wall at the rate of 1 ft/sec.

←Divide by 2 for convenience

Step 5
We know from step 2 that dx/dt = 1 and we know that
x = 12 at the instant in question. Before we can compute
dy/dt, however, we need to ﬁnd y at this instant. This is
49

accomplished by using the equation obtained in step 3.
x2 + y2 = 202
122 + y2 = 202
144 + y2 = 400
y2 = 256
y = 16
If you recognize a 12-16-20 right
triangle, this calculation is un-
necessary.
Substituting into the equation obtained in step 4, we obtain
12 · 1 + 16dy
dt = 0

The negative derivative means that y is decreasing. The top of
the ladder is falling at the rate of 3

The area of a trapezoid is h

Step 3
The cross-sectional area of the water is A = h

volume of water V = l × A. l is the length of the trough so
V = l · h
2(x + 30). Since the units in the problem must be con-
sistent, we take l = 200 cm. Thus V = 100h(x + 30). Since x is
not mentioned in either the “Given” or the “Find” in step 2,
we should eliminate x from this equation. To accomplish this,

Chapter 4
Applied Maximum and
Minimum
Optimization problems are one of the most important applica-
tions of differential calculus. Whether we are concerned with
how to get from A to B in the least amount of time, or we wish
to construct a box of maximum volume for a given amount of
material, we are looking for the “best” way to perform a given
task.
The problem of optimization generally reduces to the
problem of ﬁnding the maximum or minimum value of a func-
tion subject to a given set of conditions or constraints. In this
chapter we will discuss how to set up a maximum/minimum
problem and solve it to ﬁnd the optimal solution.
We begin by reviewing a few basic deﬁnitions and
theorems.
A function f has an absolute maximum on an interval I
if there exists a number c in I such that f (x) ≤f (c) for all
x in I.
A similar deﬁnition (with the inequality reversed) applies to
an absolute minimum. Note that that absolute maximum or
minimum value is f (c). Its location is x = c.
The existence of an absolute maximum and minimum
under certain conditions is guaranteed by the Extreme Value
Theorem:
70
Copyright 2001 The McGraw-Hill Companies.   Click Here for Terms of Use.

If f is continuous on a closed bounded interval I = [a, b],
then f has both an absolute maximum and an absolute
minimum in I.
Of course, f may have an absolute maximum and/or minimum
if the function fails to be continuous or if I is not closed, but
there is no guarantee of their existence unless both hypotheses
of the extreme value theorem are satisﬁed.
A critical number for f is a number x for which either
f ′(x) = 0 or f ′(x) does not exist.
In a word problem arising from a physical or geometrical sit-
uation it is very rare that f ′(x) will fail to exist. Therefore, in
this book we will consider only critical numbers for which
f ′(x) = 0.
It is easily shown that if a function is continuous on a
closed bounded interval, then its absolute extrema (which ex-
ist by the Extreme Value Theorem) will occur either at a critical
number or at an endpoint of the interval. The following pro-
cedure, which we will call the “closed interval method,” can
be used to determine their values.
Step 1
Find all critical numbers of f (x) that lie within the given
interval [a, b]. Critical numbers outside the interval may be
ignored.
Step 2
Compute the values of f (x) at each critical number and
at the endpoints a and b.
Step 3
The largest value of f (x) obtained in step 2 is the ab-
solute maximum and the smallest value is the absolute
minimum.
71

Solution
Step 1
f (x) = x3 −12x + 5
f ′(x) = 3x2 −12
0 = 3x2 −12
12 = 3x2
4 = x2
x = 2
x = −2
Step 2
The value x = −2 is outside the interval and is therefore
ignored.

Step 3
The absolute maximum of f (x) on [−1, 4] is 21 and the
absolute minimum is −11.
Most
functions
that
occur
in
connection
with
maximum/minimum
problems
will
be
continuous,
but
occasionally the interval representing their domain will be
open or inﬁnite in length. In such situations, the closed
interval method fails. In fact, the function may not even have
absolute extrema.
The function f (x) = x2 on the open interval (−2, 3) has
an absolute minimum (of 0) at x = 0 but has no absolute maxi-
mum. Additional examples can easily be constructed where
72

we have a maximum but no minimum, or neither a maximum
nor a minimum. The only time we are guaranteed to have both
is when we have a continuous function on a closed interval.
Closely related to an absolute maximum is a relative (or
local) maximum.
A function f has a relative (or local) maximum at c if there
exists an open interval I containing c for which f (x) ≤f (c)
for all x in I.
Of course, there is a corresponding deﬁnition for a relative
minimum. The only difference is that the inequality is re-
versed.
It can be shown that if f (x) has a relative extremum (max-
imum or minimum) at c, then c must be a critical number of
the function. But the converse is not true. A function may have
a critical value that corresponds to neither a maximum nor a
minimum.
Consider, for example, f (x) = x3. Since f ′(x) = 3x2, and
f ′(0) = 0, 0 is a critical value for f . But 0 is neither a relative
maximum nor a relative minimum. A quick look at its graph
shows why.

Because it is impossible to ﬁnd an open interval containing
0 for which (0, 0) is the highest point, f does not have a
relative maximum at 0. Similarly, it is impossible to ﬁnd an
open interval containing 0 for which (0, 0) is the lowest point,
so f does not have a relative minimum at 0. f has no relative
extremum.
To decide whether a critical number is a relative maxi-
mum or relative minimum (or perhaps neither) we introduce
two tests called the ﬁrst derivative test and the second derivative
test.
First Derivative Test
Let c be a critical value of f
(a) If f ′(x) changes from positive to negative as x goes
from the left of c to the right of c, then f has a relative
maximum at c.
(b) If f ′(x) changes from negative to positive as x goes
from the left of c to the right of c, then f has a relative
minimum at c.
Second Derivative Test
Let c be a critical value of f
(a) If f ′′(c) < 0, then f has a relative maximum at c.
(b) If f ′′(c) > 0, then f has a relative minimum at c.
If f ′′(c) = 0 the second derivative test fails and the ﬁrst deriva-
tive test must be used. However, this is very rare in solving
word problems and the second derivative test is often the more
convenient test to use.
When we solve a maximum-minimum problem, we are
looking for the largest or smallest value a function can attain.
We are looking for the absolute maximum or minimum value.
Why bother looking for relative extrema? The answer is given
in the following theorem:
74

If a continuous function f has only one relative extremum
in an interval I at c, then
(a) If the relative extremum is a relative minimum, then
f has an absolute minimum at c.
(b) If the relative extremum is a relative maximum, then
f has an absolute maximum at c.
Note: If the interval I is closed, this theorem offers a conve-
nient alternative to the closed interval method.
The theorem can be easily understood with the aid of a
simple diagram.
c
The function shown has a relative maximum at c. Be-
cause the function is continuous, the only way this can fail to
be the absolute maximum is for the graph to turn around and
go higher than f (c). But this would give rise to a relative mini-
mum which, by hypothesis, is impossible. A similar argument
holds in the case of a minimum.
Many word problems yield only one relative extremum.
To determine whether it is an absolute maximum or mini-
mum, we simply determine whether it is a relative maximum
or minimum. This is easily accomplished by using either the
ﬁrst or second derivative tests.
75

The ﬁrst step in solving a maximum-minimum word
problem is to ﬁnd a function that represents the quantity to be
maximized or minimized. Techniques for accomplishing this
task were discussed in Chapter 1 and are summarized below.
Step 1
Draw a diagram (if appropriate). Label all quantities,
known and unknown, which are stated in the problem.
Step 2
Write an equation representing the quantity to be max-
imized or minimized. This quantity will typically be rep-
resented in terms of two or more variables.
Step 3
Use any constraints or relationships between the vari-
ables to eliminate all but one independent variable. This
converts the equation obtained in step 2 into a function.
Determine the domain of this function appropriate to the
problem; i.e., determine the set of all values of the inde-
pendent variable for which the problem makes sense.
Once the function has been found, we proceed to ﬁnd its max-
imum or minimum value.
Step 4
Find all critical numbers.
Step 5
If the function is continuous on a closed interval, use
the closed interval method to determine its absolute max-
imum or minimum values.
OR
If there is only one critical value within the interval under
consideration, use the ﬁrst or second derivative test to de-
termine whether it is a relative maximum or relative min-
imum. The value of the function at this location will be
the absolute maximum value or absolute minimum value,
respectively.
76

EXAMPLE 2
Jodi wishes to use 100 feet of fencing to enclose a rectan-
gular garden. Determine the maximum possible area of her
garden.
Step 1
x
y
Step 2
A = xy
Step 3
Since the perimeter of the rectangle is to be 100 feet,
2x + 2y = 100
x + y = 50
y = 50 −x
It follows from step 2 that A(x) = x(50 −x) or A(x) = 50x −x2.
Since x cannot be negative, the smallest allowable value of x
is 0. Since y = 50 −x and y cannot be negative, the largest
allowable value of x is 50.
0 ≤x ≤50
Note: In order to obtain a closed interval, we allow x = 0 and
x = 50 as acceptable dimensions. Such degenerate rect-
angles have an area of 0.
77

Step 4
Since A(x) = 50x −x2 is a polynomial, its derivative exists
everywhere. The critical values occur where A′(x) = 0.
A(x) = 50x −x2
A′(x) = 50 −2x = 0
x = 25
Step 5
We use the closed interval method.

The maximum area is 625 ft2.
EXAMPLE 3
What is the minimum possible perimeter for a rectangle whose
area is 100 in2?
Solution
At ﬁrst glance this problem appears similar to Example 2.
We shall see, however, that it is somewhat different and must
be solved using another strategy.
Step 1
x
y
Step 2
We wish to minimize the perimeter.
P = 2x + 2y
78

Step 3
The given constraint is that the area must be 100 in2.
xy = 100
y = 100
x
Now we can represent P as a function of x
P(x) = 2x + 2
100
x

= 2x + 200
x
= 2x + 200x−1
At this point the solution takes a different turn. Unlike Ex-
ample 2, we cannot allow x = 0. Not only would this cause
difﬁculty for P(x), but more fundamentally it is impossible to
have a rectangle with an area of 100 if one side has length 0.
On the other side of the spectrum, what is the largest
that x might be? A moment’s thought will convince you that
no matter how large you make x, you can always take y sufﬁ-
ciently small so that xy = 100.
Since the domain of P(x) is the interval (0, ∞) the closed
interval method cannot be used here.
Step 4
We ﬁnd the critical value(s)
P ′(x) = 2 −200x−2
0 = 2 −200
x2
200
x2 = 2
79

2x2 = 200
The value x = −10 is disregarded
since it falls outside the domain
of our function (0 < x < ∞).
x2 = 100
x = 10
Step 5
We apply the second derivative test to our critical value,
x = 10.
P ′(x) = 2 −200x−2 (from step 4)
P ′′(x) = 400x−3 = 400
x3
P ′′(10) > 0
We do not need to know the exact value of P ′′(10). The fact
that it is positive tells us that we have a relative minimum at
x = 10. Since x = 10 is the only relative extremum, it must be
the absolute minimum. Since y = 100/x, y = 10 when x = 10.
The minimum perimeter = 2x + 2y = 40.
Note: Testing the critical number in a word problem (step 5)
may be considered to be an optional step. If you are
convinced that the problem has a solution and you ﬁnd
only one critical point, then this point must be the so-
lution to the problem. However, intuition is sometimes
misleading, and, from a mathematical perspective, the
test is one way to justify the solution.
The next example illustrates the importance of checking
the endpoints of the interval.

and/or a rectangle whose length is three times its width. De-
termine their maximum and minimum combined area.

Step 2

Step 3
Since the combined perimeter of the two ﬁgures must be
24 inches, we have
4x + 8y = 24
x + 2y = 6
It follows that x = 6 −2y.
We can also solve for y. This leads
to y = 6 −x
2
. In order to avoid
fractions, we prefer to solve for
x.
Replacing x in terms of y in step 2 gives
A(y) = (6 −2y)2 + 3y2
Recall that 4x + 8y = 24. If all of the wire is used to form the
square, y = 0. If all of the wire is used to form the rectangle,
x = 0 so 8y = 24 and y = 3. Hence
A(y) = (6 −2y)2 + 3y2
0 ≤y ≤3
81

Step 4
Using the chain rule,
A′(y) = 2(6 −2y)(−2) + 6y
= −24 + 8y + 6y
= −24 + 14y
0 = −24 + 14y

Step 5
Compute A(y) at the critical numbers and at the end-
points of the interval.

Find the dimensions of the rectangle of largest area whose
base is on the x axis and whose upper two vertices lie on the

Let (x, y) be the point on the parabola that meets the
corner of the rectangle.

Step 2
The height of the rectangle is y and the width is 2x. The
rectangle’s area is A = 2xy.
Step 3
Since the upper vertices of the rectangle lie on the para-
bola, their coordinates must satisfy the equation y = 12 −x2.
The area of the rectangle then becomes
A(x) = 2x(12 −x2)
= 24x −2x3

Step 4
A′(x) = 24 −6x2

domain of the function.
x = 2
Step 5
A(0) = 0, A(2) = 32, A(
√

If x = 2, y = 12 −x2 = 8. Since the width of the rectan-
gle is 2x, the dimensions of the rectangle are 4 × 8 and the
maximum area is 32.

Solution
Step 1

x

Step 2
The area of the window is the sum of the areas of its
rectangular bottom and its semicircular top. Since the area of
a whole circle of radius r is πr 2, a semicircle has an area of
1
2πr 2.
A = 2r x + 1
2πr 2
Step 3
The window has 4 sides, 3 straight sides and a semicircular
top. Since the circumference of a whole circle of radius r is 2πr,
the semicircular arc has length πr. Since the perimeter is 20 ft,
2x + 2r + πr = 20
x = 20 −2r −πr

We substitute into the equation obtained in step 2 and obtain
the area as a function of r.

Since the volume equation re-

six sides. The top and bottom each have an area of x2 and each
of the four sides of the box has an area of xy.

Step 5 (Optional. If you are convinced that the box must
have a maximum volume, stop here.)
V′′(x) = −3x
V′′(5) < 0
V has a relative maximum at 5. Since it is the only relative
extremum for positive x, the absolute maximum volume is
125 in3.
EXAMPLE 12
A cylindrical can is to contain 2000 in3 of liquid. What di-

It is clear, even without precise calculation, that since the crit-

this solution yields a relative minimum surface area. Being
the only relative extremum on the interval (0, ∞), S(r) has an

Since the point (x, y) lies on the line, y = 6 −3x,
d =

x2 + (6 −3x)2 −4x −6(6 −3x) + 13
98

Step 4
Differentiating this expression is a little messy due to the
presence of the radical. There is a simple trick that can be
used to make the calculation easier. Instead of minimizing d,
we minimize d2. Since the value of d2 is smallest when d is
smallest, minimizing d2 will lead to the same point that
minimizes d.
For convenience, let D = d2.
D(x) = x2 + (6 −3x)2 −4x −6(6 −3x) + 13
= x2 + 36 −36x + 9x2 −4x −36 + 18x + 13

Step 2
The distance between the ships is determined by the

z =

Step 3
Since ship B is traveling 10 mi/h, after t hours
x = 100 −10t. Similarly, y = 20t. Thus
z =

(100 −10t)2 + (20t)2


10,000 −2000t + 100t2 + 400t2
=

500t2 −2000t + 10,000
Step 4
Because of the radical, it is more convenient to minimize
z2 rather than z. The value of t that minimizes z2 is the same
value that minimizes z.
Let F (t) = 500t2 −2000t + 10,000
F ′(t) = 1000t −2000
0 = 1000t −2000
t = 2
Intuitively it is obvious that there is some point in time when
the ships are closest. Since t = 2 is the only critical number,
the ships must be closest at 2:00 and the minimum distance
between them is z =

500(2)2 −2000(2) + 10,000 =

5 miles. We can use the second derivative test to conﬁrm
this mathematically.

Since F ′′(t) = 1000 > 0, t = 2 yields a relative minimum.
Since it is the only relative extremum, it is the absolute
minimum.

Substituting this expression into the area equation, we obtain
A(x) = x(500 −2x)
= 500x −2x 2
Since x cannot be negative, x ≥0. Since y cannot be negative,
x ≤250. (Remember, y = 500 −2x.) The domain of A(x) is the
interval 0 ≤x ≤250.
Next we determine the critical values of the function A(x).
A ′(x) = 500 −4x
0 = 500 −4x
4x = 500
x = 125 ft
106

The maximum area occurs either at the critical value or at an
endpoint of the interval. Since A(0) = 0 and A(250) = 0, the
maximum area occurs when x = 125. The corresponding value of y
is 500 −2x = 500 −250 = 250 ft. The maximum area
A max = xy = 125 × 250 = 31,250 ft2
2.
Let x and y represent the width and length, respectively, of the
enclosure. We will let the interior sections of fence run parallel to
the width. (The problem can also be solved by letting the interior
pieces run parallel to the length.)

The area of the enclosure is still the product of its length and width.
A = xy
The 800 ft of fencing is to be divided into six pieces, 4 of length x,
and 2 of length y.
4x + 2y = 800
2y = 800 −4x
y = 400 −2x
Replacing y by 400 −2x in the area equation, A = xy, we obtain
the area function
If x > 200, y < 0.
A(x) = x(400 −2x)
= 400x −2x 2
0 ≤x ≤200
The critical values of A(x) are determined by solving A ′(x) = 0.
A ′(x) = 400 −4x
0 = 400 −4x
4x = 400
x = 100 ft
107

Since A(x) is zero at each endpoint of the interval [0, 200],
the absolute maximum area occurs at x = 100. The corresponding
value of y is 400 −2x = 400 −200 = 200 ft. The maximum area
xy = 20,000 ft2.

Label the legs of the triangle x and y and the hypotenuse z.

The area of the right triangle is A = 1

relationships between x, y, and z: x + y + z = 20 and
z =

x 2 + y 2. These may be combined to eliminate z.
x + y +

x 2 + y 2 = 20
We begin by simplifying this equation. To solve for y, we rewrite the
equation leaving only the radical on one side.

x 2 + y 2 = 20 −(x + y)
To eliminate the radical, square both sides of the equation. Then
simplify.
x 2 + y 2 = 400 −40(x + y) + (x + y)2
x 2 + y 2 = 400 −40x −40y + x 2 + 2xy + y 2
0 = 400 −40x −40y + 2xy
To solve for y in terms of x, we bring all terms involving y to the
left side of the equation. Terms not involving y remain on the
right.
108

40y −2xy = 400 −40x
20y −xy = 200 −20x
Finally we factor y from each term on the left and divide by its
coefﬁcient.
(20 −x)y = 200 −20x
y = 200 −20x
20 −x
The smallest allowable value of x, leading to a degenerate triangle, is
x = 0; the largest value occurs when y = 0. Since
x + y +

x 2 + y 2 = 20, when y = 0, 2x = 20 or x = 10. Hence
0 ≤x ≤10.

The volume of the box is V = l wh where l = 12 −2x,

V (x) = (12 −2x)2x
= (144 −48x + 4x 2)x
= 144x −48x 2 + 4x 3
Since the size of the cutout cannot be negative and cannot exceed
6 inches (otherwise we would cut away more than we have),
0 ≤x ≤6. We next compute the critical values.
V ′(x) = 144 −96x + 12x 2

0 = 12 −8x + x 2

x = 2
If x = 0 or x = 6, V (x) = 0. The maximum volume occurs,
therefore, when x = 2. The length and width of the box are each

V = x 2y. The postal restrictions say that 4x + y cannot exceed
108 inches. For maximum volume we take 4x + y = 108.
Equivalently, y = 108 −4x and 0 ≤x ≤27. (If x > 27, y < 0.)
V (x) = x 2(108 −4x)

0 = 216x −12x 2
0 = 12x(18 −x)
The critical values are x = 0 and x = 18. Since the endpoints of the
interval, x = 0 and x = 27, both yield a volume of 0, the maximum
volume occurs when x = 18 and its value is
Vmax = V (18) = 182(108 −4 · 18) = 324 · 36 = 11,664 in3

Clearly x cannot be negative, and x

It is clear that P ′′(30) > 0, so we have a relative minimum at

The amount of material needed to construct the box is the sum of

box is a rectangle x by 2x, its area is 2x 2. The front and back each
have areas of 2xy and each side, left and right, has an area of xy.
The total area is then
A = 2x 2 + 2xy + 2xy + xy + xy

Since the volume (l × w × h) is 972 cm3,
(2x)(x)(y) = 972

dimensions for minimum surface area are 9 cm, 18 cm, and 6 cm.
We conﬁrm that this yields a minimum area (optional):
A ′′(x) = 4 + 5832x −3 = 4 + 5832

Since x = 9 is a positive number, A ′′(9) > 0, and this value

The material used in the construction of the can consists of three

used in the construction of the top or bottom is (2r )2. (We must
consider the wasted material as well as the material used for the
circular end.)
Hence
A = 2πr h + (2r )2 + (2r )2
= 2πr h + 8r 2

P (x, y)
Let (x, y) represent the point P in the ﬁrst quadrant where the
rectangle meets the ellipse. Then the dimensions of the rectangle
are 2x by 2y so its area A = 4xy. Since P lies on the ellipse, its
coordinates must satisfy the equation of the ellipse, x 2

Rather than deal with this function directly, it is more convenient to
consider its square. We can call it F (x). The value of x that
maximizes F (x) will maximize A(x).

F (x) = [A(x)]2

Trigonometric Functions
In Chapters 3 and 4 we discussed techniques for solving re-
lated rates and maximum-minimum problems. These extend
directly to problems involving trigonometric functions. The
use of trigonometry can often simplify the solution of word
problems signiﬁcantly.
The derivatives of the trigonometric functions play an
important role in the solution of these problems.
d
dx sin x = cos x
d
dx cos x = −sin x
d
dx tan x = sec2 x
d
dx cot x = −csc2 x
d
dx sec x = sec x tan x
d
dx csc x = −csc x cot x
It is important to remember that these derivative formulas are
correct only if x is expressed in radian measure. Therefore,
any angles or rates expressed in degrees should be converted
to radians. This can be easily accomplished by remembering
that π radians is equivalent to 180◦.
The Pythagorean identities are useful in simplifying
trigonometric expressions:
sin2 x + cos2 x = 1
tan2 x + 1 = sec2 x
cot2 x + 1 = csc2 x

Exponential Functions
If b is positive and x is real, the function f (x) = b x is called
an exponential function. If the base of the exponential is
e ≈2.71828, the function is known as the natural exponential
function. Its inverse is the natural logarithm function, usually
represented as ln x.
Listed below are some of the basic properties of the nat-
ural exponential and logarithm functions.
y = e x if and only if x = ln y
e0 = 1
ln 1 = 0
e1 = e
ln e = 1
e x+y = e xe y
ln xy = ln x + ln y
e x−y = e x

ln x
y = ln x −ln y
(e x) y = e xy
ln x y = y ln x
It is also useful to remember that as direct consequences of
the above properties, ln 1

x. Because
e x and ln x are inverse functions eln x = x and ln(e x) = x.
The graphs of the exponential functions e x and e −x
are shown below for reference. These functions play a

Exponential-Growth and Decay
If a substance grows or decays at a rate proportional to its size,
its growth may be described by the equation
dy
dt = ky
where y is the amount of the substance and k is the constant
of proportionality. Positive values of k correspond to growth
and negative values correspond to decay.
To solve for y, we rewrite the equation in the form
1
y
dy
dt = k
from which it follows by the chain rule that
d
dt ln y = k
Antidifferentiating, we get
ln y = kt + C
If y = y0 when t = 0, it follows that ln y0 = C and we may write
151

ln y = kt + ln y0
ln y −ln y0 = kt
ln y
y0
= kt
y
y0
= e kt
y = y0e kt
If the value of y0 is known and the value of k can be deter-
mined, we can represent the amount of the substance as a
function of time.
EXAMPLE 1
A bacteria culture has an initial population of 500. After
4
hours the population has grown to 1000. Assuming the
culture grows at a rate proportional to the size of the popula-
tion, ﬁnd a function representing the population size after t
hours and determine the size of the population after 6 hours.
Solution
Let y(t) represent the size of the bacteria population after
t hours. Since the rate of growth of the population is pro-
portional to the population size, it follows from the above
discussion that
y(t) = y0e kt
y(t) = 500e kt
Since y(4) = 1000, it follows that
Recall that y = ln x ⇔x = ey
1000 = 500e4 k
2 = e4 k
4k = ln 2
k = 1

Thus
y(t) = 500e( 1

= 500(2)

To determine the population size after 6 hours (t = 6), we com-
pute y(6) = 500(2)1.5 ≈1414.
Exponential decay occurs when a substance deteriorates
with time. If the rate of decay is proportional to the amount
of substance present, its mass satisﬁes the equation
dy
dt = −ky
In this equation, k is a positive constant. The minus sign pre-
ceding it indicates that the rate of change is negative, i.e., the
mass is decreasing. Solving this equation in the manner de-
scribed above, we are led to the solution
y = y0e −kt .
EXAMPLE 2
A radioactive substance has a mass of 100 mg. After 10 years
it has decayed to a mass of 75 mg. What will the mass of the
substance be after another 10 years?
Solution
Let y(t) represent the mass of the substance after t years.
We know y(0) = 100 and y(10) = 75. We wish to determine
the value of y(20).
y(t) = y0e−kt
y(t) = 100e−kt
First we need to determine k. This can be done by substituting
t = 10.
153

y(10) = 100e−10 k
75 = 100e−10 k

The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it
takes for the substance to decay to half its original mass. If
y(t) = y0e−kt, the half-life is the value of t for which y(t) = 1
2 y0.
The value of y0 is irrelevant
for this calculation.

We shall represent the half-life of a substance by the letter
T: T = ln 2
k . If the half-life is known, the value of k = ln 2
T .
The next example illustrates how knowledge of the half-life of
a substance can help us solve exponential decay problems.
EXAMPLE 3
The half-life of 14C (carbon-14) is 5730 years. How long will it
take a 100-mg sample of 14C to decay to 90 mg?
Solution
y(t) = y0e−kt
k = ln 2
T
= ln 2
5730
Although k may be approximated by 0.000121, such approx-
imations often lead to error. We prefer the exact value. Using
this value of k, we proceed to solve the problem.
y(t) = y0e−kt
y(t) = 100e

It will take approximately 871 years to decay to 90 mg.
14C, a radioactive isotope of carbon, as well as 12C, a stable
isotope, are both found in the atmosphere. Plants, which ab-
sorb carbon dioxide from the air, have the same ratio of 14C to
12C as the atmosphere. The same is true for animals that eat
plants.
When a plant or an animal dies, it no longer absorbs car-
bon dioxide. Its 14C decays but its 12C does not. By measuring
the ratio of 14C to 12C, scientists can approximate the age of
a fossil by comparing this number to the known ratio of 14C
to 12C in the atmosphere today. (The assumption is made that
this ratio has not changed throughout the years.)
This ratio decreases exponentially and has the same
half-life as 14C, which is 5730 years.
EXAMPLE 4
How old is a fossil whose
14C
12C ratio is 10 percent of that found
in the atmosphere today?
Solution
Let r(t) represent the ratio of 14C to 12C present after
t years. Since r(t) decreases exponentially,
r(t) = r0e−kt

Continuous Compounding of Interest
If P dollars are invested in a bank account at an annual rate of
interest r compounded n times per year, the amount of money
A in the account after t years is
A = P

Quarterly compounding, monthly compounding, and daily
compounding use values of n = 4, 12, and 365, respectively.
(Some banks use a 360-day business year, but there is virtually
no difference in the interest between 360 and 365 days.)
If we let n →∞, we get what is called continuous com-
pounding of interest, and the amount of money in the account
after t years becomes

EXAMPLE 6
How long will it take money to double if it is compounded
continuously at an annual rate of 5 percent?
Solution
The amount of money we start with is irrelevant. The
important thing is that we end up with twice as much as we
started with. If we start with P dollars, we must end up with
2P dollars.

ing 8 percent annual interest compounded continuously if she

Solution
The equation A = Pe rt is equivalent to P = A
e rt = Ae−rt.
P = Ae−rt

Additional Exponential Models
Exponential functions are prevalent in many problems in
science, business, economics, medicine, and sociology. One
important function, the logistic function, is often used to ana-
lyze population growth that is limited by natural environ-
mental factors. The logistic function is also used to analyze
the spread of epidemics and the propagation of rumors.
The general form of the logistic function is
P(t) =
B
1 + Ae−Bkt where A, B, and k are usually determined
experimentally. Once these values are found, the logistic func-
tion can answer many questions concerning growth.

Let y(t) represent the size of the population after t hours. Since the
rate of growth of the bacteria is proportional to the number of
bacteria present, dy
dt = ky and it follows that y = y0ekt. When
t = 0, y0 = 100 and the population function becomes
y(t) = 100ekt. Since the population doubles every 2 hours, y = 200

Problems Involving Integrals
Area Problems
If y = f (x) is nonnegative between a and b, the area of the region
bounded by its graph and the x axis between the vertical lines
x = a and x = b is the value of the deﬁnite integral
A =
 b
a
f (x) dx
A simple mnemonic device for remembering this formula is
to think of a rectangle, inﬁnitesimally thin, whose height
is y = f (x) and whose width is dx. The area of this imagi-
nary rectangle would be y dx. If we “add up” all such rect-
angular areas between a and b by integrating, we obtain
A =

The diagram shows the function y = x3 −3x2 + 2x + 1 drawn
with about 20 “imaginary” vertical rectangles of height y and
thickness dx. If we imagine an inﬁnite number of such rectan-
gles extending from x = 0 to x = 2, each inﬁnitesimally thin,
the rectangles will “color in” the required area. Since integra-
tion is a summation process,

In Example 1 we were given the interval of integration. Often
this interval is determined by the x intercepts of the graph.
These intercepts can be found by setting f (x) = 0 and solving
for x. (It is always advisable to sketch a graph of the region
whose area is to be found.)

function y = 4x −x2 −3.

(x −1)(x −3) = 0

If f (x) is negative over all or part of [a, b], the integral
 b

f (x) dx will not give the desired area; the area must be de-
termined by computing
 b

| f (x)| dx. Since the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus cannot be conveniently applied to a
function involving an absolute value, one must ﬁrst deter-
mine where the graph crosses the x axis, break up the interval
into subintervals determined by these points, integrate sepa-
rately in each subinterval, and add the absolute values of the
integrals. The next example illustrates this procedure.
EXAMPLE 3

x axis, and the vertical lines x = 0 and x = 4.

To determine the area bounded by two curves, y = f (x)
and y = g(x), we must ﬁrst determine their points of intersec-
tion. This may be done by solving the equation f (x) = g(x). If
the curves intersect at only two locations, say x = a and x = b,
and f (x) lies above g(x), i.e., f (x) ≥g(x) for x ε [a, b], the area
will be
A =
 b
a
[ f (x) −g(x)] dx
179

If the curves intersect at more than two locations, the area
must be computed by subdividing the interval, integrating
separately in each subinterval, and adding the absolute values
of the integrals, in a manner similar to Example 3.
To extend our mnemonic device to areas bounded by two
curves, consider an inﬁnitesimally thin rectangle of width dx
extending from y1 = g(x) to y2 = f (x). Its height is y2 −y1
and its area is (y2 −y1)dx. The area of the region, obtained
by integrating (adding), becomes

EXAMPLE 4
Determine the area of the region bounded by the parabola
y = 9 −x2 and the line x + y = 7.
Solution
The parabola is represented by the function
y2 = f (x) = 9 −x2. To determine g(x) we solve the line’s equa-
tion for y:
x + y = 7
y = 7 −x
y1 = g(x) = 7 −x
We will need the points of intersection of these two curves.
This is accomplished by solving the equation f (x) = g(x) for x.

Occasionally, it is more convenient to compute an area by
evaluating an integral with respect to y rather than with res-
pect to x. If the region is described as the intersection of the
graphs x = f (y) and x = g(y), the area may be represented as
an integral whose variable of integration is y.
A =
 b
a
[ f (y) −g(y)] dy
It is assumed that a and b are the y coordinates of the points
of intersection of the two graphs and f (y) ≥g(y) for y ε [a, b].
In this type of problem our imaginary rectangles lie paral-
lel to the x axis and extend, left to right, from x1 = g(y) to
x2 = f (y).

The equation y = x −2 is equivalent to x = y + 2. Since the
line lies to the right of the parabola within the region un-
der consideration, we let f (y) = y + 2 and g(y) = y2. (This
guarantees that f (y) −g(y) is nonnegative.) Their intersec-
tion points are computed by solving the equation g(y) = f (y)
for y.

Volumes of Solids of Revolution
If the region bounded by the function y = f (x) and the x
axis, between x = a and x = b is revolved about the x axis, the
resulting three-dimensional ﬁgure is known as a solid of revo-
lution. Its cross-sectional area is circular, and its volume may
be computed by evaluating the integral
V = π
 b
a
[ f (x)]2 dx
or
V = π
 b
a
y2 dx
A mnemonic device for remembering this formula is to think
of the solid being “sliced” into inﬁnitesimally thin disks of
radius y and thickness dx. The volume of a typical disk is
π(radius)2(thickness) = πy2 dx and the sum of the volumes is
π
 b
a
y2 dx. (Since π is a constant, it may be taken outside the
integral.) This method is sometimes known as the disk method.

If the region bounded by two curves is revolved about the
x axis, the resulting solid of revolution will be hollow. Its cross
section will be in the shape of a washer, i.e., the area between
two concentric circles. The following method of computing
volume is named the washer method.

Another method for computing volumes of solids of revolu-

ing an integral representing volume. Consider a thin-wall
cylindrical shell having inner and outer radii r1 and r2, re-
spectively, where r1 ≈r2, and height h. (Imagine a soup can
with its top and bottom cut out. The thickness of the wall of
the can is r2 −r1.)

If we let rav = r2 + r1

represent the average radius and
△r = r2 −r1 represent the shell wall thickness, we may write
Vshell = 2πrav h△r
As △r →0, and the number of shells within the solid →∞,
the sum of their volumes will approach the volume of the solid
of revolution.
As a mnemonic device we may represent the average ra-
dius by r, the length of the shell by h, and the (inﬁnitesimal)

In a given problem, dr will be replaced by either dx or dy, de-
pending upon the axis of rotation (dx if rotated about the
y axis and dy if rotated about the x axis). In either case,
the height h and the radius r must be expressed in terms of
the variable of integration. The limits of integration must cor-
respond to the variable of integration as well.

If (x, y) represents an arbitrary point on the graph y = x2, the
length of the generated shell is h = 2 −x, the radius r = y, and
the thickness of the shell is dy. The volume of a typical shell
is 2πy(2 −x) dy and the total volume of the solid is obtained
by integration. Since the volume of the shell involves dy, in-
tegration will be with respect to y. Since y = x2, y = 0 when
x = 0 and y = 4 when x = 2. Therefore,

The length of each shell h = x2 −x1 and the radius r = y. The

Let y1 = x 2 −1 and y2 = x 4 −x 2. We determine the intersection
points of the two graphs by setting y2 = y1 and solving the resulting
equation.
x 4 −x 2 = x 2 −1
x 4 −2x 2 + 1 = 0
(x 2 −1)2 = 0
x 2 −1 = 0
x = ±1
Using vertical rectangles “coloring in” the region from −1 to 1,
the height of each rectangle is y2 −y1 and the width is dx. The area
is computed by integration. For convenience, we take advantage
of symmetry, integrating from 0 to 1 and doubling the value of the
integral. (Note that even though both curves fall below the x axis,
197

y2 −y1 is still positive throughout the region since y1 is more negative
than y2. This guarantees that the integral will represent the area.)

Let f (x) = x 2. The slope of the tangent line at (2, 4) is m = f ′(2).
f (x) = x 2
f ′(x) = 2x
f ′(2) = 4
The equation of the tangent line can be constructed using the
standard equation for a line:
y −y1 = m(x −x1)
y −4 = 4(x −2)
y −4 = 4x −8
y = 4x −4
Once we sketch the curve and the tangent line, it becomes clear
that horizontal rectangles are best to use.

Application to Business
and Economics
Rates of Change in Business
Many quantities in the business world are constantly chang-
ing. For example, your salary may increase if you stay with
the same company for many years or your debt may decrease
if you pay back your student loan.
It is useful to know how fast a quantity is changing.
After all, an employee whose salary changes by $10,000 over a
2-year time period is doing better than an employee whose
salary changes by the same amount over 5 years.
The derivative with respect to time measures how fast a
function is changing. This is known as the instantaneous rate
of change with respect to time. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion
of rates of change.)
EXAMPLE 1
t years after it was built, the property tax T on a small home
was T(t) = 15t2 + 35t + 2500 dollars. How fast did the pro-
perty tax increase 2 years after the home was built?
Solution
T ′(t) = 30t + 35
T ′(2) = 95
The tax increased at the rate of $95 per year.
205

EXAMPLE 2
A publisher estimates that t months after he introduces a new
magazine, the circulation will be
C(t) = 150t2 + 400t + 7000 copies. If this prediction is correct,
how fast will circulation increase 6 months after the magazine
is introduced?
Solution
C′(t) = 300t + 400
C′(6) = 300(6) + 400 = 2200 copies per month
Sometimes it is useful to understand how a quantity’s
change is related to variables other than time. For example, a
manufacturer’s proﬁt may change with the number of items
produced and sold or his production cost may change with
the availability of raw materials. In general, the derivative
y ′(x) or dy/dx measures the rate of change of the variable y
with respect to x.
EXAMPLE 3
The demand q for a certain commodity expressed as a function
of its selling price p is q(p) = 200p −100p2 + 5000 units. At
what rate is q changing with respect to p when the selling
price is $5? Is demand increasing or decreasing at this price?
Solution
q′(p) = 200 −200p
q′(5) = −800
The rate of change when p = 5 is −800 units per dollar. Since
this number is negative, demand is decreasing.
EXAMPLE 4
A computer manufacturer’s total cost in dollars when q units
are produced is given by the function
C(q) = 500q + 5000e−q/10. At what rate is his cost changing
when 20 units are produced?
206

Solution
C′(q) = 500 −500e−
q
10
C′(20) = 500 −500e−2
= 500 −67.67
= 432.33
His cost is increasing at the rate of $432.33 per unit.
Marginal Analysis in Economics
In economics, the marginal cost (MC) of producing an item is
the rate at which its cost changes with respect to the number of
items produced. Thus if C(x) is the cost of producing x items,
the marginal cost is C′(x). Similarly, if R(x) and P(x) represent
the revenue and proﬁt, respectively, in selling a quantity of x
units, then R′(x) represents marginal revenue (MR) and P ′(x)
marginal proﬁt (MP).
EXAMPLE 5
It costs 0.05x2 + 6x + 100 dollars to produce x pounds of
soap. Because of quantity discounts, each pound sells for
12 −0.15x dollars. Compute the marginal cost, marginal
revenue, and marginal proﬁt when x = 10.
Solution
C(x) = 0.05x2 + 6x + 100
MC(x) = C′(x) = 0.1x + 6
MC(10) = $7.00
R(x) = (price per pound)(number of pounds sold)
= (12 −0.15x)(x)
= 12x −0.15x2
MR(x) = R′(x) = 12 −0.3x
MR(10) = $9.00
207

Since P(x) = R(x) −C(x),
MP(x) = MR(x) −MC(x)
MP(10) = MR(10) −MC(10)
= 9.00 −7.00
= $2.00
By deﬁnition of the derivative of C(x),
MC(x) = C′(x)
= lim
h→0
C(x + h) −C(x)
h
≈C(x + h) −C(x)
h
if h is small in comparison to x.
If h = 1
MC(x) ≈C(x + 1) −C(x)
Thus the marginal cost approximates the additional cost in-
curred in producing one additional item. Similarly,
MR(x) ≈R(x + 1) −R(x)
and
MP(x) ≈P(x + 1) −P(x)
EXAMPLE 6
The cost of manufacturing x baseballs is
C(x) = 0.05x2 + 0.5x + 50. How much will it cost to produce
the 101st baseball? Find the exact value and compare with the
approximate value using marginal cost.
208

Solution
Exact solution
The cost of producing 101 baseballs is
C(101) = 0.05(101)2 + 0.5(101) + 50 = $610.55
The cost of producing 100 baseballs is
C(100) = 0.05(100)2 + 0.5(100) + 50 = $600.00
The cost of producing the 101st baseball is
C(101) −C(100) = 610.55 −600.00 = $10.55
Approximation using marginal cost
MC(x) = C′(x) = 0.1x + 0.5
MC(100) = C′(100) = 0.1(100) + 0.5 = $10.50
The derivative offers an excellent approximation.
EXAMPLE 7
A manufacturer estimates that the cost of producing x units of
a product is C(x) = 0.1x2 + 3x + 100 dollars and that he will
be able to sell x units when the price is
p(x) = 25 −0.05x dollars per unit.
(a) Determine the marginal cost function and use it to ap-
proximate the cost of producing the 21st unit. Compare
this with the actual cost.
(b) Determine the marginal revenue function for this product.
Use it to approximate the additional revenue from the sale
of the 21st unit and compare with the actual value.
Solution
(a)
MC(x) = C′(x) = 0.2x + 3
MC(20) = $7.00
209

The actual cost of producing the 21st unit =
C(21) −C(20) = $207.10 −$200.00 = $7.10.
(b) Since x units will be sold when the price is p(x) dollars,
R(x) = xp(x)
= x(25 −0.05x)
= 25x −0.05x2
R′(x) = 25 −0.1x
R′(20) = $23.00
The actual revenue derived from the 21st unit =
R(21) −R(20) = $502.95 −$480.00 = $22.95.
Related Rates
As we saw in Chapter 3, the rate at which one quantity changes
is often related to the rate of change of other quantities. The
following steps outline the procedure for solving a related rates
business problem.
Step 1
Label all variables with an appropriate symbol. (In busi-
ness problems, diagrams are often inappropriate. However,
all variables should be clearly labeled for reference.)
Step 2
Determine which rates are given and which rate you
need to ﬁnd. Write them down for future reference.
Step 3
Determine an equation (or several equations) relating
the variables deﬁned in step 1.
Step 4
Differentiate the equation(s) in step 3 with respect to
time.
210

Step 5
Substitute all given information into the result of step
4 and solve for the unknown rate. Insert appropriate
units.

EXAMPLE 9
The wholesale price p of string beans, in dollars per bushel,
and the daily supply x, in thousands of bushels, are related by
the equation
px + 6x + 7p = 5950
If the supply is decreasing at the rate of 2000 bushels per day,
at what rate is the daily bushel price changing when 100,000
bushels are available? Is the price increasing or decreasing?
Solution
Step 1
x = supply of string beans (thousands of bushels)
p = price per bushel (dollars)
Step 2
Given: dx
dt = −2
dx/dt is negative, since
supply is decreasing.
Find: dp
dt when x = 100
Step 3
px + 6x + 7p = 5950
Step 4
←We use the product rule to
ﬁnd the derivative of px.
pdx
dt + xdp
dt + 6dx
dt + 7dp
dt = 0
Step 5
We know the values of x and dx/dt and we are look-
ing for dp/dt. To ﬁnd p when x = 100 we go back to the
212

original equation.
px + 6x + 7p = 5950
100p + 600 + 7p = 5950
107p = 5350
p = 50
Now we can solve for dp/dt:
50(−2) + 100dp
dt + 6(−2) + 7dp
dt = 0
107dp
dt −112 = 0
dp
dt = 112
107 ≈1.0467
The price is increasing by approximately $1.05 per bushel per
day.
EXAMPLE 10
The demand x for milk (quarts), selling for p dollars per
quart at a supermarket is determined by the equation
px + 1200p −6000 = 0. If the price is increasing at the rate
of 3 cents per week, at what rate is demand changing when
the price is $1.25 per quart?
Solution
Step 1
x = demand for milk (quarts)
p = price per quart (in dollars)
Step 2
Given: dp
dt = 0.03
Find: dx
dt when p = 1.25
Step 3
px + 1200p −6000 = 0
213

Step 4
pdx
dt + xdp
dt + 1200dp
dt = 0
Step 5
When p = 1.25, we get, from step 3,
1.25x + 1200(1.25) −6000 = 0
1.25x + 1500 −6000 = 0
1.25x = 4500
x = 3600
From step 4,
1.25dx
dt + 3600(0.03) + 1200(0.03) = 0

dt + 108 + 36 = 0

dt = −115.2
The demand for milk decreases at the rate of 115.2 quarts
per week.
Optimization
Optimization problems are very important in business.
Whether we are trying to maximize our proﬁt or minimize our
cost, knowing how to determine optimal values is extremely
useful.
The procedures illustrated in Chapter 4 for ﬁnding the
maximum or minimum value of a function extend in a very
natural way to business problems. We list the main steps for
review.
214

Step 1
Draw a diagram (if appropriate). Label all quantities,
known and unknown, which will be used in the problem.
Step 2
Write an equation representing the quantity to be max-
imized or minimized.
Step 3
Use any constraints or relationships between the vari-
ables to eliminate all but one independent variable. This
gives a function representing the quantity to be maximized
or minimized.
Step 4
Find all critical numbers. A critical number for f is a
number x for which either f ′(x) = 0 or f ′(x) does not exist.
(In business problems it is extremely rare that f ′(x) will fail
to exist.)
Step 5
(optional) Use an appropriate test to conﬁrm your abso-
lute maximum or minimum value (closed interval method,
ﬁrst or second derivative tests—see Chapter 4). This step
may be omitted if you obtain only one critical number
and you are conﬁdent that the problem has a solution.
EXAMPLE 11
The wholesale price of a designer shirt is $25. A retail store
has determined that if they sell the shirt for $40, consumers
will purchase 55 shirts per month. The manager of the men’s
department knows that for each dollar decrease in price, 5
more shirts will be sold each month. What selling price will
yield the greatest monthly proﬁt for the store?
Solution
Step 1
In this type of problem it is convenient to let x represent
the decrease in the price per shirt. The selling price is thus
40 −x dollars.
215

Step 2
The total proﬁt to the store is
P(x) = (proﬁt per shirt) × (number of shirts sold).
Step 3
Since the cost of the shirt is $25, the store’s proﬁt per
shirt is (40 −x) −25 = 15 −x. The number of shirts sold at
this price is 55 + 5x since 5 more shirts are sold for each dollar
decrease in price.
P(x) = (15 −x)(55 + 5x)
= 825 + 20x −5x2
Step 4
P ′(x) = 20 −10x
0 = 20 −10x
10x = 20
x = 2
Step 5
(optional) P ′′(x) = −10 for all x. Since the second deriva-
tive is negative, the critical number represents a relative maxi-
mum. Since there is only one relative extremum, the absolute
maximum proﬁt occurs when x = 2.
The optimal selling price is $40 −$2 = $38.
Inventory Control
When a company orders spare parts or raw materials, two spe-
ciﬁc costs are incurred.
(a) The company must pay an ordering fee to cover handling
and transportation costs.
(b) The company must pay a storage fee to cover the cost of
keeping the items on hand until needed. These costs are
known as storage or holding costs.
If each shipment is large, fewer shipments will be needed and
consequently the ordering fees will be small. However, hold-
ing costs will be higher. If many small shipments are made,
216

holding costs will be small, but the total ordering fees will be
large. We will use calculus to determine the lot size x of each
shipment that minimizes the total cost.
The cost incurred is C(x) = H(x) + O(x), where H(x)
represents the total holding cost and O(x) is the total ordering
cost.
Assuming that the demand for the product is uniform
throughout the year, the average yearly holding cost to store
a lot of size x is the same as if x/2 items were stored for the
entire year. Therefore
H(x) = (annual storage cost per item)
x
2

If q items are ordered in lots of size x, then the total number
of shipments necessary will be q/x. Consequently,
O(x) = (cost per order)(number of orders)
= (cost per order)
q
x

The total cost is then
C(x) = H(x) + O(x)
= (annual storage cost per item)
x
2

+ (cost per order)
q


Once the function C(x) is constructed we apply maximum-
minimum theory to determine the value of x that minimizes
total cost.
EXAMPLE 12
A home improvement company expects to sell 180 kitchen
sinks during the year. There is a $60 ordering fee for each ship-
ment of sinks and it costs $6 to hold a sink for a year. How
many sinks should the company order in each shipment to
minimize total cost?
217

Solution
Let x = number of sinks ordered in each shipment.
C(x) = H(x) + O(x)
= 6

x = 60
Since C′′(x) = 21,600x−3 = 21,600
x3
, it is clear that C′′(60) > 0.
Hence x = 60 corresponds to a relative minimum and, since it
is the only relative extremum for positive x, it represents the
absolute minimum. (This is typical for inventory problems
and this analysis may be omitted, if desired.)
Conclusion: The company should order sinks in lots of
60 to minimize total cost.
Note: You may have noticed that the actual cost of the sinks
was not considered in the previous example. The cost
is the same no matter what each lot size is and has
no bearing on the solution. Mathematically this cost,
obtained by multiplying the cost of each sink by 180,
is constant and will be zero when differentiated. This is
typical for inventory control problems.
EXAMPLE 13
A tire dealer buys 4000 tires a year from a local distributor.
Each tire costs $75, the ordering fee is $30 per shipment, and
218

the storage cost is $24 per tire per year. How many tires should
be ordered in each shipment in order to minimize the total
cost?
Solution
Let x = size of each shipment. In this problem
C(x) = H(x) + O(x). The price per tire ($75) has no bearing on
the solution (see note above). Assuming that the demand for
the product is uniform throughout the year, it follows that
C(x) = 24

40 shipments of 100 tires each.

Solutions to Supplementary Problems
1.
In this problem x represents the company’s advertising investment
(thousands of dollars) and D represents the demand for the
company’s product (thousands of items). The rate at which demand
is changing with respect to advertising dollars is D ′(x).
D(x) = 2000x 2 + 900x + 60
D ′(x) = 4000x + 900
D ′(1.5) = 4000(1.5) + 900
= 6900
x = 1.5 corresponds to $1500
Demand increases at the rate of 6900 items per $1000 spent on
advertising.

(b) R(51) = 300(51) + 0.075(51)2

R′(x) = 300 + 0.15x
R(50) = 300(50) + 0.075(50)2
= 15,187.50
R′(50) = 300 + 0.15(50)
R(51) −R(50) = $307.58

Let R(x), C (x), and P(x) represent the revenue, cost, and proﬁt,
respectively, in producing x items. Then P (x) = R(x) −C (x)
R(x) = (price per unit sold)(number of units sold)
= (500 −2x)x
= 500x −2x 2
P (x) = R(x) −C (x)
= 500x −2x 2 −(50x + 400)
= 450x −2x 2 −400
P ′(x) = 450 −4x
P ′(99) = $54
222

If x bears are sold at $28 each, the revenue derived from the sale is
28x. We determine the proﬁt function by subtracting cost from
revenue.
P (x) = R(x) −C (x)
= 28x −(x 3 −6x 2 + 13x + 15)
= 15x −x 3 + 6x 2 −15
We proceed to ﬁnd the critical value(s).
P ′(x) = 15 −3x 2 + 12x
0 = 15 −3x 2 + 12x
0 = 5 −x 2 + 4x
x 2 −4x −5 = 0
(x −5)(x + 1) = 0
x −5 = 0, x + 1 = 0
x = 5
x = −1
(x = −1 is discarded.)
The maximum daily proﬁt is P (5) = $85.
(optional) To conﬁrm that this is the number of teddy bears
that maximizes proﬁt, we use the second derivative test.
P ′′(x) = −6x + 12
P ′′(5) = −18
Since P ′′(5) < 0, the value x = 5 is a relative maximum. Since there
is only one relative extremum for x > 0, x = 5 corresponds to the
absolute maximum proﬁt of $85.

For convenience, we will let n represent the number of cars in units
of 1000 and t, the toll, in dollars. If x represents the number of
dimes to be charged in excess of $2.00, the toll will be
t = 2.00 + 0.10x. Since the number of cars will decrease by 10,000
for each unit increment in x, the daily number of cars using the road
will be n = 300 −10x thousand. The total revenue
R(x) = n · t
= (300 −10x)(2.00 + 0.10x)
= 600 + 10x −x 2
R′(x) = 10 −2x

The toll should be increased by 50 cents (5 × 10 cents) to $2.50.

The proﬁt function P (x) = R(x) −C (x). Since the company sells
the cameras at $60 each, R(x) = 60x. It follows that
P (x) = 60x −(40 + 4x −1.6x 2 + 0.1x 3)
= 60x −40 −4x + 1.6x 2 −0.1x 3
= 56x −40 + 1.6x 2 −0.1x 3
0 ≤x ≤30
P ′(x) = 56 + 3.2x −0.3x 2

We reject the negative solution. Since the proﬁt function is
continuous on the closed interval [0, 30], we compare the value of
P (x) at x = 20 with its values at the interval endpoints.
P (0) = −40
P (20) = 920
P (30) = 380
The maximum proﬁt occurs when 20 cameras are sold daily.
