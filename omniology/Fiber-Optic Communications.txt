Foreword 
 
At home, the quadruple play: digital television, radio, high speed Internet, 
landline and cell phones … At work, multiple and diverse computer applications 
combining voice, data and images … We conduct our business as if it is completely 
natural to exchange and receive all this information, but how does this transmission 
of information happen? This is what Pierre Lecoy, author of this book, skillfully and 
clearly explains, and reminds us of all the levels of creativity, mathematical 
calculations and technical magic that had to happen in order for a simple fiber glass 
cable, the optical fiber to be able to transport digital information at speeds that today 
exceed a dozen terabits per second or 10,000 billion bits per second on a single

Pierre offers his experience in the field of fiber optics telecommunications based 
on his double expertise acquired, on the one hand, within large manufacturing 
groups and, on the other hand, as a professor instructing generations of engineers. 
The combination of these two qualities is not exceptional because engineers 
frequently teach, but in essence, it is this combination which makes this book so 
interesting, especially as Pierre illustrates the importance of developing theoretical 
knowledge based on the development of applications and concrete accomplishments. 
 
You will discover the professional competence of an industrialist as Pierre 
demonstrates a rich experience of several years in this field. He alternatively 
presents all the elements inherent to fiber-optic connections by focusing on the 
applications, their constraints and especially on choice criteria for solutions offered 
by technologies available on the market. Without going into too much detail, I will 
cite such examples as soliton propagation, micro-structured fiber optics, the 
principle of fiber bragg gratings in fibers, etc.

Pierre uses his competence as a professor and takes advantage of it by explaining 
the equations and different laws governing these fields in good company with Bessel, 
Laplace, Maxwell, Rayleigh and others (Fabry or Pérot). This is where Pierre’s 
experience comes in handy: when he describes and breaks down light propagation 
mechanisms though fibers and the different components of networks. The reader will 
thus learn or rediscover the different dispersions in an optical fiber, the calculation of 
pulse widening as well as non-linear effect processing such as Raman scattering, 
Brillouin scattering and the Kerr effect. Pierre also presents the principles controlling 
the production of fiber optics, the different types of cables, connections and associated 
measurements. In addition, he explains the different wavelength division multiplexing, 
modulation, switching technologies and so much more.  
 
This is why I strongly invite you to delve into this book, the fruit of patient 
research and compilation work of all you can find on fiber optics. I greatly 
recommend it as, even though this book is rigorously scientific, it is an easy read. 
This book is certainly very meticulous but it is also practical with concrete 
examples, making it easy to understand. 
 
 In this way, the novice reader will be able to follow each chapter, reading about 
the construction of fiber-optic connections and understand all about multimode 
fibers, single-mode fibers, the different types of cables, optical components, 
optoelectronic transmitters and receivers, optical amplification, analog and digital 
transmissions over fiber optics, the different types of optics – from local area to 
operator – with an eye on the optical future, and finally, a complete chapter is 
dedicated to fiber optics in instrumentation as well as optical fiber sensors. 
 
As for you, informed reader, the structure of this book in clearly delimited 
chapters will enable you to go directly to the heart of the subject most interesting to 
you. 
 
Lastly, Pierre puts his professor hat back on and his long teaching practice by 
proposing 35 exercises, thankfully with their answers! A bibliography and website 
addresses successfully complete this project. 
 
What more is there to say to you, dear reader, except maybe to insist on the triple 
application of fiber-optic telecommunications: at home, at work and in social 
relations. Currently at home there are over 25 million subscribers worldwide using 
fiber optics providing them with 100 Mbit/s and already in Japan, several thousand 
users can use throughputs of 1 Gbit/s enabling them to simultaneously receive 
several high definition television channels while having access to hyper-realistic 
online video. At work, high throughput digital data, combined with video telephony, 
ensure rapid circulation of large volumes of data, their storage and their query in 
relational database management systems simultaneously. As for the social aspect, 

     Foreword     xix        
much interest is based on the development of e-government, e-training, e-medicine 
and other type relations. Another significant advantage of these social evolutions 
resulting from fiber-optic telecommunications involves environmental protection by 
greatly decreasing the movement of people.  
 
That is why I thank Pierre on your behalf for this body of work that he has 
successfully achieved in order to offer you these very interesting pages. Through his 
analysis, the fruit of deep thought processes sourced from his professional and 
diversified life, Pierre has shared his knowledge in this field with us. Finally, while 
remaining prudent and realistic, this book is part of the future with the evolution of 
SDH/Sonet networks toward all optical transport networks (OTN – Optical 
Transport Network) including a new optical layer, wavelength routing and multi-
protocol label switching (MPLS) for packet transmission. As former director of 
training at Tyco Electronics and as current honorary president of Club optique, I can 
only applaud this methodology. Tomorrow is happening today.

Introduction 
Overview 
Although the first optical information transmission experiments date back to late 
in the 19th century, a way has to be found to correctly direct or guide the light 
before thinking of its application to telecommunications. The emergence of lasers, 
around 1960, led to transmission experiments in the atmosphere. However, 
propagation instability problems (mainly caused by air index variations) have led 
researchers to abandon this solution. It is now reserved for short distance 
communications (infrared remote control, indoor communications, infrared laser 
link between two buildings), even though it is now being considered again for direct 
links between satellites.  
Optical fibers are very thin angel hair type transparent glass and use the well-
known principle of fountains of light. They were used in decorative applications 
before being used in a more useful way (lighting, endoscopy, remote optical 
measures). Their application in the field of telecommunications, although considered 
by theoreticians (Charles Kao) as soon as 1966, was made possible in the 1970s 
because of the progress in silica fiber-optic production technology, allowing a very 
light attenuation and an adequate mechanical resistance. It was also enabled by the 
availability of semiconductor laser diodes, which combine laser performance with 
electronic component ease of use, in particular because of the progress of III-V 
compound semiconductors. The development of efficient cables, connectors and 
passive components, and the availability of industrial connection processes, have 
also been essential for the development of the first commercial links around 1980.  
The 1990s were significant in the development of optical amplification followed 
by wavelength division multiplexing, leading to an explosion of capabilities in 
response to new requirements caused by the growth of the Internet. The next 
revolution should be all-optical networks. Inaugurated by the emergence of the first 

xxii     Fiber-Optic Communications 
all-optical switches in 2000, they were only prototypes and this concept remains to be 
clarified, particularly with standardization of protocols.  
With approximately 100 million kilometers produced each year, and despite 
production activity fluctuations in this field which shows a strongly cyclic 
characteristic, optical fibers have become a mature technology present in 
increasingly wide application fields.  
Fiber optics advantages 
Transmission performance 
Very low attenuation, very large bandwidth, possible multiplexing (in 
wavelength) of numerous signals and users on the same fiber, provide much higher 
range (over 100 km between transmitter and receiver) and capacity (bitrates of 
several Tbit/s are possible over a single fiber) systems than with copper wires or 
radio. However, depending on the considered use, other advantages can be decisive.  
Implementation advantages 
Including the light weight, very small size, high fiber flexibility, noticeable in 
telecommunications as well as for cabling in aeronautics, information technology, 
medicine, manufacturing, home automation, etc. 
The most important practical advantage remains electrical (total insulation 
between terminals, possible use in explosive atmosphere, under high pressure, in 
medical applications) and electromagnetic safety (the fiber is not sensitive to 
parasites and does not create them either). 
Conversely, the optical power used is weak and not dangerous. We can add total 
(or almost) invulnerability: it is not possible to hear the signal on an optical fiber 
without being spotted.  
Economic advantage 
Contrary to common belief, the global fiber-optic system cost (taking its 
installation and necessary equipment into account) is, in many cases, lower than the 
cost of a copper wire system (in particular with the recent increase in the price of 
copper), and its implementation, notably concerning connections, has become much 
easier and cheaper than with the first applications.  

Introduction     xxiii 
Fields of use 
The main field of use is obviously telecommunications, but fiber optics easily 
overflow this field and work with a large number of manufacturing applications.  
Telecommunications 
The two main fields of use, related to network needs, have been urban links, with 
large capabilities and working without intermediate amplification or remote power-
feeding, and submarine links such as trans-oceanic links, or coastal links without 
repeaters (exceeding 200 km, and over 300 km with optical amplification in 
terminals). Then, stimulated by the arrival of new operators, regional, national and 
international terrestrial connections have seen a very strong growth. They are at the 
base of the ATM network infrastructure.  
In the early days of fiber optics, several experiments were carried out in the field 
of access networks for video communications and broadband service users. Direct 
fiber optics access or FTTH (fiber to the home) did not spread as expected in the 
1980s because of economic constraints and the increase of possible throughputs with 
twisted pairs (available through ADSL). Intermediate solutions were then developed 
where the fiber was relayed, at the front end, by existing cables or radio contact. 
However, the need for increasingly high throughputs has reenergized this market; 
this movement started in Japan and Sweden and has spread to now represent a large 
part of the activity for manufacturers, operators and regulation authorities.  
Data networks and links 
Even for short distances, the use of fiber optics in the information technology field 
has rapidly progressed, particularly for electric insulation and insensitivity to 
electromagnetic disruptions. Fiber optics also enable development of multi-terminal 
networks and high bitrate networks, such as Fiber Channel or 1 Gbit/s (and now up 
to 10 Gbit/s) Ethernet, were designed for fiber optics from the start. Networks now 
reach “metropolitan” sizes and work together with railway networks or electricity 
transport without technical problems.  
Industrial systems 
There are various applications (telemetry, remote controls, video monitoring, field 
bus) where fiber insensitivity to parasites and its insulating character are essential 
advantages.  

xxiv     Fiber-Optic Communications 
The massive parallelism of electronic and information technology architectures, 
the constant increase of frequencies on buses and the resulting electromagnetic 
accounting problems influence the increasing use of optical support (fibers or planar 
guides) to interconnect the different computer or embedded system cards (“optical 
backplane” concept), followed by the different chips from multiprocessor 
architecture, and even the different parts of a single chip in the future, in a SoC 
(system on chip) design.  
Instrumentation and sensors 
Fibers are more and more present in optical instrumentation, where they make it 
possible to carry out remote measurements in hard to access points. Sensors use 
fiber optics as a sensitive element and transmission support. However, their use 
remains limited, especially when material integration or total electromagnetic 
immunity is required. These applications are discussed in Chapter 11.  
Finally, optical fibers still play a role in light transportation. Traditional 
applications (lighting, visualization, endoscopy) or more recent applications (laser 
beam transportation for industry, measurement, medicine) have seen their 
performance improve, and their cost decrease, thanks to the development of fiber-
optic technologies.  
Elements of a fiber-optic transmission system 
Interfaces 
In a point-to-point link as well as in a network, we find (see Figure 1):  
– the optical transmitter interface which transforms the electric signal into optical 
signal. It mainly includes the optoelectronic transmission component, which can be a 
light-emitting diode (LED) or a laser diode (LD), components studied in Chapter 6. 
The interface also contains adaptation and protection circuits; it is connected to the 
cable by a connector or by an optical fiber pigtail that needs to be connected. 
Modulation is generally a light intensity modulation obtained by modulation of 
current going through the transmission diode or, at a very high bitrate, by an external 
modulation;  
– the optical receiver interface containing a photodiode which converts the 
received optical signal into an electric signal. It is followed by a head amplifier, 
which must be carefully designed as its noise is generally the one limiting the 
minimum optical power that can be detected, and thus the range of the system (see 

Introduction     xxv 
Chapter 7). According to the application, we then find filtering or digital reshaping 
circuits.  
 
Figure 1. Point-to-point  fiber-optic link 
Repeaters 
When the link length requires it, one or several repeaters are inserted. Ancient 
link repeaters (installed prior to 1995) contained receiving and transmission 
interfaces, linked by amplification and regeneration circuits for digital 
transmissions, leading to signal interruption. Nowadays, terrestrial and submarine 
links use erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (see Chapter 8), and are entirely optical over 
distances exceeding 10,000 km.  
Wavelength division multiplexing 
Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) enables the multiplexing of several 
signals in the same fiber-optic, even if they are from geographically different origins 
or in opposite direction. If wavelengths are close, they can be amplified by the same 
optical amplifier.  
This was first used in local area networks or user links, as well as in sensor 
networks. It now increases even already installed optical cable capabilities 
significantly. 
Dozens, and even hundreds of Gbit/s per fiber are reached in commercial links. 
Achieved in the laboratory ten years ago, the Tbit/s (1012 bit/s!) now corresponds to

long distance infrastructure requirements; the last laboratory benchmarks have 
exceeded 10 Tbit/s and the theoretical limit has not yet been reached.  
Fiber-optic networks 
All optical networks can be developed which are not simple point-to-point links 
combinations interconnected by electric nodes. Optical network nodes can be 
passive (splitters, multi-branch couplers, wavelength division multiplexers) or active 
(switches, time-division multiplexers) components using integrated optics or micro-
technologies (MEMS).  
The development of large scale optical switching is one of the major issues 
today. In fact, the speed of optical transmissions is such that the bottleneck is now 
located in the network node electronics. However, specific architectures and 
protocols for optical routing must be developed.  
Transmitted signals 
The vast majority of applications (telecommunications, information technology) 
consist of digital transmissions, with bitrates from a few kbit/s to more than 
10 Gbit/s. However, analog applications still subsist in video and telemetry fields.  
There are more particular cases, such as retransmission over fiber optics of 
carrier microwave frequencies to 30 GHz, or even modulating a laser diode. This 
technique (already used for producing active antennae, notably for radars) is 
beginning to be used in satellite telecommunications stations or for retransmission of 
microwave signals in future access networks combining fiber and radio.  
Fiberless infrared connections 
Even though this book is mainly dedicated to fiber-optic telecommunications, we 
can mention the development of infrared wave use for line-of-sight communications 
at very short distance: remote control, hi-fi accessories, mobile robotics, which are 
traditional applications, as well as wireless local area networks. While benefiting 
from the practical advantages of “wireless”, infrared can transport high throughputs 
and resolve certain disruption and confidentiality problems raised by radio links. 
They are well adapted to indoor propagation (within a building, not going outside). 
Different protocols were defined, with the most well known being IrDA for 
interfacing PCs and various peripherals to 4 Mbit/s.  

Introduction     xxvii 
Direct links between buildings with 0.8 µm laser beams have recently been 
developed, used as microwave point-to-point beams. These free space optics (FSO) 
systems avoid the cost and delay of cabling. These beams are very directional 
because of a telescope system (lens), and work at low power (a few mW), but can be 
interrupted by strong fog. Very high (2.5 Gbit/s or more) bitrates can be transported 
over a few kilometers with no obstacles, interferences or a need for a license, 
contrary to radio. Important development in these systems is expected.  
There are also link projects between satellites by laser beams in spatial vacuum 
over thousands of kilometers, obviously requiring great precision in the orientation 
of transmitters.

1.1. Overview of optics 
1.1.1. Introduction 
We can begin studying light propagation in optical fibers and guides by light ray 
propagation in the sense of traditional geometric optics.  
However, this hypothesis is only valid if the guide’s transverse dimensions are 
much larger than the wavelength λ. The optical fiber is then considered multimode, 
which means that for a given wavelength, several light rays can propagate. 
Transmission performances are not optimal, but this type of fiber has a certain 
economic advantage compared to single-mode fibers, which have a much smaller 
core.  
1.1.2. Propagation of harmonic plane waves 
As we know, a ray is not a real model because the light cannot remain 
concentrated on a very small line because of diffraction. It can, however, be 
approached using the plane wave model, which is a harmonic wave propagating 
without divergence in the z direction (see Figure 1.1):  
Ex = E0 exp j(ωt − kz),Ey = Ez = 0 and Hy = H0 exp j(ωt – kz), Hx = Hz = 0

as long as the wave width is infinite ( E

 have the same value, in amplitude 
and phase, in every point on a plane parallel to xOy, or phase plane). In practice, its 
width must be much larger than the wavelength. This is the case, for example, for 
beams radiated by gas lasers that have a width in the order of millimeters:

 ε = ε0 n2 where n is the refraction index.

The power transported by this wave is equal to the Poynting vector flow, noted 
as: P

 in isotropic mediums.  
1.1.3. Light rays 
We can locally assimilate a light ray to a plane wave if the field variation on a 
distance similar to the wavelength is negligible; we can then note:

 is the wave vector with a direction that is tangent to the light ray and its 
module is equal to:  
k = k0.n = λ

In the geometric optics hypothesis, and in the case of isotropic mediums, the 
“light ray” path (see Figure 1.2) can be calculated by ray equation:

Light rays lean towards increasing indices. They can therefore be guided into a 
high index level, which is well known in atmospheric propagation of light or radio 
frequency (mirage effect) rays. This guidance mode is used in graded-index optical 
fibers.  
 
Figure 1.2. Light ray propagation 
1.1.4. Dielectric diopter 
In Figure 1.3 we illustrate a plane diopter between two perfect dielectric 
mediums, i.e. with real n1 and n2 indices. These indices become complex in the case 
of a partially absorbing medium. This issue will not be addressed here.  
An incident plane wave (i indexed) arriving in the diopter with an angle of 
incidence θi will split into a reflected wave (indexed r) with θr angle of reflection 
and a transmitted wave (t indexed) θt angle of refraction. We represent a path for the 
wave, traditionally called the “light ray”, but we must not forget that the wave 
spreads on both sides of this ray.  
Since there are neither charges nor currents in the dielectric, there is phase 
continuity of the electromagnetic field, hence continuity of phase fronts on both 
sides of the interface, which is written as:

Since the wavenumbers in the three mediums are characterized by: kj = k0.nj, we 
see that Oz components of the three wave vectors are equal:  
kzi = kzt = kzr = β 
which means that they will propagate together in the direction of axis z while 
remaining in-phase between each other and that the resulting field will take the

1.1.5. Reflection of a plane wave on a diopter 
The above relations give wave directions, but not the distribution of energy 
between them. We must conduct an electromagnetic analysis to determine it. To do 
this, we must split the incident wave into a component TE ( E
G
 parallel to the diopter) 
and a component TM ( H
G
 parallel to the diopter). These two cases are represented in 
Figure 1.4.

This continuity is a essential property of dielectric guides, and a fundamental

We can bring all cases down to the reflection of a wave perpendicular to the 
diopter by splitting field vectors and by noting E’ and H’ as their components 
parallel to the diopter. 
For magnetic fields, sign conventions between incident and reflected waves are 
reversed because of the reversal of propagation direction. We then write:  
E’i + E’r = E’t and H’i – H’r = H’t where Z’1 (E’i + E’r) = Z’2 E’t

which is equivalent to the reflection, at the end of an electric line, over an 
unmatched impedance. This depends on polarization (TE or TM).  
The reflection of any θi incidence wave then becomes equal to the reflection of a 
zero incidence wave between two mediums of impedance:  
Z’1 =

E  = Z1/cos θi and Z’2 =

There is phase reversal if n2 > n1.  
If n2 > n1, ⎪ρ⎪→ 1 in oblique incidence (cos θi = 0) whereas if n2 < n1, it is the 
case at limit refraction (cos θt = 0). In both cases, there is an angle for which ρ = 0 
for TM waves: this is the Brewster angle, deduced from: n1 cos θt = n2 cos θi. A 
wave arriving with this incidence in a dielectric diopter (glass, water, etc.) results in 
a polarized reflected wave TE (see Figure 1.5). This well-known phenomenon is 
used in photography (for filtering reflections) and in polarizers, for example in 
lasers.

This Fresnel reflection is one of the causes of fiber-optic access and connection 
losses, and especially of integrated and optoelectronic optical components, where 
the indices are much higher. This is remedied by antireflection layers (dielectric 
layer stacking for an index adaptation at the wavelength used).

The medium 2 impedance, which is in cos θt or 1/cos θt depending on its

This is the equivalent of an electric line loaded by reactive impedance. The

– in x: kxi = kxt = k0 n2 ⏐cos θt⏐ = – jγ, purely imaginary.  
This wave’s field is then written as:  
E
G
t(x,z,t) = E
G
t0 exp j(ωt – βz).exp(– jγx)  
This wave presents a wave profile that is progressive in direction z, in phase with 
the progressive wave in medium 1, and an exponential profile decreasing in 
direction x. It is called an evanescent wave. 
Its Poynting vector is purely imaginary; the energy of its wave is therefore purely 
reactive and does not modify reflected wave energy, as long as medium 2 is 
perfectly transparent (otherwise there is partial wave absorption).  
The field of this evanescent wave, or field plays a very important role. It explains 
the interactions that can occur between medium 1 (an optical guide for example) and 
medium 2 at a certain distance, as long as it is not large compared to the penetration 
depth given by δ = 1/γ. 
These interactions are used in guided optics for splitters, as well as in optical 
near field microscopy.

1.2. Dielectric waveguide 
1.2.1. Planar dielectric waveguide model 
The planar guide is a 2D model (infinite in lateral direction y) in which the 2a 
thickness and n1 index guide is surrounded by mediums of lower indices n2 and n’2 
(see Figure 1.6). 
These mediums must have an infinite thickness, or a thickness that is large 
compared to the penetration depth of the evanescent field.  
We start with the case of the symmetric waveguide, with n2 = n’2. The case of 
asymmetric guides, where these indices are different, will be studied in section 
1.2.3.  
We will study this guide in geometric optics. A light ray propagating with an 
angle θ with Oz axis is guided by total reflection if: cos θ > n2/n1.  
θ is the angle complementary to the angle of incidence θi previously used.  
By splitting all three wave vectors according to Ox and Oz, we note:

The sign of the quantity k0
2n2 – β2 determines the progressive (if positive) or

therefore remains guided in the n1 index medium on the condition that:  
k0 n1 > β > k0 n2  
and we define its effective index na = β/k0.  
The three waves have the same longitudinal β propagation constant. They will 
therefore progress in direction Oz by remaining phased between each other. The 
resulting field will take the form:  
E(x,z,t) = E(x).exp j(ωt – βz)

1.2.2. Notion of propagation modes  
Distribution E(x) of field Ox is determined by conditions at limits. In fact, in 
order to observe a stationary wave on a guide section, which is called a propagation 
mode, the wave must be in phase after a round trip between both diopters. The phase 
shift: 4a.α + 2φ must then be a multiple integer of 2π.  
The first term of this phase shift is caused by propagation in Ox direction, and 
the second by phase shift φ at the total reflection which can be calculated according 
to section 1.1.7 since its expression is slightly different for TE and TM waves.  
This wave phase shift can be interpreted as a longer trip, or as wave reflection on 
a fictional metallic plane located beyond the dielectric diopter. This apparent guide 
widening is called the Goos-Hanchen effect (see Figure 1.7). It explains that, in a 
symmetric dielectric guide, the fundamental mode (m = 0) is always guided, 
contrary to the metallic guide.  
The phase adaptation equation can be graphically solved and deduce α, β and γ 
can be deduced by introducing the normalized variables:  
u = a.α , v = a.γ and V = a.k0.

Figure 1.7. Goos-Hanchen effect and field pattern in the guide 
The values of u and v, where we find β and field distribution, graphically 
correspond to intersections of V = constant circles and equation v(u) curves above, 
resulting in a field distribution in cos αx for even modes and sin αx for odd modes 
(see Figure 1.7). There are m field zeros along Ox (including the fundamental mode, 
for m = 0, which does not cancel out anywhere in the guide).  
Modes are orthogonal between each other, i.e. the fields of both modes i and j 
are bound by the relation:  
∫∫Ei(x, y).Ej* (x,y) dx.dy = 0 over a section perpendicular to Oz  
The number of solutions, or modes, is completely determined by the value of V. 
The m-order mode exists if V > m.π/2, its cut-off frequency being given by:

The cut-off wavelength of the m-order mode is λc/m. It means that this mode can 
only be guided at a lower wavelength (then at higher frequency), otherwise it is 
refracted. These results are the result of the geometric optics approximation, which 
is only valid if V >> 1; they are therefore not rigorous if there are few modes. The 
cut-off frequency of 0-order mode is zero, which means that it is guided regardless

of the wavelength. This is obviously theoretical and does not consider infrared 
matter absorption.  
1.2.3. Case of the asymmetric guide 
This case is frequent in integrated optics where the guide, thin layer of n1 index, 
is inserted between a substrate of slightly lower index n’2, and a coating of index n2 
lower than n’2. Again in geometric optics, the phase matching condition, therefore 
existence condition, of the m type mode of tilt θ on the axis, is written in this case:  
4a.k0 n1 sinθ + Φ2 + Φ’2 = 2πm 
where Φ2 and Φ’2 are the phase shifts that the wave encounters at total reflections 
on higher and lower interfaces (see section 1.1.7). In the asymmetric guide case, 
these index dependent phase shifts are different, and the graphic resolution (see 
Figure 1.8) shows that when k0 (then frequency) decreases, there may not be a 
solution for m = 0. This means that there is a non-zero cut-off frequency for the 
fundamental mode.  
In fact, when the mode leans towards its cut-off, its β propagation constant leans 
towards k0n2, and therefore becomes lower than k0n’2 at a wavelength λc where it 
will be able to propagate in the material of index n’2 (the substrate in the case of 
integrated optics). Geometrically, θ tends to become higher than θ’2, angle of limit 
refraction at substrate-guide interface, which causes a refraction in the material 
whose index is closest to the guide’s index. 
This phenomenon happens when the normalized V frequency decreases, i.e. 
when the wavelength increases or when the guide’s thickness decreases.  
In addition, internal reflection phase shifts do not have the same value for TE 
and TM modes, so the cut-off frequencies will not either. In an asymmetric guide, 
there is a range of wavelengths where mode TE0 only, and not mode TM0, is guided, 
i.e. a polarized light.

1.2.4. Dispersion 
Once the β constant is determined for each mode, we deduce:  
– its phase velocity: vφ(ω) = β
ω  phase front propagation velocity; and its inverse 
called the phase delay (by unit of length):  
τφ(ω) = ω
β  (phase delay)  
– its group velocity: vg(ω) = dβ
dω  pulse propagation velocity; and its inverse 
called the group delay (by unit of size):  
τφ(ω) = dω
dβ  (group delay)  
These values depend on both the mode order and angular frequency, which leads 
to a double dispersion:  
– intermodal dispersion: caused by group delay difference between modes;  
– intramodal dispersion, or chromatic dispersion: caused by group delay 
variation for each mode with its angular frequency, therefore with its wavelength. In 
practice, this effect is combined with the variations of refraction indices with the 
wavelength (called material dispersion).

We can note the limit values of these propagation velocities:  
– if ω → ωc (at mode cut-off, i.e. limit refraction), vφ and vg lean toward v2 = 
c/n2, propagation velocity in medium 2: since the mode spreads widely, it takes its 
propagation velocity; this corresponds to β = k n2;  
– if ω → ∞ (far from the cut-off), vφ and vg tend toward v = c/n, propagation 
velocity in medium 1, where the mode is completely confined; this then corresponds 
to β = k n. These relations are exact if n does not depend on the wavelength.  
The dispersion will be weaker as n and n2 are closer. Dispersion minimization is 
an essential point of optical fiber optimization.  
1.3. Multimode optical fibers 
1.3.1. Definition 
When transverse dimensions of a guide are much larger than the wavelength, the 
equation in section 1.2.3 will have a solution even for high m, which means that a 
large number of modes can be guided. 
We can then say that a mode corresponds to an authorized path, resulting from 
constructive interferences between multiple reflections on the diopter between both 
materials.  
A fiber-optic is a circular dielectric waveguide which is very probably 
multimode if the core, or in other words the central part where light propagates, has 
a diameter much larger than the wavelength. This diameter is approximately 
between 50 and 200 µm for silica fibers, and 0.5 and 1 mm for plastic fibers. We can 
then simply, but correctly, study propagation by geometric optics.  
In Chapter 2, modes will be more rigorously defined by the resolution of the 
propagation equation deduced from Maxwell equations. 
We will see that a mode is characterized by its path and by the distribution of the 
electromagnetic field around it. We must insist on the fact that in a multimode guide, 
the different modes are on the same wavelength.  
1.3.2. Multimode step-index fiber 
The simplest type of multimode fiber is a step-index fiber (see Figure 1.9), 
directly emerging from optical applications. In this structure, the core of refraction 
index n1 is surrounded by a cladding of slightly lower index n2. These indices are 

Fiber-Optic Communications 
16 
close to 1.5 for silica fibers. This cladding plays an active role in guiding and is also 
surrounded by a coating.  
Within the Oz cylinder axis fiber-optic, the ray is guided if angle θ that it 
produces with Oz remains lower than θ0, the limit refraction angle deduced from the 
Snell-Descartes laws:  
n1.cos θ0 = n2 
If θ > θ0, the ray is refracted. Otherwise, it is guided by total reflection at the 
core cladding interface. This remains true if the fiber is not straight, as long as the 
bending is not too pronounced. This makes it possible to consider long haul 
transmission with low loss levels and without transmitted information leaking 
outside.  
 
Figure 1.9. Step-index fiber 
Because of this condition, the maximum angle of incidence at fiber input, i.e. the 
acceptance cone aperture, is given by the numerical aperture:  
NA = sin Θ0 = n1 sin θ0 = 
22
21 n
n −
 
In return, it is the angle within which the light coming out of the fiber diverges.  
Along with diameters, core at 2a, and cladding at 2b, the numerical aperture is 
the most important parameter of an optical fiber. A large numerical aperture makes 
it possible to couple a large quantity of light, even from a divergent source such as 
light-emitting diode (LED). On the other hand, it will lead to spreading of 
transmitted pulses over time, because there are large differences in the length, 
therefore in propagation time, of the different guided rays (intermodal dispersion 
effect).

These fiber optics are quite suitable for optical applications and for very short 
distance transmissions. There are a certain number of multimode fibers that are 
different in material (plastic, silica/silicone, or “all silica” – not widely used for step-
index) and in their characteristics (see Chapter 2).  
1.3.3. Multimode graded-index fiber 
The graded-index fibers were designed specifically for telecommunications in 
order to minimize this intermodal dispersion effect without significantly reducing 
the numerical aperture or the coupled power. Their core index decreases according 
to a parabolic-like law from the axis to the core cladding interface (see Figure 1.10). 
In this way, the rays follow a sine type path, and those with the longest path go 
through lower index mediums, increasing their velocity and making it possible to 
approximately equalize propagation delays.

We again define the numerical aperture as with step-index fibers. However, n1 is 
the core index only on the axis. Since the numerical aperture decreases the further 
away from the axis we move, with equal conditions approximately half as much 
power is coupled as in a step-index fiber. 
The cladding does not occur in guiding itself, but plays an important spatial 
filtering role by eliminating the most tilted rays.  
Several “all silica” graded-index (GI) fiber standards have been normalized for 
short distance telecommunications applications (50/125 fiber, now used for high 
bandwidth local area networks), local computer networks (62.5/125) and first 
generation video distribution (85/125, still not widely in use). Graded-index plastic 
fibers appear for the Gigabit Ethernet.  
1.4. Propagation in multimode optical fibers 
1.4.1. Ray paths 
Figure 1.9 and 1.10 diagrams only represent meridional rays, remaining in a 
plane containing the optical fiber axis. In order to calculate all paths, we must switch 
to 3 dimensions. Due to the symmetry of revolution of the optical fiber, we use 
cylindrical coordinates (see Figure 1.11), by noting as:  
– r, z, ψ coordinates from the path’s current point, P;  
– uG

Light rays will propagate where the wave vector is real, or where f(r)2 is positive;

in the cladding in order for them to remain guided in the core. We must therefore

Meridional rays remain in the plane containing the axis Oz, so φ and ν are zero

1.4.3.2. Skew rays  
ν is not zero and we thus observe 3 cases (see Figure 1.12):  
– the ray is guided if f(r)2 < 0 in all the cladding, or as previously: 
β > k0 n2; this ray, which never cuts off the axis, is also called gallery mode;  
– the ray is refracted if f(r)2 > 0 in all the cladding, or:

In the case of leaking rays, f(r) 2 < 0 in the part of the cladding neighboring the 
core (we have an evanescent field), but becomes positive again further away, thus 
defining a zone in the cladding where a ray can propagate once more. This ray will 
gradually attract the energy propagating in the core and thus leak in cladding 
through the evanescent field, based on a phenomenon similar to the tunnel effect in 
quantum mechanics. 
This type of ray therefore cannot guide energy in the core over a long distance, 
but can propagate over short distances before elimination, and thus disrupt 
transmission and measures.

corresponding to both rotation directions of a skew ray around the fiber axis.  
It has a maximum νM value that can be graphically determined (see Figure 1.12),

In fact, there would no longer be a progressive field zone where the ray would

– over uG
r: path projection (see Figure 1.12) reveals two upturning points at 
distances r1 and r2 from the axis (r1 = 0 for meridional rays, corresponding to ν = 0). 
The envelope of these points defines on each side a cylindrical surface called caustic 
separating the progressive wave from the evanescent wave, characterized by f(r) = 0. 
It behaves like a dielectric diopter: we observe a Φ(r) phase shift. Total phase shift 
on a round trip between both caustics must be an integer multiple of 2π, defining the 
mode of radial order m (number of field periods on a radial path from r1 to r2).  
If m is large, we can neglect phase shifts on caustics before the first term 
(propagation based phase shift) and write, by using the expression of f(r):

– for a parabolic graded-index fiber: N ≈ V2/4.  
These results are only valid if V is large.  
1.5. Dispersion in multimode optical fibers 
1.5.1. Intermodal dispersion 
Due to the dispersion of propagation delay between modes, called intermodal 
dispersion, a light pulse injected at the fiber-optic entrance will arrive in the form of 
a large number of shifted pulses. Since the modes are numerous and the propagation 
delay difference between two modes is much lower than the photodetector response 
time, it will deliver the pulse envelope, or a pulse response with a standard deviation 
∆τim. For convenience of measurement purposes, the half-maximum width of the 
received pulse is generally considered.  
It is very important to note that the envelope and mid-height pulse width do not 
only depend on differences in propagation delay between modes, but also on the 
light power distribution between them. This depends on light injection at entry as 
well as on geometric conditions of the continuation of the fiber (bending, 
constraints) modifying this distribution. We can however calculate the maximum 
received pulse width, which is the propagation delay difference between the slowest 
and fastest modes.  
1.5.2. Pulse broadening calculation  
1.5.2.1. In step-index fibers

We can deduce the maximum propagation delay difference between the fastest 
mode, for which θa ≈ 0, and the slowest mode, for which θa ≈ θ0 with θ0 angle of 
limit given by: cos θ = n2/n1 (the approximation comes from the discrete nature of 
modes which results in the fact that these limit values are not exactly reached).

with P the profile dispersion parameter, which depends on the wavelength and

This expression is general because a step-index fiber corresponds to α = ∞ and 
we find again the previous expression. Because of the corrective term, caused by the 
faster average velocity of rays that have a greater tilt, propagation delays are much 
closer to each other in a graded-index fiber than in a step-index fiber (see Figure 
1.13). The intermodal dispersion is minimized for:

Since P and ∆ are low, this value which is close to 2 depends on λ: the graded-
index fiber can only be optimized for a single wavelength. In theory, it is possible to 
reach less than 100 ps/km for ∆ = 1%, but in order to do this, the theoretical index 
profile must be very precisely respected. In fact, ∆τim increases very rapidly as soon 
as the profile slightly moves away. In practice, it has an value in the range of 1 
ns/km, for a less severe tolerance making it possible to produce an economical fiber. 
However, the most recent graded-index fibers, optimized for very high bandwidth 
local area networks, almost reach theoretical values.  
1.5.3. Chromatic dispersion 
As we have seen for plane wave guides, it adds to intermodal dispersion a 
chromatic dispersion effect ∆τc, caused by the variation of the group delay τg with 
the source’s wavelength. 
First, for a fiber length L, we can write:  
 ∆τc = Dc.L.∆λ with:   
– ∆λ spectral source width; pulse broadening is proportional to it. This value 
will therefore be high with light-emitting diodes, with very large linewidth;  
– Dc chromatic dispersion coefficient, which depends on fiber and wavelength 
parameters. We can calculate this by:  
Dc = dλ
dτg   
expressed in ps/nm/km, as ∆λ is in nm and ∆τc in ps/km.  
It is divided into: Dc = DM + DG where DM is the material dispersion, caused by 
variation of material index with the wavelength, and DG is the guide dispersion. For 
multimode fibers, this last term is different for each mode, but it is negligible in 
practice. For single-mode fibers on the other hand, it plays an important role and we 
will discuss it in detail in Chapter 2. The material dispersion curve in silica (see 
Figure 1.14) cancels out at approximately 1.27 µm. The chromatic dispersion 
coefficient is negative under this wavelength, which means that light speed increases 
with the wavelength (ordinary dispersion), and it is the opposite above 
(extraordinary dispersion).

This pulse broadening is much lower for graded-index fibers than for step-index 
fibers (see Figure 1.15). Intermodal dispersion is generally predominant but not 
always: when a graded-index fiber is used with a 0.85 µm LED (cheapest 
configuration), the chromatic dispersion is then predominant and it is necessary to 
take this in consideration. In order to have an negligible chromatic dispersion effect 
in multimode fibers, we must either work at 1.3 µm or use laser diodes.

Figure 1.15. Time and frequency-domain responses in multimode fibers  
1.5.5. Multimode fiber bandwidth 
In telecommunications, the practice of using the bandwidth BW, deduced from 
the frequency-domain response, the Fourier transform of the pulsed response (see 
Figure 1.15) was maintained. This is the frequency at which the modulation 
amplitude of the received signal (and not its average power!), H(f), is equal to H(0) 
divided by 
2  (H(0) representing attenuation) because of intermodal dispersion. 
This measurement is done by using a laser source to avoid chromatic dispersion.  
The relation between bandwidth and pulse broadening depends on the exact 
pulse form, and consequently on the energy distribution between modes. We 
generally accept the approximate relation:

BW ≈

This expression is valid in the absence of chromatic dispersion.  
If the pulse broadening is proportional to the length of fiber L, the bandwidth is 
inversely proportional to it, and we can say that the resulting product of bandwidth x 
length is constant. We will then use the term, expressed in MHz.km, corresponding 
to ∆τim measured over 1 km; it is also called “kilometer bandwidth”.  
Provided by the manufacturer in practice, this bandwidth is a essential 
characteristic of multimode fibers. Minimal values can be imposed by the 
applications (distribution, local area networks, etc.). Its range is:  
– from 10 to 100 MHz.km for step-index fibers;  
– from 100 to 1,000 MHz.km for graded-index fibers. Some recent fibers, 
optimized for the Gigabit Ethernet, reach 2 GHz.km (OM3 standard).  
When chromatic dispersion is not negligible, the kilometer bandwidth becomes:  
BW ≈ 
τ
2∆
1
with ∆τ total pulse broadening given in section 1.5.5  
This bandwidth is, in this case, lower than the one given by the fiber 
manufacturer, which only involves intermodal dispersion. We have then calculated a 
global bandwidth depending on the fiber and spectral source width. We must not 
forget that (electrical) bandwidths of the source and receiver can also limit the 
transmission system bandwidth, and in particular with light-emitting diodes whose 
bandwidth does not exceed a few hundred MHz.  
1.5.6. Mode coupling 
We have considered that the pulse broadening caused by intermodal dispersion 
was exactly proportional to the length traveled. This is true that if energy coupled in 
a mode remains confined in this mode. However, most often, non-homogenities and 
distortions lead to energy coupling between modes, and consequences on 
propagation can be significant. In fact, modes have different propagation delays, but 
also slightly different attenuations: high order modes, close to the cut-off, have 
higher losses (they exchange energy with leaking modes, themselves leaking, in case 
of mechanical perturbations).  

Fiber-Optic Communications 
30 
This mode coupling can be localized, for example when caused by a strong curve 
or by a misaligned connection (it is then called mode conversion because there is a 
discontinuity in the power transported by each mode).  
In the case of statistically stationary perturbations along the fiber (material non-
homogenity effect, cable-induced constraint effect, etc.), we observe that a mode 
equilibrium distribution  is established and characterized by:  
– a near Gaussian power distribution transported by each mode, depending on its 
tilt θa on the axis (but it is not a Gaussian beam, because it does not have spatial 
coherence);  
– a global attenuation supplement, as the different modes have a slightly 
different attenuation which increases with the mode order.  
This equilibrium state happens after an equilibrium distance that is shorter as 
coupling is stronger. This distance can be reduced by creating strong constraints at 
the beginning of a fiber. This is done in measurements, using a wave scrambler, in 
order to measure its parameters at equilibrium, but attenuation increases.  
When equilibrium is established, a larger bandwidth than the one expected by the 
relation bandwidth x length = constant is observed. We then accept, instead of the  
L-1 law, an L-γ law where exponent γ is slightly lower than 1 but can only be known 
experimentally, and depends on conditions of usage (presence of connections and 
bending).  
It is therefore difficult to predict with precision the link bandwidth over the 
multimode fiber, and the L-1 law gives a lower bandwidth limit that we are sure will 
be available. For a new installation, it is preferable to use a single-mode fiber when 
it is not sure that the multimode fiber will provide enough bandwidth. However, 
with the increase of throughputs in local networks, it may be necessary to use 
already installed multimode fibers at increasingly high throughputs, at the 
bandwidth limit. It is necessary to measure it experimentally and to plan a penalty in 
the loss budget (see Chapter 9). Moreover, bandwidth can be improved by using 
mode filtering at injection (although this results in a loss of power, which is 
perfectly acceptable at short distance).  
The mode coupling phenomenon also prohibits multiplexing of different 
information on the different modes, which would be possible in theory (and has been 
realized under laboratory conditions at very short distances).  

Multimode Optical Fibers

1.5.7. Modal noise 
In the mode coupling theory, it is assumed that there is no coherence between 
modes, which is the case if the source is a low coherence LED. In the case of a high 
coherence source (laser diode), the coherence between modes is maintained along 
the fiber and we observe interference between them. Phase shift variation between 
modes is easily converted into intensity variation by spatial filtering, intentional or 
not (at a connection for example).  
Used in some vibration sensors, this modal noise phenomenon is disturbing for 
transmissions, and the use of laser diodes is traditionally avoided with multimode 
fibers. However, an exception involves very short high bit-rate links on multimode 
fibers (particularly Gigabit Ethernet), where laser diodes are necessary for adequate 
speed, and which are limited by intermodal dispersion; in this case the level of 
received signal is high and thus  noise is more easily tolerated.

In order for a guide or an optical fiber to be single mode, its transverse 
dimensions must not be much larger than the wavelength. In these conditions, the 
geometrical optical approximation is no longer valid and calculations must use 
electromagnetism.

Due to the limit conditions and especially the field continuity at core-cladding 
interface, there will be a finite number of solutions which will be the modes of 
propagation. As we have seen in section 1.4.4, they must have the form:

 (r,ψ,z,t) = E

where ν, the azimuthal sequence, is an integer.  
Since the optical fiber is a circular dielectric wave guide, we solve the propagation 
equation by developing Laplacian ∆ into cylindrical coordinates (r,ψ,z). Since this 
equation is vectorial, we solve it for the longitudinal Ez component (it is the simplest, 
as uG
z is a constant direction), resulting in:

2.1.2. Solution for step-index fiber optics 
2.1.2.1. General form 
When n(r) is constant in each medium, the equation takes the classical Bessel 
function form, which has an analytical solution. We know that for guided modes, 
k0n2 < β < k0n1. Quantity k0
2 n2 − β2 is therefore positive in the core and negative in 
the cladding, which determines two families of solutions:

There are other mathematically possible solutions, but they are the only 
physically possible solutions, i.e. which transport a finite energy (they are bounded 
and lean towards 0 for r → ∞).

2.1.3. Mode calculation method 
The above solutions depend on four integration constants noted as A, B, C, D. 
Determination of these parameters can be done with the help of continuity equations of 
tangent field components (in z and in ψ) at the core-cladding interface (where  
r = a). They provide a homogenous system with four linear equations in A, B, C, D, 
without a second member:

The solutions of this system (whose writing is identical for both polarizations) 
are usually zero, except if it is degenerated, i.e. if its determinant is zero. Physically, 
this means that only modes corresponding to certain discrete propagation constant 
values β (system eigenvalues) will propagate. The determinant notation (eigenvalues

and H1z = 0. In this transverse magnetic mode, the electric field has a radial 
distribution. In both cases, field lines have revolution symmetry, but that is not the 
case with intensity distribution.  
These equations are established by using: J’0(u) = − J1(u) and K’0(v) = − K1(v).  
2.1.4.2. Hybrid modes 
If ν ≠ 0, we have a hybrid mode HEνm or EHνm (where none of the longitudinal 
components are zero). Geometrically, the propagation axis of these modes

Because of the expressions of transverse components (respectively in ± cosνψ 
and sinνψ), we observe a property of HE1m modes: their transverse field practically 
keeps the same direction throughout the fiber section. These are quasi-linear 
polarization modes. This property is all the more true the smaller the index 
difference.  
2.1.5. Cut-off frequency 
In a dielectric guide, the cut-off corresponds to the limit refraction. The mode 
approaches a plane wave, which is transversally infinite. We then have:  
– β → k0n2 hence u → V and v → 0; with V, normalized frequency: V = a.k0

– Ez → 0 hence Jν (u) → 0 when u → V.  
These relations enable cut-off frequency calculation for each mode, i.e. the 
frequency above which it is no longer guided (it is then refracted in cladding). By 
using the following correspondences, for modified Bessel functions, when v → 0:

frequency.  
An essential property of circular dielectric wave guides is that the mode HE11 
has a zero cut-off frequency: it is (in theory) guided regardless of wavelength. 
The first non-zero cut-off frequency is the one of modes TE01, TM01 and HE21: it 
corresponds to V = 2.405, first root of J0(V). For V < 2.405, the fiber-optic is single 
mode.

2.1.6. Aspect of modes 
The dispersion diagram (see Figure 2.1) gives the value of β/k0, or apparent 
index of each mode, versus the normalized frequency V. As we know, this value 
equals n2 at each mode’s cut-off, and leans toward n1 when V → ∞.  
In this diagram, we see certain modes associate in groups of neighboring cut-off 
frequency and propagation constant β(V). The resulting field of the superposition of 
these modes, which remain in phase together, is almost linear polarization. These 
groups are called pseudo-modes and are denoted LPℓm (linear polarization) defined 
by:  
– mode LP0m = mode HE1m (in this way, fundamental mode HE11 is called 
LP01);  
– mode LP1m = modes TE0m, TM0m, HE2m; 
– mode LPℓm = modes HE (ℓ + 1),m and EH (ℓ-1),m (for ℓ > 1).  
Physically, ℓ (azimuthal order) corresponds to the number of field periods over a 
circumference. Therefore, when this circumference has been traveled, there are 2ℓ 
maxima and 2ℓ zeros of mode intensity. Order m (radial order) corresponds to the 
number of intensity maxima over a radius, from the axis. LP0m mode intensity has a 
symmetry of revolution, with a maximum on axis; other modes have zero intensity 
on the axis.

Longitudinal field components are more complex because they are the result of 
hybrid mode integration, except for modes LP0m (we will be able to rebuild it with the 
expressions in section 2.1.2). They are of low amplitude compared to transverse 
components, especially for modes far from their cut-off. Polarization of mode (in x 
here) is determined by the polarization at the fiber entrance. Both orthogonal 
polarizations of mode LP01, and all their linear combinations, propagate with the same 
constant β if the fiber is perfectly isotropic (see section 2.4 for the non-isotropic case 
where a birefringence appears). E0 can be determined by light power P0 injected at the 
fiber entrance:  
P0 = ∫∫xy E (x,y) H* (x,y) dx dy 
over the fiber-optic section, including the cladding. It guides a significant part of the 
power, especially for modes close to cut-off. Figure 2.2 represents fields and light 
intensity for the first pseudo-modes.

which is the first zero of J0(V) and corresponds to the cut-off of modes TE01 and

This condition can be reached when the core diameter is small (less than 10 µm) 
and the index difference is low (less than 0.5%), justifying the weakly guiding 
hypothesis. 
Consequently, the fiber is single-mode only beyond the corresponding wavelength, 
called cut-off wavelength, given by:

The main advantage of single-mode fibers (SMF) is their very large bandwidth 
allowing long distance transmissions, since there is no longer intermodal dispersion. 
They also have instrumentation applications because they maintain the coherence of 
the light, and its polarization for certain types of fibers.  
Their main limitation comes from the small core diameter, requiring very high 
precision at the connections, as well as the use of laser sources; these two elements 
are more expensive than with multimode fibers (whereas the fiber itself is cheaper 
than good graded-index fibers).  
The term “single-mode” means that for each wavelength (higher than λc) only 
one mode propagates, and does not mean that that the fiber only guides one 
wavelength: on the contrary, single-mode fibers are very well suited for wavelength 
division multiplexing.In this case, the different wavelengths overlap without 
interfering, at least insofar as non-linear effects are insignificant.  
2.2.2. Gaussian single-mode fiber model 
According to previous results, mode LP01 field has as expression: 
E(r,ψ,z,t) = E(r) exp j(ωt – βz) with:

Ez, longitudinal field, has a negligible amplitude compared to the transverse field 
(in low guidance approximation) but this amplitude, in J1(u.r/a), is not zero: mode 
LP01 is in fact not a transverse mode.  
As we can see in Figure 2.3, the intensity profile of the transverse field, which has 
a revolution symmetry, is of Gaussian shape and it is written in an approximate 
manner:

where 2w0 is called the mode field diameter or mode diameter. This approximation 
is particularly valid for V ranging between 1.8 and 2.4, i.e. by getting closer to the 
cut-off. It makes it possible to use Gaussian beam formalism applying to laser beams 
in particular. A good coupling between lasers and single-mode fibers can be 
achieved with the use of an appropriate lens.  
 
Figure 2.3. Single-mode optical fiber 
This quasi-Gaussian field distribution, which greatly spreads in cladding, is 
directly linked to the diffraction phenomenon, which also occurs by a light 
divergence at fiber-optic output under the form of a Gaussian beam with an angle of

This divergence is not of the same nature as for a multimode fiber, because it is a 
spatially coherent wave, propagating in direction z from the light source or fiber 
output. At this point (near field), the wave is plane and has a Gaussian distribution. 
In far field, near field Fourier transform, the distribution is also Gaussian and the 
beam can be refocused with a lens.  
2.2.3. Single-mode fiber parameters 
As with multimode fibers, single-mode fibers can be defined by core-cladding 
diameters and by the relative index difference ∆. These primary parameters are 
characteristic of fiber manufacturing. For reasons of convenience of measurement (see 
Chapter 3) and use, they are more often characterized by their secondary parameters 
which are:

At a given wavelength, the fiber is single mode if product a

is lower than a 
constant proportional to λ. It is therefore harder to produce and use a single-mode 
fiber at 0.85 µm or in visible light than at 1.3 or 1.55 µm; however, this type of fiber 
has applications in instrumentation;  
– the mode field diameter resulting from the Gaussian approximation. We can 
establish its value by using the Marcuse numerical approximation:  
w0/a = 0.65 + 1.619 V-1.5 + 2.879 V-6  
Close to the cut-off, the mode field diameter is close to the core diameter, but it 
quickly increases when V decreases, i.e. when the wavelength increases. This mode 
spreading in cladding makes the propagation increasingly sensitive to the optical 
fiber deformations. Its use for V < 1.6 is not recommended.  
A single-mode fiber can be characterized by its primary parameters, or by its 
secondary parameters. With core diameter and index difference, we have two degrees 
of freedom (contrary to the case of the metallic wave guide) which will be used for 
optimizing attenuation and dispersion.  
2.3. Dispersion in single-mode fibers 
2.3.1. Chromatic dispersion 
Although much lower than in a multimode fiber, pulse broadening in a single-
mode fiber is not zero, because chromatic dispersion remains, creating a broadening

order:

– Dc chromatic dispersion coefficient, which depends on fiber parameters and 
wavelength. We can calculate it by:

 material dispersion of medium i (i = 1 or 2).  
The sum of the first two terms, close to M1 and which we will note as DM, is the 
material dispersion caused by the variation of its index with λ. It cancels out at the 
neighborhood of 1.3 µm, which is the main advantage of this wavelength. 
The last term, low and always negative, is the waveguide dispersion; it depends 
on guidance parameters, is zero for V → 0 and ∞ (we lean toward a homogenous 
environment with two limits), and reaches a maximum when the mode is strongly 
shared between the core and the cladding.

2.3.3. Cancellation of chromatic dispersion 
In silica, DM cancels at 1.27 µm. This term is negative underneath (dispersion said 
to be ordinary, that is observed in visible light) and positive above (dispersion said to 
be extra-ordinary). The guide dispersion is always negative: in fact, if the wavelength 
increases, the mode spreads wider in the cladding, decreasing its propagation time.

(dispersion shifted fiber, see section 2.3.5). However, in order to achieve that, it is 
necessary to:  
– increase the index difference to V constant, which means the core diameter 
must be decreased; then intrinsic losses (by core index increase) and connection 
losses (by mode field diameter decrease) increase; or 
– keep the index difference and decrease V, therefore a (in other words, decrease 
λc); a decrease of V results in the fact that the mode is not as well guided and leaks 
more easily.  
From the attenuation point of view, these solutions are therefore not optimal and 
different profiles must be used, the simplest being the depressed inner cladding 
profile (see section 2.3.4). More complex index profiles (triangle, trapezium, trench, 
etc.) have also been developed for obtaining specific dispersion curves (lower and of 
lower slope). Propagation and dispersion calculations of these fibers are based on 
finite element numerical methods.  
2.3.4. Depressed inner cladding fibers 
The principle of these fibers is simply to increase the core-cladding index 
difference by decreasing the cladding index (see Figure 2.5), by incorporating 
fluorine. This makes it possible to avoid increasing the core index by increasing the 
quantity of germanium oxide, therefore attenuation. It is even possible to produce 
pure silica core fibers. However, for production reasons (see Chapter 3), it is 
necessary to preserve a pure silica external cladding. The index decreases in the 
inner cladding part, hence the name depressed inner cladding  (DIC) profile.  
In general, the thickness of this inner cladding is much larger than the penetration 
depth of the evanescent field. The external cladding plays a negligible role in the 
propagation, and we can, in parameter calculations (including dispersion), consider a 
parameter equivalent step-index fiber:  
ae ≈ a and ∆ne ≈ ∆n = ∆n+ + ∆n-  
∆n+ is the index difference between the core and pure silica; this term, 
proportional to the quantity of germanium oxide, directly occurs in intrinsic 
attenuation. 
The depressed inner cladding fiber increases guide dispersion, and thus decreases 
global chromatic dispersion, without increasing attenuation. On the other hand, it 
presents a LP01 mode cut-off for a wavelength such that: β = k0n3. In fact, when λ 

Single-Mode Optical Fibers     49 
increases, β/k0 decreases and becomes lower than n3; in addition, the mode diameter 
increases, which leads to a leakage of the mode in the outer cladding.  
 
Figure 2.5. Depressed inner cladding fiber 
Pure core silica depressed inner cladding fibers were designed to benefit from 
very low attenuation (the theoretical minimum being close to 0.15 dB/km) as well as 
low sensitivity to radiation (whereas germanium oxide darkens), which is useful for 
spatial applications or in nuclear physics for example. However, these fibers are 
very sensitive to curves.  
2.3.5. Different types of single-mode fibers 
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) standardized several types 
of single-mode fibers for telecommunications (see Figure 2.6).  
2.3.5.1. Standard fiber 
Under the ITU G 652 standard, the standard fiber is the oldest, with a core 
diameter of 9 µm; its dispersion cancels out at approximately 1.3 µm, which is its 
optimal use wavelength, mainly in very high bitrate local and metropolitan networks. 
However, it can also be used at 1.55 µm with monochromatic laser diodes (∆λ ≈ 0.1 
nm); in the absence of optical amplifier, the distance is limited by attenuation and this 
solution is satisfying, at least up to 2.5 Gbit/s bitrate.

2.3.5.2. Dispersion shifted fiber 
A G 653 standard dispersion shifted fiber or DSF has a 7 µm core diameter and 
an index profile that is often more complex, in triangle or trapezium. Its dispersion 
cancels out at approximately 1.55 µm, but its attenuation is slightly higher. It was 
mostly used for very long distance optical amplifier connections, where the critical 
parameter is dispersion and not attenuation, but it is not very compatible with 
WDM, because dispersion cannot be cancelled for all wavelengths, and zero 
dispersion leads to the accumulation of non-linear effects. It retreats to benefit the G 
655 fiber.  
2.3.5.3. Non-zero dispersion shifted fiber 
The more recent (1995) G 655 standard NZ-DSF (non-zero dispersion shifted 
fiber) has a chromatic dispersion reduced to a low value, but non-zero (from 3 to  
6 ps/km/nm in the 3rd window); it is in fact a family of fibers with parameters (and 
commercial names) that are different from one manufacturer to another. Thanks to a 
larger core diameter, it does not have as many losses as previously, and in addition 
is less sensitive to non-linear effects.  
It is therefore well adapted to wavelength division multiplexing. The slope of  
its dispersion (dDc/dλ) is lower than for the previous fibers (from 0.05 to  
0.1 ps/km/nm2).  
In 2004, the G 656 fiber was normalized, which is a variation presenting a higher 
dispersion over a larger bandwidth (2 to 14 ps/km/nm from 1,500 to 1,610 nm) 
adapted to coarse wavelength division multiplexing WDM (CWDM, see Chapter 5).

2.3.6. Chromatic dispersion compensation 
A non-zero chromatic dispersion can be optically compensated with the help of a 
short fiber section of high negative dispersion (but generally of high attenuation) 
called DCF (dispersion compensating fiber). A chromatic dispersion compensating 
device (using a Bragg grating for example, see Chapter 4) can also be used to play 
this role, which is to delay the wavelengths arriving first.  
This device is characterized by its slope, in ps/nm, which must be equal to − 
Dc.L in order to compensate the chromatic dispersion at the end of a fiber length L, 
independently from the source’s spectral width ∆λ. The development of these 
devices is delicate but their principle is simple; compensation is possible because as 
long as the propagation remains linear, the different wavelengths of a single signal 
do not interfere, contrary to the different multimode fibers or to both polarizations in 
a single-mode fiber.  
In a wavelength division multiplexing system, dispersion compensation is 
generally applied in two steps: a rough compensation for the complete spectrum for 
each section, which is not very precise because it is difficult to have a fiber or a 
device with dispersion that is exactly symmetric to the link fiber in the whole 
spectrum, followed by a fine compensation, wavelength by wavelength, after the 
demultiplexer. This method is quite suitable for the NZ-DSF fiber but also allows 
the reuse of standard fibers at 1.55 µm.  
2.4. Polarization effects in single-mode fibers 
2.4.1. Birefringence of optical fibers  
In theory, a single-mode optical fiber is isotropic, and the mode propagation 
constant β does not depend on light polarization. We then find, depending on 
injection conditions, classical polarization states in an isotropic medium (linear, 
circular or elliptical polarization).  
In practice, single-mode fibers are not rigorously isotropic, because the core fiber 
is not perfectly circular (an elliptical core fiber is birefringent), and moreover a 
birefringence can exist, induced intentionally or not, by external causes which occur 
non-isotropically. In this case, propagation constants βx and βy according to x and y 
(main birefringence axes) are no longer equal, and a birefringence appears, 
characterized by:  
– ∆β  = βx – βy (generally ∆β << β ≈ βx ≈ βy);  
– BR = ∆β/β relative birefringence;

 beat length, at the end of which the fast axis wave has 
reached a phase advance of 2π over the other.  
An initial polarization state other than a linear polarization along x or y 
(polarization eigenmodes) will therefore not be preserved. The resulting polarization 
will be a combination of the two eigenmodes but, because of the coupling, the light 
is depolarized along the fiber. 
This is not intrinsically annoying in telecommunications, because receivers, and 
even erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, are not sensitive to the polarization. However, 
there appears between both inherent polarization modes a dispersion of the 
intermodal type, which, by unit of length equals:

This dispersion term, called DGD (differential group delay), is weak but not 
necessarily negligible compared to the chromatic dispersion when it has been 
compensated.  
2.4.2. Induced birefringence 
The effects of induced birefringence are very interesting in sensors, because they 
can make the fiber sensitive to some parameters which do not modify the power 
transmitted and are therefore not (or not very) sensitive in telecommunications. 
There are mainly:  
– mechanical constraints caused by the photo-elasticity phenomenon: a 
transversal (compression) force F, by unit of length, applied along the axis y, causes 
a linear birefringence proportional to F and of slow axis y; a bending of radius R  in 
plane yOz causes a linear birefringence proportional to 1/R2 , the fast axis is aligned 
with y. In addition to the application to constraint sensors, the fiber bending is a simple 
way to control polarization in a laboratory;  
– a fiber twist of N turns around its axis, resulting in circular birefringence from 
photo-elasticity, or in other words a rotation of the polarization axis, of an angle 
proportional to N. This property is used for developing fibers preserving the state of 
polarization while presenting a low linear birefringence;  
– a longitudinal magnetic field of intensity H, resulting in a rotation of the 
polarization of angle θ = VF.H.L over a length L. This is the Faraday effect, which is 
non-reciprocal: the direction of rotation depends on the light propagation direction. 

Single-Mode Optical Fibers     53 
VF, the Verdet constant, is very low in silica (approximately 4.10-6 rd/A). This effect 
is used to develop isolators (see Chapter 5), current sensors, and magneto-optical 
disk reading.  
 
Figure 2.7. Two types of single-mode fibers 
with constant polarization 
Mechanically induced birefringence (by permanent internal constraints) is also 
used to develop high birefringence fibers, called “polarization maintenance fibers”, 
which only guide one light polarization direction (see Figure 2.7). Expensive and of 
high attenuation, they are difficult to connect, because the correct orientation of both 
fibers must be achieved. They are used in some instrumental applications, or some 
interferometric sensors (gyroscope, constraint sensors)  requiring polarized light.  
2.4.3. Polarization dispersion 
Polarization dispersion mainly occurs in optical amplification links, because of 
the very long lengths involved. In this case, because of the random character of the 
birefringence and the existence of coupling between both polarizations, pulse 
broadening ∆τP caused by this effect increases proportionally to L (L distance 
traveled):  
∆τP = PMD. L with PMD (polarization mode dispersion) in ps/ km  
If a single-mode fiber presents chromatic dispersion and polarization dispersion 
simultaneously, global pulse widening follows a quadratic combination law for these 
two phenomena, as with between the two dispersions of a multimode fiber:

∆τP is generally much lower than ∆τc at the end of the fiber, but it is not the case 
when a chromatic dispersion compensation device is used: polarization dispersion 
may become the factor limiting the link length. In fact, optical compensation of 
polarization dispersion is possible in theory, and partially achievable with 
retardation plates, but it cannot be perfect because of coupling between both 
polarizations. This phenomenon also prohibits the use of multiplexing of two signals 
over two orthogonal polarizations in practice, which has been demonstrated in lab 
conditions.  
It is therefore necessary to use very low average birefringence fibers, with PMD 
much lower than 1 ps/ km (classical standard fiber value); current G 655 fibers 
must not exceed 0.2 ps/ km, and the best submarine fibers reach 0.05 ps/ km. 
However, this is their manufacturing value, and cabling and laying must not 
deteriorate it (notably with bendings or other constraints).  
2.5. Non-linear effects in optical fibers  
2.5.1. Introduction 
Glasses used in optical fibers, silica in particular, show extremely low non-linear 
effects in standard uses. However, these effects can be observed in single-mode 
fibers for relatively low power for two reasons:  
– very low section of the fiber core, hence significant intensities (power 
densities);  
– large interaction length, since the light propagates with few losses over very 
long distances.  
Non-linear effects reveal power thresholds beyond which transmission is no longer 
adequate. These thresholds are higher than the normal power of sources, but may be 
reached in optically amplified and wavelength division multiplexed systems. On the 
other hand, they enable new applications: index change, frequency transpositions, 
interaction between two waves controlled by light, etc.  
Non-linear optics is a discipline in its own right, opening new perspectives in 
processing, switching and optical storing of information. Hereafter, we will focus on the 
main non-linear effects in optical fibers.  

Single-Mode Optical Fibers     55 
2.5.2. Raman scattering 
Raman scattering is a photon-phonon interaction, i.e. exchange of energy 
between optical wave and the vibrations of the material’s molecular bonds.  
When a pump wave goes through material, some photons transfer a part of their 
energy hνp to a phonon, a particle associated with the vibration of frequency δν 
appearing in the matter. They are then scattered with lower energy, or in other words 
with a higher wavelength, and constitute a Stokes wave of frequency:  
νs = νp – δν  
Frequency shift: δν = νp – νs depends only on the material, and not on the 
pump wavelength. Thus, the Stokes wave spectrum is represented independently 
from it, versus δν/c expressed in cm-1. In crystals, several rays may be observed in the 
spectrum of this wave, corresponding to the different vibration frequencies of 
interatomic bonds. In disorganized environments (glass, liquids) on the other hand, a 
relatively large continuous spectrum can be observed, where the peaks are 
characteristic of their composition (silica presents a peak characteristic at          
490 cm-1). It is a well-known method of analysis in chemistry.  
Reciprocally, a few phonons will give their energy to photons, who in turn will 
scatter in the form of an anti-Stokes wave with a frequency:  
νa = νp + δν therefore a lower wavelength  
The anti-Stokes wave spectrum is related to the Stokes wave spectrum and 
greatly depends on temperature T, which creates phonons by thermal agitation (see 
Figure 2.8). The ratio between Stokes and anti-Stokes rays equals:

This ratio only depends on temperature, making it possible to use Raman 
spectrometry to know the composition and temperature of the medium. When  
T = 0 °K, the anti-Stokes spectrum disappears (there is no thermal agitation any 
longer), and the Stokes spectrum is proportional to σ0(δν).  
During propagation of the pump wave along an optical fiber, the Stokes wave, 
constantly provided with photons, is amplified according to an exponential law 
where the coefficient of gain is proportional to the pump wave power. When the 
gain becomes high, either because the pump wave is strong or because the 
interaction length is large, the Stokes wave empties the pump wave and creates new 

56     Fiber-Optic Communications 
rays. Then Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) occurs, which produces a quasi-
continuous spectrum over a large range of wavelengths. This “multi-Stokes 
emission” is used in instrumentation to generate very short pulses (less than 100 ps) 
with a very large spectrum.  
The Raman effect can also be used to obtain the optical amplification  of an 
incident wave corresponding to one of the multi-Stokes emission wavelength. Its main 
advantage is that only the frequency shift between pump and Stokes waves (and not the 
frequencies themselves) is imposed by the amplifier medium: any wavelength can be 
amplified, as long as the wavelength of the pump wave is chosen accordingly. However, 
the quantum efficiency of such amplification is very bad in the silica and requires 
sources of high power (YAG laser at 1.06 µm); that is why amplification in rare earth 
doped fibers was preferred (see Chapter 8).  
The advantage of the Raman amplification remains for future large number of 
wavelength systems, because it makes it possible to amplify wavelengths located 
outside of the erbium band and does not require special fibers: The line fiber itself 
becomes amplifying thanks to the pump wave.

is very low and is determined by a phase matching rule between optical and acoustic 
waves:

This wave is amplified with a Brillouin gain that is slightly higher than the 
Raman gain. From a certain threshold lower than for the Raman effect, it is the 
stimulated Brillouin scattering regime. 
However, this effect can only be observed if the pump wave is very coherent 
(line width of less than 100 MHz) In practice, it is only disturbing for coherent 
transmissions (based on phase or light frequency modulation).  
2.5.4. Kerr effect 
In non-linear isotropic materials, the electric flux density equals:  
D = ε0n E + χ (2) E2 + χ (3) E3 +. . .  
For reasons of molecular symmetry, there are no non-linearities of the second 
order in the silica, contrary to dielectric crystals. The dominant non-linear term is 
that of the third order which, in the presence of a wave of angular frequency ω, 
reveals:  
– a term in E3 cos 3ωt (tripling of frequency);  
– a term in 3E3 cos ωt which is equivalent to an index increase:  
∆(ε0n2) = ε0 2n ∆n = 3E2 χ(3) hence ∆n = n(2) I with: I =

This index increase (accompanied by an induced birefringence if the wave is 
polarized) is the optical Kerr effect, similar to the electric Kerr effect (induced by an 
external e electric field, ∆n being in e2). It is very low in the silica (n(2) value is  
3.2.10-20 m2/W).  
2.5.5. Consequences of the Kerr effect 
The Kerr effect leads to several phenomena:  
– self-phase modulation (SPM): the index variation causes a variation of the light 
phase which, at the end of length L, equals:  
∆φ = 2π n(2) λ
L I  
This effect can become sensitive if L is large, but also if the intensity is high, in 
particular over a long single-mode fiber length. 
If this intensity is modulated, a modulation of the light frequency, thus the 
wavelength, appears. In the presence of positive chromatic dispersion, this is the 
basis of a temporal pulse compression which can lead to the propagation of solitons 
(see section 2.5.6);  
– cross-phase modulation (XPM) by a non-linear mixing between the different 
carriers of a wavelength division multiplexed system; this effect limits the number of

experimentation (transfer of a signal from one wavelength to another in fact);  
– four wave mixing (FWM) by intermodulation between three wavelengths where 
propagation constants are related by a phase matching rule; it was used in parametric 
amplification experimentation, excessively difficult to set up;  
– self-focusing: in a single-mode fiber, the index will increase proportionally to 
the local light intensity, which is not constant (it is approximately Gaussian). An 
index gradient will then be created which, if the intensity is high, will focus the 
wave that will be “self-guided” with a very small mode diameter (this phenomenon 
can even exist in a homogenous environment). A stationary solution may be 
reached, called the spatial soliton (the non-linear effect exactly compensates 
diffraction) by analogy with the temporal soliton where the non-linear effect exactly 
compensates dispersion. Self-focusing constitutes a limit to very strong power 
transmission in a single-mode optical fiber.

2.5.6. Soliton propagation 
2.5.6.1. Description 
A soliton is a short pulse, preserving its form and amplitude throughout its 
propagation. It is a singular solution to a non-linear equation, the result of the 
conjunction of both dispersion and non-linearity phenomena (the Kerr effect 
explained previously). The self phase modulation effect leads to a wavelength 
modulation when intensity I varies:

λ increases on an rising pulse edge and decreases on a falling pulse edge.  
If the chromatic dispersion Dc is positive, the rising pulse edge corresponding to 
the highest wavelengths will slow down, whereas the falling edge will speed up for the 
opposite reason: we obtain a temporal pulse compression. If the chromatic dispersion 
is negative, the pulse widens. However, we obtain in this case a phenomenon similar 
with black solitons, an “engraved” pulse on a light background.  
2.5.6.2. Soliton equation 
In very precise conditions (form, pulse amplitude and duration), an equilibrium 
state between pulse compression and chromatic dispersion may be reached. 
The pulse is a solution of the non-linear propagation equation in a lossless 
single-mode fiber. This equation is in the general form of Schrödinger equations:

T0 is typically in the order of magnitude of 10 to 20 ps. Peak power

The soliton is a solution of the equation if it remains an “isolated” pulse, i.e. if 
the time interval separating two solitons (representing two “1” bits in a transmission 
system) remains slightly higher than T0 (approximately 5 times), otherwise there is 
coupling between the two consecutive solitons (see Figure 2.9). This typically limits 
the bitrate to 40 Gbit/s, in RZ format.

Soliton pulse propagation presumes that its form and power conserve 
themselves, then that it is amplified as propagation attenuates it. Thus, if the soliton

amplification that it becomes possible, by regularly re-amplifying them (all current 
20 to 30 km/hr), to obtain their propagation on very long distances. In addition, 
different wavelength solitons can be multiplexed on a single optical fiber: since 
each one of them is a solution of the non-linear equation for its own wavelength, 
they will not suffer from pulse broadening.  
Solitons can be transmitted at bitrates of a few dozen Gbit/s over thousands of 
kilometers, without pulse broadening, under the condition that they are often 
amplified. However, optical amplification accumulates noise which, by non-linear 
mixing, results in jitter in the frequency, or in the temporal position of solitons 
(Gordon-Haus jitter). This jitter, which evolves in z, is the main cause of error in 
soliton systems. Noise accumulation can be fought by using narrow optical filters 
that are slightly shifted from one amplifier to the other: solitons cross them by 
frequency sliding, thanks to the non-linear effect, whereas the noise corresponding 
to spontaneous transmission does not cross them. This frequency sliding filtering, 
which requires very precise settings, has made it possible to exceed 20,000 km 
without regeneration.  
To reach even greater distances, it is necessary to develop optical regeneration 
of solitons, to eliminate noise and jitter: this can be done with the help of electro-
absorption modulators which reshape pulses in a “temporal gate”. They require 
online clock recovery however. In 1996, CNET demonstrated a 20 Gbit/s 
transmission over a million kilometers with 140 km span between optical amplifier-
repeaters. Propagation over millions of kilometers makes it possible to consider optical 
memory made up of solitons turning in optical loops for seconds, or even minutes, for 
the development of “all optical” routing and temporal switching.  
Despite several laboratory research studies and the development of a few 
experimental links, the interest for solitons in the telecommunications field is set 
aside for now since less complex solutions for reaching throughput goals have 
emerged; however, even though they do not exactly use solitons, submarine links 
take non-linear effects into consideration in their modeling.  
2.6. Microstructured (photonic) optical fibers 
2.6.1. Introduction 
For the last few years, great interest in the scientific and manufacturing field has 
grown for new structures called microstructured fibers and optical guides, in other 
words presenting a periodic structure on a length of the same order of magnitude as 
the wavelength, most often created from holes periodically placed in silica. This 
periodicity in wave propagation leads to phenomena similar to the propagation of 

62     Fiber-Optic Communications 
electrons in a periodic crystal, and especially the appearance of a “photonic 
bandgap” (PBG) phenomenon which prohibits propagation at certain wavelengths or 
in certain directions. These structured materials are called, by analogy, “photonic 
crystals” or even “photonic fibers”.  
Table 2.1 presents analogies between these “photonic crystals” and 
semiconductor crystals. There are differences however, in particular the fact that 
photons do not interact with each other and, except for non-linear effects, cannot 
exchange energy.

Table 2.1. Analogies of photonic crystals 
Depending on the number of directions in which we encounter structure 
periodicity, photonic crystals will be (see Figure 2.10):  
– 1D for periodicity in one direction, which is performed by periodic stacking of 
thin layers perpendicular to this direction, for example interference filters and 
“Bragg mirrors” reflecting certain wavelengths for which elementary reflections on 
the different diopters are in phase;  
– 2D for periodicity in 2 directions, which takes the form of holes (or zones of 
different index) periodically placed and oriented in the 3rd direction; this is the case 
with fibers and “photonic” guides;  
– 3D following a periodic structure said to be “wood pile” or Yablonivite, after 
the name of its inventor Yablonovich, which has mostly led to developments in 
millimetric waves, but has started to exist in optics despite realization difficulties, 
with the help of microtechnologies and is applied to certain laser cavities, thus 
making the “light caging” idea a reality.  
The photonic crystal concept is not limited to optics: some developments exist in 
the field of microwaves, thus making the material microstructured, opaque at certain 
wavelengths. Finally, we should note that these structures exist in nature and explain 

Single-Mode Optical Fibers     63 
the color effects of butterfly wings, of certain bird feathers or of several precious 
stones.  
 
Figure 2.10. Photonic bandgap material 
2.6.2. Photonic bandgap 
The traditional diagram of energy bands in a semiconductor (electron energy 
according to its wavenumber in reciprocal space) has an equivalent for a photonic 
crystal of spatial period Λ.  
In the diagram in Figure 2.11 illustrating a z-direction 1D structure (a Bragg 
mirror), we represent in abscissa the wavenumber, normalized kΛ/2π over a period 
of the reciprocal network (from – 0.5 to + 0.5), and in ordinate the photon’s 
normalized energy, ωΛ/2πc (which is proportional to ν therefore to the energy of the 
photon). k is the wave vector component along z. Whereas in a homogenous 
environment, we would have lines of slope 1/n, in the periodic structure, the 
resolution of the propagation equation along z shows a curve distortion (this is 
another representation of the dispersion diagram) and the existence of bandgaps, i.e. 
ωΛ/2πc values which are never solutions.

In physical optics, it is the wavelengths for which we have constructive 
interferences between consecutive reflections, or λp = 2naΛ/p (p integer). The light 
will be totally reflected and will not be able to propagate in the material in direction z.

where na is the effective average index and their width increases with the index 
difference of alternate thin layers.  
In more complex structures (2D or 3D), wave vector components must be 
calculated by numerical modeling based on reciprocal crystal axes. The calculation 
becomes even more complex if the crystal can no longer be considered as infinite 
(i.e. if the number of periods is no longer very large). This calculation reveals partial 
bandgaps, i.e. frequencies for which the light cannot propagate in certain directions 
or polarizations, and total bandgaps where the light cannot be propagated in the 
material at all.  
2.6.3. Photonic waveguides 
In order to create a waveguide in a photonic bandgap material, the “crystal” 
periodicity must be broken by filling (or by not creating) the holes on the guide axis 
(Figure 2.12). This is the equivalent of dopants in a semiconductor, introducing 
authorized levels in the bandgap. The light can then propagate along the guide but it 
is confined, since it cannot propagate in the photonic crystal surrounding the guide.  
In planar integrated optics planar guides, the propagation axis is perpendicular to 
the holes (which are vertical and perpendicular to the horizontal substrate). The main 
advantage compared to traditional integrated optical guides (see Chapter 4) is the 
possibility of creating sharp angles in the guide, whereas in integrated optics the 
bend radius must be much larger to limit radiative losses. Several basic functions can 
be achieved with low congestion: Y junctions, coupled cavities, filters, etc. and are at 
the base of “photonic integrated circuits”. It is also a way to achieve optical 
interconnections in silicon integrated circuits.

2.6.4. Photonic crystal fibers 
Several types of photonic crystal fibers (PCF) can be created; in the first 
category the core is full and surrounded by micro-structured cladding. Now, in the 
photonic bandgap material, the holes are parallel to the light propagation axis (see 
Figure 2.13). Guiding can be interpreted as a consequence of the effective index in 
the cladding, which is the average between silica index and air index (weighted by 
the proportion of air in cladding, or “vacuum factor”) which is lower than the core 
index.

– their zero dispersion wavelength can be adjusted over a large range, including 
under the zero material dispersion wavelength; 
– they can present a very large negative chromatic dispersion, with a negative 
slope, making their use possible as compensating dispersion fibers; 
– they can support strong bendings without additional losses, which makes them 
attractive for internal cabling. 
Depending on their structure, all sorts of unusual properties can be achieved:  
– large mode diameter fibers, decreasing power density, therefore non-linear 
effects, making it possible to transport high power;  
– or, on the contrary, very low mode diameter fibers, voluntarily increasing non-
linear effects;  
– anisotropic structure fibers, birefringent, preserving the polarization;  
– concentric core and multiple core fibers;  
– photo-sensitive fibers, amplifying doped fiber, etc. 
However, they are more expensive and more difficult to connect than classical 
fibers, and despite significant technological progress, their attenuation remains high 
(not much better than 10 dB/km at best); they are therefore not suitable for long-
distance transmission, but for several special applications such as the design of fiber 
components.  
2.6.5. Hollow fibers 
One of the most spectacular applications of photonic crystals is the development 
of hollow-core fibers, surrounded by a micro-structured cladding (see Figure 2.14). 
Light guiding can only be explained by the effect of a photonic bandgap in the 
cladding, where the effective index is higher.  

Single-Mode Optical Fibers     67 
Due to the absence of material in the core, there is no longer absorption, thus 
possibility of transmitting strong power or wavelengths where silica is not 
transparent, particularly CO2 laser beams at 10.6 µm. There are no non-linear effects 
either, or Fresnel reflection at the ends. It is also possible to transport gases, fluid or 
even nano-objects in the hollow core.

3.1. Optical fiber materials and attenuation 
3.1.1. Different types of optical fibers  
The most widely used optical fibers in transmission are “all silica” fibers, made 
with silica, and germanium oxide core “doping” which determines index value and 
profile. As indicated in Table 3.1, they turn into multimode fibers, especially 
graded-index, and single-mode fibers. 
By erbium doping, they are also made into amplifying fibers. Plastic fibers, 
besides their lighting applications, progress for very short distance transmissions. 
There are other materials for much more specific applications.  
3.1.2. Intrinsic attenuation of silica fibers 
This comes from physical absorption and scattering phenomena in guidance 
material, and involves a lineic attenuation α, in dB/km, which means that the power 
transmitted to a distance L is given by:  
P(L) = P0.10- αL/10

P0 is the power that is coupled at the fiber input. As we will see later, this term is 
difficult to correctly measure.  
This attenuation α depends on material and wavelength λ. Generally, curve α(λ) 
reveals three phenomena (see Figure 3.1 for silica fibers):  
– Rayleigh scattering, because of light interaction with material, which scatters it 
rather isotropically. It decreases rapidly when the wavelength increases, following a 
λ-4 law; this is why the sky appears blue in fine weather. In the germanium oxide 
doped silica, attenuation in dB/km equals:  
αd = (0.75 + 66 ∆n+) λ−4  
with λ in µm, where ∆n+ is the absolute index difference between the germanium 
“doped” core and pure silica, hence the interest for a low level of germanium oxide 
or a depressed inner cladding structure. The Rayleigh scattering encourages the use 
of silica fibers in infrared. This phenomenon is used in a practical way in 
backscattering measures (see section 3.6.5);  
– absorption by the material occuring in infrared, limiting the range of 
transparency to approximately 0.8 µm in plastic (which only transmits visible light), 
1.7 µm in silica, but close to 5 µm for fluoride fibers can thus be used in infrared 
instrumentation;  
– selective absorption peaks by different impurities, the most disturbing in silica 
because of OH bonds at 1.39 µm, since this peak is located close to the minimum 
attenuation. To avoid it, the silica must have very low water level, lower than 10-7. 
Gradual elimination of this peak has been one of the major achievements in 
manufacturing, and attenuation is now very close to theoretical silica attenuation. 
This is far from being the case with fluoride fibers.  
Single-mode fibers generally present a lower intrinsic attenuation because of a 
lower level of germanium oxide. We note an attenuation peak characteristic of the 
cut-off wavelength of higher order modes on their attenuation curve (in fact, it is a 
simple way to measure it).  
Exceptional phenomena can lead to partially irreversible increases of the 
intrinsic attenuation. This is the case in particular:  
– with gas penetration, in particular hydrogen, in the fiber material;  
– with sensitivity to high energy radiations (nuclear and spatial fields) especially 
for fibers with a high level of germanium oxide.  

72     Fiber-Optic Communications 
These phenomena are used in gas or radiation sensors; in addition, reflectometry 
helps in localizing the exposed zone.  
 
Figure 3.1. Intrinsic attenuation of silica optical fibers 
3.1.3. Plastic fibers 
Plastic fibers enable a large diameter as well as a large numerical aperture, while 
being flexible and light; their attenuation is high but regular in the visible spectrum 
(see Figure 3.2). The most widely used material is polymethyl methacrylate 
(PMMA); polystyrene is also used for a large numerical aperture, but it is not as 
transparent.  
These fibers are widely used in short distance optical applications (lighting, 
visualization, display, etc.) in visible light. However, they are increasingly used for 
short distance data transmission (up to approximately 100 m), with visible LEDs 
(mainly red at 670 nm, but green can also be used and both colors can even be 
multiplexed), even at very high bitrates (100 Mbit/s). They are in fact very 
economical and easy to implement (in particular concerning connectors) for home 
automation, automobile, interconnections between computer equipment in a single 
location, benchmarks where they transport signals safe from electromagnetic 
parasites.

Graded-index plastic fibers are in development to transmit Gigabit Ethernet over 
100 m with red VCSEL diodes (see Chapter 6). Their use is envisaged for subscriber 
connections up to 300 m.  
The main limitations of plastic fibers involve environmental issues (temperature 
limited at approximately 80°C, bad resistance to humidity), and their lifetime is not 
completely known.  
 
Figure 3.2. Plastic optical fiber attenuation 
3.1.4. Other materials 
Silica-silicone (pure silica core, silicone cladding) fibers, also called PCS (plastic 
cladded silica), can have a large numerical aperture, while maintaining low 
attenuation and low sensitivity to radiations. However, they are more rigid and more 
expensive than plastic fibers, and are harder to use because of their heterogenous 
structure. Their main application is light energy transport (laser beams, optical 
power feeding), around 1 µm. 
In this family, hard clad silica (HCS), with a mechanical behavior that is closer 
to glass, are used in transmission or as sensors if high mechanical resistance is 
needed.  
Fluoride fibers are actually glassy mixtures of different fluorides: ZrF4, BaF2, 
LaF3, AlF3, NaF, etc., a composition summarized in the acronym ZBLAN. 
Their original advantage, a minimal attenuation lower than 0.01 dB/km, has 
remained completely theoretical because of major production and connection 
problems: not much better than 1 dB/km to 2.5 µm was ever reached and these fibers 
are very fragile.

Their main advantage is their transparency up to approximately 5 µm, and they 
are only used for some infrared instrumentation applications (see Chapter 11).  
Other materials exist, which are transparent over short lengths in far ultraviolet 
or infrared and have much more specific uses (medical instrumentation for 
example). 
Research has been carried out on chalcogenide fibers (made up of elements from 
the 6th column: S, Se, Te) or halides, which present some transparency at 10.6 µm; 
but losses are high and these materials are difficult to use; for CO2 laser beams, 
hollow fibers are now preferred (see Chapter 2).  
3.1.5. Transmission windows 
Due to optical fiber attenuation and dispersion, but also because of the 
characteristics of available optoelectronic components, transmission windows, are 
defined, which are wavelength bands with specific properties, within which 
wavelength division multiplexing can be practised.  
In plastic fibers, the window at 0.67 µm (red) is used for very short distance 
links (less than 100 m), to take advantage of components with good efficiency; the 
main advantage compared with the twisted pair is electric and electro-magnetic 
security. 
The fluoride fiber window, around 2.5 µm, is only used in infrared 
instrumentation.  
In silica fibers, three windows are traditionally distinguished; in wavelength 
sequence, which is also historically the sequence in which these windows have been 
used (see Table 3.2):  
– the first window, from 0.8 to 0.9 µm, is not an attenuation or dispersion 
minimum, but it is an optimum for the use of the most economical (and efficient) 
components: silicon for detectors, GaAs for transmitters; this window allows 
inexpensive short distance links or local area network over multimode fibers at low 
or medium bitrates. It has a new use for high bitrate short distance interconnections 
(Gbit/s and above), with VCSEL laser diodes over multimode fibers;  
– the second window, sometimes called “O band”, at approximately 1.3 µm, is a 
relative minimum of attenuation (around 0.5 dB/km) and a minimum of chromatic 
dispersion; the components are more expensive than at 0.85 µm, but it is commonly 
used in middle-range transmission (a few dozen kilometers) over single-mode fibers, 
as well as at high bitrates in local network (Fast Ethernet, FDDI), generally over 

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     75 
multimode fibers; with 1 and 10 gigabit Ethernet, single-mode fibers emerge in the 
market of local and metropolitan networks and subscriber access;  
– the third window, at approximately 1.55 µm, corresponds to the absolute 
minimum of attenuation (less than 0.2 dB/km) but requires more expensive 
components, because of the chromatic dispersion problem (monochromatic laser 
DFB diodes must be used, and eventually dispersion compensators). Used more 
recently, it is mostly used for long distance links over single-mode fibers (terrestrial 
or submarine) with ranges exceeding 100 km without amplifier, at bitrates of several 
Gbit/s. The optical amplification is used at this wavelength and large scale 
wavelength division multiplexing is practised. The 2nd and 3rd windows can also be 
multiplexed in both directions over the same fiber, which is performed in the new 
access network standard GPON.  
Nowadays, the “C band” (1,530 − 1,570 nm) is used; it could be widened to L 
(1,570 − 1,620 nm) and S (1,460 – 1,530 nm) bands to increase capacities, which is 
what is planned with the new ITU G 656 standard for multiplexed terrestrial 
networks (see Figure 3.1). Even the “E band” (extended) between the 2nd and 3rd 
windows in fibers “without OH peak” could be used, but it is not now necessary.

3.2. Manufacturing of optical fibers 
3.2.1. Principles 
Since glass making methods, long ago used to manufacture glass fibers, do not 
offer adequate purity for telecommunications, optical fibers are manufactured by 
synthesis in two steps: 

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     77 
– realization of a preform, a cylinder approximately 1 m long with a diameter of 
a few centimeters, homothetic to the future fiber;  
– drawing of this preform, to transform it into a fiber that is several dozen 
kilometers long.  
Plastic fiber preforms are manufactured by polymerization. Those for silica 
fibers are obtained by silica synthesis from chlorides, generally by oxidation 
reaction:  
SiCl4 + O2 → SiO2 + 2 Cl2  
and, for core germanium oxide:  
GeCl4 + O2 → GeO2 + 2 Cl2  
A chemical vapor-phase oxidation process is also used:  
SiCl4 + O2 + 2H2 → SiO2 + 4HCl and GeCl4 + O2 + 2H2 → GeO2 + 4HCl  
The oxide deposit is at first porous (amorphous state), it is then vitrified at high 
temperature. A little P2O5 phosphorus oxide is incorporated to decrease vitrification 
temperature, as well as fluorine, in the inner cladding, to compensate for the index 
increase created by the phosphorus oxide (or even to decrease the index in the 
depressed inner cladding fibers, see Chapter 2). There are several production 
processes.  
3.2.2. Manufacturing of preforms by the MCVD process 
The MCVD (modified chemical vapor deposition) process developed by Corning 
in the 1970s is the most widely used process outside of Japan. The internal deposit is 
carried out by concentric layers, obtained by oxidation within a rotating quartz tube 
(see Figure 3.3). Oxidation and vitrification are achieved in the heat of an external 
torch. The deposited layers correspond to the core and the inner part of optical 
cladding.  
The index of each layer can be controlled by the level of germanium chloride in 
the gas mix (chlorides + oxygen) sent into the tube, and a very precise index profile 
can be obtained. Once a hundred or so layers have been deposited, the tube 
gradually closes on itself by softening at higher temperature (collapsing operation).  
This process allows us to obtain fibers of very high quality, but a perfectly 
geometric tube is required at the start, and there is a limit in terms of speed of 
deposit and fiber length (the tube cannot be too thick). To increase it (up to several 

78     Fiber-Optic Communications 
hundred kilometers), different processes can be used to increase the quantity of 
cladding matter:  
– jacketing, i.e. shrinking around the preform of a second tube;  
– external lateral deposit of additional silica layers by CVD or by plasma.  
 
Figure 3.3. MCVD process for preform manufacturing 
One variation is the PCVD (plasma chemical vapor deposition) process in which 
the torch is replaced by an internal plasma, induced by a microwave reactor. The 
deposit speed can thus be increased and thicker tubes can be used to produce longer 
fibers. This high performance process requires very large investments however, and 
is not widely used.  
3.2.3. Preform manufacturing by external deposit  
These processes do not use deposit tubes. The oldest, OVPO (outside vapor 
phase oxidation), deposits concentric layers around an alumina mandrel; it is 
necessary to dry the tube before vitrifying it (see Figure 3.4a). This process is 
mainly used for step-index fibers.  
The VAD (vapor axial deposition) process, contrary to others, is not concentric 
but is done by preform axial growth, by hydrolysis or plasma (see Figure 3.4b). The 
porous deposit is immediately vitrified in drying gas. This process, mainly suited to 
step-index profiles, is extensively used in Japan, where very long fibers can be 
produced. It is often combined with lateral cladding deposit.

3.2.4. Drawing  
After its manufacturing, the preform is controlled: its index profile is measured 
by an optical process (laser beam refraction). Although “line drawing” experiments 
were carried out, it is preferable to keep the two distinct steps in order to enable this 
control.  
For certain applications, preform can be the subject of particular processes: 
(machining, etc.). For example, plastic fibers assembled in bundles, for image 
transmission, are made from square or hexagonal section machined preforms. CNET 
also demonstrated the feasibility of multi-core fibers. More recently, photonic 
bandgap fibers (see section 2.6) are drawn from the assembly of a large number of 
hollow tubes.  
Preform transformation into fiber is peformed by drawing with no contact, by 
preform extremity fusion in an induction furnace, filled with inert gas (see Figure 
3.5). The fused fiber goes down along the drawing tower, where its diameter is 
measured by a laser, which controls drawing speed to keep it constant. Drawing 
speeds are constantly increasing, now exceeding 10 m/s in production.  
The fiber is immediately covered with a primary coating, which is generally a 
resin that is polymerized with ultraviolet. It has a triple role:  
– it protects the glass against chemicals stresses;  
– it cushions constraints and prevents the propagation of cracks, especially at 
bending;  
– it absorbs cladding modes because of a slightly higher index.

Figure 3.5. Drawing 
Classical acrylate-epoxy type coatings, with a general diameter of 250 µm, do 
not modify transmission properties of the fiber, but have a limited temperature range 
(up to approximately 150ºC). For higher temperatures, special (polyimide) coatings 
exist, inducing some constraints on the fiber, hence additional attenuation. Metallic 
coatings can be used for very specific cases (sealing).  
Sometimes the fiber is coated with a more rigid secondary coating with an 
external diameter of 500 or even 900 µm. Most of the time, the fiber is provided and 
used with the simple primary coating (but never bare).  
3.2.5. Mechanical resistance  
Glass is very rigid material: the Young’s modulus for silica (relative 
constraint/elongation ratio) is higher than 70 GPa. For a 125 µm diameter optical 
cladding fiber, this corresponds to approximately 1% traction stretch of 1 daN.  
Their elongation is purely elastic, up to a break limit of 1.5 to 2% depending on 
manufacturing quality. Localized defects greatly decrease this limit. To eliminate 
them, at the end of drawing, the fiber goes through a test of mechanical resistance or 
screen-test, strong traction in a short amount of time, allowing us to verify that it has 
adequate mechanical resistance (see Figure 3.5).

On the other hand, plastic fibers are much less rigid, and are therefore more 
flexible even with larger diameters than 1 mm. They support elastic stretching of up 
to 6 or 7%, followed by a plastic distortion zone before their break. They thus keep a 
memory of mechanical stress (bending, constraints, etc.). Temperature and humidity 
greatly damage their characteristics.  
3.3. Optical fiber cables and connections 
3.3.1. Principle of optical fiber cables 
The role of the cable is to protect the optical fiber against mechanical (shocks, 
abrasion, constraints, stretching, excessive bending), chemical and thermal stresses. 
The result is an increase in weight, size and sometimes even attenuation, which must 
be as limited as possible.  
Cable structures are many and varied, depending on the number of fibers per 
cable (from 1 to more than 1,000), usage constraints, the presence of electrical 
conductors in the same cable to remotely feed equipment at end of line, or on the 
contrary the need for electrical insulation. “Exotic” structures exist such as thick and 
resistant cables used in crude oil exploration, and at the other end of the spectrum, 
there are thin “wires” connecting wire-guided engines, etc.  
In telecommunications, cables have greatly evolved since the grooved rod 
structure, where optical fibers were placed in the helical grooves of a cylindrical rod, 
thanks to progress achieved in the mechanical resistance of optical fibers. In fact, 
cables are traditionally pulled into underground conduits, which implies adapted 
mechanical resistance. For access networks, cable blowing is increasingly practised.  
However, three main categories can be distinguished, by the way the optical 
fiber is placed in the cable.  
3.3.2. Different cable types 
3.3.2.1. Tight structure cables 
These cables generally only contain one fiber. Several layers of components are 
placed concentrically around the fiber (see Figure 3.6a). Size is reduced (near 1 mm 
diameter, sometimes even less) and connector performance is easier. On the other 
hand, the fiber is not isolated from constraints (compression or stretching).  

82     Fiber-Optic Communications 
With silica fibers, tight structure uses are limited to short distance “indoor 
cabling” (aeronautics, computer systems, in-building cabling, in particular when the 
fiber-optic cable is vertical). They are more systematic with plastic fibers.  
 
Figure 3.6. Structures of optical fiber cables: 
 a) tight structure; b) loose tube structure; 
 c) multi-tube loose structure 
3.3.2.2. Free structure cables 
The classic example of this type of cable is the loose tube, where the fiber is free 
inside a small tube with a diameter of 1 to 2 mm (see Figure 3.6b). It is no longer 
subject to mechanical compressions transversally occurring on the tube; this tube 
must however be reinforced with steel or kevlar strength members protecting it from 
stretching or compression. In general, there is one fiber per tube, sometimes two or 
more (their coating can be colored to locate them).  
Cables of this type are widely used in manufacturing and information 
technology, video links and local networks among other applications. They are also 
made into multi-fiber cables by combining tubes, similarly to electric cables, around 
a central strength member (see Figure 3.6c). Splitting and connection of the different 
fibers are then made easier. A bigger size is the drawback of this structure. However, 
this technique has improved and new “microtube” cables, each containing several

fibers, are emerging on the market and enable high capabilities with reduced size, 
making installation easier.  
3.3.2.3. Compact structure cables 
For long distance networks, or in distribution networks, cables with very large 
capacity (over 1,000 fibers!) with low size are used. Ribbon structure cables, which 
is on old technology (it was one of the first multi-fiber structures developed by Bell 
in the 1970s), currently dominate the large capacity cable market. Their principle is 
to stack polymer ribbons, each containing from 8 to 12 parallel fibers (see Figure 
3.7). A stack of ribbons located in a small tube contains approximately 100 fibers 
and a large number of tubes can be combined.  
 
Figure 3.7. Stripe cable 
Mass splicing techniques (simultaneous splicing of all the fibers of one stripe) 
have been developed for this type of cable.  
3.3.2.4. Aerial cables  
These are placed over high voltage lines, in particular in and around “overhead 
ground cables” (cables acting as a lightning conductor). They enable electric (or 
railway) network operators to build transmission or remote monitoring networks by 
using their existing infrastructures; the optical fiber is the only one capable of 
operating in these conditions. Their high transmission capacities are rented to 
telecom operators to be used as transport network. Lighter aerial cables can also be 
used for subscriber links.  
3.3.2.5. Submarine cables 
They build the infrastructure of a worldwide communications network with 
constantly growing range and capacity, even though this growth is highly cyclical. 
As well as large trans-oceanic links, short or average distance submarine links 
without repeater (between islands and shores, or in “festoons” between coastal

cities, which is more economical than by shore) constitute a growing market 
segment.  
As with aerial cables, submarine cables have to go through considerable stress 
(several dozen tons during the laying of a submarine cable) in addition to the sea 
bottom pressure, and their possible repair is difficult and expensive. They must 
therefore have considerable mechanical resistance and because of this, they are 
made up of an optical core which is generally a tube containing fibers or ribbons, 
and placed inside a steel cable strand, protecting it and making it resistant to stress.  
In long distance submarine cables, a layer of copper leads repeater remote power 
feeding current, of about one amp, the return is ensured by sea. The cable is 
electrically isolated by polyethylene, the voltage reaches dozens of kV at the 
extremities of a trans-oceanic link. The whole cable only has a diameter of a few cm 
(see Figure 3.8). Cables submerged at medium depth (up to 800 m) are protected 
against cut-off risks (anchors, fishing tools) by a layer of steel cables and are 
“embedded” (buried in the bottom sand) close to coasts.  
 
Figure 3.8. Submarine fiber-optic cables 
3.3.3. Connection of optical fibers 
In order to ensure long length cables, fibers are connected in a definitive way by 
a splice or fused-splice. 
To build a network, components such as end interfaces, splitters, etc. can be 
connected by connectors if it must be able to be uninstalled, but permanent 
connections can also be made.

Despite realized progress, connections remain a tricky issue with optical fibers 
because of the disruptions they generate, the very high precision required and cost 
(in material and labor). That is why single-mode fiber systems are more expensive 
than multimode fiber systems, whereas the fibers themselves are relatively 
inexpensive.  
End to end permanent connecting of two optical fibers can be carried out:  
– by fused splice: mostly done by electric arc, more rarely with flame or laser; 
this technique provides better optical and mechanical results, but requires expensive 
material (automatic splicing machines exist, achieving optimal fiber alignment). 
Good splicing machines commonly reach losses lower than 0.05 dB per weld;  
– by glued splice: fibers must already be in place in a common alignment support 
(groove, tube, etc.). This technique, more manual and requiring less investment, is 
the only one suitable for plastic or fluoride fibers. Mass splicing techniques have 
been developed for the collective connection of multi-fiber cables.  
In both cases, transmission losses are very low because they are mainly limited 
to losses caused by misaligment; particularly reflection being zero. Size is very 
small (once a mechanical protection has been rebuilt, two spliced fibers have the 
same size as one fiber). 
This operation is tricky, however: fibers must be perfectly bared and cleaved (in 
other words break the glass under tension from a tool-made fracture), and aligned 
with great precision. A slight angle in the cleaved section leads to loss by 
misalignment.  
3.3.4. Optical connectors 
3.3.4.1. Description 
When connections must have the ability to be uninstalled (transmitting and 
receiving interfaces, network nodes), connectors must be used, which are more 
expensive and cause more perturbations than splices. In fact, beside attenuation that 
is generally higher (since the alignment is not as precise, and spacing losses are 
added), the connectors are liable to cause retroreflections, which are very disturbing 
if the light returns toward a laser diode or an optical amplifier.  
Connection by connector is actually made up of a plug in each section of cable, 
permanently mounted by the provider or user, and an intermediate adaptor between 
two cables, or a fixed connector containing an optoelectronic component (called an 
“active base”). The main part of a connector is the ferrule, a device for very high 
 

86     Fiber-Optic Communications 
 precision fiber alignment, which will be guided to the other ferrule (or to the 
component of the active fixed connector) by an alignment device. The fiber is glued, 
or crimped, in the ferrule. It is separated from the locking device ensuring some 
mechanical resistance. There are also connectors that can be taken off, mostly used 
in the laboratory or for measurements.  
Criteria for choosing an optical connector are mainly:  
– positioning precision and reproductibility, depending on the ferrule material 
(plastic, metal or ceramic);  
– the existence (or absence) of a bayonet type device demanding location of 
connector orientation, improving connection reproductibility; this orientation is 
mandatory in the case of polarization-maintaining fibers or angled cleavage 
connectors;  
– the ways that may be used to prevent retroreflections. This point is essential: 
light returns caused by the Fresnel reflection can be very disturbing (source 
disruption, crosstalk on duplex connections).  
3.3.4.2. Anti-reflection connectors 
Several techniques exist (see Figure 3.9):  
– using index matching liquid: this traditional solution is not very practical to use 
(dust problems, etc.);  
– applying slight pressure maintaining fibers in longitudinal contact: this solution 
is efficient if the ferrule is polished with a slightly convex form (PC type connectors, 
physical contact, which must be handled with care);  
– angled cleavage of fibers (approximate angle of 8º), the solution now widely 
used with single-mode fibers (APC type connectors, angle physical contact): the 
reflected light deviates and is not retro-guided by the input fiber, even if there is no 
fiber connected. Mounting these connectors is trickier.  
With these methods, a very high return loss: (10 log of the incident 
power/reflected power ratio) can be obtained: 50 to 70 dB.  

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     87

3.3.4.3. Different connector types 
There is a large number of optical connectors on the market. A certain number of 
de facto standards have been imposed (see Table 3.3), the most popular of which are 
ST for local multimode fiber networks, FC/PC for single-mode links, SC for 
computer networks, which is easy to handle because of indexing, now succeeded by 
LC, with a smaller form factor. High precision but expensive and fragile connectors 
developed in early fiber-optic systems have disappeared from the market.  
The emphasis is put on the cost and robustness of connectors. There are also 
connectors with two or more fibers, such as the FDDI network connector, or more 
recently MT/RJ and duplex LC, but their use remains limited. Finally, there are all 
sorts of connectors specific to particular environments (production or military 
applications) that are impervious, with widened beams, electrical/optical mixed, etc. 
and even optical rotating joints to connect rotating machines or radars.

3.4. Extrinsic fiber-optic losses 
These losses are leaks of light outside the guide caused by deformations or 
discontinuities. The amount of loss is directly related to the cabling and connection 
technologies used.  
3.4.1. Losses by bending 
When bending lowers by a few centimeters, high order modes are refracted in 
the cladding (see Figure 3.10) and lower order modes can leak (this is the case of the 
fundamental mode in single-mode fibers). Losses can also occur by microbending in 
the case of mechanical constraints in the fiber. In addition, mode conversion and 
birefringence effects appears, which are used in certain mechanical sensors.  
The purpose of using an adequate cable structure is to avoid losses and protect 
the optical fiber(s) that it contains. Single-mode fibers are rather less sensitive to 
bending than multimode fibers (but their losses quickly increase with the mode 

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     89 
diameter, therefore with the wavelength); this sensitivity generally decreases when 
the core/cladding index difference increases hence the advantage for high numerical 
aperture fibers in cabling where a higher risk of strong bending exists (in buildings 
for example).  
 
Figure 3.10. Losses by: a) bending; b) microbending 
These phenomena have useful applications, however: they can be used to extract 
the light from a fiber (and also to inject it), in ways other than at its extremity. 
This is for example used to locally measure (and minimize) a connection loss, or 
in traffic control, tools containing two receivers detecting the presence and direction 
of the light in the fiber. 
One consequence is that in certain cases it is possible to detect the signal 
circulating in the fiber, but the attenuation caused by bending can then be 
immediately detected and located by reflectometry (see section 3.5.5).  
3.4.2. Losses at connections 
Connection between two fibers, whether by splicing or with connectors, must be 
done with care and precision to minimize losses.  
3.4.2.1. Causes of losses 
There are three types of losses at connections:  
– loss by Fresnel reflection during consecutive light crossing of two air-glass 
interfaces. This loss is of 8% (or 0.35 dB) and reflected light may create disruptions. 
It can be avoided by splicing or by using adapted techniques in the case of 
connectors (see section 3.3.4);  
– loss caused by difference between parameters (diameters and numerical 
apertures) of two fibers; this difference would come from manufacturing tolerance

on diameters, indices and core-cladding concentricity. The improvement in 
manufacturing processes tightens tolerances (they are now at 0.5 µm in single-mode 
fiber mode field diameter);  
– loss caused by bad relative positioning of the two fibers (see Figure 3.11):  
- transversal et off centering between fiber cores; may be due to core-cladding 
concentricity error;  
- misalignment of angle Dα (in radians in charts and formulae); it is generally 
the consequence of a bad cleavage;  
- longitudinal spacing De, in the types of connectors that do not put fibers into 
contact.  
Losses caused by these last two causes depend on the presence of air (n0 = 1) or 
index-matching liquid (n0 ≈ 1.5) between both fiber faces; this in fact changes light 
divergence at the fiber output.  
3.4.2.2. Calculation in multimode fibers 
In the case of a difference in diameter 2a or numerical aperture ON between both 
fibers, indexed 1 and 2 (the light goes from 1 to 2), there is a loss, in dB, of:  
20 log 
2
1
a
a if a1 > a2; 20 log 
2
1
ON
ON if ON1 > ON2  
In the opposite direction losses are generally lower; this non-reciprocity of these 
losses can be explained by that of modal distribution.  
Losses caused by bad positioning can be approximately calculated by the 
geometric optic (ray launch method), and the results are given in decibels in the 
form of a chart (see Figure 3.11).  
When they are low, losses due to each cause are added (in first order). However, 
these calculations suppose a uniform distribution of the optical power and are 
therefore not very precise and somewhat pessimistic.

We deduce loss in dB: A = − 10 log T; this loss is reciprocal. In the Gaussian 
fields and low error hypothesis, this calculation gives losses in dB, which again add 
in first order between the different causes (see Table 3.4).  
3.4.3. Fiber optics optimization

Table 3.5. Optical fiber optimization criteria 

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     93 
A compromise needs to be reached, which will depend on conditions of use: 
bending, constraints, connection frequency and precision. For short links with a 
large number of connections such as networks or distribution, a multimode fiber 
with high diameter and numerical aperture is optimal (that is why fiber 85/125 was 
specified for video distribution, but 62.5/125 is the one that has taken over, 
especially for computer networks). 
These fibers pick up a stronger signal from the transmitter. For longer or higher 
throughput point-point links, lower diameter and numerical aperture such as 50/125 
are preferable.  
In the case of long links over single-mode fibers, we can numerically determine 
parameters optimizing attenuation and dispersion according to conditions of use, by 
trying to make extrinsic losses insignificant. 
 That is why submarine links use optimized fibers with different values from 
terrestrial fibers.  
3.5. Optical fiber measurements 
3.5.1. Classification 
Optical fiber measurements are divided into two categories:  
– fiber parameter measurements: these are multimode fiber geometric parameters 
(optical cladding and core diameters, numerical aperture) optically measured; for 
single-mode fibers, since these parameters are not directly accessible because of 
diffraction, mode diameter and cut-off wavelength are measured. These 
measurements are mainly performed by the optical fiber manufacturer;  
– transmission parameter measurements, which are of direct interest to the user. 
The user may actually have to redo these measurements, in particular after optical 
cable installation in the network, which can modify some initial fiber performances.  
3.5.2. Geometric measurements for multimode fibers 
This concerns core and cladding diameters, and numerical aperture. They can be 
deduced from simple geometric measurements on the light beam at the fiber output:  
– the core diameter by the measurement of the near field;  
– numerical aperture by the measurement of the far field (radiation pattern). In 
practice, the effective numerical aperture of the cone is measured:  

94     Fiber-Optic Communications 
- ONeff = sin θeff at 10% (or 5%) of the maximum. This is lower than the 
theoretical numerical aperture, because of the stronger attenuation of the higher 
order modes, which makes this curve smoother than the theoretical one.  
These measurements must be done at mode equilibrium, after elimination of 
cladding modes. In order to do this, a mode scrambler is used (a device creating 
microbending in the fiber, hence strong mode coupling). The source must be a light-
emitting diode, to avoid modal noise that a coherent source would create.  
The numerical aperture can also be directly measured by injecting light beam in 
the optical fiber under a variable angle, until this beam is no longer guided in the 
fiber. This method, although closer to the theoretical definition, is only suitable for 
step index fibers, where selective mode excitation can be carried out by this method.  
3.5.3. Measurements of single-mode fibers parameters 
Due to diffraction, it is not possible to directly measure the core diameter or 
index difference. The single-mode fiber is characterized by its secondary parameters 
(see Chapter 2): the cut-off wavelength and the mode field diameter. These values 
are important in predicting single-mode fiber attenuation and dispersion.  
Different methods have been developed, the main one being the variable aperture 
lens method, which is an optical method consisting of measuring the coupling 
efficiency of a Gaussian beam whose aperture is varied. 
They require complex equipment and are only carried out by the fiber 
manufacturer. Determination of 2w0 by the far field is more simple but less precise.  
A good estimation of the cut-off wavelength can be made from the spectral 
attenuation curve. In fact, just above λc, the mode LP11 is guided but with much 
loss, resulting in abruptly dropping additional attenuation when λ reaches λc, 
because the mode LP11 is no longer guided (see Chapter 2).  
3.5.4. Spectral attenuation measurement 
This involves all fibers. The goal is to measure curve α(λ) (see Figure 3.1). In 
order to do this, for each wavelength λ, is calculated:

10log[P(L
−
 where L1 is the initial fiber length  

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     95 
The power P is measured at the end of this length. To determine intrinsic 
attenuation of the optical fiber, the injected power must be known. In order to do 
this, the fiber is cut at the end of a short L2 length, at the end of which the mode 
equilibrium must be established with the help of a mode scrambler, the power is 
measured once again. The global attenuation is deduced, which is then reduced to 
the unit of length. 
This method, called cut-back, is illustrated in Figure 3.12. We can observe that it 
is a destructive method which is only practised once, during fiber manufacturing. Its 
quality can be controlled with good precision, but only gives average fiber 
attenuation and cannot be practised once the fiber is installed in the network. That is 
why the most widely used method is reflectometry.  
 
Figure 3.12. Spectral attenuation measure of optical fibers 
3.5.5. Reflectometry measurement  
3.5.5.1. Principle 
Optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) is a method of fiber optic 
characterization from a single extremity, which not only measures reflections, but 
also attenuation, based on backscattered light (it is also called backscattering 
measurement). Even though this technique uses relatively expensive equipment, it is 
much used by fiber manufacturers, installers and network operators because it makes 
it possible to measure and monitor installed links.

It operates as illustrated in Figure 3.13. At moment t0, a brief pulse of duration 
δτ is sent into the fiber by a laser diode. 
With the help of a splitter, a large band and highly sensitive receiver observes the 
light that the fiber sends by reflection and Rayleigh scattering. The signal received at 
moment t0 + t comes from the point located at distance:  
z = t.vg/2 with vg = c/n1 group velocity in the optical fiber  
 
Figure 3.13. Reflectometry 
The t/z ratio is very close to 10 ns/m. Due to this, the measure can be time-
resolved. In the first approximation, spatial resolution will be:  
δz = δτ.vg/2 
the minimum distance between two points which can be distinguished on the curve, 
without having to use complex signal processing. High resolution (better than 1 m) 
requires short pulses (less than 10 ns).

3.5.5.3. Reflectometry curve interpretation 
Reading the curve (see Figure 3.14) helps in measuring fiber attenuation as well 
as locating its variations, due for example to defects, bending or constraints. 
Reflection peaks localize cracks; the end of fiber reflection measures its length 

98     Fiber-Optic Communications 
precisely. In particular, connectors can be characterized in transmission and 
reflection once the connection is established. This instrumentation also makes it 
possible to remotely measure attenuation or reflection caused by sensors placed 
along the fiber.  
 
Figure 3.14. Reflectometry curve 
Entry reflection peak is quite a hindrance because it saturates the receiver for a 
time corresponding to several dozen meters of fiber, creating a blind zone at the start 
of the link. To avoid this, notably in local networks, it is necessary to insert a fiber 
pigtail between the equipment and the beginning of the fiber to be characterized.  
A localized attenuation (splicing, bending, etc.) is directly measured by the 
height of the step separating the two fiber sections, when they have the same S 
factor. If that is not the case, the measures taken in both directions must be averaged.  
In certain cases, “ghost” peaks can emerge at twice the distance of the distance to 
the connector; this is a part of the pulse that has traveled two times consecutively in 
the fiber. They are recognizable by their location, and by the absence of attenuation, 
contrary to a connector.  
3.5.5.4. Dynamics 
An important parameter of a reflectometer is its dynamics, the difference in dB 
between the power scattered by the fiber input and the minimum power Prmin, 
required at receiver for a given signal-to-noise ratio:

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     99 
In this theoretical definition (bidirectional dynamics), D allows us to characterize 
a total fiber attenuation of D/2. In order to simplify the interpretation of measures, in 
practice the unidirectional dynamics is used, equal to D/2 then to the maximum fiber 
attenuation. There are two official definitions:  
– the RMS dynamics (unidirectional) where Prmin is the rms (root mean square) 
noise level;  
– the CEI dynamics (unidirectional) where Prmin is the level containing 98% of 
the noise.  
The dynamics can be increased by increasing the pulse duration, or S, but the 
resolution decreases. In order to optimize the measurement, reflectometers can 
generally transmit different pulse lengths, from a few ns to a few hundred ns, with 
automatic or manual selection of the appropriate duration.  
In addition, the equipment generally practices an average between N measures, 
which improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 5 log N (but increases acquisition time). 
More complex processes exist, for example by deconvolution, enabling us to 
improve the resolution without reducing the dynamics.  
Current reflectometers require us to disconnect the link in order to measure it. 
New equipment has emerged that uses a specific wavelength to perform the 
measurement simultaneously with the traffic using other wavelengths. Located 
above WDM bands (1,625 nm wavelength is reserved for this purpose), this 
wavelength also has the advantage of being more sensitive to bending and thus 
better detecting constraints in the cable.  
3.5.6. Bandwidth measurement 
This is the multimode fiber bandwidth. It is most often measured with the help of 
the time-domain response h(t), from where the pulse broadening ∆τim caused by 
intermodal dispersion is deduced (see Chapter 1). A laser diode is used to deliver 
very short input pulses e(t) and to avoid creating chromatic dispersion.  
The time-domain response is determined by a deconvolution: in fact, the pulse 
measured at the fiber output, s(t), is given by the convolution product:  
s(t) = ∫
+∞
∞
−
−τ)h(τ)dτ
e(t
 

100     Fiber-Optic Communications 
Deconvolution calculation also provides the transfer function H(f), the Fourier 
transform of h(t). This transfer function represents the light modulation by an 
electric sine signal with a frequency f, which experiences attenuation that is larger 
the higher the pulse widening. This response is normalized with respect to H(0), 
measured to a modulation frequency that is zero or very low, making it possible to 
take into account the attenuation of the optical power by the fiber.  
The optical fiber bandwidth can deduced from the diagram:

 (see Figure 1.15)  
It can also be measured by a traditional frequency analysis: a network analyzer 
measures H(f), by using a short link between transmitter and receiver as reference, in 
order to take into consideration inherent interface response. 
It is necessary to carry out these two measures at mode equilibrium, by using a 
mode scrambler.  
3.5.7. Chromatic dispersion measurement 
This is performed for single-mode fibers, but we must not forget that it also 
exists for multimode fibers, especially at 0.85 µm. In their case, the chromatic 
dispersion factor is very close to material dispersion given by diagrams.  
The principle is to measure Dc = dτg/dλ where τg is the light group delay by unit 
of length in the fiber, and which depends on the wavelength. This measure is 
difficult, because very short pulses (a few hundred ps) have to be generated over a 
large range of wavelengths. The main method consists of measuring τg(λ) point by 
point, by using several laser diodes of shifted wavelengths, working in pulses and 
the result is:

where λi + 1 and λi are two neighboring wavelengths. 
τg(λ) is the group delay, i.e. τ(λ)/L, where L is the fiber length, and τ(λ) the 
global propagation time. The use of tunable wavelength laser diodes provides this 
curve in a continuous way instead of point by point.  

Fiber Optics Technology and Implementation     101 
There are other indirect but very precise methods using phase shift of a sine 
signal of frequency f modulating the light of wavelength λ .  
Chromatic dispersion measurements are also applied to dispersion compensation 
devices (described in Chapter 5) such as Bragg gratings equalizers, the goal being 
then to measure their slope dτ/dλ in ps/nm.  
3.5.8. Polarization measurements 
With the increase of bitrates in very long links, these are increasingly important. 
They involve single-mode optical fibers, because of the polarization mode 
dispersion (PMD), as well as passive optical components where attenuation and 
even propagation time may depend on light polarization (respectively characterized 
by PDL (polarization dependent loss) and DGD (differential group delay) measured 
in ps per component). Very high precision benchmarks analyze attenuation and 
group propagation time according to light polarization.  
To measure polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in ps/ km , pulse ∆τp widening 
has to be measured according to fiber length, in maximum coupling conditions 
between polarization modes, while being freed from chromatic dispersion with the 
help of compensating devices. Remember that measured PMD in the fiber may not 
be found again in practice because of cable effects (bending, constraints, etc.).

4.1.2. Technologies used 
Fiber-optic assembly based technologies, used for the development of passive 
functions such as couplers (see Chapter 5), are advantageous because of their very

Table 4.1. Fiber optics system components 
Integrated optics technologies offer much better reproductibility of the 
components, which are created by masking techniques on dielectric or 
semiconductor substrates, and a much larger variety of functions, notably with the 
possibility of integrating different functions, including light emission and reception. 
Losses are higher, however, especially at the connections (see section 4.1.5). The 
three families of material used are:  
– glass, of very low loss level, with index close to 1.5; they only enable passive 
functions, except if they are doped for making amplifiers;  
– dielectric crystals, notably lithium niobate LiNbO3, with index close to 2.2, 
where the electrooptic effect creates active functions with very high operating 
frequencies;  
– semiconductors, particularly III-V, with a high index (3.5), with higher losses, 
but where, in addition to the previous functions, optoelectronic (transmission, 
reception, amplification) and electronic, logical or analog functions can be 
developed. A few integrated optics applications in silicon exist: guides, filters, 
interferometers, sensors.  
Finally, photonic crystal type technologies (see Chapter 2), generally on silica, 
are beginning to be used to create much more compact guides.

4.1.3. Integrated optics planar guides 
Due to their manufacturing technology, they are generally asymmetric 
rectangular section guides: the planar guide is a thin layer of index n1 and is inserted 
between a substrate of slightly lower index n2, and a coating of index n3 that is 
lower than n2 (see Figure 4.1).

Figure 4.1. Dielectric planar guide in integrated optics 
As we have seen in Chapter 1, the asymmetric dielectric planar guide model 
exhibits a non-zero cut-off frequency for the fundamental mode, by mode refraction 
in the substrate.  
Moreover, this cut-off wavelength depends on polarization, and it is possible to 
have a guide which only guides mode TE0 but not mode TM0, i.e. which polarizes 
light. Another consequence is that the fundamental mode field has an asymmetric 
transverse distribution, extending more in the substrate than in coating (see  
Figure 4.1).  
4.1.4. Lateral guiding 
In most devices, the guide is laterally limited to a width A by one of the following 
production processes (see Figure 4.2):  
a) relief stripe, not much used;  
b) stripe obtained by diffusion from the substrate surface, or by ionic exchange, 
which is a technology that is widely used with glass; in silicon, oxidation from the 
surface helps to create the silica guide;  

106     Fiber-Optic Communications 
c) induced guide by a deposited dielectric stripe (which increases the effective 
β/k0 index in this stripe) or by an electrode (operating by electrooptic effect, in 
active material);  
d) buried stripe in the substrate, by epitaxy, technology mainly used with 
semiconductors (for diode lasers in particular). In principle, it corresponds to the 
symmetric guide case.  
 
Figure 4.2. Creation of integrated optics guides with: 
 a) in relief; b) scattered; c) induced; d) buried guide 
Lateral guiding is then ensured by total reflections to the guide’s limits, or, for 
induced guides, by the graded index created in the guiding layer. In this rectangular 
guide, HEmp modes (or EHmp depending on their polarization) will be observed 
with:  
m = transversal order, p = lateral order 
equal to the number of nodes of the field in each direction.  
As with fiber optics, numerical resolution of propagation equations makes it 
possible to trace dispersion diagrams: B, normalized propagation constant of each 
mode, versus the normalized frequency V and the width to height ratio (A/d) of the 
guide.  
Lateral field distribution follows a sine law in the guide, and decreasing 
exponential outside (evanescent field zone). Lateral field distribution of the

fundamental mode is Gaussian-like (see Figure 4.4). In most applications, integrated 
optic guides are used in single mode.  
4.1.5. Losses in guides 
Losses in integrated optics components can be divided into three categories:  
– absorption losses  in guides, by the following phenomena:  
- absorption by impurities, very low because of technological progress;  
- absorption specific to semiconductors: interband (photons are absorbed by 
carriers located in the bandgap) and intraband (photons increase the energy of 
conduction band carriers) absorption. 
Absorption is the major cause of loss in semiconductors, satisfactory values of 
approximately 0.1 dB/cm are now reached;  
– scattering losses, mainly due to non-homogenities of guide volume and 
surface; this is the main cause of loss, although quite low, in dielectrics;  
– radiative losses out of the guide, at angles and bendings which are necessary 
for the implementation of complex forms in components. They can be limited by 
giving a relatively strong value to the substrate guide index difference, with a 
resulting large mode mismatching with optical fibers. These losses are generally 
difficult to calculate and numerical methods must be used, such as BPM (beam 
propagation method) software. In the future, photonic crystal structures with their 
very strong bending and large angles will be able to avoid these losses;  
– losses to the access of the guide which often constitute the major part of losses 
involved in the use of integrated optics components. They come in part from the 
large index difference, and from mode mismatching between guides and optical 
fibers, or sources, to which guides are connected. Butt-joint coupling between a 
guide and another guide, a laser diode or an optical fiber, requires very precise 
alignment of the different elements and generally a lens, external or integrated in 
guides. Some devices integrate a mode matching guide section, for example of 
variable width; a diffraction grating can also be used (see section 4.3.3) to limit 
these losses.  
4.2. Mode coupling and its applications 
Coupling between the modes of one guide or between neighboring guides has 
several applications. The general formalism is that of mode coupling.  

108     Fiber-Optic Communications 
4.2.1. Formalization 
When two guided waves A and B, with fields as expression:  
EA = A(z) exp j(ωAt − βAz)  and EB = B(z) exp j(ωBt − βBz)  
exchange energy, their complex amplitudes A(z) and B(z) vary:  
dz
dA  = κAB.B exp(− jδz) and dz
dB  = κBA.A exp(− jδz) with δ = 
2
β
 
 
β
B
A −
  
Term δ, the phase mismatch parameter, shows that coupling can only be 
complete between matched guides (δ = 0), but it can be partial between mismatched 
guides, as with resonators.  
Terms κAB and κBA are coupling coefficients by unit of length. Their expression 
depends on the physical phenomenon which caused coupling. In linear mediums, 
this can only happen between waves of the same frequency (that is if ωA = ωB). If 
the phenomenon is reciprocal, we have κAB = κBA.  
4.2.2. Coupling within a single guide 
Within a single guide, we can observe:  
– coupling between two modes of a single multimode guide. Zero in theory, 
because of mode orthogonality, it emerges in the event of guide perturbations 
(constraints, non-homogenities), constituting mode coupling which plays an 
important role in multimode fiber propagation;  
– coupling between both directions in the same guide, even single-mode. It can 
for example, be caused by Rayleigh backscattering. In integrated optics, it can be 
deliberately caused by a diffraction grating of spatial period π/β, causing a very 
wavelength-selective distributed reflection.  
A strong mode coupling in both directions can also be created by modifying the 
core diameter (tapered fiber technique for filters and splitters).  
By noting as L the length of the coupling zone, and by assuming energy 
conservation:

where * indicates conjugated complex. We then obtain:  
AB*.κAB* + A*B.κAB = BA*.κBA* + B*A.κBA 
which demands κAB = κBA* = κ. This coupling coefficient must be real since κAB = 
κBA.

4.2.3. Coupling between matched guides 
When, in a single substrate, two parallel neighbor guides are created close to one 
another, they can be coupled with the help of evanescent fields (see Figure 4.4). The

hence the solution (see Figure 4.4):

The term in − j indicates that the coupled field B is in late phase quadrature in 
relation to field A. 
 
The solution shows that total and periodic energy exchange occurs between 
matched guides: in fact, energy has completely passed from guide A to guide B at 
the end of a conversion length: 

Integrated Optics     111 
 
Lc = 2κ
π   
Since this phenomenon depends on the wavelength, it is possible to create devices 
(integrated guide or edge-fused single-mode fibers, devices in which both cores are 
very close within a certain length) which will be in parallel state for λ1 and in cross 
state for λ2, i.e. two-way wavelength division multiplexers. They are more selective 
than filter multiplexers. They can be used as interleavers (see Chapter 5). In fact, α, β 
and γ (wave vector components) are approximately in 1/λ. The dominant term in κ is 
in e-D/λ (D is the distance between cores) which increases with λ. L/Lc, the ratio 
proportional to κ, will also increase with λ. Each time it goes through an odd integer, 
there is total coupling, these are values λ1, λ3, λ5, etc. exiting by the second fiber. 
Each time it goes through an even integer value, coupling is zero, they are values λ2, 
λ4, λ6, etc. exiting by the first fiber and which are interleaved with the first comb. The 
values are all the more tightened the larger p, and thus the ratio L/Lc, is.

The larger the mismatch parameter δ, the lower the exchange and shorter the 
period (see Figure 4.4). 
It is then possible to adjust parameters in order for the energy to be back in the 
input guide at the end of length Lc. We are then in a parallel state. 
This phenomenon is most interesting when it is possible to create switching 
between the cross state and parallel state, using the electrooptic effect for example 
(see Chapter 5).  
4.3. Diffraction gratings 
4.3.1. Principle 
Widely used in optics, diffraction gratings take the form of periodic geometric 
patterns, whose spatial period Λ has the same order of magnitude as the wavelength 
λ, causing large diffraction. This pattern can take the form:  
– of the pattern of a reflecting surface (engraved gratings, Figure 4.5a) which can 
have a triangular profile (widely used blazed grating), square, sine, etc.;  
– of the periodically variable index of a transparent layer (holographic gratings, 
see Figure 4.5b, used for optical spatial switching prototypes).

4.3.2. Operation 
Diffraction gratings operate on interferences between waves diffracted by each 
grating element (see Figure 4.6).  
 
Figure 4.6. Diffraction gratings operation 
An incident wave on a grating with an infinite (or very large) number of periods 
will be diffracted, and we can observe a discrete distribution of directions, or orders,

sin θm = m Λ
λ   
In fact, since the near field is periodic, the far field, which is its Fourier 
transform, is discretized.  
The main quality parameters for these gratings are:  
– their spectral resolution or finesse: this increases with the number M of grating 
periods. For a perfectly periodic grating, maximum resolution equals ∆λ/λ = 1/M;  
– their performance in the chosen order (generally 1st order); for example, for a 
blazed grating with a tilt of φ, it is maximal to sequence m around the wavelength:  
λm = 
m
sin
2
φ
Λ
   
– the parasite scattered light rate, related to surface quality.  
The main application of these gratings, which are used in monochromators, and 
optical spectrum analyzers, is to spectrally decompose the incident light, since the 
direction of diffracted light is related to its wavelength. This is the principle of some 
wavelength multiplexers (see Chapter 5).  
4.3.3. Application to light coupling in a guide 
As we have seen, guide access losses are high because of mode mismatching. An 
interesting laboratory process (for example, for measures) is to use coupling through 
a prism (see Figure 4.7). It simply uses refraction of light in the prism to inject and 
extract light from the guide without going through its extremities.  
An incident beam normal to the prism surface, which has a tilt of θi, is 
completely coupled in the guide if:  
k0.nP.sin θi = β, mode propagation constant in the guide  
This relation shows that the index of prism nP must be quite high. It must be 
coated with an antireflection layer. 
If the guide is coated, the coupling is carried out by evanescent fields and it 
therefore becomes weaker the thicker the coating. The length L of the coupling zone 
must then be increased.

Coupling using a diffraction grating (see Figure 4.8), even though it experiences 
more losses, has the advantage of being integrated and very selective in wavelength. 
Order m, diffracted in direction θm, given by:  
n1 sin θm = sin θi + m.Λ
λ  
is totally coupled to the guide if:  
k0.n1.sin θm = β, hence k0.sin θi + m Λ
2π  = β 
This process makes it possible to separate different multiplexed wavelengths in 
the same guide.  

116     Fiber-Optic Communications 
4.3.4. Bragg grating principle 
This is a specific diffraction case through a thick grating, much thicker than λ2/Λ  
(see Figure 4.9). Most of the light is diffracted in the first order, and the 
configuration is symmetric; input and output angles are equal to θB given by:  
sin θB = 2Λ
λ  (Bragg angle)  
This configuration is used in acousto-optic modulators for its high efficiency, 
since the diffraction grating is created here by acoustic wavefronts propagating in a 
crystal and periodically modulating its index (photo-elastic effect). 
In this way light direction is modulated (as well as its frequency by the Doppler 
effect). This process is used in some integrated optical switches, their switching 
times have the order of magnitude of a µs.

heff = h0 + 1/γ2 + 1/γ3 is the “reflected density” of the guide, a term taking into 
account apparent widening of the guide by the Goos-Hanchen effect: h0, the actual 
thickness, is increased with penetration depths in the substrate and coating (see 
Chapter 1).  
The main advantage of this structure is its high selectivity in wavelength (all the 
more so the longer the network). It is used to make integrated filters in guides, 
distributed feedback monochromatic lasers (see Chapter 6):  
– DFB (distributed feed-back), with integrated grating in the active zone;  
– DBR (distributed Bragg reflector) with integrated grating in the active outside 
zone axis;  
– selective wavelength splitters.  
They are also used to make wavelength-tunable filters or laser diodes over a 
dozen nm, using the electrooptic effect to vary the apparent index, and therefore the 
reflected wavelength, caused by an electric field (in crystals) or a current (in 
semiconductors). In passive material, this effect can be obtained from temperature or 
even from stretching.

4.3.6. Photo-inscribed Bragg gratings in optical fibers 
4.3.6.1. Principle 
In optical fibers, a Bragg grating can be created by photo-inscription in the fiber 
core matter. It uses the photo-refractivity phenomenon (permanent modification of 
the core refraction index caused by ultraviolet illumination; core fibers co-doped 
with germanium and boron are well suited for this). This technique, derived from 
holography, enables the creation of integrated filters in optical fibers (see Figure 
4.11). The step, and thus the reflected wavelength, can be controlled with precision 
by illuminating the fiber with interference fringes.  
One of the applications of photo-inscribed Bragg gratings is the stretching 
sensor: by increasing the grating step, fiber stretching will involve a variation of the 
reflected wavelength, which can be measured remotely. Reciprocally, a stretching 
constraint of the fiber creates a filter that can be tuned over a rather narrow range.  
 
Figure 4.11. Photo-inscribed Bragg grating in a fiber 
4.3.6.2. Bragg grating filters 
Photo-inscribed Bragg gratings are stop-band filters used to eliminate residues 
from the pump wave in optical amplifiers, to strengthen selectivity in wavelength 
demultiplexers, or in the laser diode pigtail, in order to better control their 
wavelength and to decrease their spectral width. They can also be used to reflect a 
reference wavelength in some sensors or networks.  
Designing a photo-inscribed Bragg grating filter is carried out by knowing that 
its spectral response is the Fourier transform of the index modulation envelope. The 
bandwidth and the selectivity of the filter can be controlled. A photo-inscribed 
Bragg grating on a finite length with constant modulation amplitude will have a 
cardinal sinus spectral response, presenting secondary lobes, which is usually 
disrupting. To avoid this effect, the grating must be “apodized” by giving a specific 
form to the modulation amplitude, for example Gaussian (see Figure 4.12), but the 
spatial period must still be constant.

4.3.6.3. Chirped Bragg gratings 
Chirped gratings are a specific case; they are gratings with a spatial period 
varying regularly along the zone inscribed in the fiber. This device reflects a wide 
range of wavelengths, with a time shift that is linearly related to the reflected 
wavelength. They are used in chromatic dispersion compensation devices (see 
Figure 4.13): short wavelengths, which arrived first in the case of positive dispersion 
(dτ/dλ > 0) will travel a longer path in the Bragg grating before reflecting, and will 
be more delayed than the larger wavelengths. If the grating period has a linear 
variation of ∆Λ on a length L, this device’s dispersion coefficient in ps/nm is given 
by:  
D = 
Λ
c.∆
L
 
In this case, a linear dispersion (constant slope) can be compensated on a 
wavelength range ∆λ  = 2 na.∆Λ. However, it is possible to photo-inscribe a Bragg 
grating with a non-linear law Λ(z) to compensate for another dispersion law (as long 
as it is monotone). It is nevertheless difficult to create such devices to compensate 
for strong dispersion over a large range.

Optical Components 
5.1. Passive non-selective optical components 
5.1.1. Definitions 
We call “optical components” the components with access where the signal 
remains optical, without modifying its nature (see Table 4.1). The component is said 
to be passive if its operation is constant in time, and does not require control signal 
(electric or optical). 
The optical signal is generally attenuated and it is important to distinguish 
between:  
– component’s insertion loss between input Ei and output Sj equaling, in dB: 
Tij = 10 log 
Sj
Ei
P

where PEi is the power at input Ei and PSj is the power output at Sj; 
– excess loss, caused by component imperfection as defined by: 
pe = 10 log 
Sj
Ei
P
P
Σ
 (in dB) 
part of the input power that is not found at any output. 
For example, in the case of optical power sharing on multiple paths, for a splitter 
with n symmetric branches, we have: 

122     Fiber-Optic Communications 
Tij = 10 log n + pe 
Excess loss is deduced from the comparison between theoretical and measured 
loss. 
In principle, insertion loss is the same in both directions, except for specific 
components such as isolators. In multimode fiber devices however, slightly different 
attenuations can be measured in both directions if the modal distribution is not the 
same in both measures. 
A good optical component must be characterized by: 
– low excess loss (in dB, it increases with the number of branches); 
– low reflection  at each access (return loss: 10 logTii > 20 dB); 
– strong isolation between access at the same side (low crosstalk); 
– in certain cases, low perturbation of the modal distribution or the polarization. 
These definitions are also valid for wavelength selective components (whose 
parameters depend on λ) and for active optical components (they vary over time by 
a command). 
5.1.2. Optical couplers 
These realize sharing or grouping of optical signals, which are constant over 
time. In the first mode or splitter, the same signal is simultaneously addressed over 
several output paths. In the coupler mode (but the same component), different signals 
are grouped and it is necessary to distinguish them by their wavelength, their coding 
or an access control protocol, otherwise they get mixed up… The main categories 
are (Figure 5.1): 
– X couplers (2 inputs, 2 outputs), realized by assembling polished optical fibers, 
or by edge fusion/stretching; symmetric (50/50) or asymmetric (90/10, 95/5, etc.) 
couplers can be produced; 
– Y couplers (1 input, 2 outputs or the other way around), made from half 
coupler X and a fiber; because reciprocity, loss is the same in both directions, loss is 
at least 3 dB by using a Y coupler (symmetric) to group 2 signals; 
– star couplers or distributors (n inputs, n outputs), which can be produced by 
twisting and fusion of an n fiber bundle. They commonly have between 7 and 10 
fibers.

These technologies present low connection losses and are not very reproducible. 
Passive integrated optics in glass or silicon substrate are much more reproducible 
but access losses are more prevalent.  
 
Figure 5.2 shows a Y coupler with this technology, a brick allowing much more 
complex structures (it is generally not interesting by itself, but is interesting when 
combined with filters, multiplexers or active elements). Star couplers to 32 channels 
are also produced for passive optical networks (PON, Chapter 10) in planar 
technology which is less expensive than fiber technology.

Figure 5.2. Y couplers realized in integrated optics 
With the exception of certain single-mode couplers which use coupling 
selectivity between guides to serve as demultiplexers (section 5.2.2), these 
components are not wavelength selective. On the other hand, because of anisotropy 
created in guides by the geometry of couplers, birefringence effects can appear. The 
coupler must be calculated and realized with much precision if the coupler has to be 
independent from input polarization or on the contrary, selective in polarization 
(there are separating polarization couplers created with birefringent fibers). 

124     Fiber-Optic Communications 
5.1.3. Isolators and circulators 
Even though they use an active effect, the Faraday effect (also used as the 
current sensor), these are passive components in the sense that they do not require 
feeding current or commands. 
The Faraday effect (see Chapter 2) is caused by a longitudinal magnetic field H
G
, 
turning light polarization by the following angle: 
φ = 2 VF.L.H  
where L is the interaction length and VF is the Verdet constant, characteristic of the 
material. 
In the isolator application (Figure 5.3), the magnetic field is provided by a 
permanent magnet, which turns polarization by 45° in a magneto-optical crystal 
(with high Verdet constant). This crystal is placed between two 45° polarizers. Due 
to this, the light which propagates in the “transmitted” direction experiences a 45° 
polarization turn in the right direction, and crosses the output polarizer. On the other 
hand, the light propagating in the reverse direction experiences a polarization turn in 
the wrong direction and is cut off by the output polarizer. 
Good isolators have more than 40 dB isolation rates, but present a maximum 
efficiency wavelength. Isolators are sometimes used following a laser diode to avoid 
a return of reflected light in the optical fiber, as well as in erbium-doped fiber 
amplifiers. For this last application, polarizers are replaced by birefringent crystals, 
enabling them to work independently from the incident polarization.

3-port circulators with similar functions as circulators in microwave frequency, 
based on the Faraday effect, are emerging on the market. Associated with Bragg 
photo-inscribed gratings, they have their use in several filtering and wavelength 
division multiplexing devices (see the add-drop multiplexer example in Figure 5.7). 
5.1.4. Optical attenuators 
Fixed or variable attenuators are traditionally used for measures. They simulate 
the attenuation of a long fiber and make it possible to determine the transmission 
systems margin. Since they do not present propagation time dispersion, they also 
allow us to evaluate the penalty caused by dispersion in actual systems. They are 
also beginning to be used in high throughput (Gbit/s and more) local area networks 
because the use of laser diodes, which is necessary to reach these throughputs, leads 
to a too high level of received signals and saturates the receiver. 
Attenuators can be realized in several ways: 
– with neutral optical filters with a density that can be either uniform, or variable 
step by step or continuously (with mechanical command); 
– or by using losses caused by mismatching between two optical guides or fibers 
opposite each other, ensuring a more compact installation. 
In reconfigurable ADMs (section 5.4.4) and in optical amplifiers (Chapter 8), 
variable optical attenuators (VOA) are also used to dynamically flatten the gain 
between the different amplified wavelengths. Gain flattening devices based on 
photo-inscribed Bragg gratings have also been developed. 
5.2. Wavelength division multiplexers  
5.2.1. Different types of wavelength division multiplexing 
Wavelength division multiplexing or WDM has become increasingly important in 
increasing network capacity and flexibility. It uses wavelength division multiplexers, 
selective and reciprocal components (they can serve as multiplexers as well as 
demultiplexers). Contrary to couplers seen above where the same signal is distributed 
between the different outputs, multiplexers offer one common access and n selective 
accesses. Signals carried by different wavelengths and arriving by the common 
access are sent toward different outputs. Conversely, signals with different 
wavelengths arriving from their own access are multiplexed, theoretically without 
loss, toward the common output. It is also possible that some wavelengths propagate 
in one direction and others in the reverse direction. 

126     Fiber-Optic Communications 
There are three types of wavelength division multiplexing: 
– two way multiplexing (two relatively spaced out wavelengths, or two 
windows) described in section 5.2.2; 
– dense WDM (DWDM) between a large number of very close wavelengths (gap 
of less than 1 nm) in the same window, described in section 5.2.3; 
– more recent to the market, coarse wavelength division multiplexing 
technologies (CWDM) multiplex within the same window 4 to 8 wavelengths 
spaced between 10 and 20 nm, mainly based on filter technologies; these are cheaper 
components than the DWDM multiplexers, which can respond to metropolitan 
network requirements. 
5.2.2. Filter multiplexers 
Two way couplers are generally realized by dichroic filter technology (filters 
made by the stacking of thin layers, transparent for certain wavelengths and 
reflecting for others), which separates two rather large and spaced windows: for 
example, 0.85 and 1.3 µm, or more recently, 1.3 and 1.5 µm for PON access 
networks. 
These components can be realized by fiber assembly as well as by integrated 
optics (Figure 5.4) and are characterized by a low level of insertion loss (typically 
0.5 to 1 dB) and high isolation between channels (at least 20 to 40 dB). They enable 
the sharing of a fiber that is already installed with a new user, or the creation of a 
bidirectional link in a single fiber, with a wavelength per direction. Because of the 
price of multiplexers, this is only economical from a certain fiber length (access 
networks), or if installation constraints demand a single fiber.

5.2.3. Coupler-type multiplexers 
These multiplexers use the selective coupling between two single-mode guides 
(see section 4.2.3) which are also two channel couplers, but they selectively separate 
two close wavelengths (for example, the signal and pump in optical amplifiers). 
They can be used as interleavers where their principle, explained in section 4.2.3, 
is based on the law of coupling between two single-mode guides in a coupler, which 
varies periodically with the wavelength.  
There remain two channel couplers, but a channel contains all even wavelengths, 
the other one has all the odd wavelengths (Figure 5.5). Their application is to 
multiplex, in an interlaced way, two wavelength meshes coming from different 
subnetworks in access nodes to the core networks.

5.2.4. Dense wavelength division multiplexing 
DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) reaches gigantic capacities 
(higher than 10 Tbit/s) in networks and long distance links, and its market mainly 
involves single-mode fibers and the 1.55 µm window. It is very selective since the 
frequency spacing between channels, standardized by ITU (International 
Telecommunications Union), is 100 GHz (or approximately 0.8 nm to 1.55 µm); this 
“grid” defines channels from 192.1 to 196.1 THz, in other words from 1,561 to 
1,529 nm. Grids where channels are two, or even four times as tight (or a gap of 50 
or 25 GHz, this multiplexing is then said to be “ultra-dense”) can be used, or on the 
contrary settle for a gap of 200 or 400 GHz. These multiplexers use technologies 
based on diffraction gratings and Bragg gratings, in fibers or integrated optics, or 
also on interference between integrated guide arrays. 
Although still expensive (and involving the use of high purity and spectral 
stability laser diodes), these wavelength division multiplexers are passive 

128     Fiber-Optic Communications 
components of a technology that is more mature and reliable than time-division 
optical multiplexers. They allow us to gradually increase the capacity of existing 
links and to adapt to traffic increase with flexibility. They are also very useful in 
developing multi-terminal networks, particularly when the terminals are not grouped 
geographically. The economic advantage of dense wavelength division multiplexing 
is largely due to the development of optical amplifiers, which can simultaneously 
amplify all the wavelengths in the same window (1,530 to 1,565 µm), whereas 
before, a repeater-regenerator was required for each wavelength. 
Classical multiplexers (Figure 5.6), where all wavelengths are (de)multiplexed at 
the same point, are traditionally realized with diffraction gratings (see section 4.3), 
resulting in a “bulky” component. These multiplexers present high separating power, 
a few dozen nm (possibly reinforced by Bragg gratings) and offer a large number of 
channels (several dozen, even over 100 channels for massive 3D structures), high 
diaphonic isolation (20 to 30 dB between adjacent channels) and typical losses from 
1 to a few dB. Their cost is high, however, all the more so because they generally 
require thermal regulation.

“Phasars” or AWG (arrayed waveguides) have emerged recently, benefiting 
from the advantages and low cost of passive integrated optics. They are based on 
interferences between integrated guides of different lengths creating a phase shift 
between each other depending on the wavelength: between two guides with lengths 
different from ∆l, this equals: 

Optical Components     129 
∆φ = (2π/λ)n. ∆l (n is the guide index) 
Following a principle similar to phased array antennae (in microwave 
frequencies), the output light transmission direction depends on the wavelength, 
which achieves demultiplexing. 
5.2.5. Add-drop multiplexing 
In optical add-drop multiplexers (OADM), a signal at wavelength λi is dropped 
from the group and is replaced by another signal at the same wavelength λi. They 
are generally realized with photo-inscribed Bragg gratings and circulators (Figure 
5.7). These components are in strong development in multi-terminal networks, 
because each terminal can then operate on its own wavelength and add/drop its 
signals without having to demultiplex the complete spectrum. 
By associating wavelength-tunable sources (or more rarely receivers), or 
sometimes by tuning optical ADM with acoustic waves, optical routing is beginning 
to be realized. Thus, functions developed so far by electronic layers (ADM was 
introduced in electric form by the synchronous SDH hierarchy) are now in the 
optical layer (see Chapter 10).

5.3. Active optical components 
5.3.1. Principles 
By active optical components, we mean the components in which the signal will 
remain optical at access but be submitted to processes (modulation, switching, etc.) 
driven by an external signal. This signal is most often electric, with the use of the 
electro-optic effect, allowing us to reach very high frequencies (several dozen GHz). 
However, the command can also be: 

130     Fiber-Optic Communications 
– mechanical, in certain switches, they are slow and of a large size, but reliable 
and without consumption outside of switching; they are used in securing networks or 
routing devices. MEMS (see section 5.4.2) enable the development of high capacity 
and rather high speed spatial switching matrices (response time is in ms); 
– acoustic, in the case of acousto-optic modulators, application of bulk 
diffraction gratings or in guides (see section 4.3.4); they are slower but less 
expensive than electro-optic modulators. Acousto-optic switches also exist with a 
response time in µs; 
– thermal, in certain switches using material differential dilatations; we also use 
the effect of temperature on glass indices; 
– optical, by using optical non-linear effects, mainly for the development of 
bistable components, but these devices are still in the research stage. 
In integrated optical circuits, semiconductor or erbium-doped optical amplifiers 
are emerging, allowing the compensation of passive integrated optical component 
losses. They also provide optical gate-based switching architectures. 
5.3.2. Electro-optic effect 
This is the modification of permittivity ε, thus of the index of the material, 
resulting from an external electric field eG . This effect is important in certain 
asymmetric crystals such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3). In the most general case, the 
material is not isotropic and permittivity is a tensor ε given by relation: 
D
G
 = ε  E
G
, or the inverse relation: E
G
 = a  D
G  
where a  is the inverse of the permittivity tensor. 
An external electric eG  field modifies this tensor. In crystals, the predominant 
component of its variation is linear and is called the Pockels effect. It leads to a 
variation of the : 
∆n = n3.r’ 2
e  at the first order 
r’ being the effective electro-optic coefficient; its exact value depends on relative 
directions of eG  and E
G
 (light polarization) in relation to the crystal. 
Over a propagation length L, the light phase then varies by: 

Optical Components     131 
∆φ = 2π L λ
∆n  
If field eG  is longitudinally applied, the voltage producing a phase shift of π is 
taken out from V = e.L and equals: 
Vλ/2 = 
'r.
n3λ
 
This voltage is called half wave and is characteristic of the material. It is 
approximately 2V in lithium niobate. This low value is one of the advantages of 
integrated optics. 
There is also a quadratic term in e2, called the Kerr effect, much weaker than the 
Pockels effect in crystals, but the only one existing in fibers. It creates a slight 
birefringence in optical fibers submitted to an external electric field. 
5.3.3. Directional electro-optic coupler 
This is the most classical electro-optic component. The electro-optic effect 
enables the modification of coupling factors between two parallel integrated guides 
(Figure 5.8a). A control voltage of a few volts, applied between two electrodes 
placed on the guides, creates a field eG  in each of them, hence an index ∆n variation, 
in opposite directions. A mismatching of propagation constants then appears 
between both guides and it equals: 
∆β = 2k0.∆n = k0 n3.r’.e 
This enables switching between the cross state and parallel state (see section 
4.2.4). Length L must be an odd multiple of conversion length Lc, in order to obtain 
the cross state in the absence of control voltage; meanwhile voltage applied to a 
precise value switches to the parallel state. Since it is not easy to achieve that with 
precision, a four electrode configuration is used (Figure 5.8b). In this one, it is 
possible to obtain both states (cross and parallel) for any L value between Lc and 
3Lc, by adjusting control voltage values to V// (parallel state) and Vx (cross state).

This component has several applications: 
– extremely fast switch (less than 100 ps of switching time); 
– on-off external modulator, by coupling one of the guides toward output         
(40 GHz was reached but the Mach-Zehnder modulator is more efficient); 
– time-division multiplexer (two inputs alternatively switched toward the same 
output); optical time-division multiplexing (OTDM) experiments have thus reached 
160 Gbit/s but this remains very complex; 
– switching matrices, by integrating several basic elements in the same substrate. 
Although lithium niobate offers the best components, the active integrated optics 
also uses semiconductors, in particular indium phosphide (InP). These actually make 
it possible to integrate both active and passive optical functions in the same 
substrate, as well as light receivers and transmitters, and logical or analog electronic 
functions.  
This technology is called integrated optoelectronics.

5.3.4. Electro-optic modulator 
The electro-optic effect is also used to realize phase modulators, most often 
integrated in semiconductors, with laser diodes, which modulate the transmission in 
an “external” way. It is also used in wavelength tunable diodes (Chapter 6). 
Interferometers mainly exist in integrated optics. The most classical set up is the 
Mach-Zehnder interferometer (Figure 5.9) in which both electrodes, placed on both 
arms, command a phase shift φ which is translated into a light output intensity 
modulation by cos2φ. It is mainly used in on-off external modulation devices, 
controlled by a voltage V0 giving φ = π/2, used at 10 and at 40 Gbit/s (below, 
internal laser modulation is possible and much more economical). 
It is a very efficient component but delicate to realize, because impedance 
matching over a wide band, phase matching between microwave and optical signals 
(that is why electrode co-planar disposition is also used) and electric signal 
amplification, whose peak to peak voltage is approximately 5V, must all be ensured.

An analog modulation of signal intensity can also be achieved, to generate 
solitons, or to modulate light by a microwave sub-carrier. In this case, a bias voltage  
must be applied to electrodes in order to set the rest point to Φ = π/4 and to work in 
the rather linear zone of the cos2φ λ law. 
A more recent use of these modulators is duobinary or bipolar modulation, in 
which 0 is coded by 0 and 1 is alternately coded by +1 and –1, which means phase 
reversal in optics. In the Mach-Zehnder interferometer modulator, if a voltage 2V0 
double of the one providing a zero power is applied, then Φ = π, cos φ = -1 which 
results in maximum power (demodulation does not change) but a reverse phase on 
 

134     Fiber-Optic Communications 
light. This process is more resistant to chromatic dispersion (see section 9.1.4). The 
same component but with a different control signal, can achieve binary phase-shift 
modulation with 2 states (0 and π) and differential phase shift keying (DPSK) that 
are easier to demodulate (section 9.1.5). 
5.3.5. Electro-absorption modulator 
This amplitude modulator (EAM) uses a different principle which is the variation 
of the photon absorption in a semiconductor, caused by the application of an electric 
field. In fact, semiconductors present a very fast variation of their absorption 
coefficient with wavelength at the neighborhood of their cut-off wavelength, i.e. for 
photons with energy close to their bandgap (see section 6.1.3). 
These high slope characteristics can be shifted by the application of a 
perpendicular electric field (Figure 5.10). The absorption coefficient then varies into 
large proportions for a wavelength close to the cut-off (1.55 µm for GaInAsP). This 
is at the base of amplitude modulator use. 
Electro-absorption involves a complex absorption by exciton phenomenon, i.e. 
the creation of an electron hole pair where the electron is in orbit around the hole. 
This absorption is very selective and is observed by a peak in the absorption curve. 
It is usually observed at very low temperature, but can be obtained at ambient 
temperature in quantum well devices. The realized devices use multiple quantum 
well structures. In these structures, applying an electric field perpendicular to layers 
shifts the resonance peak of the excitonic absorption, while remaining very 
selective, because of quantization imposed by the structure. On the other hand, a 
parallel electric field widens this peak using the Stark effect, as in bulk materials.

This enables the control of the modulator with low voltages (about one volt) and 
to obtain very high modulation frequencies: from 20 to 40 GHz depending on 
control voltages, much more than with internal laser diode modulation. These 
modulators are therefore used to reach very high bitrates (10 to 40 Gbit/s) in digital 
transmission, with modulation depths of 10 to 20 dB. However, they can be used in 
analog modulation, to generate solitons or for microwave optical fiber transport, by 
transposing modulation carrier from radio frequency to optical frequency. They are 
slightly less efficient and more limited in wavelength than Mach-Zehnder 
modulators, but they are easier to integrate with laser diodes. 
These components present high attenuation however (approximately 10 dB for 
100 µm, a typical length for this component, compared to 4 to 5 dB for Mach-
Zehnder), even in the “on” state; because of this, the integration of the modulator 
with an optical semiconductor amplifier has been developed. Their response 
depends on the source wavelength, which is quite suitable for use when they are 
integrated with the transmitter. A parasite phase modulation also exists, causing a 
chirp effect. As a last point, the electro-absorption phenomenon presents a certain 
sensitivity to light polarization, sensitivity which can be compensated by the 
modulator structure. 
Electro-absorption modulators have also been used in optical regeneration 
experiments which remain difficult to implement. 
5.4. Fiber-optic switches 
5.4.1. Functions 
Optical switches were developed as early as the first fiber-optic systems. We 
must distinguish between, however: 
– switches from one to two (or a small number) channels, often found in security 
(switching toward a stand-by emergency component) or measurement devices; these 
do not need to be very quick and generally use mechanical devices; 
– switching matrices in the sense of a switching function in networks, which can 
be spatial or temporal, and from which a large capacity is expected (n X n with n in 
the hundreds, or even more) and a more or less high speed. The interest in these 
devices, which for a very long time have not passed the laboratory stage, returned in 
2000. In fact, current network switches called OEO (optical-electric-optical) perform 
electronic switching, that requires a double conversion and is limited in speed.  
However these studies have still not resulted in massive use in networks, because 
of cost and lack of device maturity, as well as their impact on network protocols and 
architecture, because they only ensure circuit switching. They are actually used as 
cross-connects, to provide network reconfiguration according to traffic, more than to 

136     Fiber-Optic Communications 
switch channels in real time. Complementary devices, such as reconfigurable 
OADMs (section 5.4.4) or wavelength conversion, are necessary to arrive at a real 
all-optical network (Chapter 10). 
5.4.2. Switching technologies 
The technologies used can be (Table 5.1): 
– mechanical (mirror and switch based); they are slow (response time in dozens 
of ms) and their consumption is low, but they are of large size and have limited 
capacity. There are thermal controlled mechanical switches, mainly on silicon. They 
are mostly used in security (switching toward a fiber or a security component), 
possibly for routing; 
– micro electro-mechanical structures (MEMS; faster (response time in ms), 
allowing packet switching, they have higher capacity because of their integration, 
especially in 3D structures (section 5.4.3) and can be used as cross-connects; there 
are also 1 to 2 switches realized in silicon microtechnology (micro-movement of an 
integrated optics guide), very quick but of uncertain reliability; 
– in integrated optics, based on electro-optic couplers (section 5.3.3); their speed 
is much higher (100 ps), and their higher consumption directs them to time-division 
switching, and are currently in the experimental phase. Despite their monolithic 
integration, they are not well suited for high capacity matrices because losses 
increase quickly with the number of basic 2 x 2 switches; 
– 3D free beams: their main advantage for very wideband spatial switching 
comes from their three-dimensional structure authorizing large capacity matrices 
(100 x 100 or more) with low loss levels (Figure 5.11).

In the 1980s holographic prototypes (based on holographic diffraction gratings) 
were developed. They were awkward and very slow because of hologram rewriting 
time.  
More compact and faster prototypes based on liquid crystals were recently 
presented, but despite the interest for 3D devices, they are not really operational. 
Other prototypes, such as acousto-optic, microbubble, optical gate based on 
semiconductor optical amplifiers, etc. were developed, but none stands out.

5.4.3. Example of micro electro-mechanical switching matrices 
The development of large capacity matrices using micromirrors can be carried 
out from two architectures. In 2D devices, derived from the traditional electric 
switch Crossbar, an N input and N output switching matrix can be realized with N2 
basic mirrors (Figure 5.12). They only have two possible positions, on and off, 
hence quick switching (a few ms).

On the other hand, in the 3D concept, only 2N mobile micromirrors are used: N 
facing input fibers and N facing output fibers (Figure 5.13), but since they have N 
possible positions, their direction must be precise and switching is not as quick.  
In 2001 Lucent developed a 256 channel prototype, but the conjuncture has not 
enabled its massive deployment in networks. However, all optical cross-connects 
based on MEMS microtechnologies progress in network cores (see Chapter 10).

5.4.4. Reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM) 
OADM (section 5.2.5) can be made to be reconfigurable by combining wavelength 
division multiplexing and optical switching functions. Equipment thus defined becomes 
reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers or ROADM and is expected to play a very 
important role in the future of all optical networks (Chapter 10). 
In fact, as with passive OADMs, they enable the drop of a signal at one (or 
several) wavelength(s) and its replacement by another signal at the same 
wavelength(s) without needing to reconvert the signal into electric or to process it, in 
an all optical node. However, reconfigurable OADMs allow the fast change of 
dropped wavelength(s), making it possible for the network to adapt in real time to 
traffic and to evolve to all optical routing. Moreover, dropped/added wavelengths at 
node level can be of any number and distributed in any way. 
On the other hand, whereas OADMs are passive, reliable and do not require 
feeding or control signals, ROADMs require a control by electric signals from the 
network control plane, which uses signaling channels distinct from data channels, at 
a specific wavelength in the case of new optical transport networks (OTN, Chapter 
10). 
Different technologies can be integrated into this equipment (Figure 5.14); 
essential functions are: 
– a wavelength demultiplexer in input, and reciprocally a wavelength division 
multiplexer at output; these two components are identical (but signals are in opposite 
directions) and can very well be realized in planar integrated optics (AWG, section 5.2.4); 
– a switching matrix with 4 access groups: input channels, output channels, drop 
channels and add channels. In each group, a channel corresponds to a fixed 
wavelength. Basic switches are 2 x 2 type and have two positions: parallel (input 
then goes to output), and crossed (input is dropped; the added channel goes to 
output). Current ROADMs use basic switches based on MEMS or silicon-integrated 
optics with thermal command (for network reconfiguration, switching does not need 
to be fast); other technologies, based on wavelength blockers, or wavelength 
selective switches (based on diffraction gratings for example) have led to 
prototypes; 
– an automatic level equalization device, based on variable optical attenuators 
(VOA, section 5.1.4) and level monitoring at each wavelength; 
– and finally switch control electronics and VOAs (but data remains in all-
optical form).

Chapter 6 
Optoelectronic Transmitters 
6.1. Principles of optoelectronic components 
The role of these components is to convert electric signal into an optical signal, 
and reciprocally, with the help of semiconductor emitting (Chapter 6) and receiving 
(Chapter 7) diodes. These easy to use components can indeed be modulated at high 
frequencies with low voltages. 
6.1.1. Electroluminescence principle 
In direct semiconductors, the recombination of an electron-hole pair is radiative, 
i.e. its energy, close to bandgap Eg, is transferred to a photon with the same energy 
hν1. This is electroluminescence. In fact, in these semiconductors, the minimum 
energy of the conduction band is reached for the same value of k (electron wave 
function) as the maximum energy of the valence band (Figure 6.1) and 
recombination is carried out without modifying movement quantity. A diode 
structure allows us to create a large number of recombinations of minority carriers 
injected throughout the junction, and therefore the emission of a large number of 
photons. 
On the other hand, in indirect semiconductors, these extrema do not match and 
recombination is carried out using a phonon possessing a low energy Eφ for the 
conservation of movement quantity. During a recombination, the electron-hole  
                              
1. h is the Planck constant = 6.62.10-34 J/Hz.

pair energy is transferred in mechanical form and ends up as heat. The radiative 
recombination probability is not zero, but it is extremely low.

Therefore, it is an emission of a relatively monochromatic light. However, the 
emitted photons are independent of each other; this emission is incoherent.  
In addition, since energy distribution is almost continuous within each band, the 
spontaneous emission spectrum presents a width ∆λ around a central wavelength 
that is slightly lower than λg, and a relatively Gaussian general form (see the 
spectrum of an LED in Figure 6.7): 
λg = h.c/Eg = 1.24/Eg when λg is in µm and Eg in eV 
Reciprocally, a photon absorbed by a semiconductor can create an electron-hole 
pair, as long as hν is higher than Eg. In an indirect semiconductor, this absorption 
also possibly involves a phonon, for which hν ≥Eg + Eφ must occur. Photodetection 
has many applications (photovoltaic cells, image sensors, photoresistors, etc.) and is 
responsible for the fact that material reabsorbs its own emission. 
Due to this reabsorption and the confinement of a certain number of photons 
within the material because of its high refraction index, are defined: 
– internal quantum efficiency: 
number of photons created
number of recombinations  

Optoelectronic Transmitters     143 
– external quantum efficiency: 
number of photons transmitted outside

6.1.2. Electroluminescent material 
Silicon and germanium are indirect semiconductors and cannot emit light. 
Silicon-integrated transmitters have recently been realized, but the active element 
(rare-earth-doped or thin layers of direct semiconductors) is not silicon.  
In addition, organic electroluminescent material is now used for displays, but 
cannot be quickly modulated for transmissions. 
The used emitting materials are mainly III-V semiconductors (made up of 
elements from the 3rd and 5th periodic table columns), or their alloys, where many 
are direct: 
– nitrogen-doped GaP emitting green (λ = 565 nm, leaning toward yellow); 
– Ga Asx P1-x emitting from yellow to red, according to x value; 
– GaAlP emitting red, with high efficiency; 
– GaAs emitting in the first infrared window (λ = 900 nm); 
– Ga1-x Alx As emitting between 700 and 900 nm in (decreasing) function of x; 
– Ga1-x Inx Asy P1-y emitting in the second or third window: λ = 1,200 to  
1,600 nm in (increasing) function of x and y; 
– Ga1-x Inx Asy Sb1-y emitting around λ = 2.5 µm. 
These materials  are also used in detection, as well as silicon and germanium 
(indirect semiconductors can detect light). 
The diagram in Figure 6.2 presents the main compositions used.

Figure 6.2. Electroluminescent III-V semiconductor material 
Blue emission has been the subject of active research, mainly for displays and 
recording on optical disks (blue-ray and HD-DVD standards). It was first obtained 
with correct efficiency in II-VI materials such as ZnCdSe (blue) and ZnTe (green-
blue). More recently, blue diodes (LED and lasers at 405 nm) based on InGaN or 
A1InN quantum wells over GaN were developed, enabling lighting and visualization 
in blue light applications and in the medical field in near-ultraviolet (275 to  
340 nm). 
A consequence has been the development of the white LED (the light is re-
emitted by phosphorescent material that is excited in blue-violet) which is taking 
over the lighting and visualization market (LCD display backlighting), since its 
energy efficiency exceeds 120 lumen/W or ten times more than incandescence with 
a much longer lifetime. 
In the case of alloys, the composition is on one hand determined by the desired 
emission wavelength, and in the other hand by the lattice constant. In the case of 
heterostructures, there must be lattice matching between the different layers and 
substrate (which is, depending on the case, GaAs or InP), if not, there is the risk of 
crystal dislocation. However, lattice mismatched layers can be inserted, under 
constraint, as long as they are very fine (quantum well structures, see section 6.1.5). 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     145 
6.1.3. Photodetection principle 
In order for the absorption of a photon by a semiconductor to lead to an electron-
hole pair, photon energy must be higher than Eg, hence the condition: 
hν > Eg therefore λ < λlim = hc/ Eg limit detection wavelength 
In the case of indirect semiconductors, this value shifts downward because the 
energy of phonon Eφ must be added to Eg, which is necessary to assist the absorption 
of a photon by an atom. This is actually done with a low probability, characterized 
by the absorption coefficient α in cm-1, which determines the number of photons 
transmitted at a depth x: 
Φ(x) = Φ(0).e-αx  
hence the definition of the absorption depth: 1/α. 
α depends on the material and decreases when the wavelength increases, up to 0 
at limit wavelength (Figure 6.3). For adequate efficiency, absorption depth must be 
low (to absorb the maximum number of photons) but not too low (otherwise they are 
all absorbed at the surface, before reaching the active layer). There is an optimum 
efficiency wavelength (close to 0.8 µm for silicon). 
As with emission, two types of photodetection efficiencies are defined: 
– internal quantum efficiency: 
number of pairs created
number of photons absorbed  
generally quite high, but limited by electron-hole pair recombinations, especially 
near the surface; in addition, not all photons reach the active zone because of surface 
reflections. Then the following is defined: 
– the external quantum efficiency: 
number of pairs created
number of incident photons  
typically equal to 50 to 80%.

Figure 6.3. Absorption coefficient 
The absorption coefficient decreases very quickly near the cut-off wavelength, 
especially in III-V semiconductors. The absorption edge is dependent on 
temperature, which modifies the bandgap; this is used in optical temperature 
sensors. It is also shifted by the application of an electric field, which is at the basis 
of electro-absorption modulators (section 5.3.5). 
In telecommunications, photodetection is mainly used in photovoltaic mode: 
charges created lead to a current in a diode structure, biased or not. The 
photoconductor mode also exists, the increase of free carriers increases conductivity 
of lighted semiconductor material. Simpler but slower, this mode is used to detect 
the brightness level for example. 
6.1.4. Heterojunction use 
In order to obtain a good efficiency, heterojunction structures are used in 
components intended for optical telecommunications (fiber based on direct infrared 
link): the active layer, which is very thin (less than a micron), is surrounded by 
confinement layers (Figure 6.4) characterized by: 
– a higher gap, which confines the recombinations (or emission) and absorption 
in the active layer. Most often, a double heterojunction (DH) is realized to ensure 
confinement of both types of carriers; 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     147 
– transparency to emitted photons, which will not be reabsorbed; this improves 
the external efficiency in emission as well as in detection (no absorption out of the 
active layer); 
– a lower refraction index, hence confinement and light guidance possibility, as 
in integrated optics, mainly used in edge-emitting diodes and laser diodes. We have 
seen that this property is used to develop semiconductor integrated optics devices.

Figure 6.4. Double heterojunction 
The growth of these layers is realized by epitaxy, most commonly in the vapor 
phase (MOCVD process for metal-organic chemical vapor deposition). To realize 
very thin layers (less than 100 nm), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is used. 
6.1.5. Quantum well structures 
Mainly used for laser diodes, quantum well structures consist of separating 
optical confinement (light guiding in a layer that cannot be much thinner than the 
wavelength) from electric confinement in the thickness of the active layer. It is 
reduced to a very thin layer, in the range of a dozen nanometers (Figure 6.5) or, 

148     Fiber-Optic Communications 
more often, several stacked layers (this is called a multiple quantum well structure or 
MQW). These layers are deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. 
The advantages of this structure are: 
– strong reduction of the threshold current density (less than 100 A/cm2) 
therefore threshold current (less than 10 mA) and heating; the quantum efficiency is 
also higher, enabling the development of power laser diodes; 
– the possibility of adjusting the emission wavelength with precision by 
modifying the active zone depth: in fact, energy levels, and therefore radiative 
transitions, are quantified (hence the structure name) to a value depending on 
thickness; a single-mode spectrum can easily be obtained; 
– at last, the active layer can be made from material with a lattice that does not 
match the substrate. The crystal is then submitted to mechanical constraints (this 
structure is called constrained quantum wells) which is only possible without 
dislocations if the layer is very thin. It gives an additional degree of freedom in the 
choice of material, therefore wavelength, in relation to the diagram in Figure 6.2, 
since it is possible to use slightly higher lattice constant material and compress it.

Figure 6.5. Quantum well structures 
In this way, constrained InAlAs over InP material or constrained GaInAs over 
GaAs material allows us to make pump laser diodes at 0.98 µm for optical 
amplification. Blue diodes also use multiple quantum wells, with constrained InGaN 
layers over GaN. 
6.1.6. Optical amplification principles 
Optical amplification is based on the stimulated emission phenomenon in which 
the generation of a photon by transition between two levels is triggered by the 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     149 
arrival of an incident photon in the emitting excited material. Since the new photon 
has the same frequency, direction, phase and polarization as the incident photon, 
light will be amplified during its propagation in the medium, according to the law: 
P(z) = P0.exp (gz) 
 
where g is the gain factor in cm-1. 
The necessary condition for stimulated emission is the population inversion 
between the two neighboring levels between which a radiative recombination 
occurs. In this way, in direct semiconductors, the conduction band must be more 
populated than the valence band. This condition is not possible at thermodynamic 
equilibrium, and can only be obtained by pumping, the outside supply of a large 
quantity of energy (electric, optical or other) for taking carriers to a higher energy 
state. 
The light that will be amplified can come from: 
– spontaneous emission of the material: a powerful source is then realized; if this 
source is associated with a selective device (resonant type cavity) which selects a 
wavelength among amplified wavelengths, it is a laser  (Light Amplification by 
Stimulated Emission of Radiation), which is a coherent light source; 
– or external light, as long as its wavelength corresponds to energy transitions of 
the material: an amplifier can then be realized. 
For optical telecommunications applications, which interest us here, the 
materials enabling optical amplification are III-V semiconductors and erbium-doped 
fibers. 
In semiconductors, population inversion can easily be obtained by a very strong 
direct injection of carriers in a biased PN junction. Carrier density must exceed a 
threshold (in the range of 1018 cm-3 in GaAs) corresponding to a threshold density 
J0.d where d is the recombination zone depth, and J0 is a threshold with an 
approximate value of: 
J0 = 4.5.103 A/cm2/µm in GaAs 
The use of heterojunctions provides optical amplification in a very thin active 
zone, with low current (a few dozen mA). Semiconductor laser structures or laser 
diodes (section 6.3). Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SCOA) can also be realized, 
less often used for transmissions because they are not as powerful as EDFAs, but 
which are interesting for integrated optics or signal processing applications. 

150     Fiber-Optic Communications 
Erbium-doped fiber amplification, the subject of Chapter 8, enables the 
realization of lasers, and mainly erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) which have 
become dominant in fiber transmission systems over the last few years. This type of 
amplification presents several advantages compared to semiconductor amplifiers: 
– low noise, caused by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE); 
– very low fiber-optic connection losses; 
– very low sensitivity to light polarization; 
– high saturation power (over 30 dBm). 
Both types of amplifiers have a relatively large gain band (several dozen nm), 
allowing the simultaneous amplification of numerous multiplexed wavelengths. 
Beyond the stimulated emission principle, optical amplification is possible with 
the help of non-linear effects (Raman or parametric amplification, see Chapter 2); 
this is actually interaction between two waves with the help of non-linear material, 
which has not much passed the experimental stage. 
6.2. Light-emitting diodes (LED) 
6.2.1. Structure 
A light-emitting diode (LED) is the simplest emitting component, directly 
performing emission of photons by carrier recombination in a directly polarized 
heterojunction (Figure 6.6). The material used is chosen according to the emission 
wavelength (section 6.1.2).

6.2.2. Main light-emitting diode characteristics 
The main characteristics are (Figure 6.7): 
– a spectrum typical of spontaneous emission, continuous and quite large (hence 
high sensitivity to chromatic dispersion); 
– a linear power-current characteristic, with a slope of approximately 10 mW/A, 
up to a few milliwatts, value limited by diode heating; 
– a typical diode current voltage characteristic, with threshold voltage in the 
range of 1.5 V (and depending on material). A LED must be biased (in 
telecommunications as in visualization) in current, and not in voltage; 
– a Lambert law emission diagram, i.e. the intensity of radiation in a θ direction 
equals: P(θ) = P0.cos θ (P0 intensity of radiation in the axis). This is interesting for 
direct infrared links, but it is not very suitable for coupling in fiber optics; LEDs are 
either used with multimode fibers with strong numerical aperture NA (split power 
increasing as NA2), or with lenses to improve coupling in fibers with lower 
numerical aperture; 
– high response time (in the range of a dozen ns) limiting bandwidth of signals 
transmitted by LEDs at about 100 MHz. Some optimized structures now exceed this 
value. The best LEDs currently offer bitrates of 100 Mbit/s (for FDDI, Fast 
Ethernet) and 155 Mbit/s (first SDH level); laboratory LEDs have reached  
250 Mbit/s, but the Gbit/s level is out of reach. 
This component of limited performance is very useful however because it is 
inexpensive, has a very low-noise and is very reliable. 
 
Figure 6.7. Characteristics of a light-emitting diode 

152     Fiber-Optic Communications 
6.2.3. Light-emitting diode transmitters 
Their structure is simple, since modulating the current in the diode is sufficient 
for the optical power to reproduce electric current with enough linearity. In analog 
transmitters (Figure 6.8a), this current is generally amplified by a transistor for 
sufficient amplitude (typically a few dozen mA). In logical transmitters (Figure 
6.8b), the diode operates in on-off mode since the current is switched by a switching 
transistor (open-collector output of a driver for example). 
 
Figure 6.8. Light-emitting diode transmitter 
6.2.4. Other types of light-emitting diodes 
Edge-emitting LEDs exist, where light is guided in the active layer, since it has a 
refraction index that is higher than confinement layers. Light then exits by both 
guide extremities (as in the laser diode in Figure 6.9). Their speed, performance and 
cost are higher than classical LEDs (called surface-emitting LEDs). 
There are also superluminescent diodes (SLD) similar to lasers, with edge 
emission and amplification, but without resonance; the light is then non-coherent 
(with a continuous and Gaussian spectrum). They have some measurement 
applications (interferometry in non-coherent light, gyroscopy) and medical 
applications, because of high beam concentration with a spatial but non-temporal 
coherence. 
6.3. Laser diodes 
6.3.1. Principle 
Their structure is more complex. Except in the case of VCSELs, they are edge 
emission components where the light is confined in the active layer. In addition, 
laser diodes must carry out the two functions of the optical oscillator that is a laser: 
amplification and resonance. 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     153 
Light amplification is obtained by stimulated emission (section 6.1.6). 
Population inversion  is obtained by injection of a very strong current density in the 
junction (in the order of a kA/cm2). Amplification therefore occurs when the current 
exceeds a threshold value noted as Ith which is from mA to several dozen mA 
according to the component structure; at that time, carriers which are usually in the 
minority after going through the junction then become a majority corresponding to 
population inversion. 
The amplified light comes from spontaneous laser emission, non-zero when 
below the threshold, it can also be an external incident light (used in semiconductor 
optical amplifiers, Chapter 8). 
In the stimulated emission regime, light power increases during its propagation 
along Oz following the law: 
P(z) = Po . egz  
with g = gain coefficient, generally expressed in cm-1. 
This coefficient depends on the wavelength and is only positive within a “gain 
band” which is narrower than the spontaneous emission band, where amplified 
photon frequency ν follows the relation: 
Eg < hν < F2 - F1 
where F2 and F1 are Fermi pseudo-levels of electrons and holes. In order for the 
inequality to be possible, they need to be respectively in the conduction band and 
valence band, corresponding to population inversion. The amplified light is therefore 
not monochromatic: a selective optical device is necessary for obtaining a unique 
wavelength. 
Gain also increases with current density J following the law: 
g = β (ηi.J/d - J0)  
with: 
– β gain coefficient (5.10-2 cm.µm/A for GaAs); 
– ηi quantum efficiency of spontaneous emission; 
– d active zone depth; 
– J0 threshold density (4.5.103 A/cm2/µm for GaAs). 

154     Fiber-Optic Communications 
It is therefore necessary to have a very thin (approximately 0.1 µm) and narrow 
(a few µm) recombination zone to operate with a low threshold current, which is 
possible thanks to double heterojunction structures. 
In addition, losses in the guide (in e-αz) and light emission by the sides must be 
compensated, therefore: 
e2gL.e-2αL.R2 = 1 or g = α - 
L
R
Ln 
 
with R as reflection coefficient at edges, as R<1, Ln R < 0 and g must be slightly 
higher than α. 
Resonance is obtained by the cavity structure, for the selection of amplified 
frequency(ies). 
6.3.2. Fabry-Pérot structure laser diodes 
This is the classical structure (Figure 6.9), using a Fabry-Pérot (solid) “cavity” 
made up of the guide and partial reflection (R = approximately 30%, because of the 
strong difference between the semiconductor index with air) at the cleaved edges at 
extremities. Resonance occurs when guide length L is an integer of the half 
wavelength (or λ/2n in the material of index n), which selects longitudinal modes of 
wavelengths: 
λp = 
p
2Ln   
with integer p, hence spacing between lines: 
δλ = 2LN
2
λ
  
with N = n - λ dλ
dn  group index, very close to n. 
In general, since p is large, several wavelengths able to be amplified (because 
they are contained in the gain curve) verify this relation. The laser spectrum then 
contains several lines (Figure 6.9b); this spectrum is said to be longitudinally 
multimode. Although lower than for an LED, the spectral width is significant, which 
is acceptable at 1.3 µm but not at 1.55 µm, because of chromatic dispersion. In 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     155 
addition, a mode partition noise can be observed by energy fluctuation between 
modes. 
This spectrum also depends on current and temperature, acting on the spectrum 
envelope (by shifting the gain curve toward large wavelengths) and on the 
wavelength for each mode simultaneously, using the index dependence on these two 
parameters.  
Temperature increases λ whereas current decreases it. In Fabry-Pérot structures, 
this shift is discontinuous, by mode hops, with a slope of approximately 0.5 nm/º. 
This is the oldest laser diode structure, which is economical but has a mediocre 
performance: strong threshold current, noise, astigmatic radiation. These 
components remain used at 1.3 µm, notably in the FTTH / GPON network in the 
upstream direction (Chapter 10), while waiting for VCSEL availability at 1.3 µm. 
 
 
Figure 6.9. Fabry-Pérot laser diode 
6.3.3. DFB laser diodes 
In order to obtain a single-mode spectrum, a “distributed feedback” (DFB) 
structure can be used, by integrating a Bragg grating (see Chapter 4) of period Λ 
along the guide (Figure 6.10). This periodic perturbation will lead to a distributed 
reflection of the wavelength verifying: λB = 2Λ.n. 
The spectrum is normally longitudinally single-mode (Figure 6.10b). To ensure 
phase matching at λB between both propagation directions, a phase shift section of 
length λB/4 is inserted in the middle of the guide, otherwise two symmetric modes 
around λB appear. In order to avoid Fabry-Pérot cavity spectrum residues, the edges 
must have anti-reflection treatments. The cost of this component is rather higher 
than for Fabry-Pérot type laser diodes. 

156     Fiber-Optic Communications 
 
Figure 6.10. DFB laser diodes 
On the other hand, the single spectrum line widens (chirp effect), when the laser 
is modulated because of the electro-optic effect (variation of the current index, 
which will vary the optical frequency by typically several hundreds of MHz per 
mA). In order to avoid this spectral widening, the laser must be operated at constant 
current and use external modulation of the light, in amplitude or in phase, with 
integrated optics or an electro-absorption modulator (see Chapter 4). 
Due to this index variation, the spectrum depends on the average current as well 
as temperature (now continuously, with a lower slope than for FP lasers, in the range 
of 0.1 nm/°C). Systems that must function at very precise wavelength (particularly 
for dense wavelength division multiplexing) require precise control of the current 
and temperature. It is then possible to modulate optical frequency of the laser by 
modulating its current. It is also possible to modify the temperature to obtain 
wavelength matching to a precise value (but in a narrow range). 
6.3.4. Lateral guiding in laser diodes 
Laser diode structures can also be distinguished by the way lateral guiding of the 
light is performed in the active layer: 
– active or “gain-guided”, i.e. that current flow, or the zone where light will be 
created and amplified, is laterally confined by a conductor “stripe” (Figure 6.11a). 
Only used with Fabry-Pérot diodes, it is the oldest laser diode structure, economical 
but with mediocre performance: high threshold current, noise, astigmatic radiation;

Figure 6.11. Lateral guidance structures of laser diodes 
– passive or “index-guided”, by realizing in the component an integrated guide 
(“buried stripe”) laterally limited by lower index material (Figure 6.11b); the electric 
confinement is ensured by higher potential barriers of lateral heterojunctions. The 
emitting zone is much narrower than previously hence low threshold current and 
relatively symmetric Gaussian radiation, well adapted to single-mode fibers. This 
principle is used for DFB structures, as well as for most of the Fabry-Pérot lasers at 
1.3 µm. 
6.3.5. Wavelength-tunable laser diodes 
For a long time now, heterodyne detection experiments, as well as 
instrumentation and measure applications, have required the development of 
wavelength-tunable laser diodes. Subsequently, the development of optical networks 
using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) between many optical 
carriers required the development of tunable laser diodes that are completely 
integrated and fast tunable.  
External tuning cavities (diffraction gratings for example) were used for a long 
time for varying the laser diode wavelength over a more or less large range, as well 
as by controlling temperature. These methods are precise but complicated and are 
mostly used in the laboratory. However, MEMS technologies, such as micro-
structured silicon resonant cavities, tuned by control voltage, could lead to new, 
more compact external cavity structures. 
The most widely currently used structure is the DBR (Distributed Bragg 
Reflector) laser diode including three sections aligned in a monolithic structure  
(Figure 6.12): 

158     Fiber-Optic Communications 
– the “gain section” which is the actual laser diode, current I1 controlling the 
emitted power; it includes the active layer, close to the guiding layer which is larger; 
– the “Bragg section” which, under the guiding layer, includes a Bragg grating, 
which selects the reflected wavelength (hence the structure name). This wavelength 
is controlled by current I2, by the electro-optic effect which changes the index, with 
a slope of approximately – 0.1nm/mA. This effect also exists in DFB lasers, but it is 
caused by control current, whereas in the DBR structure, intensity and wavelength 
can be separately controlled, and tuning is achieved over a larger range; 
– between the two, the “phase section”, where current I3 performs the phase 
matching between the light reflected by the grating and the one reflected by the 
other cleaved edge by varying the guide index; it also ensures decoupling between 
the two other sections.

High tunability is then reached, almost continuous in a range reaching over a 
dozen nm, without the wavelength being affected by laser modulation. To cover a 
larger range, several shifted DBR diodes can be used. In wavelength division 
multiplexing networks, these diodes allow the precise adjustment of the wavelength 
of each channel, and can even vary for wavelength routing, a technique in 
development (Chapter 10). They simplify network maintenance because having a 
different diode in reserve for each wavelength is no longer necessary. 
The response time of these components is very quick and is in the range of 
dozens of ns for electronic control, and in µs for thermal control. 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     159 
6.3.6. Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) 
Vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) are more recent components 
with a structure that is different from the other laser diodes. The “cavity” is vertical, 
perpendicular to the substrate, the light is vertically emitted by the component 
surface. This property makes them economical components to produce and test in 
large quantity on a single wafer, as well as to integrate in communication or signal 
processing monolithic devices. 
Due to this structure (Figure 6.13), the “cavity” is very short, making the 
longitudinal single-mode operation easier, but requiring us to respect the gain 
equation (see section 6.3.1): 
– a large gain in the cavity, which is obtained with an injected current of a few 
mA thanks to its very small transversal dimension; the active zone, generally made 
up of a few quantum wells, is only a few dozen nm thick; 
– high reflectivity mirrors (typically 99%), which are obtained by thin layer 
stacking, acting as distributed Bragg mirrors, matched to the transmission 
wavelength, increasing spectral selectivity (but the Fabry-Pérot cavity made up of 
these mirrors is the one selecting the mode). Tunable VCSEL diode prototypes, 
where mirrors are carried by mobile microstructures (MEMS), have been developed. 
Layer thickness must be very precise but epitaxy production methods are well 
controlled and a large number of identical lasers are simultaneously produced in the 
same wafer. The largest size and the lowest divergence of the transmitted beam in 
fact authorize a cheaper connection than for edge-emitting diodes.

Figure 6.13. VCSEL laser diode 
For reasons related to material properties, the first VCSEL (in GaAlAs/GaAs) 
were developed at 0.85 µm with very good commercial performance. Due to their 

160     Fiber-Optic Communications 
low cost and ease of integration, they have quickly found several applications in the 
fields of optical reading and recording, laser printing, high bitrate optical 
interconnections internal to computer equipment, and very high bitrate local 
networks (several Gbit/s), even over multimode fibers. VCSEL diodes which can be 
directly modulated at 10 Gbit/s have appeared.  
Red VCSELs have also emerged recently for plastic fibers, and orange for DVD 
reading and writing. InP components for 1.3 and 1.55 µm are in development, but 
despite regular laboratory announcements, they are still not really available. 
6.4. Optical transmitter interface 
6.4.1. Description 
The optical transmitter interface includes, in addition to the emitting component 
(LED or LD), the circuits necessary for its feeding, its modulation, its protection and 
possibly its cooling function, and finally an optical coupling device (lens or pigtail 
connection). The cost of the interface is therefore significantly higher than the cost 
of the component especially because of the last point which requires very high 
precision. 
A certain number of electronic and optoelectronic devices (photodiodes, 
amplifiers) are part of the interface, and their monolithic integration is the subject of 
several research studies, even though it is still not economically appealing. The 
integration of optical devices (filters, isolators, modulators, switches, amplifiers, 
etc.) at transmitter output is in development. 
6.4.2. Laser diode characteristic 
The use of laser diodes is much more complicated than the use of LEDs because 
of the optical power versus current characteristics (Figure 6.14) which is not regular. 
It presents a threshold current Ith below which only very low spontaneous emission 
occurs; above the threshold, stimulated emission occurs with a strong slope of the 
characteristics :

from 25 to 50% (factor 2 is caused by emission from both edges). 
The linearity of this slope is better or worse depending on the laser diode 
structure; it is high in quantum well structures, making it possible to use them for 
analog transmissions of frequency-multiplexed video signals. 
The threshold current also depends on the laser structure, and increases 
irreversibly with age. It greatly depends on temperature T according to the law:

with T0 as temperature coefficient, which is near 50°C for GaAlAs and 70°C for

Due to these characteristics and the increase of threshold current with 
temperature and with laser age, it is necessary to control its bias current to let it 
operate at constant average optical power.

6.4.3. Laser diode modulation 
Internal modulation of the laser diode, the most usual process, is obtained by 
modulating laser current. The modulating signal is superposed on this polarization 
current; its frequency can reach several GHz (Figure 6.15) and even more than  
10 GHz for some VCSELs. The matching of laser impedance must be achieved in 
this very large band, involving microwave frequency technologies. The presence of 

162     Fiber-Optic Communications 
this control prevents the transmission of continuous components. Modulation of the 
current also leads to wavelength modulation (chirp effect) because of the index 
variation that it causes. It is the second limitation to modulation frequency when 
there is chromatic dispersion in the fiber. 
The modulating signal can be analog if linearity is adequate, but it is most often 
binary. In this case, the low level is set near the threshold and corresponds to low 
(but not completely zero) optical power. In fact, in pulsed operation (with low level 
and zero current), the response time is longer.

Figure 6.15. Frequency response of laser diodes 
For very high modulation frequencies (from 5 to 10 GHz), an amplitude external 
modulation must be used, using an integrated optical modulator which follows the 
laser (see Chapter 5).  
Generally an electro-optic interferometer Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) or 
the less costly electro-absorption modulator (EAM) integrated into the laser achieves 
an on-off or analog modulation of the intensity it transmits. 
6.4.4. Transmitter noise 
At emission, a shot type noise exists and is caused by the random character of 
photon-electron interactions, even at constant current. It is characterized by the 
relative intensity noise (RIN) defined by: 
RIN = 
2
2
P
P>
∆
<
 

Optoelectronic Transmitters     163 
with <∆P> as the average fluctuation of optical power P, measured in a band of 1 
Hz. RIN is expressed in Hz-1 corresponding in detection to an electrical signal to 
noise ratio (proportional to the square of the optical power ratio, due to quadratic 
detection) inversely proportional to RIN.∆F. 
Negligible with LED, the RIN equals approximately 10-14 Hz-1 (or -140 dB.Hz-1) 
for laser diodes, the best values reaching -155 dB.Hz-1. It increases at very high 
(laser resonance) and very low (noise in 1/f) frequencies, as well as near the 
threshold current. The resulting signal to noise ratio is largely sufficient in digital 
transmissions, but can be limiting for high quality analog transmissions. 
6.4.5. Laser diode emission module 
6.4.5.1. Control 
For correct use in telecommunications, the laser diode requires a power control. 
The control loop (Figure 6.16) uses a photodiode measuring power at the back side 
of the laser, compares it to a reference value and controls the laser current. With the 
coupling device, it is contained in a hermetic package called the optical head. Its 
cost is quite high because of the very high precision required for the alignment of 
these elements. 
6.4.5.2. Mounting in the optical head 
The emission diagram of laser diodes, because of the guide’s small size and the 
resulting diffraction, is highly divergent. A lens will therefore be necessary to adapt 
it to the mode guided by the single-mode fiber. That is why laser diodes are 
generally used with a pigtail positioned with great precision facing the laser 
emission zone. Its extremity must be prepared in the form of a lens, to improve 
coupling. This lens can be engraved by chemical etching, but the simplest method 
remains to stretch the extremity of the fiber into a cone, and to give it a hemispheric 
form by fusion (Figure 6.17).

Figure 6.16. Laser diode emission module 
The advantage is the reduction of reflections toward the laser, which is very 
sensitive to it: in fact, light re-injection in the cavity increases noise and threshold 
current. Due to their larger emitting zone, VCSELs have less divergence and are 
simpler to couple in optical fibers, even multimode. 
The optical head can also contain a thermistor and a Peltier cooler allowing a 
thermal control. Its usage can be avoided for lasers with low threshold current, 
which do not disperse much heat. However, temperature control is required to 
precisely control the emitted wavelength. In some applications an optical isolator is 
also used, which prevents the possible return of light coming from the optical fiber 
towards the laser.

Table 6.1 compares performance ranges from the different types of transmitters 
that we have just studied. In each family, there is a large number of technological 
variations, corresponding to characteristics (and cost) varying around these typical 
values. They are the components commonly used in telecommunications. There are 
other types of emitting diodes, for visualization, instrumentation, high power or 
ultra-short pulses, that we will not discuss here.

7.1. Photodetectors 
Semiconductor photodiodes, although they are not the most sensitive 
photodetectors, have the advantage of being very quick and easy to use in a 
transmission system. There are two main types of photodiodes. 
7.1.1. PIN photodiode 
This uses photodetection (conversion of a photon into a hole-electron pair) in a 
semiconductor. As we have seen in Chapter 6, only photons with energy hν higher 
than Eg can be detected. 
In order to obtain a good performance, a PIN diode reverse-biased structure, is 
used (Figure 7.1): photons are absorbed in the intrinsic (i) zone which, because of 
bias, does not have mobile carriers (depleted zone); electrons and holes thus created 
have a low probability of recombining. They are separated by the electric field E
G
 
which is in the intrinsic zone and directs them toward zones n and p where they are a 
majority. 
The zone receiving the light must be thin and protected by an anti-reflection 
coating which increases external efficiency and protects material.

7.1.2. Photodiode characteristics 
A reverse current is established in the photodiode junction, with expression: 
i = is + iD  
with: is = S.P photocurrent proportional to optical power P. 
S, in A/W, is the responsivity of the photodiode:  
S = 
ν
η
h
q   
with: 
– η = quantum efficiency; 
– q = electron charge = 1.6.10-19 C. 
Responsivity S increases with wavelength, up to a value where it is maximal, 
then abruptly drops near the limit wavelength, given by: 
λc = 
g
E
hc  
Beyond this the material is transparent. 
iD is the dark current circulating in the junction in the absence of illumination. It 
comes from leaking and thermal generation currents; it increases with temperature 
and bias voltage. 

Optoelectronic Receivers     169 
When it is zero, iD = 0; the photodiode behaves as a current generator (still 
reverse), taking its energy from light received and presenting a direct voltage when 
it flows in a load R, corresponding to the potential barrier. This is the photovoltaic 
operation of the detector (Figure 7.2) used in solar cells or in optical power 
measurement devices; however, response time is too large for transmission use. It is 
the mounting used in optical measure devices which, because of this are very 
sensitive and quite slow (they measure average power). 
On the other hand, when a photodiode is reverse-biased (a few volts are 
sufficient), its response time is very short (less than a nanosecond for a classical 
surface-illuminated photodiode; it decreases by increasing bias voltage). It behaves 
as a current source parallel with junction capacitance. A direct-biased photodiode 
has the classical characteristic of a diode, which is of no interest here.

7.1.3. Avalanche photodiode 
The photocurrent must be amplified because the signal received is often very 
low. Since the preamplifier noise can be predominant, it may be interesting to use an 
internal gain component called an avalanche photodiode (APD). 
Its principle is chain ionization by carrier impact caused by a very intense 
electric field. The avalanche effect, if it is not controlled, leads to junction 

170     Fiber-Optic Communications 
breakdown for a reverse voltage VB (see Figure 7.2). Each primary carrier will 
produce m secondary carriers. 
This electric field is obtained with high reverse bias voltage, in a pn abrupt 
junction, generally separated from the absorption zone, which is thick and slightly 
doped; this is the pπpn structure principle (Figure 7.3), mostly used in silicon APD 
(π corresponds to p-). High multiplication coefficients M are then obtained: M is the 
average number of secondary carriers created (i.e. the average value of m). 
The photocurrent then becomes:  
i’s = M.S.P 
The dark current is multiplied by a factor that is slightly lower than M. It 
increases with bias voltage and temperature simultaneously. 
Thanks to high zone π resistivity, the gain can be controlled. For reasons due to 
material, germanium APDs generally adopt a simple pn structure; the gain is lower 
but obtained under lower voltage. In this case, a law of the following type is used: 
M =

m
B)
V

in which m’ has a typical value from 3 to 6. 
Also defined are the ionization coefficients of electrons, αn, and holes, αp, which 
are the probability of each carrier creating a second carrier by ionization, which 
equals αdx in a material depth dx. Carriers with the highest ionization factor must be 
injected (this is the case with electrons in silicon). 
The use of avalanche photodiodes is decreasing due to the development of 
erbium-doped fiber optical preamplifiers.

7.1.4. Materials used in photodetection 
Contrary to emission, the semiconductor used does not have to be direct. Silicon 
which is an indirect semiconductor widely used for image sensors and solar cells, is 
used up to the limit of its responsivity (approximately 1 µm). Its performances are 
very good and cost is low, hence the interest of the “first transmission window”. 
However, silicon APDs require large bias voltages and are now used mainly for 
instrumentation applications (reflectometry, spectroscopy, image intensifiers, etc.). 
Beyond 1 µm, other material must be used. Germanium is a traditional material 
that is mediocre in performance. It has progressively been replaced by III-V 
semiconductors (GaInAs over InP), with much better performance because they can 
be developed as heterojunction structures (Figure 7.4). Illumination through the 
substrate, in particular, increases performance and decreases leakage currents 
because it is transparent to the detected wavelength. 
Edge illumination in high speed photodiodes uses the active layer as a guide (of 
great depth for photons but low transit time for carriers) and also requires a 
heterojunction. Combined with a matched propagation line structure, these 

172     Fiber-Optic Communications 
components have a bandwidth that is larger than 40 GHz, but their connection with 
fiber optics is as tricky as for edge transmission laser diodes. 
In addition, III-V material enables the integration of detectors, transmitters, 
integrated optical devices (couplers and optical switches) and electronic components 
in the same substrate. In this way a complete transmission module, with monitoring 
photodiode, control circuit and even optical multiplexer can be monolithically

Table 7.1 illustrates the main characteristics of the different material. HgCdTe, a 
II-VI compound, is mainly used in infrared instrumentation and very little in 
telecommunications.  
Germanium has seen a renewed interest in the form of SiGe alloy, for the 
development of high speed components which can be integrated with silicon 
circuits. However, SiGe compositions compatible with a silicon substrate have a low 
germanium content, in order for there not to be too much lattice mismatched (they 
are constrained layers), and can mostly be used in the first window up to 0.98 µm. 
Research projects concerning germanium photodiodes bonding on SoI (Silicon on 
Insulator) substrate are also being carried out.

7.1.5. Phototransistor 
This is a transistor with an illuminated base (Figure 7.5). The depleted zone of 
the reverse-biased base collector junction acts as a photodiode. If the base-emitter 
junction is biased, the photocurrent re-injected in the base is amplified by the 
transistor’s gain β, with a typical value ranging from 30 to 100. It is therefore an 
internal gain component, simpler and more reliable than an avalanche photodiode, 
because it does not require high voltage.

Figure 7.5. Phototransistor 
The silicon phototransistor is not very efficient, however, because the base must 
be relatively thick because of the penetration depth. In these conditions, transistor 
gain and transition frequency are quite low. This component is interesting because 
of its low cost and is mainly used in automations or infrared remote control 
receiving, most often in logical mode (the reception of a certain level of light puts 
the transistor on, otherwise it is blocked). 

174     Fiber-Optic Communications 
Heterojunction phototransistors (HPT) GaAlAs on GaAs, GaInAs on InP or 
more recently SiGe on Si are much more efficient. Developed from heterojunction 
bipolar transistor (HBT) structures, they present transition frequencies of several 
dozens of GHz and gains exceeding a hundred. Their efficiency is better because 
only the base is made out of the lowest gap material, it absorbs the majority of 
photons and there is current gain (whereas photons absorbed in the collector produce 
a photocurrent that is not multiplied). They may be interesting for their integration 
capacity in amplifiers or oscillators, but are still not widely used. 
7.2. Optical receiving interface 
7.2.1. Structure 
The set made up of photodiode, its polarization circuit and the preamplifier is 
often integrated in a single package, connected to the cable by a pigtail fiber, or 
mounted with an optical connector. The hybrid technology is much used for high 
frequencies. If the signal does not contain continuous components, the photodiode 
can be linked to the preamplifier by a decoupling capacity, which eliminates the 
dark current iD (but not the associated quantum noise). 
The optical receiving interface is an analog subset, providing a signal voltage 
proportional to the optical power received. It is used in all link types. It is often 
followed by several amplification stages. However, this interface is the circuit that 
will provide most of the noise on the link and its design must be carried out with 
particular care. 
There are two preamplifier structures (Figure 7.6): 
– high input impedance amplifiers (without feedback), using an operational 
amplifier (at low frequency) or a field effect transistor. By giving high value to RP, 
the receiver is very sensitive (the v/P ratio, generally provided in mV/µW, is very 
high) and very low noise. However, the time constant τ = RC is very high, hence a 
low-pass filtering effect (or the signal integration beyond the cut-off frequency). The 
amplifier must have high dynamics and be followed by an equalizer, difficult to 
adjust because τ is not very reproducible, and which increases high frequency noise; 
– transimpedance amplifiers with a parallel RC feedback resistor. If the (discrete 
or integrated) amplifying chain gain is large, then vs ≈ -RCis. Ratio v/P is not as high 
as in the previous structure, but it is flat and reproduced over a large bandwidth. The 
time constant is divided by the feedback ratio. On the other hand, feedback 
resistance provides additional noise.

7.2.2. Photodiode noise 
7.2.2.1. In PIN photodiodes 
Because of the random distribution of  photon arrival instants or generation of 
electron-hole pairs, a shot noise appears in the junction, which is also called 
quantum noise. This is a Gaussian white noise with spectral density in current: 
df
i
d
2q>
<
 = 2qi 
with i as the average current in the photodiode and q the electron charge. 
This noise, whose power is proportional to the received optical power (whereas 
electric signal power is in P2), constitutes the theoretical limit to the range of 
transmission systems. It is in fact due to the quantum nature of light, photons 
arriving randomly, following a Poisson distribution. The probability of detecting n 
photons during the time interval {t, t+∆t} equals: 
P(n) = 
!

e.

with N as average number of photons detected during a ∆t period. 
7.2.2.2. In avalanche photodiodes 
In this case, multiplication is accompanied by an excess noise. In fact, each 
primary carrier produces m secondary carriers since m is a random variable with an 
average value  M. Shot noise power is then multiplied by its quadratic mean value 
<m2>, higher than M2, noted as: 
<m2> = M2.F(M)  
with F(M) as the excess noise factor. 

176     Fiber-Optic Communications 
This factor depends on material, more precisely on the ratio k’ between the 
electron ionization coefficient and the hole ionization coefficient, in the sense that 
k’<1, again on the condition of injecting higher ionization carriers. Its law is: 
F(M) = k’M + (2-1/M) (1-k’) 
that can be transformed into the approximate form:  
F(M) = Mx 
In the most unfavorable case where αn = αp, x = 1 (this is the case with 
germanium). In total, noise current in an avalanche photodiode has a quadratic mean 
value of:

7.2.3. Optical receiver modeling 
From the point of view of the signal (and noise), the receiver can be modeled as 
in Figure 7.7 where we show: 
– the photodiode modeled as a signal current source, in parallel with a 
capacitance CPD (junction capacitance and distributed parasite capacitance) and the 
quantum noise source; 
– bias resistance RP and eventually feedback resistance RC (RC = ∞ if there is no 
feedback); these resistances are associated with sources of thermal noise current of 
general expression:

with k = 1.38 .10-23 J/K as the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature; 
– the amplifying chain, classically modeled by a noiseless two-port-network, 
with input admittance modeled by a dipole RA//CA, preceded by a noise voltage 
source and a noise current source, which are independent and generally given in the 
amplifier notice.

Figure 7.7. Optical receiver modeling 
7.2.4. Noise current calculation 
Since the signal is a current (is), the noise must be in the form of a current 
brought back to the circuit input. Its quadratic mean value is the sum of quadratic 
mean values of the different noise currents, or: 
< 2Bi > = < 2qi > + < 2th
i
> + < 2Ai > 
< 2Ai >, the amplifying chain noise, comes from the noise current source < 2ni >

In order for this contribution to not be excessive, R must be large and C must be

of the circuit) must be as low as possible (in the order of pF).

This hypothesis is not always verified, notably at high frequencies where the 
noise spectral density has a tendency to increase, but also at very low frequencies 
because of noise in 1/f which is significant in III-V components; to avoid this, low 
frequencies are filtered (which is an additional reason to code the signal). 
If a high impedance structure with a field effect transistor is used, R is very large 
and < 2ni > is negligible. Noise power then increases as ∆F3; this structure is less 
noisy beyond a frequency of approximately 50 MHz (Figure 7.8).

Beyond this, a transimpedance amplifier with bipolar transistors is used, less 
noisy and of large bandwidth. This solution is limited by very high frequency 
stability problems, and integrated structures with field effect transistors InP are used 
integrating the photodiode. They reach bandwidths of more than 10 GHz for high 
throughput systems. Bandwidths over 40 GHz have recently been reached with 
edge-illuminated photodiode structures which minimize surface and therefore 
parasite capacitance.

2.∆F, which comes from the source noise, transmitted and

6.4.4). Since this noise power is proportional to the instant value of P2, its average 
value is then proportional to <P2>, the quadratic mean value of P, and not to Pmr
2. 
These expressions are valid for an avalanche photodiode, as well as for a PIN 
photodiode by making M=F(M) = 1. We can reveal the noise term:

which is equal to the optical power that would give, by photodetection, a current 
equal to the rms (root mean square) input noise current. Since this term is in ∆F in 
the case of white noise, this power is measured in a 1 Hz band; it is called noise 
equivalent power or NEP, in W/ Hz . In order to intrinsically characterize the

this bandwidth is must be verified. 
7.2.6. Optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio 
In practice, three cases are possible (Figure 7.9):

which is constant, the source demanding its own carrier-to-noise ratio, which can

transmissions (see Chapter 8) or specific applications such as microwave antenna

7.3. Other photodetection schemas 
7.3.1. Heterodyne detection 
Direct detection in a photodiode delivers a current that is proportional to the 
optical power or to the field square; this is a quadratic detection. The photodiode 
acts as mixer. This property makes it possible to transpose to optics the heterodyne 
detection principle well known in radio. A beat is created between the optical wave 
received, of angular frequency ωs, and a local oscillator which is a stabilized laser 
diode of angular frequency ωL, in such a way to transpose the modulated signal at an 
intermediate frequency ⎟ ωs - ωL⎟ of several GHz, where it will later be 
demodulated. The advantage is to be able to perform phase or optical frequency 
modulations and to operate a coherent transmission (see section 9.1.5), whereas 
direct detection only authorizes amplitude modulation. 
This frequency transposition is performed by mixing, in a single-mode fiber 
coupler, the electric field of the signal: Es(t) cos ωst where Es(t) is the complex 
amplitude of the received field, containing information, and of the local oscillator: 
EL cos ωLt (Figure 7.10). In order for this to happen, their polarizations must be 
aligned, which is one of the main problems with this type of system. This signal is 
then detected by a photodiode which, because of quadratic detection, will produce a 
current that is proportional to <E2>, where E is the sum of the fields; we then have: 
E(t)2 = Es(t)2cos2ωst + EL
2cos2ωLt + Es(t).EL cos(ωs+ωL)t + Es(t).EL cos(ωs-ωL)t 
After photodetection (which corresponds to a low-pass filtering with a much 
lower cut-off frequency than light frequency), the first two terms have a constant 
average, the third one has a zero average and the fourth one is the signal transposed 
into intermediate frequency. This is amplified because its amplitude is multiplied by 
the local oscillator amplitude. This gain is limited however by shot noise generated 
from the photodiode where its power is almost proportional to EL
2, since the local 
oscillator is much more powerful than the signal received.

It is theoretically possible to have ωs = ωL. It is the homodyne detection that 
makes it possible to gain 3 dB but it is even more complex to implement. The laser 
phase must in fact be controlled in addition to its frequency and polarization. 
7.3.2. Balanced detection 
This process uses two photodiodes receiving two optical powers modulated by 
signals opposed in phase (Figure 7.11). If photodiodes are identical, this differential 
mode cancels dark currents and the continuous component of the light signal, 
directly delivering the modulating signal s(t) to the load. It mainly enables the 
cancellation of source noise (RIN of the laser – Chapter 6, amplified spontaneous 
emission (ASE) of an optical amplifier – Chapter 8) at the receiver, since these 
optical noises are a common mode term and the currents they generate cancel out in 
photodiodes, with only shot noises remaining in the photodiodes.

This is a very complex process because the signal must be carried by two optical 
fibers of perfectly identical lengths and attenuations (the optical path difference 
must remain lower than the distance traveled by the light during a modulating signal 
period, which generally requires a controlled optical delay line) and an external 
modulation must be applied by a modified Mach-Zehnder modulator, delivering at 
two outputs two modulated signals with envelopes in phase opposition. This is 
possible by adding a matched guide coupler to the interferometer (section 2.4.3) and 
by using the optical phase quadrature effect on the coupled signal. It can be shown 
that the sum in one output and the difference in the other are obtained. 
It is therefore used in very specific cases, notably for microwaves over optical 
fibers over short distances: The optical source noise problem can be solved, which is 
limiting for this type of application, and the use of two parallel fibers can be 
accepted over a short distance, even if in practice it is necessary to introduce a 
controllable delay line in a channel.  
Developments made to date, for radar signal transfer for example, use in addition 
one (or more) integrated photodiode pair in order for them to have the most identical 
characteristics possible. 
A balanced mixer is also interesting in heterodyne detection, because it 
eliminates continuous components and local oscillator laser noise (but not the 
quantum noise associated with photodiodes). 
 

Chapter 8 
Optical Amplification 
8.1. Optical amplification in doped fiber 
8.1.1. Introduction 
Rare-earth-doped glasses make it possible to perform optical amplification, and 
therefore amplifiers, as well as lasers. In fact, rare earth atomic properties, similar to 
gas properties (particularly since energy levels are discrete), enable the development 
of 3 or 4 level optically pumped systems. 
The general principle of optical amplification is as follows: an external light 
energy with a wavelength corresponding to the transition between levels n and n + 2 
is absorbed and fills the higher level; emission is performed by radiative transition 
between levels n + 2 and n + 1; as this last level quickly empties by non-radiative 
transition toward stable state n, population inversion is thus obtained. 
Several rare earth elements can be used: erbium (Er) as well as neodymium (Nd), 
the active element of YAG lasers radiating at 1.06 µm, praseodymium (Pr) allowing 
us to design fiber amplifiers operating at 1.3 µm, or even thulium (Tm) enabling the 
widening of amplifier gain to the band 1.45-1.5 µm (band S). 
These elements take the form of ions doping a glass or crystal host matrix. In the 
case of fiber-optic amplifiers, this matrix is a single-mode fiber where the core has 
been erbium-doped during manufacturing. Amplifiers that are currently used are 
silica fibers where germanium oxide GeO2 as well as alumina Al2O3 are added to the 
core. More efficient amplification in erbium-doped fluoride fibers has been the 

186     Fiber-Optic Communications 
subject of research studies, but is much more expensive and causes many more 
technological problems; because of this, they have remained unused. 
Other research projects involve the development of integrated optics amplifiers 
in erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers (EDWA); applications are possible in signal 
processing or in photonic integrated circuits performing switching functions. 
Finally, laser sources using diode pumped Er+++ or Nd+++ doped crystals are 
currently available. 
8.1.2. Optical amplification principle in erbium-doped fibers 
The advantage of erbium in optical telecommunications is that one of its 
emission bands, around 1.54 µm, corresponds to the minimum attenuation in silica 
fibers. This band can be pumped to 1.48 or 0.98 µm, wavelengths where high power 
pump laser diodes can be developed (Figure 8.1). 
In the case of pumping at 1.48 µm, it is the equivalent of a three level system, 
both lower levels corresponding in fact to two of the sublevels resulting from the 
widening of the fundamental level by the Stark effect. This effect is caused by the 
host crystal lattice influence on the ion. In the case of fibers, host matrix non-
homogenity leads to complex effects of non-homogenous widening and selective 
saturation. Because of level widening, wavelengths which can be radiated and 
amplified are contained inside a relatively large band. 
Emission wavelengths, as well as the amplified bandwidth, slightly depend on 
the host matrix (the maximum is at 1,536 nm in the aluminum co-doped silica, and 
at 1,540 nm in fluoride fibers). They can be characterized by the fluorescence 
spectrum of the material corresponding to its spontaneous transmission after 
excitation by a wavelength contained in the absorption spectrum (see Figure 8.2). 
In the case of pumping at 0.98 µm, it is a four level system, since the higher level 
is pumped through an even higher level with non-radiative transition between the 
two. The absorption and emission spectra are then well separated, which improves 
amplifier characteristics, in efficiency and noise.  
On the other hand, 0.98 µm laser diodes, developed in AlInAs over InP (or 
GaInAs over GaAs) in the form of constrained quantum wells, with lattice 
mismatching, became available later than those at 1.48 µm. For this reason linked to 
system reliability, 1.48 µm pumping was chosen for the first optical amplification 
submarine links. Pumping is also possible at 0.80 µm with low cost laser diodes, but 
it is not very efficient. 

Optical Amplification     187 
The excited state has a limited radiation lifetime of a dozen ms. This relatively 
high value provides efficiency and gain stability for signals with a frequency higher 
than a few kHz. It is a significant difference with semiconductor amplifiers where 
this lifetime is of the order of ns and where the gain is not stable for signals of less 
than a few GHz. In any case, there is a transient response effect at signal input. 
Absorptions by excited states can occur and lead to emission at lower 
wavelengths than the pump. 
 
Figure 8.1. Principle of optical amplification in erbium 
8.1.3. Optical amplification gain 
The gain coefficient by unit of length, which depends on the optical frequency 
ν, is given by: 
g(ν) = Γ.σe(ν).N2  
with σe (ν) as the effective emission cross-section. 
However, the absorption coefficient by unit of length is given by: 
α(ν) = Γ.σa(ν).N1  
with σa (ν) effective absorption cross-section: 
– N2 = x.nt and N1 = (1-x)nt are the higher and lower level populations; 
– nt is the total erbium concentration (in m-3); 

188     Fiber-Optic Communications 
– x is the fraction of excited ions (included between 0 and 1), increasing with 
pump wave intensity, which increases amplifier gain; 
– Γ is the overlap integral between its spatial distribution and its guided mode 
distribution. These distributions must coincide as much as possible, in order for Γ to 
be close to 1; actually, average gain on a cross-section is considered. 
Cross-sections (called this because their dimension is the square of a length) are 
approximately 10-24 m2 (Figure 8.2). They are tricky to measure directly.

where E is the transition energy. 
The emission is shifted toward longer wavelengths than absorption; but there is

the temperature is high. 
8.1.4. Amplified signal power 
Signal power along the optical fiber, P(z), is calculated by: 
dP/dz = P(z) [g(z) - α(z)] 

Optical Amplification     189 
which generally requires a complex numerical calculation, because it involves pump 
wave absorption and intermediate level depletion, accelerating when signal power 
increases, until a state is reached where there is no longer population inversion. 
These two effects decrease x, then the net gain, when z increases. Owing to this, 
gain goes through a maximum after a length Lopt, in the order of a dozen meters, 
which increases with pump power. In addition, gain depends on optical power at 
input, which can require stabilization, by AGC or by deliberately saturating the 
amplifier. 
Gain spectrum at amplifier output has a strong resemblance to the emission 
spectrum, but is not identical because absorption is involved; its decrease when the 
wavelength increases in the 1.53 – 1.57 µm band, which is optimal for amplification 
(gray zone in Figure 8.2), makes the gain spectrum at amplifier output flatter than 
the emission spectrum. 
Figure 8.3 gives power ranges of the signal and pump in the case of erbium-
doped silica fibers (the optimal length is shorter with fluoride fibers). Pumping back 
reaches higher power (but not necessarily higher signal-to-noise ratios).

Figure 8.3. Evolution of power along the amplifying fiber 
As erbium-doped wavelength amplifiers (EDWA) are very short, they operate 
under much more homogenous conditions and their gain is more stable, but the 
power obtained is not as high, and as with all integrated optical devices, they are 
penalized by connection losses with the fibers.

8.1.5. Optical amplification noise 
The noise in an optical amplifier is caused by the amplified spontaneous 
emission (ASE), which is caused by the pump wave. It is an optical background 
noise propagating in both directions. It is expressed by its spectral density at 
amplifier output: 
Nase = 2 Nsp (G-1)hν  
where G is the gain, and Nsp is the population inversion factor (factor 2 is due to 
spontaneous transmission in both polarizations). It is given by: 
Nsp =

It decreases by ∞ (inversion appearance) to 1 (total inversion). 
Nsp is only slightly higher than 1 if pumped at 980 nm, almost total population 
inversion (N1 << N2) can then be obtained. It is higher if pumped at 1,480 nm. As with 
gain, noise has quite a large spectrum (Figure 8.4a), and it must be filtered around the 
signal wavelength. Contrary to an electronic amplifier, this noise is not independent 
from the signal. It decreases in the presence of a signal because the stimulated 
transmission decreases spontaneous emission probability then noise (Figure 8.4b).

8.2. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers 
8.2.1. Description 
The two main elements of an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) are the 
erbium-doped amplifying fiber and the pump laser, which continuously emits a 
power of several dozen mW at 0.98 or 1.48 µm. Pumping can be injected in the 
same direction as the signal (forward pumping), or in the reverse direction 
(backward pumping). Some amplifiers use a pump in both directions. This is the 
case with amplifiers for submarine links, where these two pump lasers are shared 
between both directions in order to ensure security, as the system can continue to 
operate with only one pump (Figure 8.5). 
The signal and pump are multiplexed by a wavelength division multiplexer in 
order to minimize losses. Isolators prevent the amplification of a signal that would 
arrive in the reverse direction from the fiber and therefore the occurrence of an 
oscillation by reflected wave amplification. In fact, the amplifier medium made up 
of the fiber is by nature bidirectional. They also stop amplified spontaneous 

192     Fiber-Optic Communications 
emission propagating in the opposite direction. Pump laser diodes are also equipped 
with isolators which are not represented in the figure. 
In order to further reduce connection losses with line fibers, a mode-adapting 
fiber section is generally used. In fact, the diameter of the mode guided by the 
amplifying fiber is slightly lower than the line fiber. This allows us to increase the 
power density of the pump wave, therefore the gain and efficiency. 
There is also at the repeater output an optical filter, intended for the elimination 
of pump wave residue and to reduce amplified spontaneous emission, as well as a 
photodiode for output level control and to possibly perform automatic gain control. 
 
Figure 8.5. Erbium-doped fiber-optical amplifier schemas 
8.2.2. Characteristics 
An optical amplification repeater is much simpler than an electronic repeater-
regenerator. It generally contains a monitoring electronic circuit, but it does not work 
at a high bitrate. It is actually only an amplifier with the following advantages: 
– less complexity and cost; 
– more reliability; 
– transparence of transmitted signal, i.e. the bitrate may be changed without 
modifying amplifier operation (which is quite impossible in the case of the repeater-

Optical Amplification     193 
regenerator, because of clock recovery); moreover, analog or digital signals can 
equally be amplified; 
– gain has a very low dependence on polarization of the signal wave (it was a 
significant advantage compared to heterodyne detection); 
– possibility of simultaneously amplifying a large number of multiplexed 
wavelengths. This advantage has been a determining factor because it has made it 
possible to use on a large scale, and in an economical way, wavelength division 
multiplexing. 
In addition, amplification in a single-mode fiber can be obtained with a relatively 
low pump power (a few dozen mW) because of the high concentration of the pump 
wave, contrary to bulk crystals. 
However, over a long link there are disadvantages caused by the absence of 
regeneration: 
– accumulation of noise from one amplifier to another; 
– accumulation of pulse broadening caused by chromatic dispersion; 
– significant non-linear effects because of high output level. 
8.2.3. Gain parameters of an optical amplifier 
As with an electronic amplifier, an erbium-doped fiber amplifier is characterized 
by: 
– its gain in small signal: g = 10 log G; this is in the order of 20 to 30 dB for 
pumping at 1,480 nm, from 30 to 40 dB for pumping at 980 nm; an amplifier could 
theoretically compensate the attenuation of 150 to 200 km of optical fiber, but in 
practice this value is decreased because of noise; 
– its saturation power, defined as in electronics by the power of the output signal 
when the gain is divided by 2 (or reduced by 3 dB): at output, it now reaches 
between 20 and 30 dBm for pumping at 980 nm. As it gets closer to saturation, 
quantum efficiency gets closer to its maximum (Figure 8.6). This power is becoming 
closer to power causing non-linear effects in the optical fiber (and even reaches it 
with the most powerful amplifiers exceeding 30 dBm, which requires laser security 
precautions); 
– its quantum conversion efficiency (QCE) defined by: 
QCE = 
p

λ

194     Fiber-Optic Communications 
where p relates to the pump and s to the signal. It leans toward a maximum at 
saturation, whereas gain decreases (Figure 8.6). It exceeds 80% with forward 
pumping; 
– its gain to pump power ratio: this ratio is relatively constant and goes by a 
maximum of approximately 4 dB/mW for pumping at 1,480 nm, and reaches  
10 dB/mW for pumping at 980 nm. The amplifier gain can then easily be controlled 
by using the pump power.

8.2.4. Amplified bandwidth 
Optical bandwidth is approximately 30 nm for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers; it 
covers “band C” from 1,530 to 1,565 nm, corresponding to the ITU grid for 
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). However, it is necessary that the gain be 
as flat as possible in this band; but gain flatness depends on temperature, on input 
power and on the possible saturation of the amplifier with a signal from another 
wavelength (spectral hole burning phenomenon or appearance of “holes” in the gain 
spectrum). Gain equalization of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers is a tricky point, 
which for lack of anything better is performed by filters attenuating wavelengths 
with too much amplification. The use of photo-inscribed Bragg gratings is one of the 
most efficient methods. 
Doped fluoride fibers allow a larger and flatter band, it was one of their main 
advantages compared to the first silica fiber amplifiers to have motivated a 
comeback in research studies for this material, but they have turned out to be too 
fragile.

8.2.5. Noise figure 
As with an electronic amplifier, the noise figure is defined as (optical) signal-to-
noise ratio degradation between input and output. At input, the optical “background 
noise” has a spectral density of hν, resulting from the Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle; at output, it is increased by the amplified spontaneous emission of spectral 
density Nase. Input (-10logC1) and output (-10logC2) losses (Figure 8.7) must be 
taken into account.

If G is large and losses are low, then F leans toward a limit equaling 2 Nsp; the 
theoretical minimum is 3 dB (in the absence of a particular action on polarization). 
If G is small, F becomes lower than 3 dB when G leans toward 1, which is no longer 
interesting from a practical point of view. The noise figure is a good indicator of 
amplifier quality, but for noise calculation on the link, it is preferable to use spectral 
density Nase. 
As with an electronic amplifier, input losses (low C1) deteriorate noise figure. 
This is one of the reasons that it becomes high for semiconductor amplifiers. 
8.3. Noise calculation in amplified links 
8.3.1. Input noise in the presence of an optical amplifier 
After photodetection, optical noise will create a beat with the signal of received 
optical power PS(r), as with itself, because of quadratic detection. A noise current 
then appears in the receiver which adds to the shot noise of photodetection and 
possibly to the source’s relative intensity noise (see Chapter 6), which is generally 

196     Fiber-Optic Communications 
negligible at the receiver. The global noise current has an quadratic mean value 
which is the sum of: 
– shot noise associated with the signal:  
<iq(s)
2> = 2q.S. PS(r).∆F  
– shot noise associated with the spontaneous emission: 
<iq(ase)
2> = 2q.S. Pase(r).∆F = 2q.S. Nase(r).∆ν.∆F  
– the beat between signal and spontaneous emission: 
<ib(ase)
2> = 2S2. PS(r).Nase(r).∆F  
– the beat between the different components of spontaneous emission: 
<ib(ase/ase)
2> = 2S2. Nase(r)
2. ∆ν.∆F 
The electric signal power after detection still equals: 
is
2 = S2. PS(r)
2 
Nase(r) is the spectral density of amplified spontaneous emission received at 
detector input. It is assumed to be constant within the optical filter of width ∆ν. The 
beat phenomenon, a consequence of quadratic detection, results in that all amplified 
spontaneous emission components far from each other (or from the optical carrier) at 
less than ∆F will create electric noise within band ∆F containing the signal. 
∆F is the electric filter bandwidth, determined by the signal bitrate, whereas ∆ν 
is the optical filter bandwidth, larger in practice, that should be made as small as 
possible (since the theoretical minimum, in intensity modulation, is 2∆F). 
Otherwise, noise terms related to amplified spontaneous emission can become very 
high. The optical fiber offers some “self-filtering”, because of its spectral attenuation 
curve, but it is not sufficient. 
We can develop these formulae by using: 
PS(r) = GC1C2A P(e)  
and: 
 Nase(r) = 2 Nsp (G-1)hνC2.A 

Optical Amplification     197 
in the case of a link with one amplifier, separated from the receiver by a total 
attenuation A (or –10 logA in dB) of the fiber section, since P(e) is the signal power 
at amplifier input. We note that quantum noise terms are as A.G, whereas beat terms 
are as (A.G)2, as with electric signal power. 
8.3.2. Case of an optical preamplifier receiver 
In the case of use of a doped fiber preamplifier just before the detector, A is 
close to 1 and the beat terms are predominant. As long as they are lower than 
background noise of the receiver, the carrier-to-noise ratio at input is improved by 
10 log G. When gain is high, and they dominate background noise, noise is in G2, 
and increasing gain does not improve the signal-to-noise ratio. It is possible to 
calculate the value of G for which these noises are equal (if the equivalent optical 
power of the receiver noise is known, Chapter 7), providing the value of “asymptotic 
gain” that is possible on the average power received which is necessary for a given 
signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 8.8). Its typical value is 15 to 20 dB.

Figure 8.8. Input power required versus preamplifier gain 
In instrumentation (notably in reflectometry), optical preamplifiers are beginning 
to be used to amplify very low optical signals and thus get closer to the quantum 
limit. 
On the other hand, if the amplifier is far from the receiver, A<<1, which 
generally makes the beat terms negligible. The gain must then be strong since the 
dominating noise is quantum noise, in G, whereas (electric) signal power is in G2. 
Gain limit is then due to amplifier saturation. 
In PON access networks (Chapter 10), the power of a single optically amplified 
transmitter (or of several, wavelength division multiplexed) can be distributed  
between a large number of receivers with star couplers. The limit to these systems’ 

198     Fiber-Optic Communications 
capacity, in power and in number of channels, is due to the non-linear effects which 
will create intermodulation products between the different optical carriers. 
8.3.3. Noise calculation over long links  
Because of the absence of regeneration, noise accumulation occurs which limits 
the distance between optical amplifiers, at a value that is all the lower as the link is 
long. In fact, at the end of a length L, including M identical amplifying sections with 
length d = L/M, optical noise caused by amplified spontaneous emission 
accumulation equals, in spectral density: 
Nase(tot) = 2 M Nsp (G-1)hν 
where: 
g = 10 logG = αd 
is the gain in dB for each amplifier which compensates the attenuation of the 
previous fiber section, of lineic attenuation α.  
Hence: 
M = αL/g  
and: 
Nase(tot) = 2 Nsp αL 
G
log
10
1
G−
hν 
which is all the lower the smaller G is. 
This term occurs in the different noise components described previously. The 
link calculation will then allow us to determine its maximum value depending on the 
expected bit error rate, thus on the signal-to-noise ratio. The maximum G gain value, 
hence the minimum number of amplifiers to use, is deduced from it. Since G 
decreases when L increases, the number of repeaters increases faster than  
the link length (contrary to the case of a regenerated link where they are 
proportional). That is why if the distance between amplifiers is of 50 km for a  
6,000 km link at 10 Gbit/s, it falls to 35 km for a 9,000 km link. 
Reality is more complicated because amplifier saturation by optical noise 
accumulation has to be considered. Narrow optical filters must then be used in each 
amplifier to avoid the appearance of this phenomenon. As long as the amplified 

Optical Amplification     199 
spontaneous emission power is much lower than the signal, it can work by saturating 
the signal, providing some level control on the link. In a long link, the use of 
automatic gain control (AGC), by acting on pump power, is recommended, 
however, in order to compensate for the possible attenuation fluctuations. 
The use of an error correction code at the receiver becomes very useful (and is 
easier than with a regenerated link where it would need to be used at each repeater). 
In the case of a submarine link, since intermediate amplifiers are remotely 
powered, the goal is to optimize gain while limiting pump power. Ratio g/Pp must be 
maximized. It is possible to remotely pump an in-line amplifier from a terminal 
located several dozen kilometers away. In a submarine link, it is then possible to 
increase the distance between terminals, and avoid submerged active elements 
(distances of over 400 km have been reached). 
8.4. Other types of optical amplifiers 
8.4.1. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SCOA) 
It is possible to amplify light through a structure very similar to an edge-emitting 
laser diode (Chapter 6), whose faces are anti-reflection treated, to avoid the 
occurence of a laser cavity (Figure 8.9). The operation is in progressive waves 
allowing us to use the total gain band of the material. The amplification threshold is 
then slightly lower than the laser emission threshold and this component can be used 
as semi-conductor optical amplifier (SCOA) with a gain band that is relatively large 
(30 to 40 nm). 
For use in repeaters however, it presents the following drawbacks compared to 
erbium-doped fiber amplifiers: 
– rather low saturation power (approximately 10 dBm for pump current of a 
hundred mA); 
– relatively high noise (caused by amplified spontaneous emission); 
– some sensitivity to incoming light polarization, but this drawback which is 
characteristic of the first SCOAs is less sensitive in more recent buried stripe 
structures; 
– significant connection losses with the optical fiber is a major problem for line 
repeaters, but it is less so for amplifiers integrated with a laser source, a modulator 
or an integrated optical device; 
– short carrier lifetime (in the range of a nanosecond), resulting in gain 
dependence on the signal for frequencies lower than 1 GHz, and a high-pass type 

200     Fiber-Optic Communications 
response. If there is wavelength division multiplexing, a variation of the signal at a 
wavelength can modify the gain for another wavelength. 
SCOAs, however, present practical advantages compared to EDFAs (cost, size, 
consumption, integration with other optoelectronic functions) and are beginning to 
find other network applications.

8.4.2. Other SCOA applications 
Their drawbacks can be used to create new functions (mixer, wavelength 
conversion, etc.). In fact, in order to transfer modulation from an arriving signal at a 
wavelength λ1 to another wavelength λ2, a coupling is performed at amplifier input 
between the signal at λ1 and a laser diode in continuous wave mode (cw) at  λ2 
(Figure 8.10). When the level is low at input λ1, λ2 sees the maximum gain and gives 
a high level at output λ2 . When the level is high at input λ1, the amplifier is 
saturated and gives a low level at output λ2 . It is then a transfer of modulation with 
logical inversion. This effect is only efficient below the frequency, in the range of 
GHz, beyond which the gain is stabilized. 
 
Figure 8.10. Wavelength conversion 
Semi-conductor amplifiers can also be used as optical gates operating in on-off 
mode (switching from on to off state in a few hundred ps). Due to their integration 
capacity, they could be used as very fast (but with high consumption, even in the 

Optical Amplification     201 
absence of switching) switching matrix elements. They also enable optical 
regeneration experiments, being used as gates controlled by a clock, reshaping the 
signal. 
8.4.3. Amplifier comparison 
This is summarized in Table 8.1 where we compare EDFA and SCOA. In the 
first category, the best performances were obtained with silica fibers pumped at 980 
nm, even if the pumps at 1,480 nm showed a reliability advantage with the first 
systems. Doped fluoride fibers are mentioned for reference, but due to their cost and 
brittleness they were abandoned. 
8.4.4. Raman amplification 
The Raman amplification (whose principle is explained in section 2.5.2) 
allowing the amplification of any band simply by choosing the pump wavelength, 
seemed like an interesting solution for long distances; it is in experimentation in 
some links (Figure 8.11). This is a “distributed amplification” because it occurs in the 
line fiber, caused by the Raman pump which is injected in the reverse direction from 
the signal just before the doped fiber amplifier, which is the configuration 
minimizing noise. 
However, the efficiency of such an amplification is very low and all technical 
problems are not resolved. One of the few operational applications is to pump the 
fiber of a medium length submarine link (without submerged repeaters) from the 
receiving land terminal, thus gaining 10 to 20 dB.

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems 
9.1. Structure of a fiber-optic digital link  
9.1.1. Different systems 
The vast majority of fiber-optic links are naturally made up of digital links even 
though analog transmissions are still used in video or remote measurements. Fiber 
optics’ low attenuation and large bandwidth take full advantage of digital 
transmissions, which became predominant in the telecommunications network  when 
the first fiber-optic systems were being developed. 
These systems can be classified into larger categories: 
– wide area network (WAN) infrastructure, which first used plesiochronous 
digital hierarchy steps followed by massive deployment of the synchronous digital 
hierarchy SDH/SONET (see section 10.3). Fiber-optic links constitute the 
transmission infrastructure of the “optical transport network” (OTN) which carries 
SDH, ATM, IP, etc. frames. They are managed by “historical carriers” such as 
France Télécom, as well as by “carrier’s carriers”, often associated with traffic path 
companies (railroads, highways, riverways, electric networks, etc.) who re-lease 
transmission capabilities to telecom service providers in the form of “dark fibers” or 
channels materialized by one or more wavelengths; 
– metropolitan area networks (MAN), for cities or for a very large business sites 
(airport, business district, etc.) often with a loop architecture and competition 
between SDH and Ethernet at 1 or 10 Gbit/s for the protocol. Contrary to WANs, 
this market is still growing in the recent fluctuating economy; this is in particular 

204     Fiber-Optic Communications 
where the most complex architectures are, and there is high demand for passive 
optical components; 
– local computer and company networks, and internal local area networks 
(LAN); they can be made up of point-point links connected by electric nodes, as 
well as by passive optical networks; Ethernet dominates this market but more 
specific protocols exist (FDDI, Fiber Channel, fieldbus, IEEE 1394 called “firewire” 
for multimedia); 
– distribution and subscriber access networks, designed at one time by FITL 
(fiber in the loop), and more commonly by FTTH (Fiber to the Home) or FTTx 
(Fiber to the …) x designating an intermediate point where the fiber arrives, with 
several variations (see section 10.2). 
For these last two categories, which require increasing throughputs, an important 
challenge has been equipment and installation cost reduction, in order to be more 
competitive with twisted pair, operating over short distances with relatively high 
throughputs (Ethernet and ADSL), and with WiFi wireless networks. 
9.1.2. Long–haul links over optical fibers  
They are organized according to the diagram in Figure 9.1, inherited from coax 
cable transmission systems. Up to 100 km long, they can operate without 
intermediate repeater. Beyond that, equipment must be inserted which, in the first 
generation of optical systems (approximately 1980–1995) were repeaters-
regenerators including optoelectronic interfaces and logical circuits necessary for 
signal regeneration. This was an element of cost and a brake to throughput increase, 
especially in submarine systems. 
Erbium-doped fiber amplification has enabled the implementation of optical 
amplifier repeaters (Chapter 8). The signal remains in the optical form, which makes 
it possible to amplify signals independently from their throughput, which can 
increase without modifying amplifier operation. In addition, these repeaters can 
simultaneously amplify several multiplexed (neighboring) wavelengths. On the 
other hand, they do not currently regenerate the digital signal and there is 
accumulation of noise and pulse broadening. These repeaters require electric power 
feeding, generally locally provided, except in submarine links (remote power 
feeding; a current of a few hundred mA is sent through a conductor integrated into 
the cable). 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     205 
 
 
Figure 9.1. Diagram of long-haul links over optical fibers  
9.1.3. Line terminals 
These are pieces of end-of-line equipment which mainly contain (Figure 9.2):  
– emission (EOI) and reception (ROI) optical interfaces; for long range systems, 
optical amplifiers can additionally be found behind the transmitter (booster) and in 
front of the receiver (preamplifier); 
– at reception, clock recovery and regeneration circuits; 
– code conversion circuits going from junction code to line code, and vice versa. 
This is often associated with scrambling. We recall that code conversion allows 
clock recovery at reception by introducing frequent transitions in the transmitted 
signal, and the elimination of continuous and low frequency components, generally 
not well transmitted, making transmitter control easier. Some codes allow us to 
measure the average error ratio (but they are not error correction codes at this level). 
Finally, the terminal ensures a double function of monitoring: 
– of itself: signal and clock presence (1), adequate interface operation (2), bit 
error rate at reception (3); 
– and remote monitoring of repeaters, from which it receives information (4) and 
to which it sends commands such as looping (5), through specialized channels.

Figure 9.2. Line terminal for fiber optics transmissions 
9.1.4. Line codes 
In optical transmissions, binary codes are generally used, in which the low level 
corresponds to a zero light power (transmitter turned off, or external modulator on 
“off”): 
– at rather low bitrates, biphase codes (also called Manchester codes) and 
differential Manchester codes (example: Ethernet 10 Mbit/s) or, up to 34 Mbit/s, 
CMI (Code Mark Inversion) codes, replacing one bit by a two bit sequence (Table 
9.1); 
– above this, in order to limit spectral widening, nBmB block codes which 
replace an n bit block by an m bit block, containing the maximum of transitions. For 
example, codes 4B5B or 8B9B are used. The line clock has a frequency that is 
multiplied by m/n. High bitrate systems (FDDI, Ethernet 100 Mbit/s and over, Fiber 
Channel) use it. 
The RZ (return to zero) format is used in long-haul high bitrate links (especially 
submarine), allowing us to slightly push back the dispersion limit: as they are 
narrower at the source, pulses tolerate a slightly higher broadening. 
In these links, the duobinary (or bipolar) format is starting to be used, in which 
bit 1 is alternatively coded by an amplitude of +1 and -1, which in optical terms 
means carrier phase inversion, obtained by an electro-optic modulator (see section 
5.3.5). However, contrary to the systems described in section 9.1.5, this format does 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     207 
 
not need coherent detection, because the absolute amplitude value still equals 1 (bit 
0 is still coded by zero amplitude). The interest is that since the spectrum of such a 
signal cancels out at (optical) carrier frequency, it can be filtered (single-side band) 
and occupies half as much bandwidth (spectral efficiency is doubled). The effect of 
chromatic dispersion is decreased: a 0 between two 1 has a lower risk of being 
overlapped by the spread of neighboring bits, because optical signals will be in 
phase opposition and cancel out.

9.1.5. Coherent optical transmissions 
In all operational systems, information modulates light intensity of a source 
without using coherence from the optical carrier. However, the signals can also be 
transmitted by frequency or phase modulation of a coherent optical carrier, and 
demodulated with the help of heterodyne reception (section 7.3.1). This applies 
classical radio frequency transmission processes to optical frequencies, with much 
larger technological problems. Even though they have been the subject of several 
research studies, these systems have not passed the experimental stage except for 
DPSK modulation. 
The elements of a coherent transmission system are (Figure 9.3): 
– a transmitter made up of a laser diode with very high spectral purity (better 
than the MHz, or a spectral width lower than 3.10-6 nm) modulated in frequency 
(FSK) or most often in phase (PSK or DPSK), by an integrated external modulator 
(Mach-Zehnder); 
– a receiver based on the principle of heterodyne detection explained in section 
7.3.1, by a beat between the received optical wave of angular frequency ωs, and a 
local oscillator of angular frequency ωL, in a photodiode acting as mixer. The laser 
acting as local oscillator is controlled to transpose the modulated signal at an 
intermediate frequency ωs - ωL controlled by a reference. 

208     Fiber-Optic Communications 
The signal transposed in intermediate frequency (IF) is amplified because its 
amplitude is multiplied by the amplitude of the local oscillator. This makes it 
possible to lower the detection threshold and to get closer to the quantum limit. 
Heterodyne detection is difficult to execute however because the local oscillator 
laser must be perfectly stabilized and polarization of the signal received must be 
controlled. Doped fiber-optical preamplification, which is not very sensitive to 
polarization of input signal, allows us to more easily obtain comparable results.

Figure 9.3. Coherent optical transmission system 
The potential advantage of coherent transmissions was also its great selectivity: 
carriers spaced from less than 10 GHz, or 0.08 nm, can be separated in intermediate 
frequency. The spectacular progress of (optical) wavelength demultiplexers has 
greatly deflated this interest. 
However interest has returned for differential phase shift keying (DPSK), a 
classical technique in modems, where optical carrier phase in a bit is reversed in 
relation to the previous bit if the bit equals 1, and retained if it equals 0. Mach-
Zehnder electro-optic modulators are well suited for this modulation (see section 
5.3.4). Demodulation is carried out in another Mach-Zehnder electro-optic 
interferometer by an interference between a bit and the previous bit delayed in a 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     209 
 
delay line made up of a simple longer guide (at 40 Gbit/s, propagation over a guide 
of a few mm is enough to obtain a delay of one bit time), thus avoiding (as in radio) 
recovering the optical carrier phase. Demonstrations were performed at 2 and even 
at 4 phase states. 
9.2. Digital link design 
9.2.1. Filtering 
In order to minimize noise while not creating inter-symbol interference, the 
signal must be filtered. It is known (Nyquist criteria) that the theoretical minimum 
width of this filter in the presence of Dirac pulses is Fr/2, where Fr is the clock 
frequency (calculated after line coding). In practice, a filter of frequency response 
R(f) with a certain roll-off factor is used, for example a raised cosine filter. In the 
presence of pulses of format s(t), and spectrumS(f) , a filter of response G(f) must be 
used, such that: 
R(f) = S(f).G(f). 
In the presence of NRZ pulses, this filter resembles the illustration in Figure 9.4, 
with a noise bandwidth approximately equaling: 
∆F = 0.7 Fr . This value will be used in noise calculations.

9.2.2. Choice of fiber bandwidth 
The use of the Nyquist filter presumes that the optical fiber bandwidth BW is 
much larger than this value. Otherwise, an equalization is necessary in order for the 

210     Fiber-Optic Communications 
global fiber + equalizer + filter response to fulfill the Nyquist criteria. If the fiber 
bandwidth is unknown or liable to fluctuation, this equalization must be adaptive. 
This leads to additional noise and complexity. Thus, in practice, the following rule is 
adopted: 
– if BP > Fr, equalization can be avoided; the inter-symbol interference effect 
will be negligible (as long as the adapted filter is used). This corresponds to a pulse 
broadening at half-maximum ∆τ (due to global fiber dispersion – intermodal and 
chromatic; see Chapter 1) shorter than a half-bit: 
∆τ.DB < 0.5 (DB is the bitrate); or 
– if BP is included between Fr and 0.7 Fr, the pulse broadening effect is no longer 
negligible and leads to a penalty on the received level, in the range of 1 to 2 dB, that 
should be considered in the loss budget. This penalty can be calculated according to 
∆τ.DB, but it depends on the form of the received pulse, thus propagation conditions 
(it is approximately 2 dB if ∆τ.DB = 0.7). If an equalization is made, a comparable 
penalty occurs, but its value depends on the signal-to-noise ratio: the equalization is 
interesting if the SNR is high; 
– if BP < 0.7 Fr, the bandwidth is insufficient; the optical support must then be 
modified: move to another wavelength, replace a multimode fiber by a single-mode 
fiber, or a standard single-mode fiber by a shifted dispersion single-mode fiber, or as 
a last resort, introduce a chromatic dispersion compensating device, depending on 
the dominant cause of pulse broadening. 
If possible, it is better to be in the first case, notably with multimode fibers 
whose bandwidth is too dependent on operating conditions. However, it can be 
necessary to work close to theoretical limits to increase throughput over a support 
that is already in place: that is why Gigabit Ethernet can run over several hundreds 
of meters of multimode fibers, or even over a kilometer, the strong signal-to-noise 
ratio allowing it to tolerate high penalty. 
These semi-empirical rules do not apply as above to polarization mode 
dispersion (PMD, see Chapter 2), because of its random character: operators limit 
resulting pulse broadening to a quarter, sometimes 10% of bit time. 
9.2.3. Calculation of the error probability 
In the case where noise is white, additive and with Gaussian distribution, and 
where there is no inter-symbol interference, errors at regeneration of a binary 
symbol appear randomly, according to a Poisson distribution. The error probability  
equals:

where im is the average current in the photodiode. 
It is given by: im = S.Pmr where Pmr is the average optical power received, by 
presuming that symbol 0 corresponds to a zero or negligible received power. 
This result is somewhat simplified, because it presumes that noise is independent 
from the signal, which is not the case with shot noise. The approximation is correct 
however when the background noise is predominant, which is most often the case 
with a PIN photodiode. 
We can trace curves connecting PE and Pmr versus the bitrate (Figure 9.5 gives an 
example of the range). The penalty caused by dispersion, chromatic or intermodal, 
appears during measures in this type of curve.

9.2.4. Calculation of the average power required in reception 
In reverse direction, using Q, it is possible to calculate the power Pmr 
corresponding to a given error probability (often 10-9); knowledge of this value is 
necessary for optical link design. 
Calculation is simple when the shot noise is negligible (that is generally the case 
in digital transmission when using a PIN photodiode); in fact, the noise is limited to

NEP is the noise equivalent power (in 1 Hz) of the receiver; one or the other 
expression is used depending on data available concerning the receiver. 
With an avalanche photodiode, calculation is more complicated because its noise 
is significant and depends on the power received. When the dark current is 
negligible, calculation defines the optimum APD gain for the minimization of 
average received power for a given error probability  (this is not the same definition 
as in Chapter 7): this gain equals:

If the dark current is significant, then this value is higher. Figure 9.6 shows 
numerical examples of Pmr versus bitrate and depending on the components used; we 
can see that avalanche photodiodes work with a much lower received power, and 
reduce the influence of the input transistor, but maintenance of their gain at a correct 
value must be ensured. 
 
Figure 9.6. Average received power for PE = 10-9 
On the other hand and in both cases, power Pmr increases with the bitrate, 
according to a law depending on spectral distribution of noise (and thus of 
components used); in a first approximation, it can be considered as proportional. In 
any case, the source noise effect can be ignored. 
9.2.5. Quantum limit 
The quantum limit is the theoretical Pmr value in the “ideal” case: in the absence 
of any noise from the source, amplifier, excess APD noise (then F(M) = 1), as well 
as photodiode dark current, we obtain:

This theoretical minimum, proportional to the bitrate, is lower by more than  
30 dB to what a PIN photodiode receiver detects, by approximately 15 dB to what 
an APD detects (Figure 9.6); it corresponds to an average of 20 photons per bit to 
identify it with a probability of error of 10-9 (because of the Poisson photon statistic). 
Using heterodyne detection (section 9.1.5) or optical preamplification (Chapter 8) 
allows us to get closer, but these techniques also generate their own excess noise. 
9.2.6. Loss budget 
In order to design a link at a given bitrate, knowing performances of available 
components, the designer establishes a loss budget, a calculation that determines 
optical power distribution along the link (Table 9.2). These powers are usually 
expressed in dBm (10 log of the power in mW) often resulting in a negative dBm 
quantity, because powers are generally lower than mW (except at laser and optical 
amplifier output). Attenuations and margin in dB are subtracted from power in dBm 
(which in reality is a division of power by a dimensionless factor).

Table 9.2. Loss budget 
Average emission power is in principle equal to half of the peak power, but the 
power actually coupled in the fiber must be considered; it is given by the 
manufacturer if the transmitter is equipped with a pigtail. If the component is in a 
fixed connector, which is mostly the case with a multimode fiber, coupled power 
depends on parameters of the fiber and connector quality. 
Since the bit error rate quickly deteriorates when received power decreases, it is 
necessary to plan for a margin at installation, and to consider a penalty of 1 or 2 dB 
when dispersion is not negligible. The margin is of 3 to 6 dB depending on operating 
conditions (component environment, risk of cable cut-off, frequency of uninstallation 
operations, etc.) and is generally known by experience. 
The available attenuation allows us to calculate the maximum distance between 
transmitter and receiver, by dividing it by the average lineic attenuation of the 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     215 
 
optical cable. It is slightly higher than that of the fiber, since line splice losses and 
the effect of constraints in the fiber are added. This last term is very low however 
with loose tube structure cables protecting fibers from constraints. In the case of a 
multi-terminal network, the available attenuation allows us to calculate the 
maximum number of these terminals. 
After permitted distance calculation using the loss budget, bandwidth availability 
must be verified, as seen in section 9.2.2. Regardless of bandwidth limits, 
throughput increase decreases available attenuation because of increasing input 
noise (and it is barely possible to increase emitted power). That is one of the 
throughput limits. 
When it is not immediately obvious, the choice of components can be made from 
available attenuation versus bitrate for different configurations (Figure 9.7). 
Obviously, the more reliable and less expensive components must be chosen to 
reach the expected ranges.

9.3. Digital link categories 
9.3.1. Point-to-point, non-amplified lines 
Figure 9.8 shows four large families of fiber-optic links, corresponding to 
wavelength windows used. Their spans are limited: on one hand by the attenuation 
(limit slowly decreasing when throughput DB increases), on the other hand by 
(intermodal or chromatic) dispersion, giving an approximately 1/DB limit. Operating 
at the dispersion limit is generally avoided. 

216     Fiber-Optic Communications 
The first category is plastic fiber transmissions at 0.67 µm for very short distance 
local industrial applications (cabling of workshops, computers links, internal to one 
machine, etc.) and up to 100 to 200 Mbit/s bitrate mainly for electric security 
reasons. This is now strongly developing in home automation, multimedia and 
automotive equipment fields. 
The second category operates at 0.85 µm with LEDs and PIN photodiodes over 
multimode fibers. These relatively inexpensive systems are widely used in computer 
and industrial fields for distances in the km range: short distance transmission, local 
area networks (LAN), local distribution and mainly includes digital transmissions, as 
well as video or analog remote measurements. The decisive advantages are again 
electric security and insensitivity to parasites, but also savings in weight and size 
with optical fiber cabling. With LEDs however, bandwidth is limited by chromatic 
dispersion. A large market now addresses local area networks and short distance – 
high bitrate interconnections (1 Gbit/s and more), using VCSEL laser diodes at  
0.85 µm over multimode fibers.

The third category operates the window at 1.3 µm mainly with laser diodes and 
single-mode fibers. The low attenuation at 1.3 µm enables high bitrate metropolitan 
and long-haul links up to approximately 50 km, without repeaters, but the market for 
this window is currently focused on metropolitan area networks (MAN) and very 
high bitrate LANs (typically 1, and now up to 10 Gbit/s). The 1.3 µm window is also 
used over multimode fibers, with LEDs, for high bitrate local area networks (in the 
range of 100 Mbit/s). It can also operate multiplexed systems with two wavelengths 
over a single fiber (subscriber line for example). 
The fourth category is long-haul links at 1.55 µm, requiring monochromatic laser 
diodes (of the DFB type). Without amplification, distances are limited by 
attenuation and can reach 150 km, at several Gbit/s. Standard single-mode fibers  
(G 652) can possibly be used with a chromatic dispersion compensation. For wide 
area networks (WAN), terrestrial as well as submarine, optical amplification 
repeaters and shifted dispersion single-mode fibers (G 655 type) must be used. 
Subscriber access, which used to operate over multimode fibers in the first 
generation (1G), are now being deployed over single-mode fibers in passive optical 
network architecture, multiplexing the 2nd and 3rd window (see Chapter 10). 
9.3.2. Optically amplified links 
The quick progress achieved in the 1990s made it possible to introduce optical 
amplification in long distance transmission systems, and completely replace electric 
repeaters-regenerators. One of the main advantages of doped fiber-optical amplifiers 
is that they operate independently from the bitrate supported by the optical signal, 
and can amplify a large number of wavelengths, to easily increase the bitrate in an 
already installed link. Hence the explosion of throughputs which have gone from  
280 Mbit/s to 640 Gbit/s per fiber in less than 10 years! The initial bitrate of the 
transatlantic TAT 12/13 link (first of this type installed in 1995) was of  
5 Gbit/s, but it can be increased in an already installed link. 
In point-to-point transmission (Figure 9.9), optical amplification can be used: 
– as a line amplifier; total received noise must be minimized, as well as amplifier 
consumption, because they have to be remotely powered; 
– as a preamplifier, just before detection; the goal is to achieve the lowest excess 
noise in order to get closer to the quantum limit; 
– as a booster (power amplifier) right after the source; saturation power and 
quantum efficiency must then be maximized. It is then interesting to operate the 
amplifier at saturation, which stabilizes output power. 

218     Fiber-Optic Communications 
By associating a booster at transmitter and a preamplifier at receiver, links 
exceeding 350 km without intermediate amplifiers have been realized. 
 
Figure 9.9. Optically amplified links 
9.3.3. Wavelength division multiplexed links 
Even though 40 Gbit/s systems are operational, 10 Gbit/s bitrate by wavelength 
is the highest generally used in networks. Increase of throughput is easily 
accomplished using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) making it possible to 
reach hundreds of Gbit/s. Links with 4 to 64 multiplexed wavelengths, each 
modulated at 10 Gbit/s are operational in wide area networks, and are now appearing 
in metropolitan networks requiring increasingly high throughputs. Laboratory tests 
using hundreds of optical carriers have reached bitrates of over 10 Tbit/s per fiber!  
The frequency plan or grid standardized by the ITU specifies wavelengths 
spaced from 100 GHz (or approximately 0.8 nm at 1.55 µm) between 1,528.8 and 
1,560.6 nm (actually from 190 to 198 THz). There are derived plans spaced from 50 
and 200 GHz, and the feasibility of an even denser grid at 25 GHz was 
demonstrated. Actually, the limit is caused by spectral widening of 2∆F created by 
optical intensity modulation. The use of WDM obviously requires laser diodes of 
great purity and spectral stability, and tunable if possible. Multiplexer selectivity is 
reinforced by the use of filters integrated in fibers. In order to increase capacities 
even more, the use of a widened band at higher (“L band” of 1,575 to 1,620 nm) and 
lower (“S band” of 1,500 to 1,525 nm) wavelengths is considered, even though 
erbium doped amplifiers are not as efficient in these bands (other rare earth elements 
such as thulium could be used). 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     219 
 
Besides very high bitrates obtained more simply than with time-division 
multiplexing, wavelength division multiplexing allows us to progressively increase 
the capacity of links already in place. Dense wavelength division multiplexing 
(DWDM) helped in responding to the international traffic explosion, and adapting to 
this trend in a flexible way. This technique also allows us to build multi-terminal 
networks, which explains its increasing interest in architecture evolution. 
Although wavelength division multiplexing has been possible for a long time, 
optical amplification is what has made it interesting. It is easy to perform, because 
erbium doped fiber amplifiers can simultaneously amplify several multiplexed 
wavelengths in the 3rd window. In addition, the very large length on which the signal 
remains optical (it can exceed 10,000 km) makes chromatic dispersion and 
polarization-mode dispersion problems critical. This limits bitrates by channel to 
values approximating 10 Gbit/s, or even 2.5 Gbit/s depending on fiber 
characteristics, and wavelength division multiplexing is currently the best solution in 
order to continue to increase link bitrates. 
The use of optical amplifiers for wavelength division multiplexed systems does 
raise specific problems however: 
– gain “flatness” (it must be identical from one channel to another); this can be 
reached in doped silica fiber amplifiers by using different gain equalizer optical 
devices (based on variable attenuators), adaptive if possible to follow link aging 
(still badly known); 
– turning a channel on or off affects amplifier gain, therefore the level of other 
channels; this problem can be critical in packet networks where traffic is not 
constant; 
– total output level must be limited to avoid non-linear mixing between channels. 
That is why a slight chromatic dispersion is recommended to limit the accumulation 
of non-linear mixing effects between optical carriers. The level of intermodulation 
products actually evolves as DC
2 along the fiber. The use of higher mode diameter 
single-mode fibers, maybe with a photonic bandgap structure in the future, increases 
non-linear effect appearance thresholds. 
Non-linear effects encourage the reduction of the number of multiplexed 
wavelengths, thus the increase of bitrate per channel (the goal is to deploy  
40 Gbit/s), while the dispersion has a contradictory effect. 
9.3.4. Dispersion effects 
In a very long amplified link, and in the absence of regeneration, pulses broaden 
along the link. In order to limit chromatic dispersion, it is therefore necessary to use 

220     Fiber-Optic Communications 
a dispersion-shifted fiber (see Chapter 2). The first non-multiplexed systems 
considered the use of a zero dispersion fiber (G 653), which would have required 
perfectly monochromatic (and tunable) laser sources transmitting at the precise zero 
dispersion wavelength of the link. 
In wavelength division multiplexed systems, this solution is too sensitive to non-
linear effects and it was abandoned for NZ-DSF fibers (G 655), by compensating for 
the line fiber dispersion by a dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) which in the end 
leaves residual dispersion that can exceed 1000 ps/nm because it cannot 
simultaneously compensate for all wavelengths. After demultiplexing, a wavelength 
compensating device must be added (Figure 9.10). In submarine links, chromatic 
dispersion signs alternate from one section to another (the link is said to be 
dispersion managed, which requires custom design). Increasingly used is the RZ 
format which tolerates a slightly larger pulse broadening.

Figure 9.10. Dispersion compensation in long-haul links 
At high throughput, external modulation must be used to avoid chirp effects (see 
Chapter 6) and the very low linewidths inherent to the laser (∆λ less than  
0.1 nm or approximately 12.5 GHz) is reached. In this case, intrinsic spectral 
widening caused by modulation, equaling 2∆F (or 0.15 nm at 10 Gbit/s), can no 
longer be ignored and when it is dominant ∆λ becomes proportional to the bitrate 
DB. This phenomenon limits the product DB
2.L (where L is the total link length) 
since pulse broadening follows a law in DB.DC.L and must remain lower than 1/2DB. 
It is one of the obstacles to the introduction of 40 Gbit/s in long links already 
installed because, according to the previous law, if the bitrate is multiplied by 4, the 
maximum distance is divided by 16 (instead of by 4 as at lower bitrates). 
On the other hand, the fiber must have very low birefringence to avoid 
polarization mode dispersion (PMD) which spreads pulses over time even though it 
has very little influence on amplifier gain (see Chapter 2). This intermodal pulse 
broadening is proportional to 
L  because of the fiber birefringence random 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     221 
 
character; this phenomenon also limits, for other reasons, the product DB
2.L. It is all 
the more critical as it is difficult to compensate for it, and as a precaution,  
the designers generally limit the pulse widening to 10% of bit time. It is another 
obstacle to the development of high bitrate, long links over ancient fibers (if their 
PMD is in the range of 1 ps/ km , it is difficult to achieve more than 100 km at  
10 Gbit/s!). 
9.3.5. New modulation formats 
Even though systems currently in operation at least up to 10 Gbit/s use NRZ, 
sometimes even RZ format (see section 9.1.4), several links have experimented with 
new modulation formats to increase bitrates and have better resistance to chromatic 
dispersion. 
9.3.5.1. Duobinary modulations 
Duobinary modulation, as explained in section 9.1.4, associated with the RZ 
format, is an efficient and relatively simple way to reach these goals. A first Mach-
Zehnder interferometric modulator (MZM, Mach-Zehnder Modulator, see section 
5.3.4) creates the duobinary modulation (zero amplitude for 0, maximum amplitude 
with alternatively 0 and π phase for 1), followed by a second MZM that modulates 
intensity to create a return to zero once per bit (Figure 9.11a). The signal obtained 
can easily be decoded by direct detection since the intensity is enough to identify the 
bit, while the RZ format facilitates clock recovery. The signal envelope is not on-off 
modulated here as in RZ at lower bitrate; instead it is modulated by a sinusoidal 
clock frequency, hence the name intensity modulated (IM) that is also used. 
In another set-up, a classical NRZ modulation is transformed into RZ duobinary 
by a 2nd MZM modulator controlled by a clock at half signal frequency, and a peak-
to-peak amplitude from zero to twice the voltage giving a zero amplitude. The 
optical intensity goes through zero once per bit and the optical phase is reversed at 
each alternation, so from one bit to the next (Figure 9.11b) which creates the desired 
format, also called CS-RZ (Carrier Suppressed – Return to Zero) because there is no 
spectral component at the optical carrier frequency. 
 

222     Fiber-Optic Communications 
 
Figure 9.11. Duobinary type modulations 
9.3.5.2. Phase modulations 
The optical phase modulation is only currently used in the form of differential 
phase shift keying (DPSK) where information is contained in the phase change of a 
symbol compared to the previous one (see section 9.1.5). Demodulation is 
performed in an interferometer with one arm creating a delay of a symbol width 
compared to the other, and does not require phase recovery of the optical carrier, 
which is the advantage with this process. For modulation, the MZM modulator 
works at two phase states (0 and π) with the same amplitude, generally followed by 
a formatting RZ modulator controlled by the symbol clock, hence the name RZ-
DPSK or IM-DPSK given to the process (Figure 9.12a). The intensity of the 
received optical signal reproduces exactly the symbol clock, regardless of the binary 
content. 
It is possible to achieve differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) 
where odd and even bits modulate the in-phase and the quadrature carrier in two 
MZM, with one being followed by a π/2 phase shifter to obtain quadrature 
modulation in a single integrated circuit (Figure 9.12b). Bitrate is thus doubled, with 
identical spectral occupancy. A demonstration by Alcatel in 2007 transported a 107 
Gbit/s signal in RZ-DQPSK (or a symbol rate of 53.5 Gbauds) over 2,000 km by 
using EDFAs and Raman amplifiers (Chapter 8), balanced detection (Chapter 7) and 
wavelength division multiplexing to obtain 10x107 Gbit/s per fiber.

9.3.6. Fiber-optic submarine links 
Succeeding to coaxial cable analog links, the first submarine links were installed 
late in the 1980s (transatlantic TAT8 line in 1988) and used WDM and optical 
amplification as early as 1995. Although this market has suffered from the recent 
economic situation, submarine systems have always been at the leading edge of 
fiber-optic communications because they carry the longest distances, highest 
throughputs and strongest reliability requirements. 
Currently, bitrates are in the range of hundreds of Gbit/s per fiber, with 4 to 6 
fiber pairs per cable. Submarine cables (see Chapter 3) are laid at the bottom of the 
sea by large cable ships, and buried only close to shores. Their repair, after  
cable fishing if necessary by a submarine robot, is possible but tricky and expensive. 
Another difficult point is remote power feeding, since voltages can reach 12 to  
25 kV at line extremities. 
In addition to transoceanic lines (North Atlantic, now exceeded by the Pacific), 
there are several “coastal” links without repeaters, reaching over 300 km by using 

224     Fiber-Optic Communications 
optical amplifiers in on-shore terminals. They can connect islands or cross narrow 
seas (Baltic sea, Mediterranean, etc.). Several countries (Italy, Japan, Brazil, etc.) 
connect their major cities with submarine links along the coast. Most of the 
continents are thus surrounded by submarine cables; Africa is on its way to 
completion. 
Submarine networks are increasingly becoming more prevalent, with several 
landing locations linked to the cable by branching units. The recent SEA-ME-WE 3 
line (South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe), since doubled by SEA-ME-
WE 4, connects more than 30 countries with the same cable (Figure 9.13), using 
wavelength add/drop to multiplex the different destinations, multiplexers are 
submerged (names in boxes are names of the cable ships). Network architectures 
make it possible to apply security procedures by traffic rerouting. 
The growth in international traffic driven recently by the Internet involves an 
increase in installed capacities (they – temporarily – exceed needs in the major 
routes) and undoubtedly surpass satellites, at ever decreasing cost. They also have 
better performance in terms of security and propagation delay, but satellites remain 
indispensable to directly connect a large number of users, especially if they are 
mobile or isolated. There is therefore much more complementarity than competition.

9.4. Fiber-optic analog transmissions 
Although digital links constitute the major part of fiber-optic transmission 
systems, analog links in the field of measure or image transmissions also exist. They 
can be economically interesting for local use. 
9.4.1. Analog baseband transmission  
9.4.1.1. Principle 
It is very simple: the analog signal directly modulates light intensity from the 
transmitter (see Figure 6.8). It uses linearity of the power-current characteristic of a 
LED (Figure 9.14). If the signal is alternative, an im bias current must be 
superimposed. In this case, as in radio amplitude modulation, the modulation index 
is defined as: m = ∆i/im, where ∆i is the signal amplitude. Because of the linearity of 
the transmission chain (fiber–receiver), this relation is the same at transmission and 
at reception.

Figure 9.14. Fiber-optic baseband transmission  
The modulation index is in the range of 90% as it is recommended to avoid 
characteristic extremities which are less linear. Linearity of the modulated signal is 
not perfect however (distortion of a few %). The use of a laser diode can cause 
linearity and noise problems, since the signal-to-noise ratio at laser output is not 
always sufficient for high quality analog applications. The main application for this 
technique is video monitoring in industrial sites or communication ways.

 is the total input 
noise measured in the signal bandwidth ∆F. Aside from receiving noise sources 
studied previously, this term can contain, in a significant part, source noise 
transmitted by the optical line. In fact, analog links require much higher signal-to-
noise ratios than with digital, then lower signal attenuations, and therefore source 
noise. 
As we have seen in Chapter 6, this noise leads to an input noise current of: 
<iL
2> = RIN.∆F.<i(t)2> = RIN.∆F im
2 (1 + m2/2) for a sinusoidal signal.

 which is its maximum possible value. 
This case is less exceptional with analog links, which requires higher signal-to-

formulae from section 9.2 with:

 and: Q =

must be used in formulae from section 9.2. 
Since these formulae calculate average power Pmr at receiver input, we can then 
establish the loss budget and calculate range. Levels between - 20 and - 30 dBm are 
required for a standard high quality analog video signal of 6 MHz bandwidth 
(RSBvideo = 50 to 60 dB). The designer should not forget to verify if a sufficient 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     227 
 
bandwidth is available in the optical fiber (these systems are most often in 
multimode fiber). 
9.4.2. Transmission by frequency modulation of a sub-carrier 
The signal modulates in frequency, with a frequency deviation ∆f, an electric 
sub-carrier, modulating light intensity itself (Figure 9.15). This much more efficient 
process has several advantages: 
– improvement of signal-to-noise ratio by a theoretical factor of 1.5(∆f/∆F)2 
compared to a 100% intensity modulation; 
– insensitivity to non-linearities, leading to the possibility of using laser diodes 
and single-mode fibers and logical low cost links in squared frequency modulation; 
– improved transmission of continuous components, especially using counting 
demodulation, that is important in video and remote measurements. 
 
Figure 9.15. Transmission by frequency modulation of a sub-carrier 
The modulated signal occupies a band 2(∆f+∆F) centered on the subcarrier. It is 
possible to frequentially multiplex several signals (analog or data) in the same fiber 
by modulating them on different subcarriers. In this case, the transmitter must be 
perfectly linear to avoid intermodulation effects between the different channels. This 
solution was used for remote TV antenna transfer to cover shadow areas in 
distribution, in order to transmit several high quality signals sometimes over long 
distances, but now digital has taken over for television. 
9.4.3. Transmission of measurement signals 
Transmission of an electric signal over an optical fiber from a classical sensor 
has a quite specific implementation compared to the use of optical fibers in 
telecommunications 
(Figure 
9.16) 
because 
the 
sensor 
and 
transmission 
optoelectronic interface can be in a “hostile” environment (pressure, temperature, 
high voltage, vibrations, radiation, etc.). 

228     Fiber-Optic Communications 
Due to this, it can be impossible to locally or remotely feed this device, since the 
cable must be isolated; it will need to have autonomous power feeding. Using 
optical power feeding consisting of transmitting the energy in light form and 
converting it into electric current by a photovoltaic receiver may be interesting: with 
a high power source and high efficiency photodiode, a few hundred electric mW can 
be obtained, enough to feed low consumption circuits. 
Optical fibers improve transmission range and quality, especially in a disturbed 
environment. They do not occur in the measure itself, contrary to optical fiber 
sensors where the fiber is the sensitive element as well. 
 
Figure 9.16. Transmission of a measure over optical fiber 
9.5 Microwave over fiber optics links 
9.5.1. Principle and applications 
Even though most of the time information is digital, this technique consisting of 
transporting a microwave carrier (of frequency Fmw of a few GHz to several dozens 
of GHz) over an optical fiber, is similar to analog transmission concerning 
interfaces. In fact, the laser source must be able to be modulated with high linearity 
by a sinusoidal signal (or several multiplexed signals). In addition, if modulation 
with a large number of sub-carrier states (QAM, OFDM, etc.) is used, a strong 
signal-to-noise ratio at receiver is necessary, and the source noise (RIN, see section 
9.4.2) may be a problem. 
This technique already has ancient applications in antenna transfers, particularly 
active antennae where they can feed the many transmitters of the antenna array by 
controlling delay in each optical line and enabling electronic scanning. It now has 
new perspectives in subscriber or mobile station radio access from an optical 
infrastructure (Figure 9.17), notably for the development of wireless local area 
networks (of the WiFi hotspot type). 

Fiber-Optic Transmission Systems     229 
 
Fiberoptic transport of RF modulated signals (from 100 to 1,000 MHz), also 
called radio over fiber, can be assimilated to these techniques. It is used for wireless 
or cable television brodcasting, whether analog or digital; it is the main solution 
used in American coax networks for the migration of cable toward fiber optics 
(hybrid fiber-coax networks, see Chapter 10). 
 
Figure 9.17. Architecture of an optical – microwave link 
9.5.2. Different processes 
In most experiments carried out, the fiber brings signals already modulated in 
microwave frequencies in order to make their conversion easier and control the 
transmission frequency. The main problems involve optoelectronic interfaces which 
must be able to operate at very high frequencies. External modulators can be used at 
20, or even 30 GHz, beyond which very different processes must be used: harmonic 
generation, beat between two lasers or two lines of a laser spaced from Fmw … 
Prototypes were developed but problems remain significant. 
In addition, even though the chromatic dispersion effect of the fiber can be 
limited by the use of a single-side band (SSB, see section 9.5.3) modulation, 
polarization mode dispersion remains a critical problem. 
Due to this, other processes are explored, such as transfer of a modulated signal 
in intermediate frequency over an optical fiber, or the direct conversion from 
baseband optical signal to microwave carrier (we can for example design a photo-
oscillator whose frequency or phase is controlled by light intensity). Table 9.3 
briefly compares these different techniques.

9.5.3. Single-side band transmission 
SSB modulation is more simple and more efficient in the case of microwave 
optical fiber links than for digital systems. The reason is that after optical carrier 
modulation by the microwave signal at a frequency of Fmw, both side bands are 
spaced from 2Fmw making them quite easy to filter (wavelength gap is approximately 
0.6 nm for Fmw = 40 GHz). They can also be separated in an interferometric device. 
Spectral widening of source ∆λ, therefore pulse widening by chromatic dispersion, 
will not be proportional to Fmw, but will be to the clock frequency of the data 
modulating signal which is at a much lower rhythm. 
On the other hand, for demodulation, this technique requires the transmission of 
the unmodulated carrier in the same fiber. The carrier is mixed in the receiving 
photodiode with the transmitted side band, thus recreating by beat the frequency 
Fmw. This process is called self-heterodyne (Figure 9.18). It can be implemented in 
different ways: for example, the unmodulated carrier and the carrier modulated by 
data (and not by microwave signal) can be two lines of a laser separated from Fmw, 
or lines from two slave lasers locked with a single master laser.

Fiber-Optic Networks 
10.1. Computer networks 
10.1.1. Introduction 
Even for short distance, the use of fiber optics in local area networks (LAN) has 
early on dominated the market, mainly because of their well known advantages in 
electric isolation and insensitivity to electromagnetic disruptions, often significant in 
local network environments. 
Optical fibers were used very early on for point-to-point links compatible with 
classical standards (RS 232, IEEE 488, etc.), in token ring type networks or as 
network gateways. Low fiber attenuation enables us to extend these links: for 
example local area network sections can be extended over 2,000 m without 
repeaters. Bitrates have continuously increased, going from a few hundred kbit/s to 
several hundred Mbit/s, now reaching 4 to 10 Gbit/s with Fiber Channel or the latest 
Ethernet versions. 
Optical fibers are also deployed in large scale backbones, constituting networks 
whose nodes (routers or switches) are still electrical. However, switching and optical 
routing have been the subject of several development projects in laboratories and 
should in the future revolutionize network operation. 
On the other hand, field buses are used in the industry to connect machines, 
sensors, robots, embedded equipment, etc. Distances are short and throughputs are 
generally lower, but these networks must function with perfect reliability in 
disrupted environments. They are not as standardized at LANs and there are many 

234     Fiber-Optic Communications 
“proprietary” networks such as FIP (Field Information Protocol), based on a multi-
star optical infrastructure. CAN and Flexray buses used in the automotive industry 
can also use fiber optics as support. 
10.1.2. Passive optical networks 
With the different passive optical components (couplers, splitters, wavelength 
division multiplexers, etc.) optical fibers have been able to constitute multi-terminal 
networks for a long time. They are mostly passive optical networks (PON) where 
multiplexing or access control can be operated; they are suitable for access networks 
(fiber sharing between several subscribers, see section 10.2) as well as for small 
local area networks. 
Figure 10.1 shows examples of: 
– broadcast networks, where a star coupler simultaneously broadcasts the same 
signal to many receivers; these can be a few dozen to several thousands with the use 
of an optical amplifier between source and coupler. Subscribers can possibly have a 
return channel by multiplexing or access control on the common support; 
– point to multipoint networks where several stations share the same link with Y 
or star couplers, as addressing is contained in frames; slave stations communicate 
with the main station, but not between each other. In the graph, the return path uses 
the same optical fiber at another wavelength, but it is not necessarily the most 
economical for short distance; this solution is experiencing renewed interest in 
access networks with the FTTH/PON architecture; 
– random access bus (Ethernet) or other standards with the same physical 
architecture (each station communicates directly with all others) but with different 
access protocols. Passive star topology developed around a star coupler with n 
branches is the most efficient as each station includes a transmitter and a receiver. 
Multiple star topologies can be used to increase its capacity.

10.1.3. Design of a passive network 
The loss budget is calculated as in section 9.2.6 taking into account insertion 
attenuations from couplers and/or multiplexers, and additional connections required 
by the passive network architecture. These terms are often larger than the fiber 
section attenuation, because distances are generally short. Due to this, it is often 
economically interesting to use the first transmission window, with LEDs and 
multimode fibers; as long as bitrates are low (10 to 50 Mbit/s) and as chromatic 
dispersion does not limit us. 
The calculation must be performed on the worst case because attenuations are 
not necessarily the same for all transmitter-receiver pairs. The loss budget is 
advantageous for star structures, because the insertion loss of the coupler is in log n, 
where n is the number of terminals, and differences between received levels at the 
different terminals are lower. 
Such a multimode fiber network can be optimized by determining the maximum 
transmitter-receiver distance (equal to twice L, maximum station-star distance) 
authorized by the dispersion limit (by noting if a penalty is accepted or not), by 
deducing the maximum fiber attenuation and by rewriting the loss budget as follows 
(Table 10.1).

The unknown then becomes n, the maximum number of coupler branches, thus 
of terminals. If the theoretically possible value is higher than possible with the 
technology (star couplers are available up to 32 channels) then several must be 
cascaded, causing additional excess losses. 
10.1.4. Ethernet local area networks 
10.1.4.1. Introduction to Ethernet 
Ethernet is by far the most widely used (and less costly) local area network. It 
uses random access mode with collision detection or CSMA/CD (Channel Sense 
Multiple Access/Collision Detection). Each station can transmit as soon as it has 
determined that the channel is idle after listening. There is collision probability 
when two stations start a transmission at the same time. This method is efficient for 
high bursty bitrates gone from 10 to 100 Mbit/s then at 1 and 10 Gbit/s. However, 
although efficiency is good for intermittent traffic, in the case of high traffic, 
collision risks increase very rapidly. 
Historically, these networks are adapted to back office or computer applications 
with no real time requirements. Gigabit Ethernet, for high throughput 
interconnection of nodes with a routed protocol, is currently being deployed in 
backbones, and 10 Gbit/s, standardized in 2004 is growing in metropolitan area 
networks (MAN). A new IEEE workgroup is dedicated to 100 Gbit/s! 
The Ethernet protocol (IEEE 802.3) accepts different physical supports. The 
oldest version (still used in industrial companies) operates over coax cable (thick or 
thin), a support on which stations are connected by shunting in “T”.  
For economical reasons, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is the most widely used, 
at 10 Mbit/s (10 base T) and at shorter distance, at 100 Mbit/s (100 base T). 

Fiber-Optic Networks     237 
10.1.4.2. Fiber optic Ethernet 
Optical fibers are increasingly being used to increase distances and can be used 
to interconnect stations using passive optical stars, when electric or electromagnetic 
security warrants it. For example, with multimode 62.5/125 fibers, 2,000 m are 
reached at 10 Mbit/s and 400 m at 100 Mbit/s, Gigabit Ethernet can reach 5 km over 
single-mode fibers with laser diodes (LD). 
A major issue now is the reuse of multimode fibers which are not very expensive 
in connectivity, for Gigabit Ethernet: it is possible to reach several hundred meters 
and exceed a kilometer in certain conditions with fast and inexpensive VCSEL 
diodes at 0.85 µm. The attenuation is not a limit in local area networks, chromatic 
dispersion is insignificant because of the very low spectral width of the source, 
intermodal dispersion is the limiting factor. Modal filtering devices may improve 
bandwidth.  
New 50/125 multimode fibers reaching 2 GHz.km and called OM3 have 
appeared on the market. They are much more expensive than single-mode fibers but 
provide global economy because of the low cost of connectors and interfaces. It is 
even possible to transmit 10 Gbit/s up to 300 m over a single wavelength and 1 km 
by distributing data over four wavelengths. 
Table 10.2 indicates the main Ethernet versions; ranges are typical values and we 
can often find better. 
10.1.4.3. Ethernet architectures 
Risk of collision increases with frame propagation time, thus with distance, and 
with the number of users. Ethernet network architecture has evolved toward multi-
level star topologies with the use of hubs or switches.  
The economic optimum is often to link stations to 10/100 Mbit/s hubs with 
twisted pairs and to interconnect 100 Mbit/s hubs with twisted pairs (for short 
distance) or 1 Gbit/s hubs with optical fibers with the help of an active star. Thus the 
Ethernet network is extended, since the active star is in charge of detecting collision 
and possibly for routing data between the different network sections (Figure 10.2). 
This architecture must not be confused with the backbone, interconnecting local area 
networks with bridges or routers.

10.1.5. FDDI network 
In order to increase bitrates and ranges, and to fulfill security requirements, a 
network was developed specifically over optical fibers in the 1990s: this is the FDDI 
(Fiber Distributed Data Interface) network, a ring network (with token access 
control, successor to the Token Ring), working at 100 Mbit/s with  4B5B code. This 
network mainly uses multimode 62.5/125 fibers (with LED at 1.3 µm) for distances 
under 2 km and connects up to 500 workstations. Twisted pairs can even be used for 
very short distance links. Single-mode fibers (with laser diodes at 1.3 µm) may 
cover long distances, but this version is not used much. 
The ring is doubled and each “class A” station has double access ensuring 
securement (Figure 10.3): the traffic goes through the back-up ring in case of 
incident in one section of the main ring, which is then isolated. Smaller “class B” 
stations are connected through hubs and can be isolated from the network. 
Standardized by ANSI, this network is well adapted for servers and workstations 
which must communicate in real time at high throughput with high security 
(industrial control, nuclear or medical facility monitoring, navigation systems). It 
can also be used as a local network backbone through bridges and routers. It is not 
competitive with Ethernet in the standard local area network market, but has 
retained a specific market with its security advantages. However, new industrial 
Ethernet versions which do take security requirements into consideration are 
competing with FDDI in this field.

Figure 10.3. FDDI network topology 
10.1.6. Fiber Channel 
Also standardized by ANSI, the goal of this standard is to offer high bitrate 
interconnections over optical fibers which are compatible with all local area network 
protocols: Ethernet, SCSI (serial) or HIPPI (parallel) interfaces or wide area 
networks: TCP/IP, ATM, etc. It provides them with a lower layers service. This 
protocol is organized in layers: 
– the FC0 layer corresponds to transmission/reception in the support (optical 
fiber, as well as twisted or coaxial pair for short distance) and to bit regeneration; 
each Fiber Channel (FC) station contains a transmitter/receiver with SC optical 
connector; 
– the FC1 layer constitutes 2,168 byte frames coded 8B10B, of which 2,048 are 
error control and flow control words. Stuffing bytes allow us to tolerate some 
plesiochronism.

Table 10.3; 
– the FC2 layer enabling different architectures: point-to-point, ring or switched

The main FC market is short distance storage area networks (SAN), requiring 
increasingly high throughputs, operating at up to 4 Gbit/s (the following 8 or 10 
Gbit/s version, depending on coding used is announced). It is increasingly used in 
network securement over distances reaching 10 to 30 km.

10.2. Access networks 
10.2.1. Overview 
When fiber optics first appeared, one of the main objectives was the deployment 
of access networks offering users phone, several television channels, sound channels 
and interactive services, even videophone, over fiber optics. What used to be called 
video communications networks, because of the importance of images in traffic, 
were being experimented in the 1980s (first French experiment in Biarritz in 1984) 
and deployed in a few operational networks. These first generation networks (1G) 
were based on a star structure enabled by the very small optical fiber size; each 
subscriber is connected with his (her) own fiber to the distribution center, but a 
second user can subsequently share this fiber with the help of wavelength division 
multiplexing. 
The development of this type of “optical distribution” network remained 
marginal for economic reasons however (although fiber optics have quickly been 
used throughout the transport part of CATV distribution networks). Effort was 
concentrated on the development of “low cost” optoelectronic technologies 
competitive for mass-market distribution, but was blocked by the unexpected 
success of ADSL, providing bitrates exceeding 10 Mbit/s over already installed 
phone lines. 
Only a few years ago, when ADSL had reached its limits, did high bitrate (10 to 
100 Mbit/s per subscriber) optical access deployment restart mainly in Asia (Japan, 
Korea, China) and on a more modest scale in Europe (Sweden, Italy); the USA 

Fiber-Optic Networks     243 
prefers to use “hybrid fiber-coax” to take advantage of the massive availability of 
coax cable in television distribution.  
France-Télécom and its competitors as well as several local communities (30,000 
in Pau) have relaunched projects focusing on development of services (which were 
insufficient in 1G networks) and not only infrastructures. 
For 2008, 20 million FTTH subscribers throughout the world are expected, 
among which 16 million are in Asia alone, and the market in Europe is also expected 
to take off. 
10.2.2. Different FTTx architectures 
Because of economic as well as historic (type of access network already 
installed) considerations, the choice is open among several architectures (Figure 
10.5): 
– FTTH (fiber to the home) where the fiber goes all the way to the subscriber’s 
home, with optical signal continuity, but involving possible cost and maintenance 
problems;  
– FTTx (fiber to the…) where, to avoid these problems, the optical fiber stops at 
a point accessible to the operator, where an ONU (optical network unit) is 
implemented, less than 1 or 2 km away from the subscriber. It must be relayed for 
branching by a coax cable, a VDSL type link over a phone line, by a very short 
distance and high frequency (WiFi type) radio link, or even by an electric power 
line. Even though this terminology is not very standardized and there are 
redundancies, we speak of: 
- FTTB (building) the fiber stops at the foot of the building, 
- FTTC (curb) the fiber stops at the “curb” (for several homes), 
- FTTN (node) the fiber stops at the dispatcher (extended by a VDSL 
connection for example), 
- FTTP (premises) the fiber stops at the operator’s technical location. 

244     Fiber-Optic Communications 
 
Figure 10.5. Different fiber-optic access architectures 
With a rather similar principle, hybrid fiber-coax networks (HFC) use already 
installed coax networks in which the signal is provided by an optical fiber, 
interfaced with an ONU (optical network unit). They are mainly developed in 
countries with wide cable television network (CATV) installations such as the USA 
(Figure 10.6). One of their characteristics is to transmit RF signals from the cable 
with their modulation over a specific wavelength over the optical fiber in order to 
ensure interoperability.

10.2.3. Passive optical networks (PON) 
Whereas 1G networks were point-to-point (PtoP) with one multimode fiber by 
subscriber in a star architecture around the distribution center (DC), and despite 
several announcements of PtoP FTTH network deployments (Paris, Amsterdam, 
etc.), the architecture favored by operators is passive optical network (PON). With 
the help of passive couplers or splitters forming a tree topology, possibly with 
several levels (Figure 10.7), 32 subscribers (up to 64 in the 2nd phase) share the same 
standard single-mode fiber as well as a global bitrate of several Gbit/s. It provides 
several advantages: 
– large reduction of the number of fibers from the network core, thus of the 
number of connections and cable size, enabling new cabling technologies (micro-
cladding, micro-ribbons, etc.) and installation (blowing fiber into ducts), increasing 
density and decreasing installation costs; 
– sharing of active equipment on the network side (OLT: Optical Line 
Termination) between a large number of subscribers; 
– dynamic bitrate allocation in each direction between users of the same fiber 
with the help of ATM or Ethernet type protocols; statistically, 1 or 2.5 Gbit/s global 
bitrate can be shared between 32 subscribers at 100 Mbit/s, and the use of resources 
is optimized even though traffic can be very different between two users, peak 
throughputs much higher than the average throughput are even possible. The 
downlink frame contains information for the uplink bitrate allocation; 
– reliability and upgradeability of passive components (bitrates can be increased 
simply by modifying terminals); 
– possible cohabitation of several operators on the same passive infrastructure; a 
subject of some importance for regulation authorities (ARCEP in France). 
Compared to point-to-point, PON also has constraints: 
– subscriber terminals (called ONU if they are extended by a secondary link, or 
ONT (Optical Network Terminal), if they are located at the client site) operate at 
instant shared bitrate (1 to 2.5 Gbit/s) instead of at average subscriber bitrate; 
relatively inexpensive technologies must nevertheless be used, such as Fabry-Pérot 
laser diodes at 1.3 µm in uplink; 
– TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) access control in uplink is tricky to 
manage because of differences in levels and propagation delays (in downlink, ATM 
or Ethernet-type addressing is used without these problems); subscriber side 
transmitters must be synchronized with the help of the downlink frame; 
– maintaining such a network is more complicated than with point-to-point. 
Notably, classical reflectometry does not directly apply (branch responses 

246     Fiber-Optic Communications 
superimpose and do not allow us to locate failures from the OLT) and must be 
adapted. This can be performed in a specific channel at 1,625 nm (monitoring). 
Reflections on connectors must also be very low (return loss lower than -50 dB), 
otherwise all subscribers in a single fiber are disturbed.

10.2.4. PON operation 
Throughputs and protocols come from existing (local or long distance) networks, 
and three types of protocols are used in passive optical networks: 
– BPON (Broadband PON) transporting ATM cells at 622 or 1,244 Mbit/s with 
time slot reservation in uplink (at 155 Mbit/s); derived from APON (ATM over 
PON), this solution is mostly deployed in the USA and its use is decreasing; 
– EPON (Ethernet PON) standardized by IEEE (EFM (Ethernet in the First Mile) 
workgroup) uses dynamically shared frames, access protocols and 1 Gbit/s Ethernet 
interfaces; it is the most inexpensive solution, mostly deployed in Asia; 

Fiber-Optic Networks     247 
– GPON (Gigabit-capable PON) uses the SONET/SDH physical layer (section 
10.3), currently with typical bitrates of 2.5 Gbit/s downlink and 1.25 Gbit/s uplink; 
this solution, standardized by ITU (G 984), seems to be prevalent in new 
deployments. The FSAN (full service access network) concept is also standardized 
by the ITU (G 983) and is compatible with all protocols (ATM, Ethernet, IP, etc.) 
with variable flows, and with all services: voice (traditional or over IP), data, 
images, video on demand (VoD) in downloading or streaming mode with guaranteed 
bandwidth, peer to peer interactive services, etc.  
In most present deployments, as seen in Figure 10.7, wavelength division 
multiplexing is carried out between a downlink 1,490 nm channel, transmitting a 2.5 
Gbit/s (STM-16) bitrate shared between subscribers by frame addressing (with 
specific encryption for each subscriber), and an uplink 1,310 nm channel, shared by 
time division multiple access (TDMA), allocation of time slots is controlled 
dynamically by the central station to avoid collisions. A 2nd descending channel at 
1,550 nm can be used for video broadcasting over a RF sub-carrier (solution mostly 
used in the USA, as in HFC). For the subscriber, signals are distributed through 
Ethernet RJ 45 jacks or by WiFi to the different equipment, as is currently done with 
ADSL boxes; the ONT shares the received packets according to their overhead to 
only deliver those packets addressed to the subscriber. 
The typical range is 20 km over standard single-mode fibers (G 652) and global 
attenuation, including couplers, is 20 to 30 dB. Current research projects are trying 
to bring these bitrates to 10 Gbit/s over the same fiber infrastructure in order to 
increase throughput per subscriber and/or the number of subscribers per coupler 
(which could reach 64, or even 128).  
Later, wavelength division multiplexing generalization between services and/or 
users (DWDM/PON) will allow us to increase bitrates even more without modifying 
the infrastructure. 
10.3. Wide area networks 
10.3.1. SDH/SONET hierarchy systems 
High throughput SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) was internationally 
standardized in the 1990s. It unifies the international telecommunications network 
while being compatible with pre-existing systems: older digital European, American 
and Japanese plesiochronous transmission hierarchies, as well as high bitrate data 
networks such as Ethernet, FDDI, etc. It has in fact been developed to become the 
transmission infrastructure of ATM networks, but can also transport IP frames. 

248     Fiber-Optic Communications 
The first SDH level is STM-1 at 155.52 Mbit/s (STM = Synchronous Transport 
Module). Levels of the hierarchy, called STM-n, are obtained by synchronous 
multiplexing byte by byte of n frames, with frame alignment (i.e. the n affluent 
frames start at the same time, which is not the case in plesiochronous multiplexing). 
The high bitrates obtained involve the choice of optical fiber as support; the STM-1 
level however can also be transported by microwave link or satellite, or twisted pair 
over a very short distance (internally in operation centers). 
Synchronous fiber optics transmission networks have been massively deployed 
these last years with link bitrates of: 
– STM-1 at 155 Mbit/s (local access); 
– STM-4 at 622 Mbit/s (regional networks); 
– STM-16 at 2.5 Gbit/s (national links); 
– STM-64 at 10 Gbit/s (international links); 
and step STM-256 (40 Gbit/s) was recently industrialized but is technically difficult, 
with components (electronic and optoelectronic) as well as fibers (limitations caused 
by chromatic and polarization mode dispersion, not well known and highly 
dependent on the fiber PMD in the cable). 
Very long links with amplifiers use additional online forward error control (FEC) 
which brings a symbol rate of STM-64 to 10.664 Gbauds. Note at this step the 
convergence with 10 Gbit/s Ethernet which makes optoelectronic interfaces 
compatible with both systems available on the market, but the protocols are not the 
same and neither are the frames, nor exactly the same bitrates because in  
SDH 10 Gbit/s is a rounded value. 
In North America, transmission systems are defined by the SONET 
(Synchronous Optical NETwork) standard, normalized by ANSI before SDH 
standardization by the ITU, explaining the number divergence: the first SONET 
level, at 52 Mbit/s (only used in America), does not correspond to the first SDH 
level (Table 10.4); OC-3n then corresponds to STM-n.

Table 10.4. Major SDH/SONET systems 
In order to increase bitrates even more, wavelength division multiplexing 
(WDM) allows bitrates of n x 2.5 Gbit/s (which is the most adapted to chromatic and 
polarization mode dispersion performance of previously installed G 652 optical 
fibers) and n x 10 Gbit/s for more recent G 655 type fibers. Bitrates of 
approximately 640 Gbit/s can operate on the major links, and the theoretical limit is 
far from being reached. 
10.3.2. Constitution of synchronous digital hierarchy frames 
In STM-1, the basic frame of 125 µs length (the voice sampling period in digital 
telephony), contains a total of 2,430 bytes organized in a table with 9 rows and 270 
columns (Figure 10.8). The first 9 header columns constitute a section overhead 
(SOH) containing synchronization, auxiliary data channels, parity check bytes for 

250     Fiber-Optic Communications 
error detection, as well as transmission quality supervisory and network security 
management information. Apart from a few overhead functions, SONET OC-3 
frames are identical to STM-1 frames.

Figure 10.8. SDH frame 
This overhead is structured into two levels: multiplexing section (between 2 
multiplexers) and regeneration section (between 2 regenerators). These devices can 
also communicate with the control network by adding or dropping information at 
reserved locations in the frame (even though in paradox optical amplifier repeaters 
cannot use this possibility, since they do not process the digital signal). Data is 
transmitted in NRZ format after scrambling (scrambled NRZ), the first 6 bytes are 
the only ones not scrambled because they are frame synchronizing bytes. 
The other bytes constitute the payload, in the form of a “virtual container” (VC) 
with actual bitrate of 149.76 kbit/s, or 260 columns of 9 bytes in addition to the 1st 
column of each VC, called POH (Path OverHead), which contains information on 
the container and which is transmitted end to end with its contents, contrary to SOH. 
The beginning position of a virtual container, located by its POH, can vary in the 
STM-1 frame in case the clocks are not perfectly synchronized, which is called 
plesiochronism. 
The virtual container is a very flexible concept, it can be made up of primary 
frames (24 or 30 phone channels at 64 kbit/s), frames from older plesiochronous 
hierarchies (European and American), 44 ATM cells, local area network frames 
(Ethernet, FDDI) or IP frames, contained in different levels of virtual containers. A 
specific POH byte indicates the type of contents. 

Fiber-Optic Networks     251 
This data can be synchronous or asynchronous since the actual position in the 
container is indicated by a pointer in the 4th overhead row. This position can vary 
because of a justification mechanism which increments the pointer (positive 
justification if throughput is too low: the VC is delayed by one byte) or decrements 
it (negative justification if throughput is too high: the VC is advanced of one byte). 
This allows us to know the exact position of each channel at anytime and thus to 
directly add or drop any channel in the SDH frame, including a basic 64 kbit/s 
channel instead of demultiplexing all levels one by one as in plesiochronous 
multiplexing. 
10.3.3. SDH rings 
The SDH is not only a point-to-point transmission protocol, it involves 
multipoint ring architectures and enables securement (Figure 10.9). 
The simplest scheme is a two fiber ring; the main fiber transmits unidirectional 
traffic whereas the second one acts as back up fiber. When used (in case of interface 
failure or fiber cut-off), the securement protocol transmits the signal in the reverse 
direction. In the second scheme, a fiber pair ensures normal bidirectional traffic; 
there is here a back up fiber in each direction, transmitting in case of securement by 
the same arc and in the same direction. This concept extends to 2(n + 1) fibers 
(securement 1: n) where one back up pair secures n traffic pairs. If A – D (major 
path) is completely cut off, A – D traffic restoration can be performed by BC (minor 
path). 
In the ring, the traffic can use several possible paths: for example A – B, A – C 
by B, D – B by A, which will then be multiplexed (electrically or by wavelength) in 
the same arc (AB here). Each node uses an add-drop multiplexer which enables it to 
connect one or several users (individual terminal, PABX, LAN access point, etc.) 
and becomes the key component of these rings, which explains the increased 
importance of OADM (Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers, see Chapter 5) and the 
advantage of making them reconfigurable.

Rings can be interconnected by electric or optical cross-connects. Currently, the 
SDH ring architecture is mainly used in MANs (metropolitan area networks) where 
reconfiguration can be performed in less than 50 ms; it is less adapted to wide area 
networks because of propagation delay which varies significantly during 
reconfigurations. 
10.3.4. Optical cross-connect 
Cross-connecting consists of modifying the distribution of the different affluent 
multiplexed units within higher level units between cross-connect (OXC: Optical 
Cross-Connect) input and output. In SDH, cross-connect is carried out at all levels: 
between lower or higher level VC, between STM-1 or STM-n frames, with 
electronic switching matrices. It can also be carried out in the optical layer between 
wavelengths or between fibers (Figure 10.10). In the first case, the different input 
wavelengths are demultiplexed, separately switched and remultiplexed differently at 
output; in the second case, all wavelengths of an input fiber are switched together to 
a single output fiber. 

Fiber-Optic Networks     253 
 
Figure 10.10. Different types of optical cross-connects 
In both cases, (de)multiplexing and switching are completely optical, there is an 
electronic control signal but no signal at the data bitrate, which can reach 10 or even 
40 Gbit/s without limiting speed. There is transparency: electric signals, overheads 
in particular are not modified. Cross-connecting is currently used for network 
reconfiguration in case of incident or congestion (switching all channels from one 
fiber to another) and not for real time channel switching. Mechanical or micro 
electro-mechanical structure (MEMS) switching technologies are therefore the most 
adapted (see Chapter 5). 
10.3.5. Optical transport network (OTN) 
The evolution of SONET/SDH networks, which in their design remain marked 
by telephone circuit transport, is taking the form of the optical transport network 
(OTN) whose standardization by the ITU started in 2002 (G 709). It allows us to 
directly and transparently transport Ethernet, IP, Fiber Channel, SDH/SONET or 
ATM frames, for a convergence that avoids stacking of protocol layers. 
In charge of transport, multiplexing, routing, network security and control, the 
OTN protocol is organized in electric layers and optical layer (section 10.3.6).  

254     Fiber-Optic Communications 
The electric frame is organized into a 4 row and 4,080 column matrix (Figure 
10.11), is called OTU (Optical Transport Unit) and includes the client payload and: 
– framing; 
– a three part overhead:  
- the OPU (Optical Payload Unit) overhead containing information on the type 
of client, and is in charge of adaptation, 
- the ODU (Optical Data Unit) overhead containing end to end channel 
supervisory information, 
- the OTU overhead containing supervisory information for a section (between 
a transmitter and an optical receiver); 
– forward error control (FEC) based on a Reed-Solomon code (255, 239)1, 
allowing the same error ratio with 5.8 dB less power, for a bitrate increase of 7%; an 
interleaving technique allows us to correct bursts. The major SDH functions are 
present, with more usage flexibility. 
The OTN hierarchy includes 3 levels, obtained either directly or by multiplexing 
of the lower level frame by frame and not byte by byte as in SDH; frames then 
remain complete and their duration is reduced whereas it remains constant (at  
125 µs) in SDH. These levels are: 
– OTU1 at 2.7 Gbit/s (which can transport an STM-16); 
– OTU2 at 10.7 Gbit/s (which can transport an STM-64, Ethernet 10G, etc.); 
– OTU3 at 43 Gbit/s (which can transport an STM-256), while being introduced. 
Bitrate  increase compared to SDH comes from overhead and error control bytes. 
There is no coincidence between a SDH frame and the payload.

bytes.

10.3.6. The optical OTN layer 
The optical layer constitutes the main OTN enhancement. It ensures dense 
wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) of several OTU frames in the same 
fiber. The number of wavelengths and the bitrate per wavelength can be adapted in a 
flexible way. High grooming can thus be reached, which means that the bitrate can 
vary over a very large range with a fine pitch (2.5 Gbit/s). 
An optical supervisory channel (OSC), at a specific wavelength of 1,510 nm, 
transports tracking and control information for data channels, to multiplexers, 
routers, etc., constituting a distinct signaling network, such as the signaling network 
in telephony.  
This information is transmitted as packets and structured on three levels: 
– optical channel (OCh) tracking an end to end optical signal at a given 
wavelength, information corresponding to the different wavelengths is temporally 
multiplexed; 
– optical multiplex section (OMS) which controls multiplexers and cross-
connects; this information is common to all multiplexed channels in the same fiber; 
– optical transport section (OTS) controlling a regeneration section.

256     Fiber-Optic Communications 
This channel communicates with the network management and control plane 
which controls active network components without having to convert data channels. 
The supervisory channel is the only one that needs to be converted into electric 
signals and processed in network nodes as its bitrate is much lower (currently 100 or 
155 Mbit/s). Data channels can be multiplexed and switched optically; it is not 
necessary to detect and process signals at 10 or 40 Gbit/s, which is a significant 
difference with SDH. This is one of the impediments to bitrate increase, the relative 
slowness of electronic processing in nodes, which disappears. 
The OSC in particular can transmit GMPLS signaling (section 10.4.4) and 
control all-optical switches. The optical transport network is not completely 
established yet, but it is a significant step toward next generation networks (NGN). 
10.4. Toward all optical networks 
10.4.1. Wavelength division multiplexed networks 
It is easy to multiplex signals coming from geographically distant sources in the 
same fiber because the multiplexer is passive and requires no synchronization, 
contrary to time-division multiplexing. Add-drop multiplexers (ADM, see Chapter 
5) are used to connect intermediate terminals (Figure 10.13). This method is largely 
used in wide area networks, submarine notably (SEA-ME-WE link example, see 
Figure 9.11), but is also developed in metropolitan area networks or in company 
backbones. A different wavelength is affected at each path, in a fixed way.

10.4.2. Wavelength routing 
In order for the network to be more flexible, wavelength routing can be 
performed: each terminal can emit at several wavelengths (generally using tunable 

Fiber-Optic Networks     257 
laser diodes) corresponding to as many receivers: it selects its wavelength according 
to the receiver. These wavelengths can be separated in a passive demultiplexer, or by 
a filter in each receiver. In this case, routing is performed at the source because it is 
tunable. 
It is also possible to route at receiver level using a filter or a tunable ADM which 
matches with the source wavelength, but this method is not as advanced. The 
wavelength allocation can be reconfigured dynamically, but it is always the same 
one used end to end in a given path. 
To optimize the use of wavelengths and be able to massively reuse them, as with 
frequencies in a radio network, it is helpful to change wavelengths at each node. 
This can be done with the help of an optical-electric-optical interface receiving the 
signal in a wavelength and retransmits it in another, possibly tunable wavelength. 
However, to remain optical from end to end, wavelength conversion done by 
devices derived from semi-conductor optical amplifiers (see section 8.4.2) 
transposing a signal from one wavelength to another at each node, must be achieved 
(Figure 10.14).  
These nodes will become real optical routers but still need electronics to process 
signaling information and establish connections. However, this information, which 
is transported by the optical supervision channel, has a much lower throughput than 
data.

10.4.3. All optical network architectures 
The combination of optical cross-connecting and wavelength division 
multiplexing is very interesting in metropolitan area networks or in large company 
backbones. The architecture of these systems is evolving toward rings making 
securement and reconfiguration easier (Figure 10.15); it is inspired by the SDH 
architecture, but these rings are interconnected by optical cross-connects (OXC) to 
establish back up routes by other paths.

Figure 10.15. All optical network, ring architecture 
Introduced by OTN, the optical layer concept plays an important part under 
SDH, ATM or IP layers. It includes the main optical components which are optical 
add-drop multiplexers (OADM) and optical cross-connects (OXC). The former are 
used at the network access (most often through a local area network) whereas the 
latter interconnect rings or switch to back up routes. 
In this architecture, the signal remains optical from end to end. This is the 
concept of a transparent network contrary to an opaque network where signal is 
converted into electronic at each node. Whereas in the current state of technology, 
the signal keeps its wavelength, wavelength conversion will make the network 
intelligent by dynamically affecting wavelengths taking into account the traffic and 
by optimizing the use of resources (section 10.4.2). A specific protocol must then 
control the optical layer. 
10.4.4. MPLS protocols 
MPLS (multi protocol label switching) is a label routing protocol standardized 
by IETF (the organization which standardizes the Internet), initially introduced at 
the end of the 1990s to optimize IP frame transport in different types of switched 
networks. It is packet-transport oriented and has OAM (Operating, Administration 
and Maintenance) tools. 
Containing a label and switched in the form of ATM cells, data is separated from 
signaling which is routed in IP. Data follows a path called LSP (Label Switched 
Path) established beforehand, labels (or “references”) are processed and modified in 
the routers through routing tables updated by signaling. This method comes from the 

260     Fiber-Optic Communications 
ATM virtual path concept. MPLS signaling establishes, controls and deletes these 
paths, according to traffic, and ensures circuit securement. 
There are label edge routers (LER) and label switching routers (LSR). The 
reference is inserted in the overhead of only 32 bits, which is added to frame and 
packet headers. There are several reference distribution protocols. Flow aggregation 
toward the same destination simplifies routing. Virtual private networks (VPN) can 
be established. 
Generalization of this protocol led to GMPLS (generalized MPLS) where the 
role of reference can also be played by the number of a time slot in a synchronous 
time-division frame (TDMC: Time Division Multiplexing Capable), the wavelength 
number in a fiber (LSC: Lambda Switching Capable), or the number of a fiber in the 
cable (FSC: Fiber Switching Capable). A hierarchy of the supports can be carried 
out (Figure 10.16), which the protocol must respect when establishing connections 
between routers. 
Flows transmitted over the fiber wavelengths, which can be of high bitrate 
SONET/SDH format, can be switched by their optical label without electric 
processing. Signaling information for implementing virtual circuits is transmitted by 
a control plane separate from the user plane transferring data. The control plane, 
which is in real time, controls connections and dynamic reconfigurations (via optical 
cross-connects or wavelengths switches) and uses an IP protocol over Ethernet. It 
must not be confused with the management plane which has much longer time 
constants and plans for the network evolution.

In the optical transport network OTN, signaling is transported by the optical 
supervision channel, at a specific wavelength (section 10.3.6) and not in SDH frame 
overheads, data can then remain all-optical and at very high bitrates. GMPLS can

quickly be reconfigured, and also offer quality of service (QoS). In the future, it 
must allow the installation of the automatically switched transport network (ASTN). 
10.4.5. Trends 
In parallel, access control techniques such as optical CDMA (Code Division 
Multiple Access, widely used in radio) are the subject of research projects focusing 
on access networks, they require the development of an optical spread-spectrum 
technique, with the help of photo-inscribed fiber Bragg gratings for example. 
Completely optical packet switching is even more futuristic because it would 
require optical memory, which only exists in experimental form and is very 
expensive. 

Chapter 11 
Fiber-Optic Sensors and Instrumentation 
11.1. Fiber optics in instrumentation 
11.1.1. Introduction 
Parallel to the development of fiber optics in telecommunications in the last 20 
years, several studies focused on their use in instrumentation and sensors. Their specific 
advantages come from: 
– low disruption caused by lightweight, small and insulating fiber optics; 
– their intrinsic security (absence of electric current) and their insensitivity to 
electromagnetic parasites; 
– the possibility they offer for remote analysis with high spatial resolution of 
environments that are difficult or dangerous to access; 
– and finally, the possibility of using the optical fiber itself as a sensitive element 
for a certain number of physical dimensions. It is possible to build distributed 
sensors or sensor networks in which the optical fiber can be used as a sensitive 
element and transmission support simultaneously. 
However, fiber-optic sensors having reached their technological maturity are 
rare. This is especially the case with those where the optical fiber improves an 
existing measurement system without modifying its principle. Large perspectives 
exist for when the optical fiber can instrument a complete system, a structure or 
material by integration. It then is no longer a sensor in the sense of an isolated 
component, but an element of a real intelligent system. 

264     Fiber-Optic Communications 
In addition, the development of silicon integrated optics helps in the design of 
microsystems integrating an optical sensor, optoelectronic interfaces and processing 
circuits (the reading head of magneto-optical disks developed at LETI for example). 
11.1.2. Use of fiber optics in instrumentation 
The use of fiber optics in measurement can have 3 forms: 
– fiber-optic transmission of a measurement, generally electric and analog; this 
application is described in Chapter 9; 
– optical instrumentation using fibers for light propagation; 
– actual optical fiber sensors. 
At the chapter instrumentation, we can add the use of fiber optics to transmit 
light beams of various powers: 
– low power: display (direct observation of the light at fiber output); this can be 
the transmission of the colored emission of an LED by a plastic optical fiber; 
– intermediate power: lighting (white light transmission, clear of infrared light, 
by a bundle of glass fiber, or at short distance, plastic fiber); this is one of the oldest 
optical fiber applications; 
– high power: particularly the YAG laser beam transfer, emitting at  
1.06 µm (wavelength well transmitted by silica, even in the form of very strong 
pulses). These are new applications developed in mechanical industries and surgery 
notably. 
11.1.3. Fiber-optic measurement instrumentation 
In this case, measurement is completely optical; it is performed remotely with 
the help of one (or more) optical fiber(s) playing a passive role, but offers significant 
implementation advantages: accessibility, high spatial resolution, cartography 
possibility by moving the test point, security, etc.  
Some of these concepts are relatively old, but they have benefited from 
technological advances and decreased cost of optoelectronics. 
Today, several operational applications exist in fields such as: 
– physical chemistry: pH measurement, colorimetry, refractometry, infrared and 
Raman spectroscopy; 

Fiber-Optic Sensors and Instrumentation     265 
– temperature measure by pyrometry (black body radiation analysis): because of 
this radiation’s spectrum, which is mainly in infrared (Figure 11.1), it can be 
transmitted by silica optical fibers if the temperature is higher than 300ºC, and by 
fluoride fibers when temperature becomes ambient; 
– near field microscopy; 
– robotics and computer-integrated manufacturing (Figure 11.2): proximity 
detection, optical barriers, pattern recognition, laser telemetry; 
– endoscopy (transmission of an image by a fiber optics bundle), used in 
medicine as well as in manufacturing, civil engineering, archeology, etc., which is 
one of the most well known fiber optics applications. Since each fiber (with a 
diameter of a few micrometers) transports a pixel, placement must be exactly the 
same at both extremities (coherent bundle) explaining its high cost. Camera 
miniaturization makes its market decrease.

11.1.4. Fiber-optic sensor classification 
In the strict sense, sensors use the light propagation modification in an optical 
fiber by the phenomenon to measure.  
They can be classified according to several criteria: 
– extrinsic sensors (effects at fiber extremities or connections) versus intrinsic 
sensors (modification of internal guide properties or of its material); 
– non-coherent sensors (only based on light power; they are simple but not always 
very precise or reliable) versus coherent sensors (based on light phase or 
polarization, they are much more sensitive, but a lot more difficult to use); 
– punctual sensors versus distributed sensors; in the second case, the fiber is 
sensitive throughout; it is then useful to distinguish whether the installation enables 
localization of the phenomenon to be measured or not. 
11.2. Non-coherent fiber-optic sensors 
11.2.1. Geometric and mechanical size sensors 
Very simple in principle, these sensors have multiple applications in industrial or 
security systems, insofar as high precision is not required. They are used in analog 
measurements as well as go-no go applications (detection, counting, etc.).  
Following are a few examples: 
– micro-movement sensors (longitudinal or angular) using techniques such as 
spatial filtering at the connection of both fibers, or by extremity reflection (Figure 
11.3); they can also be used as force or vibration sensors;

– external medium refraction index measure with the help of the Fresnel 
reflection coefficient at fiber extremity (or, more rarely, bending losses); the most 
common applications are level detection (Figure 11.4) or bubble counting, but it can 
be used to find out a temperature or chemical composition;

∆ν = c

By beat with the wave reflecting on the fiber extremity, a frequency ∆ν is 
measured after detection, which has a range from kHz to MHz for movement 
velocities from mm/s to m/s.

11.2.2. Bending or micro-bending sensors 
Sensors using losses in strong bending of an optical fiber were experienced. 
Since these losses quickly vary with bending radius as well as with numerical 
aperture, it is possible to achieve geometric measures as well as an index of the 
medium surrounding the core (cladding with an index which depends on a 
dimension to measure, or fiber without cladding sensitive to external medium 
index). 
There are also different types of micro-bending constraint sensors (Figure 11.6); 
their main advantage is the ability to be integrated in structures (mechanical, 
aeronautical, bridges, etc.) and to locate constraints by reflectometry. Micro-bending 
loss measure can be sensitive, particularly with graded-index fibers, when the spatial 
distortion period corresponds to the mode coupling period.  
However, bending or micro-bending measures are not very accurate, and they 
require fibers of strong mechanical resistance.

11.2.3. Temperature extrinsic sensors 
These sensors detect an optical property of material placed at the end of the 
optical fiber (in the form of a thin layer deposit for example). The general scheme is 
illustrated in Figure 11.7. The optical property depending on temperature can be: 
– photoluminescence: the material retransmits a light with a spectrum that 
depends on temperature when it is lit; 
– fluorescence: decrease in time of the re-emitted light depends on temperature; 
– absorption of a semiconductor close to its cut off wavelength which greatly 
varies with temperature; 
– reflectivity of a material whose index depends on temperature, etc. 

Fiber-Optic Sensors and Instrumentation     269 
There are also on-off sensors indicating threshold temperature overshoot, using the 
liquid crystal state for example.  
Some applications corresponding to different sensitivity and precision ranges were 
commercialized. The major advantages with these sensors is their small size and 
electric insulation, and it is very convenient to place them in a reflection-based 
network (see section 11.4).

11.2.4. Intrinsic non-coherent sensors 
These are sensors using light intensity variations appearing in the optical fiber matter. 
In this way, intrinsic temperature sensors, contrary to the previous ones, use the 
variation of the fiber material property with temperature. It can be the core-cladding 
index difference, measured with the help of the numerical aperture variation (more 
simple than with interferometry). Other sensors use the Raman scattering of the fiber 
matter, or scattering or fluorescence variations in doped fiber. These measures make 
it possible to obtain a temperature profile along the fiber by backscattering, but these 
methods are very complicated, and only installed in certain sensitive sites (high 
power electric lines, gas pipelines, etc.) for locating abnormally hot or cold spots. 
Intrinsic chemical sensors were also realized. Their general principle (Figure 
11.8) is the use of optical cladding for absorbing the matter to be detected (methane 
for example). Through the evanescent field, the light is then attenuated where this 
matter is absorbed; they can then be located with an OTDR. In the same principle, 
interferometric sensors were developed which use index variation with absorption of 
the matter to be detected. 

270     Fiber-Optic Communications 
 
Figure 11.8. Chemical fiber-optic sensor 
Finally, fiber-optic radiation sensors use a specific type of optical fiber, generally 
made of plastic (doped polystyrene) presenting a fluorescence property (light radiation 
caused by external illumination at a shorter wavelength). The fiber guides (over a 
short distance) the light it has emitted. A spectral, spatial and temporal radiation 
analysis can then be achieved. Fluorescent (sensitive to visible or ultraviolet light) 
and scintillating (sensitive to nuclear radiations) fibers are on the market; they have 
applications in visualization and display. 
11.3. Interferometric sensors 
11.3.1. Overview 
These sensors are based on coherent techniques: analysis of the phase or 
polarization of light in a single-mode optical fiber, or at a more experimental step, 
interferometry between modes in a multimode fiber. They are extremely sensitive 
and do not affect optical fiber reliability. They are less easy to implement and often 
require signal processing to obtain absolute (and not relative) measures and separate 
the effects of different physical influential parameters (notably temperature). We will 
give some examples. 
11.3.2. Two arm interferometers 
11.3.2.1. Mach-Zehnder interferometer 
In this interferometer (Figure 11.9), both arms are made up of two single-mode 
fibers (or two guides in integrated optics) with identical lengths L. Phase shift 
between the measurement and reference arm is caused by a stretching ∆L or by an 
index variation ∆n, which is most often due to variation in temperature ∆T or in 
differential pressure ∆P (by photo-elasticity). Chemical sensors of this type were 
also developed, mainly in integrated optics, by using effective index variation in the 
measure arm, due to the contact of a chemical matter. 

Fiber-Optic Sensors and Instrumentation     271 
In the set-up using fibers and two couplers, the receiver receives an intensity 
modulated by cos2 ∆φ; the phase is measured within π and we must delete the 
ambiguity (by a two wavelength measurement for example). The second set-up 
which can be carried out in integrated optics, creates interference fringes between 
beam output coming from both guides that move and can be counted. 
 
Figure 11.9. Fiber or optical guide Mach-Zehnder interferometer 
Phase shift equals: 
∆φ = k0 n.∆L + k0 L [ dT
dn ∆T + dP
dn ∆P + dX
dn ∆X] 
These different parameters (X is another parameter liable to influence the index, 
chemical for example) can therefore simultaneously be measured, but they are 
difficult to separate. This is possible by using several wavelengths whose relative 
sensitivities from n to P, T, X, etc. are not the same at each wavelength. 
The main application is the acoustic sensor, with large bandwidth, used in 
hydrophones. This is a dynamic and differential measure. For absolute and static 
measures, the main problem remains sensitivity to the difference in temperature 
between both arms; it is attenuated but not cancelled by the realization in integrated 
optics. 
11.3.2.2. Michelson interferometer  
Based on a single-mode fiber coupler X (Figure 11.10), it provides the same 
measures, but is mainly interesting for relative micrometric movement measures, 
using interferometry in non-coherent light (from an LED).  
This type of sensor can also be developed in silicon integrated optics.

11.3.3. Intermodal interferometry 
We have experimented with sensors based on intermodal interferometry in 
multimode fibers through coherent light. The phase shift between guided modes is 
very sensitive to index variations, even very low ones, caused by mechanical 
perturbations (photo-elasticity).  
These phase fluctuations are converted into amplitude fluctuations in case of 
spatial filtering, intentional or not (it can be a bad connector). The modal noise 
phenomenon discourages the use of laser diodes with multimode fibers. 
The main advantage with this type of sensor is that it only has one fiber and is 
thus easily integrated, and that optical installation is very simple, since spatial 
filtering can be carried out by connecting two different fibers (Figure 11.11). It 
easily detects vibrations of the structure in which the fiber is integrated, but the 
signal obtained is complex.

11.3.4. One fiber interferometers 
Other constraint measurement methods through stretching of a single optical fiber 
were developed. Their main advantage is easy integration of the sensor in material 
(for aeronautic, civil engineering and other structures). 
11.3.4.1. Fabry-Pérot interferometer 
This is made up of two parallel mirrors spaced from Λ integrated in an optical 
fiber or between two optical fibers (Figure 11.12). By interferometer resonance, power

11.3.4.2. Bragg grating sensor 
This more recent technology uses a Bragg grating photo-inscribed in the fiber 
core matter (Figure 11.13). It is a periodic and longitudinal variation of the 
refraction index (Chapter 4), with step Λ, causing reflection of the wavelength λ 
following the phase matching relation: 
λ = 2 Λ n (n is the average fiber index) 
In both cases, by increasing Λ, fiber stretching will induce a variation of the 
transmitted or reflected wavelength which can be remotely measured with perfect 
reliability: the light wavelength, contrary to its intensity or its polarization, cannot be 
modified by its propagation in the optical fiber. In addition, these sensors are usable 
in reflection and are well adapted for serial implementation and reflectometry 
interrogation. 

274     Fiber-Optic Communications 
However, these techniques are expensive and complicated to implement and the 
problem of sensitivity to temperature (which influences the index) remains.

This is one of the oldest optical fiber sensors, at the source of intense scientific 
and industrial activity. The principle is identical to the laser or acoustic wave 
gyroscope principle and consists of measuring by interferometry the phase shift 
between both propagation directions in the same ring-based optical fiber (Figure 
11.14). The influence of temperature then auto-compensates. If the set-up turns

around the conductor, but it does not depend on the fiber path, temperature or 
mechanical constraints.  
This sensor is therefore precise, accurate and securely measures very high 
currents at very high voltages. However, it is expensive and must be installed 
permanently on a high voltage power line for example; this type of sensor has 
remained experimental and integrated sensors made from glass with a high Verdet 
constant are being developed.

11.3.6. Polarimetric sensors 
These are interferometric sensors as well (requiring a coherent source), but both 
orthogonal polarizations guided by the fiber play the role of the two interferometer 
arms. This allows a better integration of the sensor and lower sensitivity to 
temperature. 

276     Fiber-Optic Communications 
The major application is the constraint sensor by birefringence (Figure 11.16): it 
uses created (or modified) birefringence in a single-mode fiber by a non-isotropic 
constraint. The polarization state analysis gives the constraint direction and value. 
For a remote sensor, the main problem is to correctly transmit the state of 
polarization from the sensitive point to the analysis point; high birefringence fibers 
are then used (see Chapter 2) in which the constraint will couple light in the 
polarization orthogonal to initial polarization. Light can also be injected into both 
polarizations; the constraint then creates a phase shift between them. The resulting 
polarization state, preserved by the following birefringent fiber, is determined by the 
constraint applied and allows us to analyze it (in direction and intensity). 
This measure is quite complex, but it has the advantage of only using one fiber; 
the effect of temperature is theoretically neutralized and it enables the creation of a 
distributed constraint sensor. Location of the constraint is possible by rather 
complicated coherence multiplexing techniques (see section 11.4.4). Birefringent 
fibers are tricky to use, however. 
Finally, there are optical sensors where the fiber remotely measures the 
transmission of a crystal placed between two polarizers, and experiencing constraints 
making it birefringent; it is then a extrinsic sensor.

11.4.1. Distributed sensors 
The location of a phenomenon in a continuously sensitive fiber is classically 
performed by reflectometry (OTDR), which is possible if this phenomenon occurs 
by an attenuation or reflection in the optical fiber. This corresponds to using non-
coherent sensor techniques. 
Specific methods were developed for sensors such as POTDR (OTDR with 
polarization analysis) or OFDR (Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry) which is 
a frequency-domain reflectometry. The set-up is similar to temporal reflectometry, 

Fiber-Optic Sensors and Instrumentation     277 
for locating attenuating or reflecting events in the fiber, but the laser is wavelength 
modulated (in the form of a ramp or chirp) instead of transmitting pulses (Figure 
11.17). 
Distance z of the point measured is proportional to beat frequency fb between the 
signal received and the signal transmitted (returned by the mirror): 
fb = 
T
f
v
2z
g
∆
 
where ∆f is the optical frequency deviation (several GHz) and T is the ramp period. 
By spectrally analyzing the signal received, it is possible to separate responses from 
the different sensitive points; very high spatial resolutions can be reached. This 
method however requires laser diodes which can be wavelength modulated with 
high spectral purity as well as polarization control; this remains experimental to this 
day. 
 
Figure 11.17. Optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) measurement 
In addition to these completely distributed sensors (in which the optical fiber can 
be continuously sensitive), it is possible to design multipoint sensor networks, used 
with a common optoelectronic transmitter and receiver thanks to multiplexing. 
11.4.2. Time-division multiplexing 
The different sensors respond by more or less attenuating (or reflecting) a pulse 
sent by a single source. Responses are shifted over time by optical paths with 
different lengths (Figure 11.18). A time-domain (or possibly frequency-domain) 
reflectometry demultiplexes sensors.

11.4.3. Wavelength division multiplexing 
In this technique, also called chromatic multiplexing, each sensor continuously 
works at its own wavelength obtained from a unique LED spectrum (Figure 11.19). 
This has the advantage of working with an LED in continuous wave mode (or low 
frequency modulated for synchronous detection), and showing correct sensitivity; but 
wavelength division multiplexers are expensive. 
11.4.4. Coherence multiplexing 
This specific method applies to polarimetric sensors distributed along a high 
birefringent fiber. Since the propagation constants of these two polarizations are 
different, the delay between them at receiver is proportional to the coupling point 
distance, thus to the sensor. This delay can be measured by a Michelson 
interferometer placed at the end of the fiber, as each polarization is injected in each 
arm (Figure 11.20).  
The interferometer operates in non-coherent light (from an LED or a 
superluminescent diode): a beat can only be observed between both polarizations 
when the measurement arm delay exactly compensates for the slow polarization 
delay. It is thus possible to spatially separate with high resolution several 
measurement points distributed along the fiber (the separating power corresponding 
to source coherence, which is short). However, this is a very complicated technique.

the following characteristics: 
– small signal gain = 30 dB; 
– noise figure = 3 dB; 
– saturation power = 20 dBm. 
Input and output losses are negligible. 
Calculate the total noise at reception, if a 1 nm wide optical filter is placed, for 
the same power received as before. What should be concluded? 
Redo the loss budget and calculate the new number of receivers. 
Exercise 3.11. Multimode fiber multiplexed link 
A digital signal at 50 Mbit/s (coded 4B5B) downlink and 10 Mbit/s (Manchester 
coded) uplink must be transmitted over 4 km between a terminal and the network. In 
order to do this, the following are used: 
– 62.5/125 optical fibers; 
– 1.3 µm LED coupling 50 µW peak power in the optical fiber; 
– 0.85 µm LED coupling 40 µW peak power in the optical fiber; 
– connectors with each 0.5 dB loss; 
– Si photodiode receivers with noise equivalent power 4 pW/ Hz ; 
– GaInAs photodiode receivers with noise equivalent power 3 pW/ Hz ; 
– wavelength division multiplexers separating both windows, with a loss of 0.5 
dB at transmitted wavelength. 
With the help of loss budgets, compare the solution using a single fiber and the 
solution using one fiber per direction. In each case, specify the components used 
(and why). Verify that the link is not limited by dispersion (by explaining what is  
the dominating dispersion) knowing that LEDs have a spectral width of  
50 nm and that the fiber chromatic dispersion is approximately 100 ps/km/nm at  
0.85 µm. 
Which solution seems the best at first glance? Why? 

Exercises     295 
 
Exercise 3.12. Very high bitrate single-mode fiber link 
A long distance link is established at 10 Gbit/s, in NRZ code, over a dispersion 
shifted optical fiber. At the source, a DFB laser diode with a peak power of 2 mW, 
and spectral width of 0.1 nm is used, followed by an electro-optic modulator 
attenuating by 1 dB at on and by 25 dB at off. The fiber chromatic dispersion 
coefficient is 3 ps/nm/km and it has a polarization mode dispersion of 0.5 ps/ km . 
At the link end, a receiver with a NEP of 10 pW/ Hz  is used. 
1) Calculate possible maximum distance between transmitter and receiver 
without intermediate optical amplifiers. An error probability of 10-11 with a margin 
of 3 dB is required. Fiber attenuation is 0.2 dB/km and at every 20 km there is a  
0.1 dB loss splice. 
2) What distance can be reached with optical amplifiers? What will it be limited 
by? What global gain must these amplifiers have? If each amplifier has a maximum 
gain of 32 dB, what will the minimum number of amplifiers be? Will the actual 
number be higher than this theoretical minimum or not, and why? 
3) Is it possible to eliminate the chromatic dispersion effect? With what device? 
Calculate the maximum possible distance after chromatic dispersion compensation, 
by supposing that widening caused by polarization mode dispersion must not exceed 
20% of a bit time. 
Exercise 3.13. Time-division multiplexing sensor network 
We use optical fiber sensors operating in all or nothing reflection, with the help 
of a temporal multiplexing network (according to Figure 11.18). 
Pulses transmitted have a power of 10 W and a 5 ns duration, and are repeated 
with a frequency of 10 kHz. We require the minimum L value, unit length of the line 
with optical delay. 
Final problem: design of fiber-optic links 
Objective 
Technical solutions for the different fiber-optic link requirements listed below 
must be proposed. For each one of them, propose the choice of the most appropriate 
components in the tables and justify these choices; indicating, when appropriate, 
what other solutions could have been retained. Establish the loss budget  

296     Fiber-Optic Communications 
and verify that bandwidth is sufficient in each case (by specifying if dispersion 
compensation or equalization is necessary). Prices are given as examples to compare 
different possible solutions, they have no commercial value. 
These links are: 
1) a 100 Mbit/s (code 4B5B) Ethernet link over 100 m, inside a building 
(maximum 100 m), with a margin of 3 dB and error probability of 10-9; 
2) a computer network made up of 1 Gbit/s (8B10B code) links, of 500 m 
maximum length, with a margin of 3 dB and error probability of 10-10; 
3) an FTTH subscriber network at 100 Mbit/s (4B5B code) downlink (network 
Æ subscriber) and at 50 Mbit/s (4B5B code) uplink (subscriber Æ network), 
distances between 5 and 10 km according to subscriber locations, with a margin of  
3 dB and error probability of 10-9; 
4) a link at STM-16 SDH hierarchy level , over 20 km, with a margin of 3 dB 
and error probability of 10-11, enabling evolution to STM-64 with very few 
modifications; 
5) a long distance link over 800 km, for a global bitrate of 40 Gbit/s, with a 
margin of 3 dB and error probability of 10-11; 
6) a broadcasting network of 100 digital video channels time-division 
multiplexed (1.5 Mbit/s per channel) to about a hundred receivers located less than 
500 m with an error probability of 10-9 and a margin of 3 dB; 
7) a ring network linking 10 access points with a bitrate of 622 Mbit/s each, a 
few km between them, using only one fiber per direction, with a margin of  
3 dB and error probability of 10-9.

Exercise 1.1. Propagation in a graded-index optical fiber 
Light ray path follows the r(z) law, with: 
n(r).cos θ = cte = n1 cos θa and r(0) = 0 as initial condition 
By writing tg θa = dr/dz, and using cos2 θ = 1/(1+tg2 θ) and n(r) law, we obtain 
the differential equation:  
cos2 θa [1 + (dr/dz)2] + 2 ∆ (r/a)2 = 1  
and its solution is written: 
r(z) =

which depends very little on θa, because cos θa is still very close to 1.

Exercise Answers     303 
 
converging toward γ = 0.8 for L < 4 km (equilibrium distance). 
Exercise 1.4. Link bandwidth 
Over 1 km, pulse broadening caused by intermodal dispersion equals:  
∆τim = 1.6 ns/km (deduced from the bandwidth of 300 MHz.km) 
and pulse broadening caused by chromatic dispersion equals:  
∆τc = 5 ns/km for 850 nm LED, thus globally ∆τ = 5.25 ns/km 
Over 2 km, we then have 10.5 ns thus a bandwidth of slightly less than 50 MHz, 
limited by chromatic dispersion.  
 
On the other hand, at 1,300 nm, the chromatic dispersion effect is negligible and 
the bandwidth is thus 150 MHz (approximate but not exact value, because of mode 
coupling). 
Exercise 1.5. Injection of light in a single-mode fiber

Figure E.3. Gaussian beam coupling 
In order to perfectly couple this beam to a single-mode fiber, the angle of 
convergence must obey:  
θ = λ/πw0f with tg θ = w0l/f 
f being the lens focal distance. θ is small therefore θ ≈ tg θ. 

304     Fiber-Optic Communications 
We then obtain: 
 f = πw0f.w0l/ λ = 6 mm  
and, of course, the alignments must be perfect. 
Exercise 1.6. Single-mode fiber parameters 
The cut-off wavelength (formula in section 2.2.3) equals 1.27 µm. This fiber 
must then be used at a higher wavelength. 
At 1.3 µm, we have: 
V = 2.35 (deduced from V/2.4 = λc/λ)  
hence a guide dispersion equaling -3.6 ps/nm/km and total dispersion that is almost 
zero (material dispersion has approximately the same absolute value). 
At 1.55 µm, we have: 
V = 1.98  
from which we deduce a guide dispersion of -4.3 ps/nm/km and a total dispersion  
of slightly less than 16 ps/nm/km (material dispersion approximately equals  
20 ps/nm/km). 
Exercise 1.7. Single-mode fiber design 
1) Since the cut-off wavelength is 1.2 µm, the core fiber radius equals 4.2 µm. 
2) At 1.55 µm, we have V = 1.85 (quickly deduced from V/2.4 = λc/λ) hence: 
V.

from which a guide dispersion of 4.9 ps/nm/km and a total dispersion of  
15.1 ps/nm/km are deduced. In order to avoid unit errors, in DG expression, use: λ in 
nm and c = 3.10-7 km/ps. 
3) Connection losses depend on w0 which equals 1.26a = 5.7 µm. 

Exercise Answers     305 
 
We find:  
– by off-centering: 0.13 dB; 
– by misalignment: 0.01 dB; 
– by tolerance over w0: 0.04 dB; 
in total 0.18 dB at each splice, thus 0.009 dB/km (if the fiber is long) adding to: 
– Rayleigh scattering = 0.176 dB/km; 
– infrared absorption = 0.02 dB/km; 
– micro-bending losses = 0.05 dB/km; 
in total 0.255 dB/km. 
4) To cancel chromatic dispersion, DG would have to equal 20 ps/nm/km, thus:  
V.

or:

We deduce that a = 3.2 µm and w0 = 1.48 a = 4.7 µm. 
Splicing losses increase because w0 decreases, and Rayleigh scattering increases 
because ∆ increases. On the other hand, micro-bending losses decrease. Globally, 
this fiber has better performance than the previous one, but the depressed inner 
cladding fiber is the only one that is optimal. 

306     Fiber-Optic Communications 
Exercise 1.8. Depressed inner cladding single-mode fiber 
1) The cut-off wavelength is calculated with ∆n (absolute) = 6.10-3, by using n1 = 
1.47 we find 1.2 µm. It is therefore possible to use this fiber for both λ1 = 1.3 µm 
and λ2 = 1.54 µm wavelengths. 
2) At these two wavelengths we calculate the normalized V frequency, the mode 
diameter from w0/a, and Rayleigh scattering by: 
αd = (0.75 + 66 ∆n+) λ-4  = 1.01 λ-4  
for guide dispersion we use ∆n and not ∆n+. Dispersions are in ps/nm/km.

The zero chromatic dispersion wavelength is deduced (approximately) from 
linear interpolation between both wavelengths, resulting in 1.35 µm. 
Exercise 1.9. Single-mode fiber dispersion 
Pulse broadening caused by chromatic dispersion equals 300 ps over 1,000 km. 
The one caused by polarization dispersion (in √L) equals 16 ps, insignificant 
compared to the other (because of the quadratic law). The global pulse broadening is 
of approximately 300 ps, and the bitrate will necessarily be lower than 3.3 Gbit/s 
(2.5 Gbit/s should work). 
The compensator must have a slope equal to DC.L thus 3,000 ps/nm (it is 
calculated to compensate for dispersion of 1,000 km of fiber regardless of the source 
width). If chromatic dispersion is compensated, polarization dispersion leaves a 
broadening of 16 ps and the bitrate will be slightly lower than 60 Gbit/s (10 Gbit/s 
but probably not 40 Gbit/s, because of its random character, a margin larger for 
polarization dispersion than for chromatic dispersion is needed). 
Exercise 1.10. Graded-index plastic fibers 
The available 30 dB attenuation corresponds to a maximum 200 m distance. 
Assuming that we need a 1 GHz bandwidth over this distance, 200 MHz.km will 
therefore be needed (which is beyond reach for step-index fibers). Chromatic

width must used to achieve this throughput.

Exercise 1.12. Reflectometry 
 Reflectometer pulses width: δτ = 5 ns for 50 cm resolution. 
The dynamic will have to be higher than the attenuation of 5 km of 50/125 fiber, 
thus 5 dB at 1.3 µm (see Table 3.1), increased with the signal-to-noise ratio (10 dB 
in this case) at the farthest point of the fiber, thus a dynamic of at least 15 dB. 
Exercise 1.13. Design of a reflectometer 
Reflectometer pulses width: δτ = 10 ns for 1 m resolution. 
Receiver bandwidth then equals 100 MHz, hence: 
 Prmin = 50 nW (-43 dBm) 

308     Fiber-Optic Communications 
We set the signal-to-noise ratio = 1 at limit, so: 
Prmin = Pr 
The dynamic equals:  
D = Pe – Pr - A + S  
with: 
Pe = + 37 dBm 
A = 8 dB 
and: 
S (dB) = 10 log (αD vg/2.δτ.κ)  
calculated with: 
vg/2.δτ = 1 m 
αD = 2.2.10-4.λ-4 m-1 = 4.2 10-4 m-1 
κ = 1/4 (ON/n1)2 = 8.3 10-3 (graded-index fiber) 
where: 
S = -54.5 dB 
and: 
D = 17.5 dB both ways 
dividing by 2α, we obtain range, equaling 3.24 km.  
Reflection peak: S = -14 dB, it then exceeds the backscattered signal by  
40.5 dB. 
To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (and therefore the dynamic) by 10 dB, 100 
measures have to be averaged.

Exercise 2.1. Light coupling in a planar dielectric wave guide  
The beam refracted (by the prism) or diffracted (by the grating) must be injected 
in the guide with an angle θ such that the propagation constant β is equal to: 
k0 n1 cosθ (see Figure 4.7) 
Under this condition, there is total coupling. 
In the case of the prism:  
nP sin θi = n1 cosθ   
then: 
 β = k0 nP sin θi  
In the case of the diffraction grating: there must be a 2πm phase shift between 
waves diffracted by two close patterns.  
For the path in the guide:  
Φ = Λ.k0 n1 cosθ  
for the path in the air (optically shorter):  
Φ = Λ.k0 sinθi  
from which we deduce: 
β = k0.sin θi + m Λ

Exercise 2.2. Chromatic dispersion compensator 
A “chirped” Bragg grating will reflect a wavelength band and not a single 
wavelength. However, short wavelengths, reflected at the grating far end, will be 
more delayed than long wavelengths, reflected at the near end. However, in the case 
of positive chromatic dispersion in the fiber, long wavelengths arrived later. 
Therefore, there is a possibility of compensation. The device slope must be of  

310     Fiber-Optic Communications 
600 ps/nm (propagation time difference between two wavelengths spaced from 1 
nm) to compensate total chromatic dispersion of the link (equal to Dc.L). 
Then dΛ/dz = ∆Λ/L (constant, as the law is linear) = 1/(c.D) = 5.5 nm/m. 
The gap ∆λ between two wavelengths is deduced from  ∆λ/λ = ∆ν/ν with 
ν = c/λ: it equals 0.8 nm for λ = 1.55 µm and ∆ν = 100 GHz.  
There will be 3 intervals, the compensator must therefore operate over a 2.4 nm 
range. By using: 
∆Λ = 
a
n

∆
 = 0.8 nm  
we deduce that the photo-inscribed zone must be 14.5 cm long (which shows that it 
is difficult to realize these devices for a large wavelength range).

– excess loss = 1 dB; 
– 2 connection losses = 0.4 dB; 
resulting in 9.8 dB of total loss. 
Exercise 2.4. Y coupler 
From 1 to 2 the transmission coefficient is 0.25 thus an insertion attenuation -
10log (0.25) = 6 dB, giving a total of 7 dB with excess loss. From 2 to 1, because of 
reciprocity; the attenuation is the same. 
From 1 to 3 (and from 3 to 1) the insertion attenuation is of -10log (0.75) =  
1.2 dB giving a total of 2.2 dB with excess loss.

Exercise 2.5. Number of longitudinal modes of a laser diode 
Spacing between longitudinal modes equals:  
δλ = λ2/2nL = 0.48 nm 
The spectral width is given by ∆λ/λ = ∆Eg /Eg with Eg = hc/λ where ∆λ =  
13.6 nm (using hc = 1.24 eV) or approximately 30 modes in the spectrum. 
Exercise 2.6. Calculation of a DFB laser diode 
The diffraction grating step equals Λ = λ/2n = 221 nm. 
Laser line widening is deduced from ∆λ/λ = ∆ν/ν: it equals 0.08 nm (for ∆ν = 10 
GHz). 
Pulse broadening equals ∆λ.Dc.L = 120 ps over 100 km. 
Exercise 2.7. Laser diode noise at emission 
If we note as Pem the average emitted optical power, the optical signal is intensity 
modulated by a sub-carrier at 50 MHz with an amplitude equaling m.Pem (m 
modulation index), therefore electric signal power after photodetection will be 
proportional to (m.Pem)2/2. 
The average electric power of noise at receiver input is proportional to: 
(1 + m2/2) Pem
2.RIN.∆F  
with RIN = relative laser intensity noise and ∆F = 24 MHz (twice the baseband). As 
proportionality factors are the same, we deduce carrier-to-noise ratio (identical at 
transmission and reception):

power which then is in PS(r)

optical filtering, the threshold for this last phenomenon is lower. This means that the 
filter was well chosen and that it is not necessary to make it narrower. 
3) The previous study shows that in the best case, we win 18 dB, thus a power of 
-44 dBm at optical amplifier input. However, its gain must be at least 21dB, in order 
to compensate for noise at receiver caused by its own noise. The link extension that 
it authorizes is therefore 90 km. 
Part 3: fiber-optic systems and networks 
Exercise 3.1. Link between micro-computers over plastic optical fibers 
Optical fiber attenuation is 20 dB over 100 m, adding a margin of 3 dB, 
transmission power must therefore be –39 + 23 = –16 dBm or 25 µW. 
Since it is proportional to the current, we deduce that a current of 10 mA in the 
LED allows this power. A twisted pair could be used for this distance, but the 
optical fiber brings insulation and electromagnetic immunity.

The loss budget is written as: 
Average emitted power, coupled in the fiber (10 log Pme)  
- 13 dBm 
- attenuation of connections  
- 1 dB 
- margin 
- 3 dB 
- average received power (10 log Pmr)  
- (-47.2 dBm) 
= available attenuation 
= 30.2 dB 
hence a 12 km range considering the lineic attenuation of the optical fiber. A 
bandwidth equal to Fr = 4 MHz (because of Manchester code) over 12 km is 
sufficient therefore 48 MHz.km, widely available with commercial multimode fibers 
(typically 62.5/125 GI) even when taking into account chromatic dispersion (see the 
answer to exercise 1.4). 
Exercise 3.3. Multimode fiber link 
We can write the loss budget as: 
 
Average emitted power, coupled in the fiber (10 log 25 µW) 
- 16 dBm 
- attenuation of connections  
- 1 dB 
- margin 
- 3 dB 
- average received power (10 log Pmr)  
- (-37.3 dBm) 
= available attenuation 
= 17.3 dB 
The average input power is calculated with Q = 6 and ∆F = 0,7.Fr = 108 MHz: 
we find Pmr = 187 nW. 
A distance of 19.2 km could be reach with a 0.9 dB/km fiber1 but it will 
obviously be limited by intermodal dispersion, since the fiber is specified at  
300 MHz.km, not much more than 15 MHz will be available at this distance! 
With the criterion BW (fiber) > Fr or 155 MHz, approximately  
2 km can be reached.  
With the criterion BW (fiber) >0.7 Fr or 108 MHz, close to 3 km can be reached, 
as long as a penalty is accepted, as at this distance we will obtain an additional

14 dB in the loss budget (the attenuation for the 16 km that cannot be reached) there 
is therefore no problem. 
Exercise 3.4. Single-mode fiber link at 1.3 µm 
Average received power equals 0.67 µW, which is calculated with Q = 6.4 and 
∆F = 0.7Fr = 435 MHz. The loss budget is written as: 
 
Average emitted power, coupled in the fiber (10 log 0.5 mW) 
- 3 dBm 
- attenuation of connections (splices in this case)  
- 0.4 dB 
- margin 
- 3 dB 
- average received power (10 log Pmr)  
- (-31.8 dBm) 
= available attenuation 
= 25.4 dB 
The range equals 59.8 km taking into account 0.5 dB/km optical fiber 
attenuation. The effect of chromatic dispersion is negligible at this wavelength.

With an average transmitted power of -16 dBm and two connectors with total 
attenuation of 1 dB, we find an available attenuation of 18.6 dB thus a maximum 
length of 7.15 km (with the margin). 
A kilometer bandwidth of at least 43 MHz.km will be needed. The bandwidth of 
the fiber used is much larger even considering chromatic dispersion. 

Exercise Answers     317 
 
Exercise 3.6. Wavelength division multiplexed link 
Around 1.55 µm, a frequency spacing of 100 GHz corresponds to a 0.8 nm 
wavelength spacing (using ∆ν/ν = ∆λ/λ). In the amplifier bandwidth of 30 nm, there 
is room for 38 channels. 
The amplifier saturation power is 23 dBm thus 200 mW, therefore 5.2 mW per 
channel. 
Exercise 3.7. Amplified link 
The loss budget is written as: 
 
Average emitted power, coupled in the fiber (10 log 0.5 mW) 
- 3 dBm 
- attenuation of connections (splices) 
- 0.4 dB 
- margin 
- 3 dB 
- average received power (10 log Pmr)  
- (-29 dBm) 
= available attenuation 
= 22.6 dB 
which is not enough for the 300 km of fiber representing 60 dB. 
For the missing 32.4 dB, one amplifier is sufficient but it must be placed in the 
middle of the link under the sea. Actually, if we place it behind the source, it will 
work at saturation power (+25 dBm peak thus +22 dBm average) and that will not 
be sufficient, an optical preamplifier in the receiver will also be required. However, 
this may be less expensive than a submarine repeater. 
Exercise 3.8. Fiber-optic data bus 
The loss budget is presented in the following form where the unknown is N, 
number of stations. Line symbol rate is 125 Mbauds from which we calculate an 
average received power of 168 nW (with Q = 6).  
The number of connectors and the fiber length on a link between a transmitter 
and receiver must be taken into account.

from which 10 log N = 12.9 thus N = 19 (rounded to lower integer). 
Over 2 km, because of intermodal dispersion (dominating at this wavelength) the 
available bandwidth is approximately 150 MHz, which is sufficient. 
Exercise 3.9. Ring network 
The network topology (circular highway) and its operation (each BTS only 
communicates with the base station controller or BSC) allow us to use a single-fiber 
ring network with wavelength division multiplexing (Figure E.4). Each BTS has its 
own wavelength at which it receives (from the BSC) and retransmits (toward the 
BSC over the other arc), which corresponds perfectly to the operation of optical add-
drop multiplexers (OADM, see section 5.2.5). At BSC level, all wavelengths are 
multiplexed and demultiplexed.

The bitrate x distance product demands a single-mode fiber, but the standard 
single-mode fiber is sufficient. The 1.3 µm wavelength could be appropriate but the 
availability of multiplexers will probably involve the use of the 3rd window. 
Exercise 3.10. Access network 
1) The average received power equals 800 nW or -31dBm, with Q = 6.4. 
The loss budget is written differently because we do not know the number of 
couplers. The available attenuation will be allocated to couplers and their splices.

20.4 dB 
Attenuation of 32 branch star couplers is 10 log(32) + excess loss therefore  
18 dB: we can only use one with the available attenuation. The maximum number of 
receivers which can be covered without optical amplification is 32. 
2) With an optical amplifier behind the source, it will operate at saturation power 
(+17 dBm in average power). With the same received power of -30 dBm, the 
attenuation between this amplifier and the receivers is 47 dB or A = 2.10-5. In these 
conditions its noise at receiver is much lower than background noise: the total noise 
at receiver will not be increased by the presence of an optical amplifier at 
transmitter. 
The average power at transmission has been increased by 20 dB without 
changing the rest of the loss budget; the available attenuation is now 40.4 dB 
enabling the serial placement of two couplers, then one 32 branch coupler in each of 
the first coupler’s 32 branches, for a total of 1,024 receivers with a single amplified 
transmitter (and even 2,048 because it is possible use an additional Y coupler).

Exercise 3.11. Multimode fiber multiplexed link 
First, take a single fiber. It will use 2 window wavelength division multiplexing, 
attributing 1.3 µm to the direction with the highest throughput. We therefore have 2 
loss budgets, where we must take into consideration 2 multiplexers.  
Average received powers are calculated with Q = 6 for the different 
configurations. A Si photodiode must be used at 0.85 µm and a GaInAs at 1.3 µm.

= 16.2 dB 
Since attenuation of 4 km of fiber is 10.8 dB at 0.85 µm and 3.6 dB at 1.3 µm, 
technically this choice is correct. Available bandwidths over 4 km (75 MHz at  
1.3 µm and close to 25 MHz at 0.85 µm because of chromatic dispersion) are 
sufficient even if they do not offer much possibility of increasing throughput. 
If we take a fiber in each direction: we must use the same wavelengths because 
at 0.85 µm (which would be more economical) there is not enough bandwidth in 
downlink.  
Loss budgets are naturally verified (we take out multiplexers and their 
connectors) but despite saving the cost of multiplexers, it is probable that over 4 km, 
the cost of the 2nd fiber and its installation will be higher (this would not be the case 
for short distance, in a company network for example). 
 The first solution is preferable.

Exercise 3.12. Very high bitrate single-mode fiber link 
1) Pmr = 5.6 µW, thus -22.6 dBm (with Q = 6.7). The external modulator 
attenuates by 1 dB at on and totally cuts off at off (it lets 0.3% of the power leak 
through which is negligible) from which we find the following loss budget:. 
 
Average emitted power (10 log 1 mW) 
0 dBm 
- loss of modulator at on 
-1 dB 
- attenuation of connections (2 splices at extremities) 
-0.2 dB 
- margin 
-3 dB 
- average received power (10 log Pmr) 
- (-22.6 dBm) 
= available attenuation 
= 18.4 dB 
allowing 90 km (lineic attenuation of 0.2 dB/km + 0.005 dB/km caused by splices). 
2) With amplifiers, the chromatic dispersion will limit distance. In addition, very 
high bitrate modulation (this is an amplitude modulation at 10 Gbit/s) will widen the 
laser line by 20 GHz, or 0.16 nm. Supposing a quadratic combination with natural 
laser line width of 0.1 nm, we obtain ∆λ = 0.2 nm hence ∆λ.Dc. = 0.6 ps/km. In 
order for the pulse broadening to remain lower than 70 ps (limit with equalization 
and penalty) we cannot exceed 117 km. We only have an additional 27 km, or  
5.5 dB for which a single amplifier is sufficient, even with penalty. It will either be 
placed at transmission or at reception according to practical and economic 
constraints. 
3) It is possible to optically compensate for chromatic dispersion with the help of 
a fiber or a Bragg grating optical device (exercise 2.2) with opposite sign dispersion. 
It is then polarization mode dispersion (PMD) that will limit us: the 20 ps are 
reached at the end of 1,600 km. Optical compensation is much more difficult 
because of coupling between polarizations. For the additional 1,510 km or close to 
310 dB, at least 10 amplifiers will be needed but their cumulative noise may not 
remain much lower than the NEP of the optoelectronic receiver. If not, it will be 
necessary to decrease their gain and increase their number. 
Exercise 3.13. Time-division multiplexing sensor network 
The reflectometer used has a pulse width of 5 ns and therefore a resolution of  
50 cm. In order to correctly observe the responses from the consecutive sensors, the 
elementary length L will need to be slightly higher at this value. On the other hand 

322     Fiber-Optic Communications 
the repetition period is of 100 µs enabling the analysis of 10 km of fiber, much more 
than is needed for this application. 
Engineering department: fiber-optic link design 
Procedure to follow 
For each application, select in the proper order: 
– the type of fiber (plastic or silica, multimode or single-mode, etc.) according to 
bitrate and distance (Figure 9.8 can provide a starting guide); 
– the wavelength (choices are few, but for certain fibers 2 wavelengths are 
possible); 
– the transmitter (generally imposed by the fiber/wavelength pair, but at 1.3 µm 
in single-mode fiber we still have a choice); 
– the photodiode: imposed by the wavelength (silicon below 1 µm, GaInAs 
over); 
– the preamplifier: determined by the bitrate (its bandwidth must be at least 0.7 
Fr). If it is not directly given (in the case of an integrated receiver), the NEP is then 
deduced from the preamplifier noise current and photodiode sensitivity. 
Do not forget the network architecture when it is not a simple point-to-point 
connection, but when couplers or multiplexers are used. 
Subsequently, make a loss budget based on real component characteristics to 
verify if it is technically possible or not. Do not forget to calculate global dispersion 
which will need to remain lower than a half-bit time (after line coding) or 0.7 T (T is 
a bit time) only in the cases where a penalty is acceptable. If that is not possible, go 
to a combination with better performance.  
Obviously the less expensive solution should be chosen, however you must also 
consider the network’s future evolution, notably its throughput increase. 
Typical solutions 
1) Except when indicated otherwise (environment constraints), use a plastic fiber 
at 0.67 µm; the choice of the rest follows. The available attenuation, taking the 
margin into account, is higher than actual fiber attenuation over 100 m. 

Exercise Answers     323 
 
2) A choice must be made between the multimode 50/125 fiber with a bandwidth 
that authorizes 1.25 Gbauds over 500 m (with a penalty that causes no problem, 
because VCSEL diodes have to be used to achieve the bitrate, and give a large 
power margin), and the standard single-mode fiber used at 1.3 µm with FP laser 
diodes. The first solution is less expensive but the second one is more evolutive (it 
will allow us to upgrade to 10 Gbit/s). 
3) We have a choice between using 2 fibers and only one with wavelength 
division multiplexing. In both cases, because of the bitrate x distance product (higher 
than in exercise 3.11) a single-mode fiber is needed; the standard fiber will be 
convenient. 
– 1st choice (2 fibers): both directions are at 1.3 µm (attenuation remains low); 
– 2nd choice (one fiber): one direction will be at 1.55 µm for multiplexing. 
Logically, it will be a downlink (the highest bitrate). 
The cost will be the determining factor. Over 5 km, the additional cost of 2 
multiplexers and components at 1.55 µm will not compensate for the economy made 
on the fiber, but it is the opposite over 10 km, and there are other arguments (cable 
size in a subscriber network, number of splices to make, etc.) in favor of the one 
fiber solution. Nevertheless, the cost of this solution encourages fiber sharing 
between several subscribers (this is the principle of PON/FTTH networks). 
4) It is 2.5 Gbit/s. The standard single-mode fiber is suitable once more and can 
be used at 1.3 µm (10 dB of attenuation over 20 km will not be a problem). This 
choice will enable the increase of bitrate to 10 Gbit/s since a very large bandwidth is 
available, only transceivers modules will need to be modified.  
5) The very high bitrate demands shifted dispersion single-mode fiber (except if 
a standard fiber is already installed, then it can be used again with a chromatic 
dispersion compensator). The distance demands the use of 1.55 µm (with DFB laser 
diode) and optical amplifiers. Total attenuation is 160 dB, and since available 
attenuation without amplifiers is approximately 25 dB, 135 dB remain to be 
compensated, requiring at least 5 amplifiers set at (approximately) 27 dB of gain. 
This presumes that their noise remains much lower than that of the receiver, which 
only a simulation software can verify (it is probable however). 
On the other hand, currently, the bitrate can only be reached through wavelength 
division multiplexing. We have a choice between 4 x 10 Gbit/s and 16 x 2.5 Gbit/s. 
In the first case, there are not as many transmitters but globally they are more 
expensive (because they need an external modulator); in addition chromatic 
dispersion compensation (equaling 240 ps over 800 km) is necessary at 10 Gbit/s 

324     Fiber-Optic Communications 
and can be avoided at 2.5 Gbit/s. It is therefore possible that the 2nd solution is less 
expensive, which only a market survey will enable us to find out. 
6) It is broadcasting network architecture, for 100 lines, 10 couplers of 10 
branches each must be used with an 11th one for grouping them. Distance and bitrate 
(150 Mbit/s in total) allow the use of a GI fiber at 1.3 µm (preferably a 62.5/125 one 
for fewer losses) with an LED at the central station, and in each station a GaInAs 
photodiode trans-impedance 100 MHz receiver. 
7) The most recommended architecture, as in exercise 3.9, is to use a single fiber 
ring (standard single-mode) and wavelength division multiplexing in the 3rd window 
with OADMs at each station and a multiplexer/demultiplexer at each extremity 
(only 10 out of the 16 lines will be used). Each station uses a wavelength and 
communicates with end stations (but not directly with the other stations). The return 
fiber is not necessary to the normal operation but brings added security.
