Letters–
Materialist mind
From Andy Clark, 
 University of Edinburgh , and 
Daniel Dennett,   Tufts University 
We are amazed by the claim by 
Mario Beauregard and Jeffrey 
M. Schwartz that Andy Clark’s 
reaction to the claims of non-
materialist neuroscience betrays 
a “fundamental lack of knowledge 
of mind-brain interactions” 
( 29 November, p 23 ).
They claim that neuro-
imaging provides copious 
evidence of minds changing 
brains – for example, when a 
subject’s deliberate shift of 
attention alters their brain state 
in a way detectable by a scanner.
But this would lend support to 
the proposition that minds are 
non-material – in the strong sense 
of being beyond the natural 
order – only if we were to accept 
the assumption that thoughts, 
attending and mental activity are 
not realised in material substance. 
For if they are, then all we are 
seeing is that one set of physical 
changes can lead to another. 
Their argument thus assumes 
that which it sets out to prove.
Nor should we be surprised 
that the mere impingement of 
information can itself have an 
impact on a physical system: 
for that information, too, is 
materially encoded and 
materially transmitted.  For 
instance, there is nothing brutally 
physical about the overdraft in 
your bank account, but the 
representation of that overdraft 
is a material state that has plenty 
of well-known effects, all without 
benefit of immaterial minds.
We do not, of course, claim 
that there are no interesting 
problems facing a science of mind 
and of conscious experience. 
But the ability of physically 
encoded information to bring 
about physical changes in a 
purely material system is not 
one of them.
It is sad that, in their zeal to 
find room for faith in a non-
material God, working scientists 
are willing to bracket so much of 
their own hard-won knowledge 
in return for the comforting 
shroud of mystery.

War over the brain
From Manfred Velden, 
 Department of Psychology, 
University of Mainz 
Of course we should be alarmed 
by the recent attempts to use 
brain science as a vehicle for 
spreading religious ideas 
(  25 October, p 46 ). But it is 
scientists who today denounce 
the abuse of science for religious 
purposes who prepared the 
ground for this new intrusion of 
irrational ideas into science.
For decades they have 
announced that we will soon 
know “how the brain works”, how 
social behaviour, romantic love, a 
sensibility for irony, and so on are, 
they typically say, “hard-wired 
into our brains”. It seems more 
realistic, even for scientists not 
inclined to invoke the 
supernatural when things 
become complicated, to assume 
that even in 1000 years’ time we 
will not know how the brain 
works, as the late Australian 
neurophysiologist John Eccles 
predicted we wouldn’t.
The irritating discrepancy 
between what brain scientists 
and neuroscientists have been 
announcing and what we actually 
know is ideal for those who want 
to introduce religious notions 
into science, allowing them to 
point to problems where scientific 
“materialism” has “failed”.

The e-doctor is out 
From Jackie Duckworth
 I was very interested in your 
article about “e-medicine”, 
but I was surprised to read that 
patients with bipolar disorder 
are “usually prescribed mood-
stabilising drugs and one-on-one 
therapy” ( 8 November, p 24 ).
Not on the UK’s National 
Health Service, they’re not. Even 
the guidelines of the National 
Institute for Clinical Excellence 
say only that psychological 
treatment should be “considered”. 
Mental health trusts in the UK 
seem barely able to afford paper 
clips, never mind psychologists.
Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, UK
From Carol Stevenson
 The potential for “e-doctors” to 
manage mental health problems 
is very interesting, but there is 
a complication. People with 
mental health problems are   far 
more likely than the general 
population  to live in poor 
accommodation or be homeless, 
and therefore far less likely to 
have an email address or regular 
access to a computer and suitable 
conditions for using online 
therapies.
There is little point in 
designing a therapy that is 
inaccessible to many of those 
who need it the most.

proposed: it presents the theories 
as if they are uncontroversial and 
omits any mention of the large 
number of scientists in many 
fields who disagree with these 
notions about warfare. Two 
critically acclaimed recent works 
in this opposing camp,   Man the 
Hunted  by anthropologists Donna 
Hart and Robert Sussman , and 
 Beyond War  by psychologist 
Douglas Fry (reviewed   10 March 
2007, p 49 ), come readily to mind.
The claims made incorporate 
numerous fallacies. One is to 
conflate aggression (both active 
and passive), violence, feuding 
and warfare: these, though often 
related, are not necessarily 
homologous or analogous either 
to one another or to superficially 
similar behaviours in non-human 
primates. Another is to obfuscate 
biological propensity – to assume 
that because a behaviour is 
“natural” it is also adaptive.
The overriding mistake is the 
lack of a nuanced view of the 
complex interplay between 
biology, culture and the 
environment. Assuming that a 
behaviour is biological without 
looking at context is just not 
very helpful. Specific kinds of 
subsistence strategies may make 
warfare or peace more likely, just 
as certain types of subsistence 
can alter female fecundity, for 
example. But just as humans 
figured out how to lower fertility 
to pre-agricultural levels through 
cultural practices, we can also 
learn to live in peace.

The march of tides
From Paul Whiteley
 Jason Palmer’s article on tidal 
barrages was interesting but 
missed a major issue ( 11 October, 
p 35 ). Presumably, given its high 
capital cost, a barrage is expected 
to last for at least a century and 
possibly longer. Its most basic 
design parameter is head of 
water, determined by tide height. 
No one knows with any certainty 
where sea levels are going to be 
on these timescales.

How warfare evolved
From Joshua L. Marshack
 The ideas on the origins of 
war that Bob Holmes reports 
(  15 November, p 8 ) are not part 
of a “new theory”. The idea that 
warfare is primordial, innate 
and adaptive pre-dates the 
philosopher Thomas Hobbes’s 
The Leviathan (1660) and has had 
steadfast supporters ever since.
The claim that, “for the first 
time, anthropologists, 
archaeologists, primatologists, 
psychologists and political 
scientists are approaching a 
consensus” goes beyond 
advancing the validity of the ideas
