What is Computational Neuroscience? 
F
“The goal of computational neuroscience is to explain in 
computational terms how brains generate behaviors” (T. 
Sejnowski) 
F
Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for 
“characterizing what nervous systems do, determining how 
they function, and understanding why they operate in 
particular ways” (P. Dayan and L. Abbott) 
Descriptive Models (What) 
Mechanistic Models (How) 
Interpretive Models (Why)

Responses of a Neuron in an Intact Cat Brain 
(Hubel and Wiesel, c. 1965) 
An Example: Models of “Receptive Fields” 

3 
A “spike” from the 
recorded neuron 

4 
Receptive Field 
F Definition: Specific properties of a sensory 
stimulus that generate a strong response from 
the cell 
F Examples:  
Spot of light that turns on at a particular location 
on the retina 
Bar of light that turns on at a particular orientation 
and location on the retina

Receptive Field Models 
Let’s look at: 
I.
A Descriptive Model of Receptive Fields 
II. A Mechanistic Model of Receptive Fields 
III. An Interpretive Model of Receptive Fields

Descriptive Models: Cortical Receptive Fields 
Other examples of oriented receptive fields 
Oriented 
receptive field 
of a neuron in 
primary visual 
cortex (V1) 
We will learn later how to quantify these using reverse correlation 
Orientation Preference

How are these oriented receptive fields 
obtained from center-surround receptive 
fields?
