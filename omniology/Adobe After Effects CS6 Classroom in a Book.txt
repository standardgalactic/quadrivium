Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 1
Adobe® After Effects® CS6 provides a comprehensive set of 2D and 3D tools  
for compositing, animation, and effects that motion-graphics professionals, 
visual effects artists, web designers, and film and video professionals need.  
After Effects is widely used for digital post-production of film, video, DVD,  
and web content. You can composite layers in various ways, apply and combine 
sophisticated visual and audio effects, and animate both objects and effects.
about Classroom in a Book
Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book® is part of the official training 
series for Adobe graphics and publishing software, developed with the support 
of Adobe product experts. The lessons are designed to let you learn at your 
own pace. If you’re new to Adobe After Effects, you’ll learn the fundamental 
concepts and features you’ll need to master the program. And if you’ve been 
using Adobe After Effects for a while, you’ll find that Classroom in a Book 
teaches many advanced features, including tips and techniques for using the 
latest version.
Although each lesson provides step-by-step instructions for creating a specific 
project, there’s room for exploration and experimentation. You can follow  
the book from start to finish, or do only the lessons that match your interests 
and needs. Each lesson concludes with a review section summarizing what 
you’ve covered.
Prerequisites
Before beginning to use Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book, make sure 
that your system is set up correctly and that you’ve installed the required soft-
ware and hardware. You should have a working knowledge of your computer 
and operating system. You should know how to use the mouse and standard 
menus and commands, and also how to open, save, and close files. If you need 
to review these techniques, see the printed or online documentation included 
with your Microsoft® Windows® or Apple® Mac® OS software.

GettinG started
Installing After Effects
You must purchase the Adobe After Effects CS6 software separately. For system 
requirements and complete instructions on installing the software, visit www.adobe.
com/go/aftereffects_systemreqs. Note that After Effects CS6 requires a 64-bit oper-
ating system, and OpenGL 2.0 support. You must also have Apple QuickTime 7.6.6 
or later installed on your system.
Install After Effects from the Adobe After Effects CS6 application DVD (you cannot 
run the program from the disc), or from the installation files you downloaded from 
Adobe, onto your hard drive. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Make sure that your serial number is accessible before installing the application. 
You can find the serial number on the back of the DVD, or if you downloaded the 
software from Adobe, the serial number will be in your emailed receipt.
Optimizing performance
Creating movies is memory-intensive work. After Effects CS6 requires a minimum 
of 4GB of RAM. The more RAM that is available to After Effects, the faster the 
application will work for you. For information about optimizing memory, cache, and 
other settings for After Effects, see “Improve performance” in After Effects Help.
After Effects CS6 supports color management workflows. We encourage you to take 
advantage of the color management features in After Effects, especially for profes-
sional projects. For an introduction to color management, see the appendix, “Color 
Management in After Effects CS6.”
Restoring default preferences
The preferences file controls the way the After Effects user interface appears on 
your screen. The instructions in this book assume that you see the default interface 
when they describe the appearance of tools, options, windows, panels, and so forth. 
Therefore, it’s a good idea to restore the default preferences, especially if you are 
new to After Effects.
Each time you quit After Effects, the panel positions and certain command settings 
are recorded in the preferences file. To restore the original default settings, press 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) while starting 
After Effects. (After Effects creates a new preferences file if one doesn’t already exist 
the next time you start the program.)

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 3
Restoring the default preferences can be especially helpful if someone has already 
customized After Effects on your computer. If your copy of After Effects hasn’t been 
used yet, this file won’t exist, so this procedure is unnecessary.
Important: If you want to save the current settings, you can rename the preferences 
file instead of deleting it. When you are ready to restore those settings, change the 
name back, and make sure that the file is located in the correct preferences folder.
1 Locate the After Effects preferences folder on your computer:
• For Windows: ..\AppData\Roaming\<username>\Adobe\AfterEffects\11.0
• For Mac OS: ...\Users\<user name>\Library\Preferences\Adobe\
After Effects\11.0 
2 Rename any preferences file you want to preserve, and then restart After Effects.
Copying the lesson files
The lessons in Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book use specific source files, 
such as image files created in Adobe Photoshop® and Adobe Illustrator®, audio files, 
and prepared QuickTime movies. To complete the lessons in this book, you must 
copy these files from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD (inside 
the back cover of this book) to your hard disk.
1 On your hard disk, create a new folder in a convenient location, and name it  
AECS6_CIB, following the standard procedure for your operating system:
• Windows: In Explorer, select the folder or drive in which you want to create 
the new folder, and choose File > New > Folder. Then type the new name.
• Mac OS: In the Finder, choose File > New Folder. Type the new name, and 
drag the folder to the location you want to use.
Now, you can copy the source files onto your hard disk.
2 Copy the Lessons folder (which contains folders named Lesson01, Lesson02,  
and so on) from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD onto your 
hard disk by dragging it to your new AECS6_CIB folder.
3 Remove the DVD from the DVD drive.
When you begin each lesson, you will navigate to the folder with that lesson number, 
where you will find all of the assets, sample movies, and other project files you need 
to complete the lesson.
If you have limited storage space on your computer, you can copy each lesson folder 
individually as you need it, and delete it afterward if desired. Some lessons build on 
preceding lessons; in those cases, a starting project file is provided for you for the 
second lesson or project. You do not have to save any finished project if you don’t 
want to, or if you have limited hard disk space.

about copying the sample movies and projects
You will create and render one or more QuickTime movies in some lessons in this 
book. The files in the Sample_Movie folders are examples that you can use to see the 
end results of each lesson and to compare them with your own results. These files 
tend to be large, so you may not want to devote the storage space or time to copying 
all the sample movies before you begin. Instead, find the appropriate Sample_Movie 
folder on the book’s DVD, and copy the file it contains onto your hard disk as you 
begin work on a lesson. (You cannot play movies from the DVD.) After you finish 
viewing the movie, you can delete it from your hard drive.
The files in the End_Project_File folders are samples of the completed project for 
each lesson. Use these files for reference if you want to compare your work in prog-
ress with the project files used to generate the sample movies. These end-project 
files vary in size from relatively small to a couple of megabytes, so you can either 
copy them all now if you have ample storage space, or copy just the end-project file 
for each lesson as needed, and then delete it when you finish that lesson.
how to use these lessons
Each lesson in this book provides step-by-step instructions for creating one or more 
specific elements of a real-world project. Some lessons build on projects created 
in preceding lessons; some stand alone. All of these lessons build on each other in 
terms of concepts and skills, so the best way to learn from this book is to proceed 
through the lessons in sequential order. In this book, some techniques and processes 
are explained and described in detail only the first few times you perform them. 
Many aspects of the After Effects application can be controlled by multiple tech-
niques, such as a menu command, a button, dragging, and a keyboard shortcut. 
Only one or two of the methods are described in any given procedure, so that you 
can learn different ways of working even when the task is one you’ve done before.
The organization of the lessons is also design-oriented rather than feature-oriented. 
That means, for example, that you’ll work with layers and effects on real-world 
design projects over several lessons, rather than in just one lesson.

Whether you use After Effects to animate a simple 
DVD title sequence or to create complex special 
effects, you generally follow the same basic workflow. 
The After Effects interface facilitates your work and 
adapts to each stage of production. 

10 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
Getting started
A basic After Effects workflow follows six steps: importing and organizing footage, 
creating compositions and arranging layers, adding effects, animating elements, 
previewing your work, and rendering and outputting the final composition so  
that it can be viewed by others. In this lesson, you will create a simple animated 
video using this workflow, and along the way, you’ll learn your way around the 
After Effects interface. 
First, you’ll preview the final movie to see what you’ll create in this lesson.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson01 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: bgwtext.psd, dancers.mov, gc_adobe_dance.mp3, 
kaleidoscope_waveforms.mov, pulsating_radial_waves.mov 
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson01.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson01.mov sample movie to see what you will create in 
this lesson. When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete this 
sample movie from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
Creating a project and importing footage
When you begin each lesson of this book, it’s a good idea to restore the default pref-
erences for After Effects. (See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.) You can do 
this with a simple keyboard shortcut.
1 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file.
2 Click Close to close the Welcome screen. 
After Effects opens to display an empty, untitled project.
An After Effects project is a single file that stores references to all the footage  
you use in that project. It also contains compositions, which are the individual  
containers used to combine footage, apply effects, and, ultimately, drive the output.
E Tip: Restoring default 
preferences can be 
tricky in Windows, 
especially if you’re 
working on a fast 
system. Press the keys 
after you double-click 
the application icon 
but before After Effects 
begins to list the files it’s 
activating. .

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 11
about the after effects  
work area
After Effects offers a flexible, customizable work area. The main window of the program 
is called the application window. Panels are organized in this window in an arrangement 
called a workspace. The default workspace contains groups of panels as well as panels 
that stand alone, as shown below. 
B C
A
E
F
D
G
H
I
A. Application window B. Tools panel C. Project panel D. Composition panel   
E. Timeline panel F. Time graph G. Grouped panels (Info and Audio) H. Preview panel   
I. Effects & Presets panel
You customize a workspace by dragging the panels into the configuration that best suits 
your working style. You can drag panels to new locations, move panels into or out of a 
group, place panels alongside each other, and undock a panel so that it floats in a new 
window above the application window. As you rearrange panels, the other panels resize 
automatically to fit the window. 
When you drag a panel by its tab to relocate it, the area where you can drop it—called a 
drop zone—becomes highlighted. The drop zone determines where and how the panel is 
inserted into the workspace. Dragging a panel to a drop zone either docks it or groups it.
If you drop a panel along the edge of another panel, group, or window, it will dock next 
to the existing group, resizing all groups to accommodate the new panel.
If you drop a panel in the middle of another panel or group, or along the tab area of 
a panel, it will be added to the existing group and be placed at the top of the stack. 
Grouping a panel does not resize other groups. 
You can also open a panel in a floating window. To do so, select the panel and then choose 
Undock Panel or Undock Frame from the panel menu. Or, drag the panel or group outside 
the application window.

12 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
When you begin a project, often the first thing you’ll do is add footage to it.
3 Choose File > Import > File.
4 Navigate to the Assets folder in your AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson01 folder.  
Shift-click to select the dancers.mov, gc_adobe_dance.mp3, kaleidoscope_
waveforms.mov, and pulsating_radial_waves.mov files (all the files except 
bgwtext.psd). Then click Open.
A footage item is the basic unit in an After Effects project. You can import many  
types of footage items, including moving-image files, still-image files, still-image 
sequences, audio files, layered files from Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator,  
other After Effects projects, and projects created in Adobe Premiere® Pro. You can 
import footage items at any time.
As you import assets, After Effects reports its progress in the Info panel. 
Because one of the footage items for this project is a multilayer Photoshop file, 
you’ll import it separately as a composition.
5 Double-click in the lower area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box. 
E Tip: To quickly 
maximize a panel, 
position the pointer 
over it and press the 
accent grave (`) key—
the unshifted character 
under the tilde (~) on 
standard US keyboards. 
Press the ` key again to 
return the panel to its 
original size.
E Tip: You can also 
choose File > Import > 
Multiple Files to select 
files located in different 
folders, or drag and 
drop files from Explorer 
or the Finder. You can 
use Adobe Bridge® to 
search for, manage, 
preview, and import 
footage. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 13
6 Navigate to the Lesson01/Assets folder again, and select the bgwtext.psd file. 
Choose Composition from the Import As menu, and then click Open.
After Effects opens an additional dialog box with options for the file you’re 
importing.
7 In the bgwtext.psd dialog box, choose Composition from the Import Kind menu 
to import the layered Photoshop file as a composition. Select Editable Layer 
Styles in the Layer Options area, and then click OK. The footage items appear  
in the Project panel.

14 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
8 In the Project panel, click to select different footage items. Notice that a 
thumbnail preview appears at the top of the Project panel. You can also see  
the file type and size, as well as other information about each item, in the 
Project panel columns.
When you import files, After Effects doesn’t copy the video and audio data itself  
into your project. Instead, each footage item in the Project panel contains a refer-
ence link to the source files. When After Effects needs to retrieve image or audio 
data, it reads it from the source file. This keeps the project file small, and allows  
you to update source files in another application without modifying the project.
To save time and minimize the size and complexity of a project, import a footage 
item once, and then use it multiple times in a composition. In some cases, you may 
need to import a source file more than once, such as if you want to use it at two  
different frame rates.
After you’ve imported footage, it’s a good time to save the project.
9 Choose File > Save. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/
Lessons/Lesson01/Finished_Project folder. Name the project Lesson01_
Finished.aep, and then click Save.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 15
Creating a composition and arranging layers
The next step of the workflow is to create a composition. You create all animation, 
layering, and effects in a composition. An After Effects composition has both  
spatial dimensions and a temporal dimension (time).
Compositions include one or more layers, arranged in the Composition panel 
and in the Timeline panel. Any item that you add to a composition—such as a 
still image, moving-image file, audio file, light layer, camera layer, or even another 
composition—becomes a new layer. Simple projects may include only one composi-
tion, while elaborate projects may include several compositions to organize large 
amounts of footage or intricate effects sequences.
To create a composition, you’ll drag the footage items into the Timeline panel, and 
After Effects will create layers for them.
1 In the Project panel, Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) 
to select the bgwtext composition as well as the dancers, gc_adobe_dance, 
kaleidoscope_waveforms, and pulsating_radial_waves footage items.
2 Drag the selected footage items into the Timeline panel. The New Composition 
From Selection dialog box appears.
After Effects bases the dimensions of the new composition on the selected footage. 
In this example, all of the footage is sized identically, so you can accept the default 
settings.

16 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
3 Click OK to create the new composition. 
The footage items appear as layers in the Timeline panel, and After Effects displays 
the composition, named bgwtext 2, in the Composition panel. 
When you add a footage item to a composition, the footage becomes the source for 
a new layer. A composition can have any number of layers, and you can also include 
a composition as a layer in another composition, which is called nesting.
Some of the assets are longer than others, but you want them all to appear only  
as long as the dancers are on the screen. You’ll change the length of the entire  
composition to 1:15 to match the dancers.
4 Choose Composition > 
Composition Settings.
5 In the Composition 
Settings dialog box, 
type 1:15 for the 
Duration, and then  
click OK.
The Timeline panel displays 
the same duration for each 
of the layers.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 17
about layers
Layers are the components you use to build a composition. Any item that you  
add to a composition—such as a still image, moving-image file, audio file, light 
layer, camera layer, or even another composition—becomes a new layer. Without 
layers, a composition consists only of an empty frame.
Using layers, you can work with specific footage items in a composition without 
affecting any other footage. For example, you can move, rotate, and draw masks for 
one layer without disturbing any other layers in the composition, or you can use 
the same footage in more than one layer and use it differently in each instance. In 
general, the layer order in the Timeline panel corresponds to the stacking order in 
the Composition panel.
In this composition, there are five footage items, and therefore five layers in the 
Timeline panel. Depending on the order in which the elements were selected  
when you imported them, your layer stack may differ from the one shown on the 
previous page. The layers need to be in a specific order as you add effects and ani-
mations, however, so you’ll rearrange them now.
6 Click an empty area of the Timeline 
panel to deselect the layers, and then 
drag bgwtext to the bottom of the layer 
stack if it is not already there. Drag the 
other four layers so that they’re in the 
order shown in the figure.
From this point forward in the workflow, you should be thinking about layers, not 
footage items. You’ll change the column title accordingly.
7 Click the Source Name column title  
in the Timeline panel to change it to 
Layer Name.
8 Choose File > Save to save your project 
so far.
 Note: You may  
need to click a blank 
area of the Timeline 
panel or press F2 to 
deselect layers before 
you can select an 
individual layer.

18 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
about the tools panel
As soon as you create a composition, the tools in the Tools panel in the upper 
left corner of the After Effects application window become available. After Effects 
includes tools that enable you to modify elements of your composition. Some of 
these tools—the Selection tool and the Hand tool, for example—will be familiar  
to you if you use other Adobe applications, such as Photoshop. Others will be new. 
The following image identifies the tools in the Tools panel for your reference.

J. Brush  K. Clone Stamp  L. Eraser  M. Roto Brush  N. Puppet tools
When you hover the pointer over any button in the Tools panel, a tool tip identifies 
the tool and its keyboard shortcut. A small triangle in the lower right corner of the 
button indicates that one or more additional tools are hidden behind it. Click and 
hold the button to display the hidden tools, and then select the tool you want  
to use.
adding effects and modifying 
layer properties
Now that your composition is set up, you can start having fun—applying effects, 
making transformations, and adding animation. You can add any combination of 
effects and modify any of a layer’s properties, such as size, placement, and opacity. 
Using effects, you can alter a layer’s appearance or sound, and even generate visual 
elements from scratch. The easiest way to start is to apply any of the hundreds of 
effects included with After Effects. 
Preparing the layers
You’ll apply the effects to duplicates of selected layers—the dancers layer and the 
kaleidoscope_waveforms layer. Working with duplicates lets you apply an effect  
to one layer and then use it in conjunction with the unmodified original.
1 Select the first layer, dancers.mov, in the Timeline panel, and then choose  
Edit > Duplicate. A new layer with the same name appears at the top of the 
stack, so the first two layers are now both named dancers.mov.
 Note: This exercise 
is just the tip of the 
iceberg. You will learn 
more about effects and 
animation presets in 
Lesson 2, “Creating a 
Basic Animation Using 
Effects and Presets,” and 
throughout the rest of 
this book.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 19
2 Select the second layer and  
rename it to avoid confusion:  
Press Enter (Windows) or  
Return (Mac OS) to make the  
name editable, and type  
dancers_with_effects.mov.  
Then press Enter or Return  
again to accept the new name.
3 Select the kaleidoscope_
waveforms layer, and  
make two duplicates. Rename 
the duplicates kaleidoscope_
left.mov and kaleidoscope_
right.mov.
4 Drag if necessary to rearrange the layers in the Timeline panel so that they’re  
in the order shown.
adding a radial Blur effect
The Radial Blur effect creates blurs around a specific point in a layer, simulating  
the effects of a zooming or rotating camera. You’ll add a Radial Blur effect to  
the dancers.
1 Select the dancers_with_effects layer in the Timeline panel. Notice that layer 
handles appear around the layer in the Composition panel.
E Tip: Use the 
keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl+D (Windows) 
or Command+D 
(Mac OS) to copy the 
layers quickly.
 Note: If you 
double-click a layer  
in the Timeline panel, 
it appears in the Layer 
panel. To return to  
the Composition  
panel, click the 
Composition tab.

20 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
2 In the Effects & Presets panel at the right side of the application window, type 
radial blur in the search box.
After Effects searches for effects and presets that contain the letters you type, and 
displays the results interactively. Before you have finished typing, the Radial Blur 
effect—located in the Blur & Sharpen category—appears in the panel.
3 Drag the Radial Blur effect onto the dancers_with_effects layer in the Timeline 
panel. After Effects applies the effect and automatically opens the Effect Controls 
panel in the upper left area of the workspace.
Now you’ll customize the settings.
4 In the Effect Controls panel, choose Zoom from the Type menu.
5 In the Composition panel, move the center point of the blur lower by dragging 
the center cross-hair ( ) down until it’s at the horizon line. As you drag the  
cross-hair, the Center value updates in the Effect Controls panel. The left 
and right values are x and y coordinates, respectively. Center the blur at 
approximately 325, 335.
6 Click the number next to Amount, type 200, and press Enter or Return.
E Tip: You can also 
type the x and y 
values directly into the 
coordinate fields in the 
Effect Controls panel, 
or you can position the 
pointer over the fields 
to see the double-arrow 
icon (
), and then drag 
right or left to increase 
or decrease the values, 
respectively. Dragging 
to change values is 
sometimes called 
scrubbing.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 21
adding an exposure effect
To punch up the brightness of this layer, you will apply the Exposure color- 
correction effect. This effect lets you make tonal adjustments to footage. It simu-
lates the result of modifying the exposure setting (in f-stops) of the camera that 
captured the image.
1 Click the x in the Effects & Presets panel to clear 
the search box, and then locate the Exposure 
effect by doing one of the following:
• Type Exposure in the search box.
• Click the triangle next to Color Correction to 
expand the list of color-correction effects in 
alphabetical order.
2 Drag the Exposure effect in the Color Correction category onto the dancers_
with_effects layer name in the Timeline panel. After Effects adds the Exposure 
settings to the Effect Controls panel under the Radial Blur effect.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, click the triangle next to the Radial Blur effect to 
collapse those settings so that you can see the Exposure settings more easily.
4 For Master Exposure, enter 1.60. This will make everything brighter in the layer 
to simulate an overexposed image. 
transforming layer properties
The dancers look smashing, so you can turn your attention to the kaleidoscope 
waveforms that are part of the background. You’ll reposition the copies you created 
earlier to create an edgy effect.
1 Select the kaleidoscope_left layer (layer 5) in the Timeline panel.
E Tip: Make sure to 
select the Exposure 
effect in the Color 
Correction category, not 
the Exposure animation 
preset in the Lights And 
Optical category.

22 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
2 Click the triangle to the left of the layer number to expand the layer, and 
then expand the layer’s Transform properties: Anchor Point, Position, Scale, 
Rotation, and Opacity. 
3 If you can’t see the properties, scroll down the Timeline panel using the scroll 
bar at the right side of the panel. Better yet, select the kaleidoscope_left layer 
name again and press P. This keyboard shortcut displays only the Position 
property, which is the only property you want to change for this exercise.
You’ll move this layer to the left about 200 pixels.
4 Change the x coordinate for the Position property to 160. Leave the y 
coordinate at 243.
5 Select the kaleidoscope_right layer (layer 6), and press P to display its Position 
property. You will move this layer to the right.
E Tip: With any layer 
selected in the Timeline 
panel, you can display 
any single Transform 
property by pressing a 
keyboard shortcut:  
P displays Position; 
A displays Anchor Point; 
S displays Scale; 
R displays Rotation; 
T displays Opacity.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 23
6 Change the x coordinate for the kaleidoscope_right Position property to 560. 
Leave the y coordinate at 243. Now you can see the three waveforms—left, 
center, and right—in the Composition panel, hanging like a beaded light 
curtain.
To contrast the left and right waveforms with the center waveform, you will reduce 
their opacity.
7 Select the kaleidoscope_left layer in the Timeline panel, and press T to reveal  
its Opacity property. Set it to 30%.
8 Select the kaleidoscope_right layer in the Timeline panel, press T to reveal its 
Opacity property, and set it to 30%.
9 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
E Tip: To change the 
Opacity property for 
multiple layers at once, 
select the layers, press 
T, and change the 
property for one of the 
selected layers.

Getting to know the Workflow
animating the composition
So far, you’ve started a project, created a composition, imported footage, and 
applied some effects. It all looks great, but how about some movement? You’ve 
applied only static effects.
In After Effects, you can change any combination of a layer’s properties over time 
using conventional keyframing, expressions, or keyframe assistants. You’ll explore 
many of these methods throughout the lessons of this book. For this exercise, you 
will animate the Position property of a text layer using keyframes, and then use an 
animation preset so that the letters appear to rain down on the screen. 
about the timeline panel
Use the Timeline panel to animate layer properties and set In and Out points  
for a layer. (In and Out points are the points at which a layer begins and ends in 
the composition.) Many of the Timeline panel controls are organized in columns of 
related functions. By default, the Timeline panel contains a number of columns and 
controls, as shown in the following figure:
A B
C
D
E
F
A. Composition name B. Current time C. Time graph/Graph Editor area D. Audio/Video 
Switches column  E. Source Name/Layer Name column F. Layer switches

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 25

The time graph portion of the Timeline panel (the right side) contains a time  
ruler, markers to indicate specific times, and duration bars for the layers in your 
composition.

some of these controls. The duration of a composition, a layer, or a footage item  
is represented visually in the time graph. On the time ruler, the current-time  
indicator marks the frame you are viewing or editing, and the frame appears  
in the Composition panel.
The work area start and end brackets indicate the part of the composition that will 
be rendered for previews or final output. When you work on a composition, you may 
want to render only a portion of it by specifying a segment of the composition time 
ruler as a work area.
A composition’s current time appears in the upper left corner of the Timeline panel. 
To move to a different time, drag the current-time indicator in the time ruler or click 
the current-time field in the Timeline panel or Composition panel, type a new time, 
and click OK.
For more information about the Timeline panel, see After Effects Help.

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
Preparing the text composition
For this exercise, you’ll work with a separate composition—the one you imported 
from a layered Photoshop file.
1 Select the Project tab to display the Project panel, and then double-click the 
bgwtext composition to open it as a composition in its own Timeline panel.
This composition is the layered Photoshop file you imported. Two layers—Title 
Here and Background—appear in the Timeline panel. The Title Here layer contains 
placeholder text that was created in Photoshop. 
At the top of the Composition panel 
is the Composition Navigator bar, 
which displays the relationship 
between the main composition 
(bgwtext 2) and the current composi-
tion (bgwtext), which is nested 
within the main composition. 
You can nest multiple compositions within each other; the Composition Navigator 
bar displays the entire composition path. Arrows between the composition names 
indicate the direction in which information flows.
Before you can replace the text, you need to make the layer editable. 
 Note: If the Project 
tab isn’t visible, choose 
Window > Project to 
open the Project panel.  
 Note: You can 
quickly navigate within 
a composition network 
using the Composition 
Mini-Flowchart. To 
display the flowchart, 
tap the Shift key when a 
Composition, Timeline, 
or Layer panel is active.  

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 27
2 Select the Title Here layer (layer 1) in the Timeline panel, and then choose 
Layer > Convert To Editable Text.
A T icon appears next to the layer name in the Timeline panel, indicating that it 
is now an editable text layer. The layer is also selected in the Composition panel, 
ready for you to edit.
animating text with animation presets
You’ll start by replacing the placeholder text with real text. Then you’ll animate it.
1 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and drag over the 
placeholder text in the Composition panel to select it. Then type AQUO. 
2 Select the Title Here layer in the Timeline panel again, and make sure you’re  
at the first frame of the animation by doing one of the following:
• Drag the current-time indicator all the way to the left of the time ruler,  
to 0:00.
• Press the Home key on your keyboard. 
 Note: If you see 
a warning about 
missing fonts or layer 
dependencies, click OK.
 Note: After Effects 
offers robust character 
and paragraph 
formatting controls, 
but the default 
settings—whatever 
typeface appears when 
you type—should be 
fine for this project. 
You’ll learn more 
about type in Lesson 3, 
“Animating Text.”

lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
about timecode and duration
The primary concept related to time is duration, or length. Each footage item,  
layer, and composition in a project has its own duration, which is reflected in the 
beginning and ending times displayed in the time rulers in the Composition, Layer, 
and Timeline panels.
The way you view and specify time in After Effects depends on the display style, 
or unit of measure, that you use to describe time. By default, After Effects displays 
time in Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) timecode: 
hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. Note that the figures are separated by 
semicolons in the After Effects interface, representing drop-frame timecode 
(which adjusts for the real-time frame rate), but this book uses a colon to represent 
non-drop-frame timecode.
To learn when and how to change to another system of time display, such as frames, 
or feet and frames of film, see After Effects Help.
3 Select the Effects & Presets tab to display the panel. Then type bubble in the 
search box. 
4 Select the Zoom-Bubble effect in the Transitions-Movement category, and drag 
it onto the AQUO text in the Composition panel. 
After Effects adds the effect, and displays its settings in the Effect Controls panel. 
You can change effect settings in this panel or in the Timeline panel. You’ll add 
keyframes in the Timeline panel. 
5 In the Timeline panel, expand the Title Here layer, and then expand Effects > 
Zoom-bubble to reveal the Transition Completion setting. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 29
The stopwatch icon ( ) next to Transition Completion is selected, and the value is 
0%. A diamond appears in the Transition Completion bar for the layer in the time 
graph, indicating the keyframe that After Effects created when you added the effect.
6 Go to 1:00 in the timeline, and then change the Transition Completion value  
to 100%.
Even though this is a simple animation, you’ll learn good animation practices right 
away by adding ease-in controls using the Easy Ease feature. Easing into (and out of) 
animations keeps the motion from appearing to be too sudden or robotic.
7 Right-click or Control-click the keyframe at 1:00, and choose Keyframe 
Assistant > Easy Ease In.
 Note: Don’t 
select the Transition 
Completion property, 
as that will select both 
keyframes, and you 
only want to change 
the value of the second 
one..
E Tip: To see greater 
detail in the Timeline 
panel, move the time 
zoom slider at the 
bottom of the panel.

30 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
Keyframes are used to create and control animation, effects, audio properties, and 
many other kinds of changes that occur over time. A keyframe marks the point in 
time where you specify a value, such as spatial position, opacity, or audio volume. 
Values between keyframes are interpolated. When you use keyframes to create a 
change over time, you must use at least two keyframes—one for the state at the 
beginning of the change, and one for the state at the end of the change.
8 Manually preview the effect by moving the current-time indicator from 0 to 1:00.
Changing preset settings in the effect Controls panel
You’ll add another animation preset to the type layer, but this time, you’ll adjust its 
settings in the Effect Controls panel.
1 Go to the beginning of the time ruler by doing one of the following:
• Drag the current-time indicator to the left in the time ruler so that it’s 
positioned at 0:00.
• Click the Current Time field in the Timeline panel or Composition panel, 
and type 00. If you clicked in the Current Time field in the Composition 
panel, click OK to close the Go To Time dialog box.
2 Type channel blur in the search box in the Effects & Presets panel. 
3 Drag the Channel Blur effect onto the type in the Composition panel. After 
Effects adds the Channel Blur effect to the Timeline panel and displays its 
settings in the Effect Controls panel. 
4 In the Effect Controls panel, click the triangles next to Zoom-bubble,  
Spherize, and Transform to hide their settings so you can focus on the  
Channel Blur settings.
5 Set the Red Blurriness, Green Blurriness, Blue Blurriness, and Alpha Blurriness 
values to 50%.
6 From the Blur Dimensions menu, choose Vertical. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 31
7 Click the stopwatch icon next to each of the settings you changed to create 
initial keyframes.
8 Go to 1:00 in the timeline.
9 Change the values as follows:
• Red: 75%
• Green: 25%
• Blue: 0%
• Alpha: 0%
The blue lines at the top, bottom, and sides of the Composition panel indicate title-
safe and action-safe zones. Television sets enlarge a video image and allow some 
portion of its outer edges to be cut off by the edge of the screen. This is known 
as overscan. The amount of overscan is not consistent between television sets, so 
you should keep important parts of a video image, such as action or titles, within 
margins called safe zones. Keep your text inside the inner blue guides to ensure that 
it is in the title-safe zone, and keep important scene elements inside the outer blue 
guides to ensure that they are in the action-safe zone.
Previewing your work
You’re probably eager to see the results of your work. After Effects provides several 
methods for previewing compositions, including standard preview, RAM preview, 
and manual preview. (For a list of manual preview controls, see After Effects Help.) 
All three methods are accessible through the Preview panel, which appears on the 
right side of the application window in the Standard workspace. 

32 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
Using standard preview
Standard preview (commonly called a spacebar preview) plays the composition 
from the current-time indicator to the end of the composition. Standard previews 
usually play more slowly than real time. They are useful when your composition is 
simple or in its early stages and doesn’t require additional memory for displaying 
complex animations, effects, 3D layers, cameras, and lights. You’ll use it now to 
preview the text animation.
1 In the Bgwtext Timeline panel, collapse the Title Here layer, and deselect  
both layers.
2 Make sure that the Video switch ( ) is selected for the layers that you want  
to preview—in this case, the Title Here and Background layers.
3 Press the Home key to go to the beginning of the time ruler.
4 Do one of the following:
• Click the Play/Pause button ( ) in the Preview panel.
• Press the spacebar.
5 To stop the standard preview, do one of the following:
• Click the Play/Pause button in the Preview panel.
• Press the spacebar.
E Tip: Click the 
pasteboard of the 
Composition panel 
if you want to hide 
the motion path for 
this preview.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 33
Using ram preview
RAM preview allocates enough RAM to play the preview (with audio) as fast as 
the system allows, up to the frame rate of the composition. Use RAM preview to 
play footage in the Timeline, Layer, or Footage panel. The number of frames played 
depends on the amount of RAM available to the application.
In the Timeline panel, RAM preview plays either the span of time you specify as 
the work area, or from the beginning of the time ruler. In the Layer and Footage 
panels, RAM preview plays only untrimmed footage. Before you preview, check 
which frames are designated as the work area.
You’ll preview the entire composition—the animated text plus graphic effects—
using a RAM preview.
1 Click the Bgwtext 2 tab in the Timeline panel to bring it forward.
2 Make sure that the Video switch ( ) is turned on for all of the layers in the 
composition, and press F2 to deselect all layers.
3 Drag the current-time indicator to the beginning of the time ruler, or press the  
Home key.
4 Click the RAM Preview button (
) in the Preview panel, or choose 
Composition > Preview > RAM Preview. 
A green progress bar indicates which frames are cached to RAM. When all of the 
frames in the work area are cached, the RAM preview plays back in real time. 
5 To stop the RAM preview, press the spacebar.
The more detail and precision you want to see, the more RAM is required for 
RAM preview. You can control the amount of detail shown in either the standard 
or RAM preview by changing the resolution, magnification, and preview quality 
of your composition. You can also limit the number of layers previewed by turning 
off the Video switch for certain layers, or limit the number of frames previewed by 
adjusting the composition’s work area.
6 Choose File > Save to save your project.
E Tip: You can 
interrupt the caching 
process at any time by 
pressing the spacebar, 
and the RAM preview 
will play back only the 
frames that have been 
cached to that point.

34 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
Optimizing performance in after effects
How you configure After Effects and your computer determines how quickly 
After Effects renders projects. Complex compositions can require a large amount  
of memory to render, and the rendered movies can take a large amount of disk 
space to store. Refer to “Improve Performance” in After Effects Help for tips that 
can help you configure your system, After Effects preferences, and your projects  
for better performance.
rendering and exporting your composition
When you’re finished with your masterpiece—as you are now—you can render and 
export it at the quality settings you choose, and create movies in the formats that 
you specify. You will learn more about exporting compositions in subsequent les-
sons, especially in Lesson 14, “Rendering and Outputting.”
Customizing workspaces
In the course of this project, you may have resized or repositioned some panels,  
or opened new ones. As you modify a workspace, After Effects saves those modifi-
cations, so the next time you open the project, the most recent version of a work-
space is used. However, you can choose to restore the original workspace at any 
time by choosing Window > Workspace > Reset “Standard.”
Alternatively, if you find yourself frequently using panels that aren’t part of the 
Standard workspace, or if you like to resize or group panels for different types of 
projects, you can save time by customizing the workspace to suit your needs. You 
can save any workspace configuration, or use any of the preset workspaces that 
come with After Effects. These predefined workspaces are suitable for different 
types of workflows, such as animation or effects work.
Using predefined workspaces 
Take a minute to explore the predefined workspaces in After Effects.
1 If you closed the Lesson01_Finished.aep project, open it—or any other project—
to explore the workspaces.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Animation. After Effects opens the following 
panels at the right side of the application window: Info and Audio (grouped), 
Preview, Smoother, Wiggler, Motion Sketch, and Effects & Presets.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 35
You can also change workspaces using the Workspace menu at the top of the window.
3 Choose Paint from the Workspace menu at the top of the application window, 
next to the Search Help box. The Paint and Brushes panels open. The Com-
position panel is replaced by the Layer panel, for easy access to the tools and 
controls you need to paint in your compositions.
Saving a custom workspace
You can save any workspace, at any time, as a custom workspace. Once saved, new 
and edited workspaces appear in the Window > Workspace submenu and in the 
Workspace menu at the top of the application window. If a project with a custom 
workspace is opened on a system other than the one on which it was created,  
After Effects looks for a workspace with a matching name. If After Effects finds  
a match (and the monitor configuration matches), it uses that workspace; if it can’t 
find a match (or the monitor configuration doesn’t match), it opens the project 
using the current local workspace.
1 Close the Paint and Brushes panels by clicking the small x next to the panel names.
2 Choose Window > Effects & Presets to open 
that panel, and then drag it into a group with 
the Preview panel. 
3 Choose Window > Workspace > New 
Workspace. Enter a name for the workspace  
and click OK to save it, or click Cancel if you  
don’t want to save it. 

36 
lesson 1 
Getting to know the Workflow
Controlling the brightness 
of the user interface 
You can brighten or darken the After Effects user interface. Changing the bright-
ness preference affects panels, windows, and dialog boxes. 
1 Choose Edit > Preferences > Appearance (Windows) or After Effects > 
Preferences > Appearance (Mac OS). 
2 Drag the Brightness slider to the left or right, and notice how the screen changes.
3 Click OK to save the new brightness setting or Cancel to leave your preferences 
unchanged. You can click Default to restore the default brightness setting.
Finding resources for using after effects
For complete and up-to-date information about using After Effects panels, tools, 
and other application features, visit the Adobe website. To search for information 
in After Effects Help and support documents, as well as other websites relevant to 
After Effects users, simply enter a search term in the Search Help box in the upper 
right corner of the application window. You can narrow the results to view only 
Adobe Help and support documents. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 37
For additional resources, such as tips and techniques and the latest product infor-
mation, check out the After Effects Help And Support page at www.adobe.com/
support/aftereffects. 
Checking for updates
Adobe periodically provides updates to software. You can easily obtain these 
updates through Adobe Application Manager, as long as you have an active 
Internet connection.
1 In After Effects, choose Help > Updates. Adobe Application Manager 
automatically checks for updates available for your Adobe software.
2 In the Adobe Application Manager dialog box, select the updates you want  
to install, and then click to install them.
Congratulations! You’ve finished Lesson 1. Now that you’re acquainted with the

4 How can you customize an After Effects workspace?
review answers
1 Most After Effects workflows include these steps: import and organize footage, create 
compositions and arrange layers, add effects, animate elements, preview your work, 
and render and export the final composition.
2 A composition is where you create all animation, layering, and effects. An After Effects 
composition has both spatial and temporal (time) dimensions. Compositions include 
one or more layers—video, audio, still images—arranged in the Composition panel 
and in the Timeline panel. Simple projects may include only one composition, while 
elaborate projects may include several compositions to organize large amounts of 
footage or intricate effects sequences.
3 You can manually preview your work in After Effects by moving the current-time 
indicator, or you can view either a standard or RAM preview. A standard preview 
plays your composition from the current-time indicator to the end of the composition, 
usually more slowly than real time. A RAM preview allocates enough RAM to play 
the preview (with audio) as fast as the system allows, up to the frame rate of the 
composition.
4 You can customize an After Effects workspace by dragging the panels into the 
configuration that best suits your working style. You can drag panels to new locations, 
move panels into or out of groups, place panels alongside each other, and undock 
a panel so that it floats above the application window. As you rearrange panels, the 
other panels resize automatically to fit the application window. You can save custom 
workspaces by choosing Window > Workspace > New Workspace.

lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
Getting started
In this lesson, you will continue to learn the basics of the Adobe After Effects 
project workflow. You’ll learn new ways to accomplish basic tasks as you create a 
simple identification graphic for a fictional travel show called “Travel Europe” on the 
fictional Destinations cable network. You will animate the travel show ID so that it 
fades to become a watermark that can appear in the lower right corner of the screen 
during other TV programs. Then you’ll export the ID for use in broadcast output. 
First, take a look at the final project files to see what you’ll be doing.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson02 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now: 
• In the Assets folder: destinations_logo.ai, parthenon.jpg
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson02.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson02.mov sample movie to see what you will create in 
this lesson. When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete this 
sample movie from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin the lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file.
4 Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a blank, untitled project.
5 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
6 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson02/  
Finished_Project folder. 
7 Name the project Lesson02_Finished.aep, and then click Save.

Importing footage using adobe Bridge
In Lesson 1, you chose File > Import > File to import footage. However, After Effects 
offers another, more powerful and flexible way to import footage for a composi-
tion: Adobe Bridge. You can use Adobe Bridge to organize, browse, and locate the 
assets you need to create content for print, web, television, DVD, film, and mobile 
devices. Adobe Bridge keeps native Adobe files (such as PSD and PDF files) as well 
as non-Adobe application files available for easy access. You can drag assets into 
your layouts, projects, and compositions as needed; preview your assets; and even 
add metadata (file information) to assets to make files easier to locate. 
In this exercise, you will jump to Adobe Bridge to import the still image that will 
serve as the background of your composition.
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge. If you receive a message about adding an 
extension to Adobe Bridge, click Yes.
Adobe Bridge opens, displaying a collection of panels, menus, and buttons.
2 Click the Folders tab in the upper left corner of Adobe Bridge.
3 In the Folders panel, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson02/Assets 
folder. Click the arrows to open nested folders. You can also double-click folder 
thumbnail icons in the Content panel.
The Content panel updates interactively. For example, when you select the Assets 
folder in the Folders panel, thumbnail previews of the folder’s contents appear in 
the Content panel. Adobe Bridge displays previews of image files such as those in 
PSD, TIFF, and JPEG formats, as well as Illustrator vector files, multipage Adobe 
PDF files, QuickTime movie files, and more.
E Tip: To open Adobe 
Bridge directly, choose 
Adobe Bridge from the 
Start menu (Windows) 
or double-click the 
Adobe Bridge icon in 
the Applications /Adobe 
Bridge folder (Mac OS).
 Note: We’re using the 
Essentials workspace, 
which is the default 
workspace in Bridge.

4 Drag the thumbnail slider at the bottom of the Adobe Bridge window to enlarge 
the thumbnail previews. 
5 Select the parthenon.jpg file in the Content panel, and notice that it appears in 
the Preview panel as well. Information about the file, including its creation date, 
bit depth, and file size, appears in the Metadata panel.
6 Double-click the parthenon.jpg thumbnail in the Content panel to place the file 
in your After Effects project. Alternatively, you can drag the thumbnail into the 
Project panel in After Effects.
Adobe Bridge returns you to After Effects when you place the file. You can close 
Adobe Bridge if you’d like. You won’t be using it again during this lesson.
E Tip: To prioritize 
different information 
in Adobe Bridge,

Creating a new composition
Following the After Effects workflow you learned in Lesson 1, the next step to 
building the travel show ID is to create a new composition. In Lesson 1, you created 
the composition based on footage items that were selected in the Project panel. You 
can also create an empty composition, and then add your footage items to it.
1 Create a new composition by doing one of the following:
• Click the Create A New Composition button (
) at the bottom of the  
Project panel.
• Choose Composition > New Composition.
• Press Ctrl+N (Windows) or Command+N (Mac OS).
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, do the following:
• Name the composition Destinations.
• Choose NTSC D1 from the Preset pop-up menu. NTSC D1 is the resolution 
for standard-definition television in the United States and some other 
countries. This preset automatically sets the width, height, pixel aspect ratio, 
and frame rate for the composition to NTSC standards.
• In the Duration field, type 300 to specify 3 seconds.
• Click OK.
After Effects displays an empty composition named Destinations in the 
Composition panel and in the Timeline panel. Now, you’ll add the background.

46 
lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
3 Drag the parthenon.jpg footage item from the Project panel to the Timeline 
panel to add it to the Destinations composition.
4 With the parthenon layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Layer > 
Transform > Fit To Comp to scale the background image to the dimensions  
of the composition.
Importing the foreground element
Your background is now in place. The foreground object you’ll use is a layered  
vector graphic that was created in Illustrator.
1 Choose File > Import > File. 
2 In the Import File dialog box, select the destinations_logo.ai file in the  
AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson02/Assets folder. (The file appears as  
destinations_logo if you’ve hidden file extensions in Windows.)
E Tip: The keyboard 
shortcut for fitting a 
layer to a composition 
is Ctrl+Alt+F (Windows) 
or Command+Option+F 
(Mac OS).

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 47
3 Select Composition from the Import As menu, and then click Open.
The Illustrator file is added to the 
Project panel as a composition named 
destinations_logo. A folder named 
destinations_logo Layers also appears. 
This folder contains the three individ-
ual layers of the Illustrator file. Click 
the triangle to open the folder and see 
its contents if you’d like.
4 Drag the destinations_logo composition file from the Project panel into the 
Timeline panel above the parthenon layer.
You should now see both the background image and the logo in the Composition 
panel and in the Timeline panel.
Working with imported Illustrator layers
The destinations_logo graphic was created in Illustrator; your job in After Effects 
is to add text and animate it. To work with the layers of the Illustrator file indepen-
dently of the background footage, you’ll open the destinations_logo composition in 
its own Timeline and Composition panels.

48 
lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
1 Double-click the destinations_logo composition in the Project panel.  
The composition opens in its own Timeline and Composition panels.
2 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and click in the center  
of the Composition panel.
3 Type TRAVEL EUROPE, all capital letters, and then select all of the text you 
just entered.
4 In the Character panel, select a sans serif typeface such as Myriad Pro, and 
change the font size to 24 pixels. Click the eyedropper in the Character panel, 
and click on the rotated “Destinations” text on the logo to select the green color. 
After Effects applies it to the text you typed. Leave all other options in the 
Character panel at their defaults. 
5 In the Paragraph panel, click the Right Align Text button ( ). Leave all other 
options in the Paragraph panel at their defaults. You’ll learn more about 
working with text in Lesson 3, “Animating Text.” 
 Note: If the Character 
panel isn’t open, choose 
Window > Character.
 Note: If the 
Paragraph panel isn’t 
open, choose Window > 
Paragraph.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 49
6 Select the Selection tool ( ), and then drag the text in the Composition panel  
to position it as it appears in the following figure. Notice that when you switch 
to the Selection tool, the generic Text 1 layer name in the Timeline panel 
changes to TRAVEL EUROPE, the text you typed. 
applying and controlling effects
You can apply or remove an effect at any time. Once you’ve applied effects to a layer, 
you can temporarily turn off one or all of the effects in the layer to concentrate on 
another aspect of your composition. Effects that are turned off do not appear in the 
Composition panel, and typically aren’t included when the layer is previewed or 
rendered.
By default, when you apply an effect to a layer, the effect is active for the duration of 
the layer. However, you can make an effect start and stop at specific times, or make 
the effect more or less intense over time. You’ll learn more about creating animation 
using keyframes or expressions in Lesson 5, “Animating a Multimedia Presentation,” 
and Lesson 6, “Animating Layers.”
You can apply and edit effects on adjustment layers just as you do with other layers. 
However, when you apply an effect to an adjustment layer, the effect is applied to all 
layers below it in the Timeline panel.
Effects can also be saved, browsed, and applied as animation presets.
E Tip: Choose View > 
Show Grid to make the 
nonprinting grid visible 
to help you position 
objects. Choose View > 
Show Grid again to hide 
the grid later.

lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
applying effects to a layer
Now you will return to the main composition, Destinations, and apply an effect  
to the destinations_logo layer. This will apply the effect to all of the layers nested  
in the destinations_logo composition.
1 Click the Destinations tab in the Timeline panel, and then select the 
destinations_logo layer. The effect you create next will be applied only  
to the logo elements, not to the background image of the Parthenon.
2 Choose Effect > Perspective > Drop Shadow. A soft-edged shadow appears 
behind the nested layers of the destinations_logo layer—the logo graphic, the 
rotated type, and the words travel Europe—in the Composition panel.
You can customize the effect using the Effect Controls panel, which appears in 
front of the Project panel when you apply an effect.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, reduce the drop shadow’s Distance to 3 and 
increase its Softness to 4. You can set these values by clicking the field and 
typing the number, or by dragging the orange, underlined value.
The drop shadow is nice, but the logo will stand out even more if you apply an 
emboss effect. You can use either the Effect menu or the Effects & Presets panel  
to locate and apply effects.
4 Click the Effects & Presets tab to bring that panel forward. Then click the 
triangle next to Stylize to expand the category.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 51
5 With the destinations_logo layer selected in the Timeline panel, drag the Color 
Emboss effect into the Composition panel. The Color Emboss effect sharpens 
the edges of objects in the layer without suppressing the original colors. The 
Effect Controls panel displays the Color Emboss effect and its settings below  
the Drop Shadow effect.
6 Choose File > Save to save your work.
applying an animation preset
You’ve positioned the logo and applied some effects to it. It’s time to add some ani-
mation! You will learn several ways to animate text in Lesson 3; for now, you’ll use  
a simple animation preset that will fade the words travel Europe onto the screen 
next to the logo. You’ll need to work in the destinations_logo composition so that 
you can apply the animation to only the TRAVEL EUROPE text layer.
1 Click the destinations_logo tab in 
the Timeline panel, and select the 
TRAVEL EUROPE layer.
2 Move the current-time indicator 
to 1:10, which is the point at 
which you want the text to start 
fading in.
3 In the Effects & Presets panel, choose Animation Presets > Text > Blurs.

52 
lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
4 Drag the Bullet Train animation preset onto the TRAVEL EUROPE layer in 
the Timeline panel or over the words travel Europe in the Composition panel. 
Don’t worry about the text disappearing—you’re looking at the first frame of the 
animation, which happens to be blank.
5 Click a blank area of the Timeline panel to deselect the TRAVEL EUROPE layer, 
and then drag the current-time indicator to 2:00 to manually preview the text 
animation. The text appears, letter by letter, until the words travel Europe are 
fully onscreen at 2:00.
Precomposing layers for a new animation
The travel show ID is coming along nicely, and you’re probably eager to preview the 
complete animation. Before you do, however, you’ll add a dissolve to all of the logo 
elements except the words travel Europe. To do this, you need to precompose the 
other three layers of the destinations_logo composition: rotated type, Globe logo, 
and crop area. 
Precomposing is a way to nest layers within a composition. Precomposing moves 
the layers to a new composition. This new composition takes the place of the 
selected layers. When you want to change the order in which layer components are 
rendered, precomposing is a quick way to create intermediate levels of nesting in 
an existing hierarchy.
1 Shift-click to select the rotated type, Globe logo, and crop area layers in the 
destinations_logo Timeline panel.
2 Choose Layer > Pre-compose.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 53
3 In the Pre-compose dialog box, name the new composition Dissolve_logo.  
Make sure the Move All Attributes Into The New Composition option is 
selected. Then click OK.
The three layers are replaced in the destinations_logo Timeline panel with a single 
layer, Dissolve_logo. This new, precomposed layer contains the three layers that 
you selected in step 1. You can apply the dissolve effect to it without affecting the 
TRAVEL EUROPE text layer and its Bullet Train animation.
4 Make sure the Dissolve_logo layer is selected in the Timeline panel, and press 
the Home key or drag the current-time indicator to go to 0:00.
5 In the Effects & Presets panel, choose Animation Presets > Transitions – 
Dissolves, and then drag the Dissolve – Vapor animation preset onto the 
Dissolve_logo layer in the Timeline panel or onto the Composition panel.
The Dissolve – Vapor animation preset includes three components—a master  
dissolve, a box blur, and a solid composite, all of which appear in the Effect  
Controls panel. The default settings are fine for this project.
6 Choose File > Save.
E Tip: To locate the 
Dissolve – Vapor preset 
quickly, type vap in the 
search box in the Effects 
& Presets panel.

lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
Previewing the effects
It’s time to preview all of the effects together.
1 Click the Destinations tab in the Timeline panel to switch to the main 
composition. Press the Home key or drag the current-time indicator to make 
sure you’re at the beginning of the time ruler.
2 Make sure the Video switch ( ) is selected for both layers in the Destinations 
Timeline panel.
3 Click the Play button ( ) in the Preview panel, or press the spacebar, to watch 
the preview. Press the spacebar to stop playback at any time.
adding transparency
Many TV stations display logos semi-transparently in the corner of the frame  
to emphasize the brand. You’ll reduce the opacity of the ID so that it can be used  
this way.
1 Still in the Destinations Timeline panel, go to 2:24.
2 Select the destinations_logo layer, and press T to display its Opacity property.  
By default, the Opacity is 100%—fully opaque. Click the stopwatch icon ( ) 
to set an Opacity keyframe at this location.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 55
3 Press the End key or drag the current-time indicator to go to the end of the time 
ruler (2:29), and change the Opacity to 40%. After Effects adds a keyframe.
The logo appears, the words travel Europe fly in, and it all fades to 40% opacity. 
4 Watch a preview of your composition by clicking the Play button in the Preview 
panel, by pressing the spacebar, or by pressing 0 on your numeric keypad. Press 
the spacebar to stop playback when you’re done.
5 Choose File > Save to save your project.
rendering the composition
You’re ready to prepare your travel show ID for output. When you create output, 
the layers of a composition and each layer’s masks, effects, and properties are 
rendered frame by frame into one or more output files or, in the case of an image 
sequence, into a series of consecutive files.
Making a movie from your final composition can take a few minutes or many hours, 
depending on the composition’s frame size, quality, complexity, and compression 
method. When you place your composition in the render queue, it becomes a ren-
der item that uses the render settings assigned to it.
After Effects provides a variety of formats and compression types for rendering 
output; the format you choose depends on the medium from which you’ll play your 
final output or on the requirements of your hardware, such as a video-editing 
system. 
 Note: For more 
about output formats 
and rendering, see 
Lesson 14, “Rendering 
and Outputting.”

56 
lesson 2 
Creating a basic Animation Using effects and Presets
You’ll render and export the composition so that it can be broadcast on television.
1 Do one of the following to add the composition to the render queue:
• Select the Destinations composition in the Project panel, and then choose 
Composition > Add To Render Queue. The Render Queue panel opens 
automatically.
• Choose Window > Render Queue to open the Render Queue panel, and then 
drag the Destinations composition from the Project panel onto the Render 
Queue panel.
2 Choose Maximize Frame from the 
Render Queue panel menu so that the 
panel fills the application window.
3 Click the triangle to expand the Render Settings options. By default, After Effects 
renders compositions at the Best Quality and Full Resolution. The default 
settings are fine for this project.
4 Click the triangle to expand the Output Module options. By default, After Effects 
uses lossless compression to encode the rendered composition into a movie file, 
which is fine for this project. But you need to identify where to save the file.
5 Click the underlined words Not Yet Specified next to the Output To pop-up menu.
6 In the Output Movie To dialog box, accept the default movie name 
(Destinations), select the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson02/Finished_Project 
folder for the location, and then click Save.
E Tip: The keyboard 
shortcut for the 
Maximize Frame 
command is the accent 
grave (`) character, 
which shares a key with 
the tilde (~) character.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 57
7 Back in the Render Queue panel, click the Render button. 
After Effects displays a progress bar in the Render Queue panel as it encodes  
the file, and issues an audio alert when all items in the Render Queue have been 
rendered and encoded.
8 When the movie is complete, choose Restore Frame Size from the Render Queue 
panel menu to restore your workspace.
9 If you want to see your final product, double-click the Destinations.mov file 
in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson02/Finished_Project folder to open it in 
QuickTime, and then play the file.
Congratulations. You’ve created a travel show ID suitable for broadcast.

Your type doesn’t need to sit still while your audience 
is reading it. In this lesson, you’ll learn several ways 
to animate type in After Effects, including timesaving 
methods unique to text layers. 

62 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Getting started
Adobe After Effects offers many ways to animate text. You can animate text layers 
by manually creating keyframes in the Timeline panel, using animation presets,  
or using expressions. You can even animate individual characters or words in a text 
layer. In this lesson, you’ll employ several different animation techniques, includ-
ing some that are unique to text, while you design the opening title credits for an 
animated documentary called Road Trip. 
As in other projects, you’ll begin by previewing the movie you’re creating, and then 
you’ll open After Effects.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson03 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: background_movie.mov, car.ai, compass.swf, credits.psd
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson03.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson03.mov sample movie to see the title credits you will 
create in this lesson. When you’re done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete 
this sample movie from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
As you start the application, restore the default settings for After Effects. See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file.
4 Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a blank, untitled project.
5 Choose File > Save As > Save As, and navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/
Lesson03/Finished_Project folder.
6 Name the project Lesson03_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
Importing the footage
You need to import two footage items to begin this lesson.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson03/Assets folder on your hard 
disk, Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) to select both the 
background_movie.mov and compass.swf files, and then click Open.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 63
After Effects can import several file formats including Adobe Photoshop and Adobe 
Illustrator files, as well as QuickTime and AVI movies. This makes After Effects an 
incredibly powerful application for compositing and motion graphics work.
Creating the composition
Now, you’ll create the composition.
1 Press Ctrl+N (Windows) or Command+N (Mac OS) to create a new 
composition.
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, name the composition Road_Trip_
Title_Sequence, select NTSC DV from the Preset menu, and set the Duration  
to 10:00, which is the length of the background movie. Then click OK.
3 Drag the background_movie.mov and compass.swf footage items from the 
Project panel to the Timeline panel. Arrange the layers so that compass.swf  
is above background_movie.mov in the layer stack.
4 Choose File > Save.
You’re ready to add the title text to the composition. 

64 
lesson 3 
Animating text
about text layers
In After Effects, you can add text with flexibility and precision. You can create 
and edit text directly on the screen in the Composition panel, and quickly change 
the font, style, size, and color of the text. You can add horizontal or vertical text 
anywhere in a composition. The Tools, Character, and Paragraph panels contain 
a wide range of text controls. You can apply changes to individual characters and 
set formatting options for entire paragraphs, including alignment, justification, 
and word-wrapping. In addition to all of these style features, After Effects provides 
tools for easily animating specific characters and properties, such as text opacity 
and hue.
After Effects uses two types of text: point text and paragraph text. Use point text to 
enter a single word or line of characters; use paragraph text to enter and format text 
as one or more paragraphs.
In many ways, text layers are just like any other layer in After Effects. You can apply 
effects and expressions to text layers, animate them, designate them as 3D layers, 
and edit the 3D text while viewing it in multiple views. As with layers imported 
from Illustrator, text layers are continuously rasterized, so when you scale the layer 
or resize the text, it retains crisp, resolution-independent edges. The main differ-
ences between text layers and other layers are that you cannot open a text layer in 
its own Layer panel, and that you can animate the text in a text layer using special 
text animator properties and selectors.
Creating and formatting point text
When you enter point text, each line of text is independent—the length of a line 
increases or decreases as you edit the text, but it doesn’t wrap to the next line. The  
text you enter appears in a new text layer. The small line through the I-beam marks  
the position of the text baseline. 
1 In the Tools panel, select the Horizontal Type tool ( ).
2 Click anywhere in the Composition panel, and type Road Trip. Then press 
Enter on the numeric keypad to exit text-editing mode and to select the text 
layer in the Composition panel. Or, you can select the layer name to exit text-
editing mode.
 Note: If you press 
Enter or Return on 
the regular keyboard 
instead of on the 
numeric keypad, you’ll 
begin a new paragraph.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 65
Using the Character panel
The Character panel provides options for formatting characters. If text is high-
lighted, changes you make in the Character panel affect only the highlighted text.  
If no text is highlighted, changes you make in the Character panel affect the 
selected text layers and the text layers’ selected Source Text keyframes, if any exist. 
If no text is highlighted and no text layers are selected, the changes you make in the 
Character panel become the new defaults for the next text entry.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Text to display only those panels you need 
while working with text.
2 Select the Road Trip text layer in the Timeline panel.
3 In the Character panel, choose Myriad Pro from the Font Family menu. If you 
don’t have Myriad Pro, then choose another heavy sans serif typeface, such as 
Verdana.
4 Choose Bold from the Font Style menu. If Bold isn’t available, click the Faux Bold 
button ( ) in the lower left corner of the panel.
5 Set the Font Size to 90 pixels.
6 Leave all other options at their default settings. 
Using the Paragraph panel
Use the Paragraph panel to set options that apply to an entire paragraph, such  
as alignment, indentation, and leading. For point text, each line is a separate 
paragraph. You can use the Paragraph panel to set formatting options for a single 
paragraph, multiple paragraphs, or all paragraphs in a text layer. You just need to 
make one adjustment in the Paragraph panel for this composition’s title text.
E Tip: To open the 
panels individually, 
choose Window > 
Character or Window > 
Paragraph. To open both 
panels, select the 
Horizontal Type tool and 
then click the Toggle 
The Character And 
Paragraph Panels button 
in the Tools panel.
E Tip: To select a font 
quickly, begin typing its 
name in the Font Family 
box. The Font Family 
menu jumps to the first 
font on your system 
that matches the letters 
you’ve typed. If a type 
layer is selected, the 
text in the Composition 
panel takes on the 
newly selected font. 

66 
lesson 3 
Animating text
1 In the Paragraph panel, click the Center Text button ( ). This aligns horizontal 
text to the center of the layer, not to the center of the composition.
2 Leave all other options at their default settings. 
Positioning the type
To precisely position layers, such as the text layer you’re working on now, you can 
display rulers, guides, and grids in the Composition panel. These visual reference 
tools don’t appear in the final rendered movie.
1 Make sure the Road Trip text layer is selected in the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Layer > Transform > Fit To Comp Width. This scales the layer to fit  
to the width of the composition. 
Now you can position the text layer using a grid.
3 Choose View > Show Grid and then View > Snap To Grid.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 67
4 Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the text up in the Composition panel until 
the base of the letters sits on the horizontal gridline in the center of the 
composition. Press Shift after you start dragging to constrain the movement and 
help you position the text. 
5 When the layer is in position, choose View > Show Grid again to hide the grid.
This project isn’t destined for broadcast TV, so it’s okay that the title extends 
beyond the title-safe and action-safe areas of the composition at the beginning  
of the animation.
6 Choose Standard from the Workspace menu at the top of the application 
window to return to the Standard workspace, and then choose File > Save to 
save your project.
Using a text animation preset
Now you’re ready to animate the title. The easiest way to do that is to use one of the 
many animation presets that come with After Effects. After applying an animation 
preset, you can customize it and save it to use again in other projects.
1 Press the Home key or go to 0:00 to make sure the current-time indicator is at 
the beginning of the time ruler. After Effects applies animation presets from the 
current time.
2 Select the Road Trip text layer.

68 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Browsing animation presets
You already applied an animation preset in Lesson 2, “Creating a Basic Animation 
Using Effects and Presets.” But what if you’re not sure which animation preset you 
want to use? To help you choose the right animation preset for your projects, you 
can preview them in Adobe Bridge.
1 Choose Animation > Browse Presets. Adobe Bridge opens, displaying the 
contents of the After Effects Presets folder.
2 In the Content panel, double-click the Text folder, and then the Blurs folder. 
3 Click to select the first preset, Blur By Word. Adobe Bridge plays a sample of the 
animation in the Preview panel.
4 Select a few other presets, and watch them in the Preview panel.
5 Preview the Evaporate preset, and then double-click its thumbnail preview. 
Alternatively, you can right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the 
thumbnail and choose Place In After Effects. After Effects applies the preset  
to the selected layer, which is the Road Trip layer.
Nothing appears to change in the composition. This is because at 0:00, the first 
frame of the animation, the letters haven’t yet evaporated.
Previewing a range of frames
Now, preview the animation. Although the composition is 10 seconds long, you 
need to preview only the first few seconds, since that is where the text animation 
occurs.
1 In the Timeline panel, move the current-time indicator to 3:00, and press  
N to set the end bracket of the work area.
 Note: Leave Adobe 
Bridge open in the 
background. You’ll use it 
again later in the lesson. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 69
2 Press 0 on the numeric keypad, or click the RAM Preview button (
) in the 
Preview panel, to watch a RAM preview of the animation. The letters appear  
to evaporate into the background. It looks great—but you want the letters to 
fade in and remain onscreen, not disappear. So you will customize the preset  
to suit your needs.
3 Press the spacebar to stop the preview, and then press the Home key to move 
the current-time indicator back to 0:00.
Customizing an animation preset
After you apply an animation preset to a layer, all of its properties and keyframes 
are listed in the Timeline panel. You’ll use those properties to customize the preset.
1 Select the Road Trip text layer in the Timeline panel, and press U. The U key, 
sometimes referred to as the Überkey, is a valuable keyboard shortcut that 
reveals all the animated properties of a layer.
2 Click the Offset property name to select both of its keyframes. The Offset 
property specifies how much to offset the start and end of the selection.
3 Choose Animation > Keyframe Assistant > Time-Reverse Keyframes. This 
command switches the order of the two Offset keyframes so that the letters  
are invisible at the beginning of the composition, and then emerge into view.
4 Drag the current-time indicator from 0:00 to 3:00 to manually preview the 
edited animation. The letters now fade into rather than disappear from the 
composition.
E Tip: If you press 
U twice (UU), After 
Effects displays all 
modified properties 
for the layer, instead 
of only the animated 
properties. Press the U 
key again to hide all the 
layer’s properties.

70 
lesson 3 
Animating text
5 Press U to hide the layer’s properties.
6 Press the End key to move the current-time indicator to the end of the time ruler, 
and then press N to set the end bracket of the work area. 
7 Choose File > Save to save your project.
animating with scale keyframes
The text layer was scaled to more than 200% when you applied the Fit To Comp 
command to it earlier in this lesson. Now, you’ll animate the layer’s scale so that the 
type gradually shrinks down to its original size.
1 In the Timeline panel, move the current-time indicator to 3:00.
2 Select the Road Trip text layer, and press the S key to reveal its Scale property.
3 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) to add a Scale keyframe at the current time (3:00).
4 Move the current-time indicator to 5:00. 
5 Reduce the layer’s Scale values to 100, 100%. After Effects adds a new Scale 
keyframe at the current time.
Previewing the scale animation
Now you’ll preview the change.
1 Move the current-time indicator to 5:10, and press N to set the end of the work 
area. The scale animation ends shortly before 5:10.
2 Watch a RAM preview of the animation from 0:00 to 5:10. The movie title fades 
in and then scales to a smaller size.
E Tip: You can 
experiment with text 
scale animation presets 
that are included with 
After Effects. They’re 
located in the Presets/
Text/Scale folder in the 
After Effects CS6 folder 
on your hard drive.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 71
3 Press the spacebar to stop playback after you’ve viewed the animation.
adding easy ease
The beginning and end of the scale animation are rather abrupt. In nature,  
nothing comes to an absolute stop. Instead, objects ease into and out of starting 
and stopping points.
1 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the Scale keyframe at 3:00, 
and choose Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease Out. The keyframe becomes a left-
pointing icon.
2 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the Scale keyframe at 5:00, 
and choose Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease In. The keyframe becomes a right-
pointing icon.
3 Watch another RAM preview. Press the spacebar to stop it when you’re done.
4 Choose File > Save.
animating using parenting
The next task is to make it appear as if the virtual camera is zooming away from the 
composition. The text scale animation you just applied gets you halfway there, but 
you need to animate the scale of the compass as well. You could manually animate 
the compass layer, but it’s easier to take advantage of parenting relationships in 
After Effects.

72 
lesson 3 
Animating text
1 Press the Home key or drag the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 In the Timeline panel, click the Parent pop-up menu for the compass layer, 
and choose 1. Road Trip. This sets the Road Trip text layer as the parent of the 
compass layer, which in turn becomes the child layer.
As the child layer, the compass layer inherits the Scale keyframes of its parent 
layer (Road Trip). Not only is this a quick way to animate the compass, but it also 
ensures that the compass scales at the same rate and by the same amount as the 
text layer.
3 In the Timeline panel, move the compass layer above the Road Trip text layer.
4 Move the current-time indicator to 9:29, so you can clearly see the compasss in 
the Composition panel.
5 In the Composition panel, drag the compass so that its anchor point is over the 
dot in the letter i in the word Trip. Alternatively, you can select the compass 
layer in the Timeline panel and press P to reveal its Position property. Then  
enter 122, -60.
 Note: When you 
move the compass 
layer, its parent 
becomes 2. Road Trip 
because Road Trip is 
now the second layer. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 73
6 Move the current-time indicator from 3:00 to 5:00 to manually preview the 
scaling. Both the text and the compass scale down in size, so that it appears that 
the camera is moving away from the scene.
7 Press the Home key to return to 0:00, and drag the work area end bracket to the 
end of the time ruler.
8 Select the Road Trip layer in the Timeline panel, and press S to hide its Scale 
property. If you entered Position values for the compass, select the compass 
layer, and press P to hide the Position property, too. Then choose File > Save.

Parenting assigns one layer’s transformations to another layer, called a child layer. 
Creating a parenting relationship between layers synchronizes the changes in the 
parent layer with the corresponding transformation values of the child layers, except 
opacity. For example, if a parent layer moves 5 pixels to the right of its starting 
position, then the child layer also moves 5 pixels to the right of its starting position. 
A layer can have only one parent, but a layer can be a parent to any number of 2D 
or 3D layers within the same composition. Parenting layers is useful for creating 
complex animations such as linking the movements of a marionette or depicting 
the orbits of planets in the solar system.
For more on parent and child layers, see After Effects Help.
animating imported Photoshop text
If all text animations involved just two short words, such as Road Trip, life would 
be easy. But in the real world, you may often have to work with longer blocks of 
text, and they can be tedious to enter manually. Fortunately, After Effects lets you 
import text from Photoshop or Illustrator. You can preserve text layers, edit them, 
and animate them in After Effects. 

74 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Importing text
Some of the remaining text for this composition is in a layered Photoshop file, 
which you’ll import now.
1 Double-click an empty area in the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Select the credits.psd file in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson03/Assets folder. 
Choose Composition – Retain Layer Sizes from the Import As menu, and then 
click Open.
3 In the Credits.psd dialog box, select Editable Layer Styles, and click OK.
After Effects can import Photoshop layer styles, retaining the appearance of the 
layers you’re importing. The imported file is added as a composition to the Project 
panel; its layers are added in a separate folder.
4 Drag the credits composition from the Project panel into the Timeline panel, 
placing it at the top of the layer stack.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 75
Because you imported the credits.psd file as a composition with layers intact, 
you can work on it in its own Timeline panel, editing and animating its layers 
independently.
editing imported text
The text you imported isn’t currently editable in After Effects. You’ll change that  
so that you can control the type and apply animations. And if you have a sharp eye, 
you’ve noticed some typos in the imported text. So, first you’ll clean up the type.
1 Double-click the credits composition in the Project panel to open it in its own 
Timeline panel.
2 Shift-click to select both layers in the credits Timeline panel, and choose Layer > 
Convert To Editable Text. (Click OK if you see a warning about missing fonts.) 
Now the text layers can be edited, and you can fix the typos.
3 Deselect both layers, and then double-click layer 2 in the Timeline panel to 
select the text and automatically switch to the Horizontal Type tool ( ).
4 Type an e between the t and d in the word animated. Then change the k to a c in
documentary. 
5 Switch to the Selection tool ( ) to exit text-editing mode. 
6 Shift-click to select both layers in the Timeline panel. 
7 If the Character panel isn’t open, choose Window > Character to open it.
 Note: The layer 
name does not change 
in the Timeline panel 
when you correct the 
spelling in the layer. This 
is because the original 
layer name was created 
in Photoshop. To 
change a layer’s name, 
select it in the Timeline 
panel, press Enter or 
Return, type the new 
name, and press Enter 
or Return again.

76 
lesson 3 
Animating text
8 Choose the same typeface you used for the words Road Trip. (We used Myriad 
Pro.) Leave all other settings as they are.
9 Click an empty area of the Timeline panel to deselect both layers. Then select 
layer 2 again.
10 In the Character panel, click the Fill Color box. Then, in the Text Color dialog 
box, select a shade of green. We used R=66, G=82, B=42.
animating the subtitle
You want the letters of the subtitle—an animated documentary—to fade onscreen 
from left to right under the movie title. The easiest way to do this is to use another 
text animation preset.
1 Go to 5:00 in the timeline. At that point, the title and the compass have finished 
scaling to their final size.
2 Select the subtitle layer (layer 2) in the Timeline panel.
3 Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O (Windows) or Command+Option+Shift+O (Mac OS) 
to jump to Adobe Bridge. 
4 Navigate to the Presets/Text/Animate In folder.
5 Select the Fade Up Characters animation preset, and watch it in the Preview 
panel. This effect works well to reveal the text gradually.
6 Double-click the Fade Up Characters preset to apply it to the subtitle layer in  
After Effects.
7 With the subtitle layer selected in the Timeline panel, press UU to see the 
properties modified by the animation preset. You should see two keyframes for 
Range Selector 1 Start: one at 5:00, and one at 7:00. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 77
You still have a lot of animation to do in this composition, so you will speed up the 
effect by 1 second.
8 Go to 6:00, and then drag the second Range Selector 1 Start keyframe to 6:00.
9 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler between 5:00 and 6:00  
to see the letters fade in.
10  When you’re done, select the subtitle layer, and press U to hide the modified 
properties. Then choose File > Save to save your work.
animating text using a path animation preset
You’ve seen how versatile and convenient text animation presets can be. You’ll 
use another type of text animation preset to animate the words directed by along 
a motion path. After Effects includes several animation presets that animate text 
along a prebuilt path. These presets also provide placeholder text when you apply 
them, so in this exercise, you will enter and format your text after you apply the 
animation preset. 
1 Select the Road_Trip_Title_Sequence tab in the Timeline panel.
2 Deselect all layers, and then go to 5:00.
3 Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O (Windows) or Command+Option+Shift+O (Mac OS) 
to jump to Adobe Bridge. 
4 Navigate to the Presets/Text/Paths folder. 
5 Double-click the Pipes animation preset. Adobe Bridge returns you to  
After Effects, where the preset automatically creates a new layer, pipes, with  
a predefined path that zigzags across the composition. The text on the path  
is obscured by the movie title. You’ll fix that soon.

78 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Customizing the preset path
First, you need to change the placeholder word pipes to directed by. Then you’ll 
adjust the path itself.
1 In the Timeline panel, go to 6:05, when the word pipes is visible—and 
horizontal—onscreen.
2 Double-click the pipes layer in the Timeline panel. After Effects switches to the 
Horizontal Type tool ( ) and selects the word pipes in the Composition panel. 
3 Type directed by to replace the word pipes. Press Enter on the numeric keypad 
or select the layer name when you’re done. After Effects updates the Timeline 
panel with the new layer name.
4 In the Character panel, do the following:
• Set the Font Family to Minion Pro or another serif typeface. 
• Set the Font Style to Regular.
• Set the Font Size to 20 pixels.
• Leave all other settings at their defaults.
5 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler between 5:00 and 8:00 to 
see how the words directed by move onscreen—and then offscreen. You’ll fix the 
text so that it stays onscreen, but now is a good time to adjust the position of 
the path in the composition so that it doesn’t interfere with the movie title.
6 Using the Selection tool ( ), double-click the yellow motion path in the 
Composition panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 79
7 Drag the path down and slightly to the left, until the words Road Trip are 
centered in the top curve and Your Name Here is within the lower curve. You 
may find it easiest to use the arrow keys.
8 Press Enter or Return to accept the change.
Later in the lesson, you’ll attach a car graphic to the path so it appears to be pulling 
the text. But first, you’ll finish animating the credits.
9 Select the directed by layer in the Timeline panel, and hide its properties. Then 
choose File > Save to save your work.
animating type tracking
Next, you’ll animate the appearance of the director’s name in the composition 
using a text animation tracking preset. By animating tracking, you can make words 
appear to expand outward as they appear onscreen from a central point. 
Customizing placeholder text
Currently, the director’s name is simply a layer with placeholder text—Your Name 
Here. Before you animate it, change it to your own name. 
1 Switch to the credits timeline in the Timeline panel, and select the Your Name 
Here layer.
2 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ), and  
then replace Your Name Here in the  
Composition panel with your own name.  
Use a first, middle, and last name so that  
you have a nice long string of text to  
animate. Click the layer name when  
you’re done. 
 Note: It doesn’t 
matter where the 
current-time indicator 
is located when you 
edit the text of this 
layer. Currently, the 
text is onscreen for 
the duration of the 
composition. That 
will change once you 
animate it.
 Note: Again, the 
layer name doesn’t 
change, because it was 
named in Photoshop.

80 
lesson 3 
Animating text
applying a tracking preset
Now you will animate the director’s name with a tracking preset so that it starts 
to appear onscreen shortly after the words directed by reach the center of the 
composition.
1 Go to 7:10.
2 Select the Your Name Here layer in the Timeline panel.
3 Jump to Adobe Bridge, and go to the Presets/Text/Tracking folder. Double- 
click the Increase Tracking preset to apply it to the Your Name Here layer  
in After Effects.
4 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler between 7:10 and 9:10  
to manually preview the tracking animation. 
Customizing the tracking animation preset
The text expands, but you want the letters to be so close initially that they’re on 
top of each other, and then to expand to a reasonable, readable distance apart. The 
animation should also occur faster. You’ll adjust the Tracking Amount to achieve 
both goals.
1 Select the Your Name Here layer in the Timeline panel, and press UU to reveal 
the properties that were modified.
2 Go to 7:10.
3 Under Animator 1, change the Tracking Amount to -5 so that the letters are 
squeezed together. 
4 Click the Go To Next Keyframe arrow ( ) for the Tracking Amount property, 
and then change the value to 0.
E Tip: If you’re tired 
of jumping to Adobe 
Bridge and don’t care 
to preview the preset, 
simply type Increase 
Tracking in the search 
box of the Effects & 
Presets panel. Then 
double-click the effect 
to apply it to the 
selected layer in the 
Timeline panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 81
5 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler between 7:10 and 8:10.  
The letters expand as they appear onscreen, and stop animating at the last 
keyframe.
animating text opacity
You’ll take the animation of the director’s name a little further by having it fade 
onscreen as the letters expand. To do this, you’ll animate the layer’s Opacity 
property.
1 Select the Your Name Here layer in the credits timeline.
2 Press T to reveal only the layer’s Opacity property.
3 Go to 7:10, and set the Opacity to 0%. Then click the stopwatch icon ( ) to set 
an Opacity keyframe.
4 Go to 7:20, and set the Opacity to 100%. After Effects adds a second keyframe. 
Now the letters of the director’s name should fade in as they expand onscreen.
5 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler between 7:10 and 8:10  
to see the letters of the director’s name fade in as they spread out.
6 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the ending Opacity keyframe, 
and choose Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease In.
7 Choose File > Save.

82 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Using a text animator group
Text animator groups let you animate individual letters within a block of text in 
a layer. You’ll use a text animator group to animate only the characters in your 
middle name without affecting the tracking and opacity animation of the other 
names in the layer.
1 In the Timeline panel, go to 8:10.
2 Hide the Opacity property for the Your Name Here layer. Then expand the layer 
to see its Text property group name.
about text animator groups
A text animator group includes one or more selectors and one or more animator 
properties. A selector is like a mask—it specifies which characters or section of a text 
layer you want an animator property to affect. Using a selector, you can define a 
percentage of the text, specific characters in the text, or a specific range of text. 
Using a combination of animator properties and selectors, you can create complex 
text animations that would otherwise require painstaking keyframing. Most text ani-
mations require you to animate only the selector values—not the property values. 
Consequently, text animators use a small number of keyframes even for complex 
animations. 
For more about text animator groups, see After Effects Help.
3 Next to the Text property name, click the Animate pop-up menu, and  
choose Skew. A property group named Animator 2 appears in the layer’s  
Text properties.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 83
4 Select Animator 2, press Enter or Return, and rename it Skew Animator. Then 
press Enter or Return again to accept the new name.
Now you’re ready to define the range of letters that you want to skew.
5 Expand the Skew Animator’s Range Selector 1 properties. Each animator group 
includes a default range selector. Range selectors constrain the animation 
to particular letters in the text layer. You can add additional selectors to an 
animator group, or apply multiple animator properties to the same range 
selector.
6 While watching the Composition panel, drag the Skew Animator’s Range 
Selector 1 Start value up (to the right) until the left selector indicator ( ) is just 
before the first letter of your middle name (the B in Bender, in this example). 
7 Drag the Skew Animator’s Range Selector 1 End value down (to the left) until  
its indicator ( ) is just after the last letter of your middle name (the r in Bender, 
in this example) in the Composition panel. 
Now, any properties that you animate with the Skew Animator will affect only the 
middle name that you selected.

84 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Skewing the range of text
Now, make that middle name shake and shimmy by setting Skew keyframes. 
1 Drag the Skew Animator’s Skew value left and right, and notice that only the 
middle name sways. The other names in the line of text remain steady.
2 Set the Skew Animator’s Skew value to 0.
3 Go to 8:05, and click the stopwatch icon ( ) for Skew to add a keyframe to  
the property.
4 Go to 8:08, and set the Skew value to 50. After Effects adds a keyframe.
5 Go to 8:15, and change the Skew value to -50. After Effects adds another 
keyframe.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 85
6 Go to 8:20, and change the Skew value to 0 to set the final keyframe.
7 Click the Skew property name to select all of the Skew keyframes. Then choose 
Animation > Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease. This adds an Easy Ease to all 
keyframes.
8 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler from 7:10 to 8:20 to see 
how the director’s name fades in and expands onscreen, and the middle name 
rocks side to side while the other names are unaffected. 
9 Hide the properties for the Your Name Here layer in the Timeline panel.
10 Select the Road_Trip_Title_Sequence tab to open its timeline.
11 Press End, or move the current-time indicator to 9:29. Then press N to set the 
end bracket for the work area at the end of the composition.
12 Press Home, or go to 0:00, and then play a RAM preview of the entire 
composition.
13 Press the spacebar to stop playback, and then choose File > Save to save  
your work.
Cleaning up the path animation
Currently, the words directed by fade in and out as they wind along the Pipes path 
preset. You’ll modify the text properties so that the words are opaque for the entire 
animation and come to rest just above your name.
1 With the directed by layer selected in the Timeline panel, press U to display the 
animated properties for the layer.
E Tip: To quickly 
remove all text 
animators from a 
text layer, select the 
layer in the Timeline 
panel, and choose 
Animation > Remove 
All Text Animators. 
To remove only one 
animator, select its 
name in the Timeline 
panel, and press Delete.

86 
lesson 3 
Animating text
2 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) for the Range Selector 1 Offset property to delete 
all of its keyframes.
3 Depending on where the current-time indicator is located in the time ruler, the 
resulting value for Range Selector 1 Offset may or may not be set to 0%. Set it  
to 0% if it is not. Now, directed by will be visible throughout the composition.
Next, you’ll modify the First Margin property to make the text stop animating 
above your name.
4 Select and delete the last keyframe for the First Margin property in the Timeline 
panel. Because the middle keyframe (now the last keyframe) is set to Easy Ease, 
the words directed by come gently to rest above your name.
5 Go to 6:14, and change the First Margin value to 685.
You also need to adjust the path shape so that it starts and ends off the screen.
6 Using the Selection tool ( ) in the Composition panel, Shift-drag the control 
point at the top of the S-shaped curve to the right and off the screen. Drag it  
well off the screen so the car won’t be visible.
7 Click the control point at the end of the S-shaped curve, and Shift-drag the 
control point off the left side of the screen, so that the car won’t be visible.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 87
8 Preview the animation from about 5:00 to 9:00 to see the corrected path. 
9 If the text doesn’t stop directly above your name, adjust the First Margin value 
of the final keyframe.
10 Hide the properties for the directed by layer in the Timeline panel, and then 
choose File > Save.
animating a nontext layer 
along a motion path
To cap off this project, you’ll use a mask from a text layer to animate a nontext 
layer. Specifically, you’ll use the mask shape for the directed by path to create a 
motion path for a car graphic so that it appears to be pulling the text. First, you’ll 
import the car graphic and add it to your composition.
1 Double-click an empty area in the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box. 
2 In the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson03/Assets folder, select the car.ai file, choose 
Composition – Retain Layer Sizes from the Import As menu, and then  
click Open.
3 Drag the car composition from the Project panel to the top of the layer stack  
in the Road_Trip_Title_Sequence Timeline panel.
 Note: Depending 
on how far you move 
the beginning and 
ending control points 
of the path, you may 
need to change the First 
Margin value again to 
reposition the text. 

88 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Copying the mask shape
Now you’re ready to copy the mask shape from the path of the directed by layer  
to the car layer.
d
1 Go to 5:00.
2 Select the directed by layer in the Timeline panel, and press M to display its 
Mask Path property.
3 Click the Mask Path property to select it, and then choose Edit > Copy.
4 Select the car layer, and then press P to display its Position property.
5 Click the Position property name to select it, and then choose Edit > Paste. 
After Effects copies the Position keyframes from the directed by layer to the car 
layer. 
Orienting the object
Unfortunately, the car is flying backward, but that’s easy to fix. 
1 With the car layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Layer > Transform > 
Auto-Orient. 
2 In the Auto-Orientation dialog box, select Orient Along Path, and then  
click OK. 
Now the car is facing forward as it flies. 
3 Select the car layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to hide its Position 
property.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 89
Coordinating the text and object timing
Next, you need to coordinate the timing of the car’s motion with the words directed 
by so that the words correctly trail behind the car.
1 Select the directed by layer, and press U to display its Path Options in the 
Timeline panel.
2 Go to 5:18, and change the First Margin value to 373. After Effects adds a keyframe, 
and the text moves behind the car.
3 Go to 5:25, and change the First Margin value to 559.
4 Go to 4:24, and drag the first First Margin keyframe (the left-pointing arrow) to 
that position.
5 Manually preview the corrected path animation by dragging the current-time 
indicator across the time ruler from about 4:20 to 7:10. The words follow the car 
and come to rest above your name, while the car continues to fly along the path 
and off the screen.
6 Hide the properties for the directed by layer, and then press the Home key  
or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the time ruler.
adding motion blur
Motion blur is the blur that occurs as an object moves. You’ll apply motion blur  
to finesse the composition and make the movement look more natural.
1 In the Timeline panel, click the Motion Blur switch ( ) for each layer except the 
background_movie and credits layers.

90 
lesson 3 
Animating text
Now, apply motion blur to the layers in the credits composition.
2 Switch to the credits Timeline panel, and enable motion blur for both layers.
3 Switch back to the Road_Trip_Title_Sequence Timeline panel, and select the 
Motion Blur switch for the credits layer. Then click the Enable Motion Blur  
button ( ) at the top of the Timeline panel so that you can see the motion  
blur in the Composition panel.
4 View a RAM preview of the entire, completed animation.
5 Choose File > Save.
Give yourself a pat on the back. You just completed some hard-core text animations. 
If you’d like to export the composition as a movie file, see Lesson 14, “Rendering and 
Outputting,” for instructions.

review questions
1 What are some similarities and differences between text layers and other types  
of layers in After Effects?
2 How can you preview a text animation preset?
3 How can you assign one layer’s transformations to another layer?
4 What are text animator groups?
review answers
1 In many ways, text layers are just like any other layer in After Effects. You can apply 
effects and expressions to text layers, animate them, designate them as 3D layers, and 
edit the 3D text while viewing it in multiple views. However, text layers are like shape 
layers in that you can’t open them in their own Layer panels, and in that they are 
synthetic layers that consist entirely of vector graphics. You can animate the text  
in a text layer using special text animator properties and selectors.
2 You can preview text animation presets in Adobe Bridge by choosing Animation > 
Browse Presets. Adobe Bridge opens and displays the contents of the After Effects 
Presets folder. Navigate to folders containing categories of text animation presets, such 
as Blurs or Paths, and watch samples in the Preview panel. Then double-click a preset 
to add it to the currently selected layer in the After Effects Timeline panel.
3 You can use parenting relationships in After Effects to assign one layer’s 
transformations to another layer (except opacity transformations). When a layer is 
made a parent to another layer, the other layer is called the child layer. Creating a 
parenting relationship between layers synchronizes the changes in the parent layer 
with corresponding transformation values of the child layers.
4 Text animator groups enable you to animate the properties of individual characters in 
a text layer over time. Text animator groups contain one or more selectors, which are 
like masks: They let you specify which characters or section of a text layer you want an 
animator property to affect. Using a selector, you can define a percentage of the text, 
specific characters in the text, or a specific range of text.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Create custom shapes.
• Customize a shape’s fill and stroke.
• Use path operations to transform shapes.
• Animate shapes.
• Repeat shapes. 
• Explore design options with the Brainstorm feature.
• Add a Cartoon effect to a video layer for a distinctive look.
This lesson will take approximately an hour to complete. Copy the 
Lesson04 folder into the Lessons folder that you created on your hard 
drive for these projects (or create it now), if you haven’t already done 
so. As you work on this lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need 
to restore the start files, copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 
Classroom in a Book DVD.

Shape layers make it easy to create expressive 
backgrounds and intriguing results. You can animate 
shapes, apply animation presets, and add Repeaters 
to intensify their impact.

94 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
Getting started
Shape layers are created automatically when you draw a shape with any of the draw-
ing tools. You can customize and transform an individual shape or its entire layer to 
create interesting results. In this lesson, you will use shape layers to build a dynamic 
background for the introduction of a reality series called DJ Quad Master. You’ll 
also use the Cartoon effect to change the overall look of the video. This effect can 
be memory-intensive. You may choose to skip the Cartoon effect exercise; if you do, 
you’ll be able to finish the project, but it won’t match the sample movie. 
First, you’ll preview the final movie and set up the project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson04 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: DJ.mov, gc_adobe_dj.mp3
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson04.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson04.mov sample movie to see what you will create  
in this lesson. When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete this 
sample movie from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
As you start After Effects, restore the default application settings. See “Restoring 
default preferences” on page 2. 
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file.
4 Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a blank, untitled project.
5 Choose File > Save As > Save As, and then navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/
Lesson04/Finished_Project folder.
6 Name the project Lesson04_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
Creating the composition
Next, you’ll import the files you need and create the composition.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 95
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson04/Assets folder on your hard disk, 
Shift-click to select the DJ.mov and gc_adobe_dj.mp3 files, and then click Open.
3 Choose File > New > New Folder  
to create a new folder in the  
Project panel.  
4 Name the folder Assets, press 
Enter or Return to accept the 
name, and then drag the footage 
items you imported into the  
Assets folder. 
5 Press Ctrl+N (Windows) or Command+N (Mac OS) to create a new 
composition.
6 In the Composition Settings dialog box, name the composition Shapes 
Background, select the NTSC DV preset, and set the Duration to 10:00. Then 
click OK.
After Effects opens the new composition in the Timeline and Composition panels.
E Tip: To specify 10 
seconds, type 10. in 
the Duration box. The 
period indicates that 
there are no units in 
that position. To specify 
10 minutes, type 10.. in 
the box.

96 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
adding a shape layer
One advantage of using a shape layer, rather than a solid layer, is that you can use 
the Fill option to create a linear or radial gradient. You’ll use the Rectangle tool to 
create a gradient background for the composition.
about shapes
After Effects includes five shape tools: Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, 
Polygon, and Star. When you draw a shape directly in the Composition panel, After 
Effects adds a new shape layer to the composition. You can apply stroke and fill set-
tings to a shape, modify its path, and apply animation presets. Shape attributes are 
all represented in the Timeline panel, and you can animate each setting over time.
The same drawing tools can create both shapes and masks. Masks are applied to 
layers to hide or reveal areas of an image, while shapes have their own layers. When 
you select a drawing tool, you can specify whether the tool draws a shape or a mask.
Drawing a shape
You’ll begin by drawing the rectangle that will contain the gradient fill.
1 Select the Rectangle tool ( ).
2 Choose 50% from the Magnification Ratio pop-up menu at the bottom of the 
Composition panel so that you can see the entire composition.
3 Click just outside the upper left corner of the composition, and drag the tool to 
the area just outside the bottom right corner, so that a rectangle covers the entire 
composition.

The shape appears in the Composition panel, and After Effects adds a shape layer 
named Shape Layer 1 to the Timeline panel.
applying a gradient fill
You can change the color of a shape by modifying its Fill settings in the Tools panel. 
Clicking the word Fill opens the Fill Options dialog box, where you can select the 
kind of fill, its blending mode, and its opacity. Clicking the Fill Color box opens the 
Adobe Color Picker if the fill is solid, or the Gradient Editor if the fill is a gradient.
1 Click the word Fill to open the Fill Options dialog box.
2 Select the Radial Gradient option ( ), and click OK.
3 Click the Fill Color box (next to the word Fill) to open the Gradient Editor. 
4 Select the white color stop (the left color stop below the gradient ramp), and 
select a light blue color. (We used R=100, G=185, B=240.)
5 Select the black color stop (the right color stop below the gradient ramp), and 
select a dark blue color. (We used R=10, G=25, B=150.)
6 Click OK to apply the new gradient colors.

lesson 4 Working with shape layers
modifying gradient settings
The gradient is a little small, and it falls off quickly. You’ll adjust the settings for the 
shape layer to expand the gradient.
1 In the Timeline panel, expand Shape Layer 1 > Contents > Rectangle 1 > 
Gradient Fill 1, if it isn’t already visible.
2 Change the Start Point to 0, 225, and the End Point to 0, 740. 
Now the gradient originates at the bottom of the screen and falls off near the top 
and edges of the composition.
3 Hide the Shape Layer 1 properties.
4 Select the layer name (Shape Layer 1), press Enter or Return, and type 
Background. Press Enter or Return to accept the new layer name.
5 Click the Lock column ( ) for the Background layer so that  
you don’t accidentally select it.
Creating custom shapes
Though there are only five shape tools, you can modify the paths you draw to create 
a wide variety of shapes. The Polygon tool, in particular, gives you great flexibility. 
You’ll use it to create rotating sun shapes in the background.
Drawing a polygon
By default, the Polygon tool draws a shape using the settings of the last shape 
drawn with that tool. However, by adjusting the points, position, rotation, outer 
radius, outer roundness, and other values, you can dramatically alter the initial 
shape. You’ll modify a simple polygon to create a much more interesting shape.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 99
1 Select the Polygon tool ( ), which is hidden behind the Rectangle tool ( ). 
2 Drag a polygon shape in the Composition panel. 
3 In the Timeline panel, expand Shape Layer 1 > Polystar 1 > Polystar Path 1.
4 Change the Points to 6, the Rotation to 0 degrees, and the Outer Radius to 150.
5 Change the Outer Roundness to -500%. 
6 Hide the Polystar Path 1 properties.
7 Click the word Fill in the Tools panel to open the Fill Options dialog box. Select 
the Solid Color icon (
), and then click OK.
E Tip: While you’re 
dragging the shape,  
you can press the 
spacebar to reposition 
the shape in the 
Composition panel. 
E Tip: You can change 
settings to values below 
0 and above 100% for 
more dramatic results.

lesson 4 Working with shape layers
8 Click the Fill Color box, and select a bright yellow. (We used R= 250, G=250, 
B=0.) Click OK.
9 Click the Stroke Color box, and select a bright gray. (We used R=230, G=230, 
B=230.) Click OK.
10  Change the Stroke Width in the Tools panel to 5 pixels to emphasize the stroke.
twisting a shape
The Twist path operation rotates a path more sharply in the center than at the 
edges. Positive values twist clockwise; negative values twist counterclockwise. You’ll 
use the Twist path operation to give the shape a little more definition. 
1 In the Timeline panel, open the Add pop-up menu next to Contents in the 
Shape Layer 1 layer, and choose Twist.
2 Expand Twist 1.
3 Change the Angle to 160.
4 Hide the Polystar 1 properties.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 101
repeating a shape
You’ve created the basic shape that you want to use in the background, but you  
need many more copies of it to fill the composition. You could duplicate the shape 
manually, but instead, you’ll use the Repeater path operation to create multiple 
rows of suns.
1 Select Shape Layer 1. You’re selecting the layer because you want to add the 
Repeater to the entire shape group, not just an individual shape.
2 Open the Add pop-up menu, and then choose Repeater. 
3 Expand Repeater 1.
4 Change the number of copies to 5. 
The Repeater creates four copies of the shape, overlapping each other. You’ll sepa-
rate them next.
5 Expand Transform: Repeater 1. 
6 Change the Position to 345,0. The first value represents the x axis. To move the 
shapes closer together, use a smaller value for the x axis; to move them farther 
apart, use a larger value.
Now the shapes are farther apart. But you can’t see them all at the same time.  
To move all of the shapes, you need to move the entire shape layer.
7 Hide the Transform: Repeater 1 properties.
8 Select Shape Layer 1, and then press P to display the Position property for the 
layer. Change the Position to -50, 65. 
 Note: There are 
multiple Transform 
properties in the 
Timeline panel, 
applying to different 
path operators. Make 
sure you’re selecting the 
appropriate Transform 
property for the object 
or layer you want to 
affect. In this case, you 
want to affect only 
the Repeater.

102 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
The shape layer is now in the upper left corner of the composition. You’ll scale the 
layer and then add more rows.
9 Select Shape Layer 1, and then press S to display the Scale property for the layer. 
Change the Scale value to 50%. 
10  Press S to hide the Scale property for the layer.
11  Expand Shape Layer 1 > Contents.
12  Select Shape Layer 1, and then choose Repeater from the Add pop-up menu.
13  Expand Repeater 2 > Transform: Repeater 2.
14  Change the Position to 0, 385 so that there is vertical space between the rows.
15  Hide the Repeater 2 properties.
rotating shapes
The suns should rotate on the background. You’ll animate the Rotation property for 
the original shape; changes will automatically apply to the duplicated shapes. 
1 In the Timeline panel, expand Shape Layer 1 > Contents > Polystar 1 > 
Transform: Polystar 1.
2 Press the Home key, or drag the current-time indicator to the beginning  
of the timeline.
 Note: Because the 
horizontal and vertical 
values are linked, both 
values change when 
you change one.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 103
3 Click the stopwatch ( ) next to the Rotation property to create an initial 
keyframe for the layer.
4 Press the End key, or drag the current-time indicator to the end of the timeline.
5 Change the Rotation to 3x+0 degrees. This setting causes the shape to rotate 
three times in 10 seconds.
6 Hide the properties for Shape Layer 1.
7 Drag the current-time indicator across the timeline to preview the rotation.
Blending shapes with the background
The rotating suns look good, but they contrast with the background too much. You 
want the character in the main video file to be the focus of attention. You’ll change 
the blending mode and opacity for the shape layer to make the background more 
subtle.
1 Click Toggle Switches/Modes at the bottom of the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Overlay from the Mode pop-up menu for the Shape Layer 1 layer.

104 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
3 Select Shape Layer 1, and then press T to display the Opacity property for  
the layer.
4 Change the Opacity value to 25%.
5 Press T to hide the Opacity property.
6 Select Shape Layer 1, press Enter or Return, and type Suns for the layer name. 
Press Enter or Return again to accept the new name.
7 Lock the layer to prevent accidental changes to it.
Creating stars
The Star tool is similar to the Polygon tool. A polygon is simply a star without an 
Inner Radius or Inner Roundness property; both tools create shapes called poly-
stars. You’ll use the Star tool to draw a star for the background, and then use the 
Pucker & Bloat operation to change the star’s shape. Then you’ll duplicate the star 
and rotate the stars around the layer’s anchor point.
Drawing a star
The Star tool is grouped with the other shape tools. To draw a star, drag the Star 
tool in the Composition panel.
1 Select the Star tool ( ), which is hidden beneath the Polygon tool ( ).
2 Change the fill and stroke settings for the shape before you draw the star:
• Click the Fill Color box, and select a medium blue. (We used R=75, G=120, 
B=200.) Then click OK.
• Click the word Stroke, and click None (
) in the Stroke Options dialog box. 
Click OK.
3 Draw a star near the center of the composition. After Effects adds a shape layer 
named Shape Layer 1 to the Timeline panel. 
4 In the Timeline panel, expand Shape Layer 1 > Contents > Polystar 1 > Polystar 
Path 1.
 Note: Instead of 
changing the opacity 
for the entire layer, 
you could change the 
opacity for the original 
shape. The value 
would apply to all the 
duplicates as well.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 105
5 Change the Points to 6 and the Rotation to 150 degrees.
6 Change the Inner Radius to 50 and the Outer Radius to 90. The radius values 
change the shape of the star.
7 Expand the Transform: Polystar 1 properties.
8 Change the Position to -180, -70.
9 Collapse the Polystar 1 properties to hide them.
applying Pucker & Bloat
After Effects includes a powerful path operation called Pucker & Bloat. You can 
pucker a shape by pulling the path’s vertices outward while curving segments 
inward, or bloat a shape by pulling the vertices inward while curving segments 
outward. Negative values pucker a shape; positive values bloat it. You’ll pucker the 
star to give it a distinctive look.
1 Select Shape Layer 1.
2 Choose Pucker & Bloat from the Add pop-up menu. 
3 Expand Pucker & Bloat 1. 
4 Change the Amount to -125 to pucker the star.
This star shape will go well in the background. Now you can duplicate and  
animate it.
 Note: If you have 
trouble seeing the 
star in front of the 
background, you can 
temporarily hide the 
Suns and Background 
layers by clicking the 
video switches (eye 
icons) for the layers in 
the Timeline panel. 

106 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
Duplicating shapes
You want to have multiple stars in slightly different sizes rotating around the 
screen. You’ll use the Repeater path operation again, but this time you’ll modify the 
Transform properties for the Repeater to get different results. 
1 Select Shape Layer 1, and choose Repeater from the Add pop-up menu.
2 Expand Repeater 1, and change the number of copies to 6.
Now there are six stars on the screen.
3 Expand Transform: Repeater 1. 
4 Change the Position to 0, 0, and the Rotation to 230 degrees.
Because you applied the rotation to the Repeater, rather than the shape, each star 
rotated around the layer’s anchor point to a different degree. When you change 
the Transform properties for the Repeater, the change is multiplied by the number 
of copies created. For example, if there are 10 copies of a shape and you change 
the Rotation value to 10 degrees, the first shape retains the original value of 0, the 
second shape rotates 10 degrees, the third shape rotates 20 degrees, and so on. The 
same concept applies to each of the Transform properties.
In this project, the anchor point for the layer differs from the position of the 
shapes, so the chain of stars begins to wrap in on itself. 
5 Change the End Opacity to 65%. Each star is more transparent than the one  
before it.
6 Hide the Repeater 1 properties.
7 Select the Shape Layer 1 layer, and choose Repeater from the Add pop-up menu 
again to add another Repeater.
8 Expand Repeater 2 > Transform: Repeater 2.
9 Change the Position to -140, 0 and the Rotation to 40 degrees.
10  Change the Scale to 80%.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 107
Each duplicate star will be smaller than the one before it. Because there are three 
duplicates of the first group of stars, some will be 64% the size of the original.
11  Change the End Opacity to 0%.
12  Collapse the Repeater 2 properties to hide them.
13 Choose File > Save.
rotating shapes
You’ve rotated the stars around the anchor point for the layer. Now you want to 
animate each star to rotate around its own axis. To achieve this, you’ll animate the 
Rotation property for the polystar shape itself, not the layer or the Repeater.
1 Expand Polystar 1 > Transform: Polystar 1. 
2 Press the Home key, or drag the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
timeline.
3 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) for the Rotation property to create an initial 
keyframe.
4 Press the End key, or drag the current-time indicator to the end of the timeline.
5 Change the Rotation to 180 degrees.

108 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
6 Manually preview the composition by dragging the current-time indicator along 
the timeline. After you confirm that everything is rotating, collapse the layer.
7 Rename the Shape Layer 1 layer Stars, and press Enter or Return to accept the 
layer name.
8 Lock the Stars layer.
Incorporating video and audio layers
The background is in place. Now you can add the video of the DJ and the audio 
track that accompanies it.
adding audio and video files
You imported files at the beginning of the lesson. Now you’ll add them to the 
composition. The DJ.mov clip has no background and was rendered with a premul-
tiplied alpha channel, so the underlying layers are visible. 
1 Press the Home key, or drag the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
composition.
2 Open the Assets folder in the Project panel.
3 Drag the DJ.mov footage item to the Timeline panel, placing it above the  
other layers.
4 Drag the gc_adobe_dj.mp3 item from the Project panel to the Timeline panel, 
placing it beneath the other layers.
5 Lock the audio layer that you just added to the Timeline panel so that you can’t 
accidentally select and move it later. Then choose File > Save.
 Note: You can place 
an audio layer any- 
where in the layer stack, 
but moving it to the 
bottom keeps it out of 
the way while you work.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 109
trimming the work area
The DJ.mov clip is only 5 seconds long, but the composition is 10 seconds. If you 
rendered this movie now, the DJ would disappear halfway through the movie. To 
fix the problem, you’ll move the work area end point to the 5-second mark. Then 
only the first 5 seconds will render.
1 Move the current-time indicator to the 5-second mark. You can drag the 
current-time indicator in the Timeline panel, or click the Current Time box and 
then type 500. 
2 Press N to move the work area end point to the current time.
applying a Cartoon effect
After Effects includes a Cartoon effect, which makes it easy to create a stylized look 
for your video. Since this intro for the DJ Quad Master reality series is very different 
from other reality series, the Cartoon effect will work perfectly here. 
1 Select the DJ.mov layer in the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Effect > Stylize > Cartoon.
The Cartoon effect performs three opera-
tions on a layer. First, it smooths the layer, 
removing a great deal of detail. Therefore, 
it works best on video footage rather than a 
graphic layer, such as the background in this 
project. Next, the Cartoon effect emphasizes 
the edges of shapes, based on their bright-
ness values. Finally, it simplifies the color  
in the layer. 
The default settings do a pretty good job, but you’ll fine-tune them in the Effect 
Controls panel. 
 Note: Alternatively, 
if you do not want 
to keep the last 
five seconds of the 
composition, you can 
change the duration 
of the composition to 
5 seconds. To do so, 
choose Composition > 
Composition Settings, 
and then type 5.00 in 
the Duration box.
E Tip: For interesting 
results, try changing the 
Cartoon Render options 
from Fill & Edges to Fill 
(for a color-only effect) 
or Edges (for black-and-
white line art).

110 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
3 In the Effect Controls panel, choose Fill from the Render pop-up menu.
For this project, you’re selecting Fill only temporarily so that you can more easily see 
the results of the Fill settings as you make adjustments.
4 Change the Detail Radius amount to 20 and the Detail Threshold amount to 50. 
These settings control how much detail is removed and how it is smoothed. Higher 
values remove more detail.
5 In the Fill area, change the Shading Steps value to 10, and make sure the 
Shading Smoothness value is 70.
These settings determine how color is reduced and how gradients are preserved. In 
this project, changing these values reduces the number of colors in the DJ’s shirt, 
creating a simpler design.
6 Choose Edges from the Render pop-up menu so you can focus on the edge 
controls. The layer becomes black and white temporarily.
7 In the Edge area, change the Threshold to 1.25 and the Width to 1.
These settings reduce the number of black lines on the subject.
8 Leave the Softness value at its current setting (60), but lower the Opacity to 60% 
to make the lines more subtle.
9 Choose Fill & Edges from the Render pop-up menu to restore the color.
10 Expand Advanced to see the advanced controls, which give you precise control 
over the edges.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 111
11 Change the Edge Enhancement value to 50 to sharpen the edges of the layer.
12 Change the Edge Black Level to 2 to fill in more areas of the image with solid 
black. This makes the image even more cartoonish.
13 Lock the DJ.mov layer to ensure you don’t accidentally make changes to it as 
you continue the project.
adding a title bar
You’ve created an exciting background and added the video of the DJ and the audio 
track. The only thing missing is the title to identify the program. You’ll use the 
Rectangle tool and path operations to create a dynamic shape, and then you’ll add 
the text.
Creating a self-animating shape
Wiggle Paths turns a standard rectangle into a series of jagged peaks and valleys. 
You’ll use it to create a shape that looks like a soundwave. Because the operation 
is self-animating, you need to change only a few properties for the entire shape to 
move on its own.
1 Select the Rectangle tool ( ), which is hidden under the Star tool ( ).
2 Click the Fill Color box, and select a light yellow. (We used R=255, G=255, 
B=130.) Click OK.
3 Click the word Stroke. In the Stroke Options dialog box, select Solid Color, and  
click OK.
4 Click the Stroke Color box, and select a light gray. (We used R=200, G=200, 
B=200.) Click OK.

112 
lesson 4 Working with shape layers
5 Change the Stroke Width to 10 pixels.
6 Draw a rectangle across the composition—near the bottom and approximately 
50 pixels high.
7 In the Timeline panel, expand Rectangle 1 > Rectangle Path 1. 
8 Unlink the Size values, and then change them to 680, 50.
9 Expand Stroke 1, and then change the Stroke Opacity to 30%.
10  Hide the Rectangle 1 properties.
11  Select Shape Layer 1, and choose Wiggle Paths from the Add pop-up menu.
12  Expand Wiggle Paths 1. Then change the Size to 150 and the Detail to 80.
13 Choose Smooth from the Points menu to make the path less jagged.
14  Change Wiggles/Second to 5 to speed up the movement.
15  Move the current-time indicator across the timeline to see the shape move.  
It’s not exactly an audio waveform, but it’s a stylistic version of one.
16  Hide all the properties for the layer. 
17  Rename the layer Lower Third, and then lock the layer.
E Tip: If you need 
to reposition the 
rectangle, use the 
Selection tool to drag 
it into place in the 
Composition panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 113
adding text
All you need to do now is add the title of the program. You’ll use an animation 
preset to make the text stand out.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
composition.
2 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ). In the Character panel, select a sans serif 
font, such as Arial Bold, and specify a size of 60 pixels.
3 Click the Fill Color box in the Character panel, and select black (R=0, G=0, B=0). 
Then click the Stroke Color box, and select white (R=255, G=255, B=255).
4 Change the Stroke Width to 2 pixels.
5 Click an insertion point in the Composition panel, and type DJ Quad Master. 
6 Select the Selection tool ( ), and then reposition the text over the wave- 
form shape.
7 Select the text in the Composition panel, and choose Animation > Browse 
Presets. Adobe Bridge opens, displaying the available animation presets.
8 Navigate to the Text > 3D Text folder, and then double-click the 3D Rotate  
In By Character thumbnail. After Effects applies the preset to the selected text.

Using Brainstorm to experiment
The Brainstorm feature makes it easy to try different settings for effects, and to 
quickly apply the one you like. To use the Brainstorm feature, select the layer or 
properties you want to include, and then click the Brainstorm icon. The Brainstorm 
dialog box displays multiple variations of your image, based on randomized set-
tings. You can save one or more of the variants, apply one to a composition, or redo 
the Brainstorm operation.
The Brainstorm feature works especially well with animation presets. You’ll use it 
to explore possibilities for the Suns layer you created for this project.
1 Save the project, and then choose File > Save As > Save A Copy. Name the copy 
of the project Brainstorm, and save it in the Lesson04/Finished_Project folder.
2 Unlock the Suns layer in the Timeline panel.
3 Click the Solo switches ( ) for the Suns and Background layers, so that you see 
only these two layers in the Composition panel.
You can isolate one or more layers for animating, previewing, or rendering by solo-
ing. Soloing excludes all other layers of the same type from the Composition panel. 
4 Expand the Suns layer, and then select Contents. 
5 Click the Brainstorm icon ( ) at the top of the Timeline panel to open the 
Brainstorm dialog box.
 Note: With the 
Cartoon effect in place, 
the RAM preview 
may take longer than 
usual to render and 
begin playing.
 Note: Selecting 
Contents selects all the 
properties for the layer, 
so that the Brainstorm 
feature includes them 
all in the operation. 
You can also use the 
Brainstorm feature 
to experiment with 
one or more specific 
properties.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 115
6 Select the level of randomness Brainstorm should apply to the layer properties. 
The default value is 25%; for drastic changes, try 100%.
7 Click the Brainstorm button. The feature randomizes the properties and 
displays variants. You can click the Brainstorm button multiple times; each 
time, it randomizes the settings by the percentage you’ve selected.
8 When you find a variation you like, move the pointer over the variant, and then 
click the check mark icon to apply it to the composition. 
E Tip: To return to a 
previous variation, click 
the Back button. To see 
all the variants in action, 
click the Play button.

4 What does the Pucker & Bloat path operation do?
5 How does the Cartoon effect work?
review answers
1 A shape layer is simply a layer that contains a vector graphic called a shape. To create 
a shape layer, draw a shape directly in the Composition panel using any of the drawing 
tools or the Pen tool. 
2 To quickly duplicate a shape multiple times, apply a Repeater operation to the shape 
layer. The Repeater path operation creates copies of all paths, strokes, and fills included 
in the layer.
3 The Brainstorm feature creates variants of your composition based on randomized 
settings in the properties you selected. The feature makes it possible to explore 
numerous possibilities quickly and easily, and to save or apply them with a single click.
4 The Pucker & Bloat operation pulls the path’s vertices outward while curving segments 
inward (puckering), or pulls the vertices inward while curving segments outward 
(bloating). Negative values pucker a shape; positive values bloat it.
5 The Cartoon effect stylizes a layer by removing some details and emphasizing others, 
and by simplifying color. You can change settings in the Effect Controls panel to fine-
tune the effect’s behavior.

Adobe After Effects projects typically use a variety of 
imported footage, arranged in a composition, which  
is edited and animated using the Timeline panel. 
In this lesson, you’ll become more familiar with 
animation fundamentals as you build a multimedia 
presentation.

lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
Getting started
For this project, professional illustrator Gordon Studer has created a Photoshop file 
of a city scene with several objects on separate layers that you will animate in After 
Effects. In fact, he has prepared an After Effects project that already contains this 
layered Photoshop file, as well as the video and audio clips that you will need later 
in the lesson.
You will animate an illustration of the artist driving a car on a city street. The ani-
mation ends with an easel that displays a slide show of samples of the artist’s work. 
This is a complex animation. You will start by animating the background and some 
objects so that the virtual camera appears to move from left to right across the 
scene. Then you’ll animate the car driving down the road and mask a photograph of 
the illustrator’s face into the driver’s seat. Next, you’ll animate some passing traffic 
and buildings to add interest to the background. Finally, you’ll animate the slide 
show of the artwork on the easel.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson05 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Start_Project_File folder: Lesson05_Start.aep
• In the Assets folder: CarRide.psd, GordonsHead.mov, piano.wav, and several 
JPEG images whose file names begin with “studer_”
• In the Animation_preset folder: HeadShape.ffx
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson05.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson05.mov sample movie to see what you will create 
in this lesson. When you’re done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete the 
sample movie from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.

animating the scenery using parenting
To animate the various elements of the scenery efficiently with the background, 
you’re going to use parenting. As you learned in Lesson 3, “Animating Text,” creat-
ing a parenting relationship between layers synchronizes the changes in the parent 
layer with the corresponding transformation values of the child layers. In Lesson 
3, you used parenting to quickly apply one layer’s scale transformation to another 
layer. Now, you will use it to synchronize the movement of the objects in three  
layers—the leaves, full skyline, and the FG (foreground) layers—with the BG  
(background) layer of the animation.
Setting up parenting
First, you’ll set up the parent-child relationship between the relevant layers in the 
Timeline panel.
1 In the Timeline panel, Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) to 
select the leaves, FG, and full skyline layers.

122 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
2 In the Parent column for any one of the selected layers, choose 8.BG from the 
pop-up menu. This establishes the three selected layers as child layers to the 
parent layer, which is layer 8, named BG (the background).
animating the parent layer
Now you’ll animate the position of the background layer—the parent layer—so that 
it moves horizontally. This, in turn, will animate the child layers in the same way.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 Select the BG layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its Position 
property.
3 Set the BG layer’s Position values to 1029, 120, and click the stopwatch  
icon ( ) to create a Position keyframe. This moves the background layer  
off to the left side of the scene, as if the camera had been moved.
4 Go to 10:15.
E Tip: If you don’t 
see the Parent column, 
choose Columns > 
Parent from the Time-
line panel menu. 
E Tip: A quick way to 
go to a frame is to press 
Alt+Shift+J (Windows) 
or Option+Shift+J (Mac 
OS) to open the Go To 
Time dialog box. Then 
type the desired time 
without punctuation (as 
in 1015 for 10:15), and 
press Enter or Return.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 123
5 Set the BG layer’s Position values to -626, 120. After Effects automatically 
creates a second keyframe and shows you the motion path of the animation  
in the Composition panel. The background now moves across the composition, 
and because the leaves, full skyline, and FG layers are child layers to the BG 
(parent) layer, they also move horizontally from the same starting position.
6 Select the BG layer, and press P to hide its Position property and keep the 
Timeline panel neat.
animating the bee’s position
Another element of the composition that moves across the scene at the beginning 
of the animation is the bee. You will animate it next.
1 Press the Home key, or go to 0:00. 
2 Select the Bee layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its Position 
property. (The bee is not visible at 0:00 in the Composition panel.)
3 Set the Position values of the Bee layer to 825, 120, so that the bee is offscreen 
to the left at the beginning of the animation. Then click the stopwatch icon ( )
to create a Position keyframe.
4 Go to 1:00, and set the Bee layer’s Position values to 1411, 120, putting the  
bee offscreen to the right. After Effects adds a keyframe.
5 Select the Bee layer, and press P to hide its Position property in the Time- 
line panel.
E Tip: You can also 
change the Bee layer’s 
Position values by 
dragging the layer in 
the Composition panel 
(using the Selection 
tool) until the layer is in 
the correct position.

124 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
trimming a layer
Because you don’t want the bee to appear in the composition after 1:00, you need to 
trim the layer. Trimming (hiding) footage at the beginning or end of a layer lets you 
change which frames are first or last in the composition. The first frame to appear is 
called the In point, and the last frame is called the Out point. You can trim footage 
by changing the In and Out points in the Layer panel or the Timeline panel, depend-
ing on what you want to change. Here, you’ll change the Out point of the Bee layer 
in the Timeline panel.
1 Make sure the current-time indicator is at 1:00 and the Bee layer is selected in 
the Timeline panel.
2 Press Alt+] (Windows) or Option+] (Mac OS) to set the Out point at 1:00. 
applying motion blur
	
Previewing the animation
A quick manual preview will show you how the elements in the scenery move.
1 Drag the current-time indicator from 0:00 to 10:15. The animation of the 
background, leaves, bee, foreground objects, and objects in the skyline makes it 
appear as if a camera is panning across the scene.
2 After you preview, return the current-time indicator to 0:00, and then choose  
File > Save to save your work.
E Tip: You can also 
drag the right side of 
the layer duration bar to 
change the Out point. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 125
adjusting an anchor point
The background is moving; now it’s time to animate the artist in his red car so that 
he appears to drive across the composition. To begin that process, you must first 
move the anchor point of the layer that contains the red car, without moving the 
layer’s relative position in the composition. The red car is on the Artist layer. To 
edit the anchor point of the Artist layer, you need to work on the Artist layer in  
the Layer panel.
1 Double-click the Artist layer in the Timeline panel to open it in the Layer panel. 
2 At the bottom of the Layer panel, choose Anchor Point Path from the View 
menu. This view displays the layer’s anchor point, which by default is at the 
center of the layer.
3 Select the Pan Behind tool (
) in the Tools panel (or press Y to activate it). 
4 Choose Fit Up To 100% from the Magnification Ratio pop-up menu to see the 
entire layer, and then drag the anchor point to the lower left corner of the car.
5 Click the Composition: CarRide tab to view the CarRide composition.
6 Select the Artist layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its Position 
property.

126 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
7 Set the Position values for the Artist layer to 50, 207 so that the car is in the 
center of the frame, and then click the stopwatch icon ( ) to set a Position 
keyframe. This is a temporary position that lets you see the car onscreen while 
you mask the driver into place, which is your next task. Then you’ll animate the 
car so that it drives across the composition. 
8 Select the Artist layer, press P to hide its Position property, and then choose  
File > Save to save your work. 
masking video using vector shapes
With the car positioned onscreen, you can add the driver. You will use a custom 
animation preset to create a mask from a shape layer. This shape turns a frontal 
head shot into a side-view profile shape, which is a “Picasso-esque” signature style 
of the artist’s work.
Creating a new composition
To help you manage the movement of this layer later, you will create a new compo-
sition, which you’ll add to the main composition.
1 Drag the GordonsHead.mov clip from the Source folder in the Project panel 
onto the Create A New Composition button (
) at the bottom of the panel. 
After Effects creates a new composition named GordonsHead based on the set-
tings applied to the movie. It opens the new composition in both the Timeline and 
Composition panels.
 Note: You’ll learn 
much more about 
masking in Lesson 7.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 127
Unfortunately, the GordonsHead movie has a different resolution than the CarRide 
composition. You need to fix that now.
2 Select the GordonsHead composition in the Project panel, and then choose 
Composition > Composition Settings.
3 In the Composition Settings dialog box, change the Width to 360 pixels. If the 
Lock Aspect Ratio option is selected, After Effects automatically changes the 
Height to 240 pixels. Click OK.
Now you’ll scale the layer to fit the composition.
4 Select the GordonsHead layer in the Timeline panel, and choose Layer > 
Transform > Fit To Comp.

128 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
Using animation presets with shape layers
If you’re the creative type, like Gordon Studer, you can create shape layers and save 
them as animation presets to apply to future projects. You’ll apply an animation 
preset to a shape layer to change the appearance of Gordon’s head.
1 Choose Layer > New > Shape Layer. After Effects adds a new shape layer to the 
composition.
2 Select Shape Layer 1 in the Timeline panel, and then choose Animation > 
Browse Presets. Adobe Bridge opens.
3 In Adobe Bridge, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson05/
Animation_preset folder on your hard disk. 
4 Double-click the HeadShape.ffx file to apply it to Shape Layer 1. You can close 
Adobe Bridge or leave it open to use later in this lesson.
Constraining a layer with an alpha matte
There are many ways to mask layers in After Effects. For example, you can use 
shape tools or the Pen tool to draw a mask. In this lesson, you’ll use an alpha matte, 
which uses the alpha channel of a layer to mask another layer.
1 Click Toggle Switches/Modes at the bottom of the Timeline panel to view the 
Mode column.
2 In the TrkMat menu for the GordonsHead layer, choose Alpha Matte “Shape 
Layer 1.”

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 129
The layer is now constrained by the shape layer.
Swapping a composition into a layer 
Now that Gordon Studer’s mug is constrained to the vector shape, you need to 
attach it to the car. You’ll return to the main CarRide composition and swap the 
GordonsHead composition into the Head layer, which is currently a solid layer that 
serves as a placeholder.
1 Click the CarRide tab in the Timeline panel.
2 Select the head layer in the Timeline panel, and then do one of the following:
• Select the GordonsHead composition in the Project panel, and press 
Ctrl+Alt+/ (Windows) or Command+Option+/ (Mac OS).
• Alt-drag (Windows) or Option-drag (Mac) the GordonsHead composition 
from the Project panel to the head layer in the Timeline panel.
3 Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the head layer in the Composition panel so 
that Gordon is sitting properly in the car. 
Now, you’ll use parenting again so that Gordon’s head will move with the car.

lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
4 In the head layer in the Timeline panel, choose 2. Artist from the Parent menu.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Keyframing a motion path
Finally, you’re ready to animate the car so that it drives onscreen at the beginning 
of the composition, scales larger during the middle of the composition—as if it’s 
approaching the camera—and then pops a wheelie and drives offscreen. You’ll start 
by keyframing the car’s position to get it on the screen.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler. 
2 Click the Video switch ( ) for the leaves layer in the Timeline panel to hide the 
layer, so that you can clearly see the Artist layer below it.
3 Select the Artist layer in the Timeline panel, and expand its Transform properties.
4 Change the layer’s Position values to -162, 207 to move it offscreen to the left 
(behind the leaves). 
 Note: There’s 
already a keyframe 
at this time from the 
anchor-point exercise.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 131
5 Go to 2:20, and change the Position values for the Artist layer to 54.5, 207.  
After Effects adds a keyframe.
6 Go to 6:00, and click the Add Or Remove Keyframe At The Current Time 
button (in the Switches column) for the Artist layer to add a Position keyframe 
for the Artist layer at the same values (54.5, 207).
When you animate the Position property, After Effects displays the movement  
as a motion path. You can create a motion path for the position of the layer or for 
the anchor point of a layer. A position motion path appears in the Composition 
panel; an anchor-point motion path appears in the Layer panel. The motion path 
appears as a sequence of dots in which each dot marks the position of the layer at 
each frame. A box in the path marks the position of a keyframe. The density of dots 
between the boxes in a motion path indicates the layer’s relative speed. Dots close 
together indicate a slower speed; dots farther apart indicate a faster speed.
Keyframing scale and rotation transformations
The car is zooming onscreen; now, you’ll make it appear as if the car is getting 
closer to the camera by scaling it larger. Then you’ll make it pop a wheelie by key-
framing the Rotation property.
1 Go to 7:15, and set the Scale values for the Artist layer to 80, 80%. Then click 
the stopwatch ( ) to set a Scale keyframe.
 Note: You can’t 
add a keyframe 
here by clicking the 
stopwatch—it’s already 
active. And After Effects 
won’t automatically 
add a new keyframe 
if you haven’t entered 
new values. Thus, you 
must click the Add Or 
Remove Keyframe At 
The Current Location 
button to add a 
keyframe with the  
same values.

132 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
2 Go to 10:10, and set the Position values for the Artist layer to 28, 303.  
After Effects adds a keyframe.
3 Still at 10:10, change the Scale values to 120, 120%. After Effects adds a 
keyframe.
4 Still at 10:10, click the stopwatch icon ( ) for the Rotation property to set a 
Rotation keyframe at the default value, 0.0 degrees.
5 Go to 10:13, and change the Rotation value to 0x -14.0 degrees. After Effects 
adds a keyframe, and now the car pops a wheelie. 
Now, you’ll animate the car driving offscreen. 
6 Go to 10:24, and set the Position values for the Artist layer to 369, 258.  
After Effects adds a keyframe.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 133
adding motion blur
Finally, apply a motion blur to smooth out the driving sequence.
1 Hide the Artist layer properties in the Timeline panel.
2 Turn on the Motion Blur switch ( ) for the Artist and head layers.
The blur will be visible as the car drives offscreen, and it will be visible for the fly-
ing bee as well, because you applied motion blur to that layer earlier in the lesson. 
You’ll see all of this when you preview the composition.
Previewing your work
Now that the keyframes are set for the moving car, preview the entire clip, and  
make sure the driver is framed to create a pleasant composition. 
1 Click the Video switch ( ) for the leaves layer to make it visible. 
2 Click the RAM Preview button in the Preview panel to preview the animation.
3 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
animating additional elements
You’ll get more practice creating keyframe animations as you animate the passing 
traffic and the buildings in the background.
animating the passing traffic
Perhaps you noticed in the preview you just watched that the blue car is tailgating 
the artist in his red speedster. The blue car is actually on a precomposed layer that 
also contains a yellow car. Next, you’ll make the scene more dynamic by animating 
the blue and yellow cars so that they drive past the artist’s car in the background.
1 Select the vehicles layer in the Timeline panel, and click the Solo switch ( )  
to isolate it as you work. 
2 Press the P key to reveal the layer’s Position property.
3 Go to 3:00.
4 Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the vehicles layer in the Composition panel  
so that both cars are offscreen to the right. Press Shift after you start to drag  
to constrain the movement vertically. Or, simply set the vehicles layer’s Position 
values to 684, 120. 
 Note: Remember, 
a precomposition is 
simply a layer with 
nested layers in it. 
In this example, the 
vehicles layer contains 
one nested layer with a 
blue car and one nested 
layer with a yellow car.

134 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
5 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) to create a Position keyframe for the vehicles layer.
6 Go to 4:00, and drag the vehicles layer in the Composition panel so that both 
cars are offscreen to the left. Or, simply set the layer’s Position values to 93, 120. 
After Effects adds a keyframe.
7 Turn on motion blur for the vehicles layer. 
8 Select the vehicles layer in the Timeline panel, and then press P to hide its 
Position property.
9 Unsolo the vehicles layer, and then manually preview the passing traffic by 
dragging the current-time indicator from about 2:25 to 4:06.
animating the buildings
Animated buildings? You bet. You’ll animate a couple of buildings rising and “jump-
ing” in the background as the artist cruises through downtown San Francisco. 
Once again, you’ll be working with a precomposition (full skyline), but you’ll open 
it to animate its nested layers individually.
1 Double-click the full skyline composition in the Project panel to open it in its 
own Timeline and Composition panels. Notice that this composition has three 
layers: skyline, building, and buildings. You’ll start with the buildings layer.
2 Go to 5:10, select the buildings layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal 
its Position property.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 135
3 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) to set a Position keyframe for the buildings layer  
at the default values (127, 120).
4 Go to 4:20. Then, in the Composition panel, use the Selection tool ( ) to drag the 
buildings layer down, off the bottom of the composition, until its y Position value 
is 350. Press Shift after you start to drag to constrain the horizontal axis. After 
Effects adds a keyframe.
5 Go to 5:02, and drag the buildings layer up in the Composition panel until  
its y Position value is 90. After Effects adds a keyframe.
Great. You’ve got your first animated building. Next, you’ll finesse the movement  
at the high point of the jump to make it more natural. (Naturally jumping build-
ings? Aw, come on. This is fun.)
E Tip: Dragging the 
layer into position is 
good practice, but you 
can also directly enter 
the y coordinates in 
steps 4 and 5 if you don’t 
want to drag the layer in 
the Composition panel.

136 
lesson 5

adding easy ease
Finesse the movement at the high point of the jump by adding Easy Ease. 
1 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the keyframe at 5:02, and 
choose Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease. This adjusts the speed of change as  
the motion approaches and retreats from the keyframe.
2 Drag the current-time indicator from 4:20 to 5:10 to preview the jumping 
building.
Copying the building animation
To animate the other layers in the full skyline composition, you’ll copy and paste 
the buildings layer’s keyframes to those other layers—but at different times—so 
that the elements jump in sequence.
1 Click the Position property name for the buildings layer to select all of the 
property’s keyframes, and then choose Edit > Copy or press Ctrl+C (Windows) 
or Command+C (Mac OS). 
2 Go to 5:00, and select the building layer in the Timeline panel. Choose Edit > 
Paste or press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste the 
keyframes to this layer. (You won’t see the pasted keyframes if the Position 
property isn’t visible.)
3 Go to 5:10, and select the skyline layer. Choose Edit > Paste or press Ctrl+V 
(Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS) again to paste the keyframes to this  
layer, too. 
4 If the Position properties are not already visible, select the building layer name, 
and press the P key to see the copied keyframes. Then do the same for the 
skyline layer.
5 Apply motion blur to all three layers. Then switch to the CarRide Timeline panel, 
and turn on motion blur for the full skyline precomposed layer. This applies 
motion blur to all of the nested layers.
You’ve done a lot of work. Take a look at the animation from the beginning.

applying an effect
You’ve created several keyframed animations in this project. You’ll switch gears 
now and apply an effect in this next exercise. The effect will animate some radio 
waves emitting from the Transamerica Pyramid building.
adding a solid-color layer
You need to apply the radio wave effect on its own layer, which will be a solid- 
color layer.
about solid-color layers
You can create solid images of any color or size (up to 30,000 x 30,000 pixels) in  
After Effects. After Effects treats solids as it does any other footage item: You can 
modify the mask, transform properties, and apply effects to a solid layer. If you 
change settings for a solid that is used by more than one layer, you can apply the 
changes to all layers that use the solid or to only the single occurrence of the solid. 
Use solid layers to color a background or to create simple graphic images.
1 Make sure the CarRide Timeline panel is open.
2 Choose Layer > New > Solid. In the Solid Settings dialog box, name the layer 
radio waves, and then click the Make Comp Size button. Then click OK to 
create the layer. 
3 Drag the radio waves layer in the Timeline panel so that it sits directly above  
the BG layer.

138 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
By default, the radio waves layer lasts the duration of the composition. However, it 
needs to be only a few seconds long, to last the length of the effect. So you’ll change 
the layer’s duration.
4 Click the Expand Or Collapse The In/Out/Duration/Stretch Panes button ( )  
in the lower left corner of the Timeline panel to view those four columns.
5 Click the orange Duration value for the radio waves layer.
6 In the Time Stretch dialog box, set the New Duration to 8:00. Then click OK.
7 In the time ruler, drag the radio waves layer duration bar (from the center) so 
that it starts at 6:00. Watch the In value for the layer to see when it’s at 6:00, or 
you can enter the In value manually.
8 Go to 6:00—the first frame of the radio waves effect.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 139
applying the effect
Now you’re ready to apply the radio waves effect to the solid layer. 
1 With the radio waves layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect >  
Generate > Radio Waves. Nothing changes in the Composition panel, because 
the first wave hasn’t emitted yet.
2 In the Effect Controls panel, expand the Wave Motion and Stroke properties,  
if they aren’t already visible. Then do the following:
• Choose Each Frame from the 
Parameters Are Set  
At menu.
• Set the Expansion to 0.40.
• Set the Velocity to 1.00.
• Set the Color to white 
(R=255, G=255, B=255).
• Set the Opacity to 0.50.
• Set both the Start Width and 
End Width to 3.00.
3 Still in the Effect Controls panel, click the cross-hair button for the Producer 
Point setting near the top of the panel. Then, in the Composition panel, click  
to set the producer point at the top of the pyramid.

140 
lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
Radio waves with the settings you specified will now emit from the top of the pyra-
mid building. You just need to parent the radio waves layer to the full skyline layer 
so that the waves travel with the pyramid building across the composition.
4 In the Parent column of the radio waves layer, choose 7. full skyline from the  
pop-up menu. 
5 Go to 5:28, just before the Radio Waves effect begins, and select From Current 
Time in the Preview panel. (You may need to expand the Preview panel to see  
all the options.)
6 Click the RAM Preview button (
) to view a RAM preview from the point that 
the Radio Waves effect begins.
After watching the preview, tidy up the Timeline panel.
7 Click the Expand Or Collapse The In/Out/Duration/Stretch Panes button ( )  
to hide those columns. Then press the Home key, or move the current-time 
indicator to the beginning of the time ruler.
8 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Creating an animated slide show
Now that you’ve completed this complex animation of the artist driving through a 
stylized cityscape, it’s time to add samples of his work to the easel. The point, after 
all, is to show off the artist’s work to potential new clients. However, this slide-show 
technique could easily be adapted to other uses, such as exhibiting family photos or 
making a business presentation.

Importing the slides
The artist has provided a folder of sample artwork, but you’ll include only some  
of the images. To help you choose, use Adobe Bridge to preview them.
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to jump to Adobe Bridge.
2 In the Folders panel, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson05/Assets 
folder on your hard disk.
3 Click the various “studer_” images, and study them in the Preview panel.
4 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) to select your five favorite 
images, and then double-click to add all of them to the After Effects Project 
panel. We chose studer_Comcast.jpg, studer_Map.jpg, studer_music.jpg,  
studer_Puzzle.jpg, and studer_Real_Guys.jpg.
5 Leave Adobe Bridge open in the background.
making a new composition
You’ll put these images into their own composition, which will make it easier to 
turn them into a slide show, complete with transition effects between slides.
1 In After Effects, click the Project tab to view the Project panel. 
2 Deselect all items in the Project panel. Then Shift-click to select the five Studer 
images, and drag them onto the Create A New Composition button (
) at the 
bottom of the panel. 

142 
lesson 5

3 In the New Composition From Selection dialog box, do the following: 
•
In the Create area, select Single Composition.
•
In the Options area, set the Still Duration to 2:00.
•
Select the Sequence Layers and Overlap options.
•
Set the Duration to 0:10.
•
Choose Cross Dissolve Front And Back Layers from the Transition menu.
•
Click OK.
The transition option creates a sequence of still images that dissolve from one  
to the next. When you click OK, After Effects opens the new composition, named  
for the Studer image at the top of the list in the Project panel, in the Composition 
and Timeline panels. Before continuing, you’ll give the composition a more  
intuitive name.
4 Choose Composition > Composition Settings, and rename the composition 
Artwork. Then click OK.

Positioning the slide show
Wasn’t it easy to make the slide show? Now, you’ll position the slide show on the 
canvas of the easel. The slides are actually larger than the canvas, but because 
they’re in a composition, you can size them as a unit.
1 Switch to the CarRide Timeline panel, and go to 11:00, which is when the canvas 
is centered in the composition.
2 Drag the Artwork composition from the Project panel into the CarRide 
Timeline panel, placing it at the top of the layer stack.
Currently, the Artwork layer is set to start at 0:00. You need to adjust the timing  
of the layer so that it appears at 11:00.
3 Drag the layer duration bar (from the center) for the Artwork layer in the time 
ruler so that its In point is at 11:00. You can click the Expand Or Collapse The 
In/Out/Duration/Stretch Panes button ( ) to see the In point precisely.
Now, you’ll scale the slides to fit the canvas.
4 With the Artwork layer selected in the Timeline panel, press S to reveal  
its Scale property.
5 Set the Scale values to 45, 45%.

) in the Preview panel to watch a RAM 
preview of the slide show. (Make sure From Current Time is selected to start  
the RAM preview at 11:00.)
Fading in the first slide
As it stands, the first slide instantly appears in the easel at 11:00. You’ll animate the 
Artwork layer’s opacity so that the first slide fades in.
1 Select the Artwork layer in the Timeline panel, and press T to reveal its Opacity 
property.
2 Go to 11:00.
3 Set the Artwork layer’s Opacity to 0%, and click the stopwatch icon ( ) to set  
an Opacity keyframe.
4 Go to 11:03, and set the Artwork layer’s Opacity to 100%. After Effects adds  
a keyframe. Now the artwork appears gradually.
5 Manually preview the animation from 11:00 to 11:03 to see the first slide  
fade in.
6 Select the Artwork layer in the Timeline panel, and press T to hide its Opacity 
property. Then choose File > Save to save your work.

adding an audio track
Give yourself a hand—you’ve done a lot of animating in this project. But you’re not 
quite done. Gordon Studer speaks to the viewer while he drives his car across the 
composition, but you’ll add some polish by dropping in a background audio track.
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to jump to Adobe Bridge.
2 In the Content panel, select the piano.wav thumbnail preview. Adobe Bridge lets 
you preview audio.
3 If the file doesn’t automatically play when you select it, click the Play button ( )  
in the Preview panel to hear the track. Click the Pause button ( ) or press the 
spacebar to stop.
4 Double-click the piano.wav file to import 
it into the After Effects Project panel.
5 Deselect everything in the Project panel, 
and then drag the piano.wav item from 
the Project panel into the CarRide 
Timeline panel, placing it at the bottom of 
the layer stack.
Supported audio file formats
You can import any of the following types of audio files into After Effects:
•
Adobe Sound Document (ASND; multitrack files import as merged single track)
•
Advanced Audio Coding (AAC, M4A)
•
Audio Interchange File Format (AIF, AIFF)
•
MP3 (MP3, MPEG, MPG, MPA, MPE)
•
Video for Windows (AVI, WAV; requires QuickTime on Mac OS)
•
Waveform (WAV)

lesson 5 
Animating a multimedia Presentation
Looping the audio track
The duration of the piano layer isn’t as long as the composition, so you’ll need to 
loop it. Luckily, this music track has been composed to loop cleanly. You’re going 
to loop the audio clip using the time-remapping feature. You’ll learn to use time 
remapping in more depth in Lesson 6, “Animating Layers.”
1 Select the piano.wav layer in the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Layer > Time > Enable Time Remapping. A Time Remap property 
appears for the layer in the Timeline panel, and two Time Remap keyframes 
appear for the layer in the time ruler.
3 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) the stopwatch icon ( ) for 
the layer’s Time Remap property. This sets the default expression for time 
remapping; it has no immediate effect in the Composition panel.
4 In the Expression: Time Remap property for the piano layer, click the Expression 
Language pop-up menu, and choose Property > loopOut(type = "cycle", 
numKeyframes = 0).
The audio is now set to loop in a cycle, repeating the clip endlessly. All you need  
to do is extend the Out point of the layer to the end of the composition. 
5 Select the piano layer in the Timeline panel, and go to the end of the time ruler. 
Then press Alt+] (Windows) or Option+] (Mac OS) to extend the layer to the 
end of the composition.
You’ll preview the entire composition soon.
6 Hide the piano layer’s properties, and then choose File > Save to save your work.

Zooming in for a final close-up
Everything is looking good, but zooming in for a final close-up of the slide show 
will really focus the viewer’s attention on the artwork.
1 In the Project panel, drag the CarRide composition onto the Create A New 
Composition button (
) at the bottom of the panel. After Effects creates a new 
composition, named CarRide 2, and opens it in the Timeline and Composition 
panels. You’ll rename the composition to avoid confusion.
2 Select the CarRide 2 composition in the Project panel, press Enter or Return, 
and type Lesson05. Then press Enter or Return again to accept the new name.
3 In the Lesson05 Timeline panel, go to 10:24, the first frame where the car clears 
the right side of the composition. 
4 Select the CarRide layer in the Lesson05 Timeline panel, and press S to reveal  
its Scale property.
5 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) to set a Scale keyframe at the default values, 100, 100%.
6 Go to 11:00, and change the Scale values to 110, 110%. After Effects adds a 
keyframe, and for the rest of the composition, the slide show will be prominent 
and eye-catching.
7 Select the CarRide layer, and press S to hide its Scale property.
Previewing the entire composition
It’s time to see how the whole thing comes together.
1 In the Preview panel, deselect From Current Time, and then click the RAM 
Preview button (
) to watch a RAM preview of the entire composition.
2 Press the spacebar to stop playback when you’re done.
3 Choose File > Save.
Congratulations. You’ve just created a complex animation, practicing all kinds  
of After Effects techniques and capabilities along the way, from parenting to audio 
looping. Although you’re not going to render it for final output right now, this proj-
ect is used for Lesson 14, “Rendering and Outputting.” You can skip to that lesson 
now if you’d like to learn how to output this project for a few different media, or 
you can proceed sequentially through the book and render it later.

review questions
1
How does After Effects display an animation of the Position property?
2
What is a solid-color layer, and what can you do with it?
3
What types of audio can you import into an After Effects project?
review answers
1 When you animate the Position property, After Effects displays the movement as a 
motion path. You can create a motion path for the position of the layer or for the 
anchor point of a layer. A position motion path appears in the Composition panel; an 
anchor-point motion path appears in the Layer panel. The motion path appears as a 
sequence of dots, where each dot marks the position of the layer at each frame. A box 
in the path marks the position of a keyframe.
2  You can create solid images of any color or size (up to 30,000 x 30,000 pixels) in After 
Effects. After Effects treats solids as it does any other footage item: You can modify the 
mask, transform properties, and apply effects to the solid layer. If you change settings 
for a solid that is used by more than one layer, you can apply the changes to all layers 
that use the solid or to only the single occurrence of the solid. Use solid layers to color 
a background or create simple graphic images.
3 You can import any of the following types of audio files into After Effects: Adobe 
Sound Document (ASND; multitrack files import as merged single track), Advanced 
Audio Coding (AAC, M4A), Audio Interchange File Format (AIF, AIFF), MP3 (MP3, 
MPEG, MPG, MPA, MPE), Video for Windows (AVI, WAV; requires QuickTime on 
Mac OS), and Waveform (WAV).

Animation is all about making changes over time—
changes to an object or image’s position, opacity, 
scale, and other properties. This lesson provides more 
practice animating the layers of a Photoshop file, 
including dynamically remapping time.

152 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
Getting started
Adobe After Effects provides several tools and effects that let you simulate motion 
video using a layered Photoshop file. In this lesson, you will import a layered 
Photoshop file of the sun appearing through a window, and then animate it to 
simulate the motion of the sun rising behind the panes of glass. This is a stylized 
animation in which the motion is first accelerated, and then slows down as clouds 
and birds move through the window frame at the end. 
First, you’ll preview the final movie and set up the project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson06 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: clock.mov, sunrise.psd
• In the Sample_Movies folder: Lesson06_regular.mov, Lesson06_retimed.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson06_regular.mov file to see the straightforward time-
lapse animation you will create in this lesson. 
3 Open and play the Lesson06_retimed.mov file to see the same animation after 
time has been remapped, which you will also do in this lesson.
4 When you’re done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete the sample movies 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin the lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
5 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file. Click Close to close 
the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display an empty, untitled project.
6 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
7 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson06/ 
Finished_Project folder.
8 Name the project Lesson06_Finished.aep, and then click Save.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 153
Importing the footage
You need to import one source item for this lesson.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson06/Assets folder on your hard disk, 
and select the sunrise.psd file.
3 Choose Composition – Retain Layer Sizes from the Import As menu, so the 
dimensions of each layer will match the layer’s content.
4 Click Open.
5 In the Sunrise.psd dialog box, make 
sure Composition – Retain Layer 
Sizes is selected in the Import Kind 
menu, and click OK.
Before continuing, take a moment 
to study the layers of the file you just 
imported.
6 In the Project panel, expand the 
sunrise Layers folder to see the 
Photoshop layers. Resize the Name column to make it wider and easier to read, if 
necessary.
Each of the elements you’ll animate 
in After Effects—the shadows, birds, 
clouds, and sun—is on a separate layer. 
In addition, there is one layer repre-
senting the initial, predawn lighting 
conditions in the room (Background), 
and a second layer that represents 
the final, bright daylight conditions in 
the room (Background Lit). Similarly, 
there are two layers for the two light-
ing conditions outside the window: 
Window and Window Lit. 
The Window Pane layer includes a  
Photoshop layer style that simulates  
a pane of glass. 

154 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
After Effects preserves the layer order, transparency data, and layer styles from the 
source Photoshop document. It also preserves other features, such as adjustment 
layers and type, which you don’t happen to be using in this project.
Preparing layered  
Photoshop files
Before you import a layered Photoshop file, name its layers carefully to reduce  
preview and rendering time, and to avoid problems importing and updating  
the layers:
•
Organize and name layers. If you change a layer name in a Photoshop file after 
you have imported it into After Effects, After Effects retains the link to the 
original layer. However, if you delete an imported layer, After Effects will be 
unable to find the original layer and will list it as missing in the Project panel.
•
Make sure that each layer has a unique name to avoid confusion.
Creating the composition
For this lesson, you’ll use the imported Photoshop file as the basis of the 
composition.
1 Double-click the sunrise composition in the Project panel to open it in the 
Composition panel and in the Timeline panel. 
2 Choose Composition > Composition Settings.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 155
3 In the Composition Settings dialog box, change the Duration to 10:00 to make 
the composition 10 seconds long, and then click OK.
about Photoshop layer styles
Adobe Photoshop provides a variety of layer styles—such as shadows, glows,  
and bevels—that change the appearance of a layer. After Effects can preserve these 
layer styles when you import Photoshop layers. You can also apply layer styles in 
After Effects. 
Though layer styles are referred to as effects in Photoshop, they behave more like 
blending modes in After Effects. Layer styles follow transformations in the stan-
dard render order, whereas effects precede transformations. Another difference is 
that each layer style blends directly with the underlying layers in the composition, 
whereas an effect is rendered on the layer to which it’s applied, the result of which 
then interacts with the underlying layers as a whole. 
The layer style properties are available for the layer in the Timeline panel. 
To learn more about working with layer styles in After Effects, see After Effects Help.

156 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
Simulating lighting changes
The first part of the animation involves lightening the dark room. You’ll use Opacity 
keyframes to animate the light.
1 In the Timeline panel, click the Solo switch ( ) for both the Background Lit 
and Background layers. Soloing the layers isolates them to speed animating, 
previewing, and rendering.
Currently, the lit background is on top of the regular (darker) background, obscur-
ing it and making the initial frame of the animation light. However, you want the 
animation to start dark, and then lighten. To accomplish this, you will make the 
Background Lit layer initially transparent, and have it “fade in” and appear to 
lighten the background over time.
2 Go to 5:00.
3 Select the Background Lit layer in the Timeline panel, and press T to reveal its 
Opacity property.
4 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) to set an Opacity keyframe. Note that the Opacity  
value is 100%.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 157
5 Press the Home key, or drag the current-time indicator to 0:00. Then set the 
Opacity for the Background Lit layer to 0%. After Effects adds a keyframe.  
Now, when the animation begins, the Background Lit layer is transparent, 
which allows the dark Background layer to show through.
6 Click the Solo switches ( ) for the Background Lit and Background layers to 
restore the view of the other layers, including Window and Window Lit. Make 
sure to leave the Opacity property for the Background Lit layer visible.
7 Expand the Window Pane layer’s Transform properties. The Window Pane layer 
has a Photoshop layer style that creates a bevel on the window.
8 Go to 2:00, and click the stopwatch next to the Opacity property for the 
Window Pane layer to create a keyframe at the current value, 30%.
9 Press the Home key, or drag the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler, and change the Opacity property to 0%.

158 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
10  Hide the Window Pane properties.
11  Click the Play/Pause button ( ) in the Preview panel, or press the spacebar to 
preview the animation. The interior of the room transitions gently from dimly 
to brightly lit.
12  Press the spacebar to stop playback at any time after 5:00.
13  Choose File > Save.
Duplicating an animation using the pick whip
Now you need to lighten the view through the window. To do this, you’ll use the 
pick whip to duplicate the animation you just created. You can use the pick whip  
to create expressions that link the values of one property or effect to another. 
about expressions
When you want to create and link complex animations, such as multiple car  
wheels spinning, but want to avoid creating tens or hundreds of keyframes by  
hand, you can use expressions instead. With expressions, you can create relation-
ships between layer properties and use one property’s keyframes to dynamically 
animate another layer. For example, if you set rotation keyframes for a layer and 
then apply the Drop Shadow effect, you can use an expression to link the Rotation 
property’s values with the Drop Shadow effect’s Direction values; that way, the drop 
shadow changes accordingly as the layer rotates.
Expressions are based on the JavaScript language, but you don’t need to know 
JavaScript to use them. You can create expressions by using simple examples and 
modifying them to suit your needs, or by chaining objects and methods together.
You work with expressions in the Timeline panel or the Effect Controls panel. You 
can use the pick whip to create expressions, or you can enter and edit expressions 
manually in the expression field—a text field in the time graph under the property.
For more about expressions, see After Effects Help.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 Select the Window Lit layer, and press T to reveal its Opacity property.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 159
3 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) the Opacity stopwatch for the 
Window Lit layer to add an expression for the default Opacity value, 100%. The 
words transform.opacity appear in the time ruler for the Window Lit layer.
4 With the transform.opacity expression selected in the time ruler, click the pick 
whip icon ( ) on the Window Lit Expression: Opacity line, and drag it to the 
Opacity property name in the Background Lit layer. When you release the 
mouse, the pick whip snaps, and the expression in the Window Lit layer time 
ruler now reads “thisComp.layer("Background Lit").transform.opacity.” This 
means that the Opacity value for the Background Lit layer (0%) replaces the 
previous Opacity value (100%) for the Window Lit layer. 
5 Drag the current-time indicator from 0:00 to 5:00. Notice that the Opacity 
values for the two layers match. 
6 Go to the beginning of the time ruler, and then press the spacebar to preview 
the animation again. Notice that the sky outside the window lightens as the 
room inside the window does.
7 Press the spacebar to stop playback.
8 Hide the Window Lit and Background Lit layers’ properties to keep the Timeline 
panel tidy for your next task.
9 Choose File > Save to save your project.

lesson 6 
Animating layers
animating movement in the scenery
The scenery outside the window is unrealistically static. For one thing, the sun 
should actually rise. In addition, shifting clouds and flying birds would bring this 
scene to life. 
animating the sun
To make the sun rise in the sky, you’ll set keyframes for its Position, Scale, and 
Opacity properties.
1 In the Timeline panel, select the Sun layer, and expand its Transform properties. 
2 Go to 4:07, and click the stopwatch icons ( ) to set keyframes for the Position, 
Scale, and Opacity properties at their default values.
3 Go to 3:13.
4 Still working with the Sun layer, set its Scale to 33, 33% and its Opacity to 10%. 
After Effects adds a keyframe for each property.
5 Press the End key, or move the current-time indicator to the end of the 
composition.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 161
6 For the Position property of the Sun layer, set the y value to 18, and then set the 
Scale values to 150, 150%. After Effects adds two keyframes.
You’ve just set keyframes that instruct the sun to move up and across the sky, and 
to become slightly larger and brighter as it rises. 
7 Hide the Sun layer’s properties.
animating the birds
Next, you’ll animate the motion of the birds flying by. To create the animation faster, 
you’ll take advantage of the Auto-Keyframe button in the Timeline panel. When the 
Auto-Keyframe button is selected, After Effects automatically creates a keyframe 
whenever you change a value. 
1 Select the Birds layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its Position 
property.
2 Click the Auto-Keyframe button ( ) at the top of the Timeline panel. The 
stopwatch icon becomes red when it’s selected.
3 Go to 4:20, and set the Position values for the Birds layer to 200, 49. After 
Effects automatically adds a keyframe. 
 Note: While the 
Auto-Keyframe button 
can make your life 
easier, it can also create 
more keyframes than 
you intended. Enable 
the Auto-Keyframe 
button only when you 
need it for a specific 
task, and remember to 
turn it off when you’re 
done with that task!

162 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
4 Go to 4:25, and set the Position values of the Birds layer to 670, 49. After Effects 
adds a keyframe.
5 Select the Birds layer, and press P to hide its Position property.
animating the clouds
Next, you’ll animate the clouds drifting across the sky.
1 Select the Clouds layer in the Timeline panel, and expand its Transform 
properties.
2 Go to 5:22, and click the stopwatch icon ( ) for the Position property to set  
a Position keyframe at the current value (406.5, 58.5). 
3 Still at 5:22, set the Opacity for the Clouds layer to 33%. After Effects 
automatically adds a keyframe, because the Auto-Keyframe button is still 
selected. 
4 Click the Auto-Keyframe button to deselect it.
5 Go to 5:02, and set the Clouds layer Opacity value to 0%. After Effects adds  
a keyframe, even though the Auto-Keyframe button is deselected. After Effects 
adds a keyframe when you change the value for a property that already has a 
keyframe in the timeline.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 163
6 Go to 9:07, and set the Clouds layer Opacity value to 50%. After Effects adds  
a keyframe.
7 Press the End key, or move the current-time indicator to the last frame of the 
composition.
8 Set the Position of the Clouds layer to 456.5, 48.5. After Effects adds a 
keyframe.
Previewing the animation
Now, see how it all comes together.
1 Press the Home key, or go to 0:00.
2 Press F2 or click an empty area in the Timeline panel to deselect everything, and 
then press the spacebar to preview the animation. The sun rises in the sky, the 
birds fly by (very quickly), and the clouds drift. So far, so good! However, there’s 
a fundamental problem: These elements all overlap the window frame—the 
birds even appear to be flying inside the room. You’ll solve this next. 
3 Press the spacebar to stop playback.
4 Hide the Clouds layer’s properties, and then choose File > Save.

164 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
adjusting the layers and 
creating a track matte
To solve the problem of the sun, birds, and clouds overlapping the window frame, 
you must first adjust the hierarchy of the layers within the composition. Then you’ll 
use an alpha track matte to allow the outside scenery to show through the window, 
but not appear to be inside the room.
Precomposing layers
You’ll start by precomposing the Sun, Birds, and Clouds layers into one 
composition.
1
Shift-click to select the Sun, Birds, and Clouds layers in the Timeline panel.
2
Choose Layer > Pre-compose. 
3
In the Pre-compose dialog box, name the new composition Window Contents. 
Make sure the Move All Attributes Into The New Composition option is 
selected, and select Open New Composition. Then click OK.
A new Timeline panel named Window Contents appears. It contains the Sun, Birds, 
and Clouds layers you selected in step 1 above. The Window Contents composition 
also appears in the Composition window. 
4 Click the sunrise Timeline panel 
to see the contents of the main 
composition. Notice that the Sun, 
Birds, and Clouds layers have been 
replaced by the Window Contents 
layer, which refers to the Window 
Contents composition.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 165
Creating the track matte
Now, you will create the track matte to hide the outside scenery behind all areas of 
the image except the windowpane. To do that, you’ll duplicate the Window Lit layer 
and use its alpha channel.
about track mattes and  
traveling mattes
When you want one layer to show through a hole in another layer, set up a track 
matte. You’ll need two layers—one to act as a matte, the other to fill the hole in the 
matte. You can animate either the track matte layer or the fill layer. When you ani-
mate the track matte layer, you create a traveling matte. If you want to animate the 
track matte and fill layers using identical settings, you can precompose them.
You define transparency in a track matte using values from either its alpha channel 
or the luminance of its pixels. Using luminance is handy when you want to create 
a track matte from a layer without an alpha channel, or a layer imported from a 
program that can’t create an alpha channel. In both alpha-channel mattes and lumi-
nance mattes, pixels with higher values are more transparent. In most cases, you use 
a high-contrast matte so that areas are either completely transparent or completely 
opaque. Intermediate shades should appear only where you want partial or gradual 
transparency, such as along a soft edge.
After Effects preserves the order of a layer and its track matte after you duplicate 
or split the layer. Within the duplicated or split layers, the track matte layer remains 
on top of the fill layer. For example, if your project contains layers A and B, where 
A is the track matte and B the fill layer, duplicating or splitting both of these layers 
results in the layer order ABAB.
A
B
C
Traveling matte 
A. Track matte layer: a solid with a rectangular mask, set to Luma Matte. The mask is  
animated to travel across the screen.  
B. Fill layer: a solid with a pattern effect.  
C. Result: The pattern is seen in the track matte’s shape and added to the image layer,  
which is below the track matte layer.

166 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
1 In the sunrise Timeline panel, select the Window Lit layer.
2 Choose Edit > Duplicate. 
3 Drag the duplicate layer, Window Lit 2, up in the layer stack so that it’s above 
the Window Contents layer.
4 Click Toggle Switches/Modes in the Timeline panel to display the TrkMat 
column, so you can apply the track matte.
5 Select the Window Contents layer, and choose Alpha Matte “Window Lit 2” 
from the TrkMat pop-up menu. The alpha channel of the layer above (Window 
Lit 2) is used to set transparency for the Window Contents layer, so the scenery 
outside the window shows through the transparent areas of the windowpane.
6 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of 
the time ruler, and then press the spacebar to preview the animation. Press the 
spacebar again when you’re done.
7 Choose File > Save to save your project.
adding motion blur
The birds will look more authentic if they include motion blur. You’ll add the 
motion blur and then set the shutter angle and phase, which control the intensity  
of the blur.
1 Switch to the Window Contents Timeline panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 167
2 Go to 4:22—the middle of the birds animation. Then select the Birds layer,  
and choose Layer > Switches > Motion Blur to turn on motion blur for the layer.
3 Click the Enable Motion Blur button ( ) at the top of the Timeline panel to 
display the motion blur for the Birds layer in the Composition panel.
4 Choose Composition > Composition Settings.
5 In the Composition Settings dialog box, click the Advanced tab, and reduce the 
Shutter Angle to 30 degrees. This setting imitates the effect of adjusting a shutter 
angle on a real camera, which controls how long the camera aperture is open, 
gathering light. Larger values create more motion blur.
6 Change the Shutter Phase to 0 degrees, and then click OK.

lesson 6 
Animating layers
animating the shadows
It’s time to turn your attention to the shadows cast on the table by the clock and the 
vase. In a realistic time-lapse image, those shadows would shorten as the sun rises.
There are a few ways to create and animate shadows in After Effects. For example, 
you could use 3D layers and lights. In this project, however, you will use the Corner 
Pin effect to distort the Shadows layer of the imported Photoshop image. Using the 
Corner Pin effect is like animating with the Photoshop Free Transform tool—the 
effect distorts an image by repositioning each of its four corners. You can use it to 
stretch, shrink, skew, or twist an image, or to simulate perspective or movement 
that pivots from the edge of a layer, such as a door opening.
1 Switch to the sunrise Timeline panel, and make sure you’re at the beginning  
of the time ruler.
2 Select the Shadows layer in the Timeline panel, and then choose Effect > 
Distort > Corner Pin. Small circles appear around the corner points of the 
Shadows layer in the Composition panel. 
You’ll start by setting the four corners of the Shadows layer to correspond to the 
four corners of the glass tabletop. Begin about midway into the animation, when 
the sun is high enough to start affecting the shadow. 
3 Go to 6:00, and then drag each of the four corner-pin handles to the respective 
corners of the glass tabletop. Notice that the x and y coordinates update in the 
Effect Controls panel.
If you have trouble getting the shadows to look right, you can manually enter the 
values shown in the figure that follows step 4.
 Note: If you don’t 
see the controls, choose 
View Options from the 
Composition panel 
menu. In the View 
Options dialog box, 
select the Handles and 
Effect Controls options, 
and then click OK.
E Tip: The lower right 
corner of the Shadows 
layer is offscreen. To 
adjust that corner, 
switch to the Hand tool 
(
), and drag up in the 
Composition panel so 
that you can see some 
of the pasteboard 
below the image. Then 
switch back to the 
Selection tool ( ), and 
drag the lower right 
corner-pin handle to the 
approximate location of 
the lower right corner of 
the glass tabletop.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 169
4 Set a keyframe for each corner at 6:00 by clicking the stopwatch icon ( ) for 
each position in the Effect Controls panel.
5 Press the End key, or move the current-time indicator to the last frame of the 
composition. 
6 Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the two lower corner-pin handles to shorten 
the shadows: Drag them about 25% closer to the back edge of the tabletop. You 
may also need to move the two upper corners in slightly so that the bases of the 
shadows still align properly with the vase and the clock. Your corner-pin values 
should be similar to those in the figure below; you can enter the values directly if 
you prefer not to drag the corners. After Effects adds keyframes.
7 If necessary, select the Hand tool (
), and drag the composition down to center 
it vertically in the Composition panel. Then switch back to the Selection tool, 
and deselect the layer.

9 Choose File > Save to save your project.
adding a lens flare effect
In photography, when bright light (such as sunlight) reflects off the lens of a 
camera, it causes a flare effect. Lens flares can be bright, colorful circles and halos, 
depending on the type of lens in the camera. After Effects offers a few lens flare 
effects. You’ll add one now to enhance the realism of this time-lapse photography 
composition.
1 Go to 5:10, where the sun is shining brightly into the lens of the camera. 
2 Choose Layer > New > Solid. 
3 In the Solid Settings dialog 
box, name the layer Lens 
Flare, and click the Make 
Comp Size button. Then set 
the Color to black by clicking 
the swatch and setting all the 
RGB values to 0 in the Solid 
Color dialog box. Click OK 
to return to the Solid Settings 
dialog box.
4 Click OK to create the Lens 
Flare layer. 
5 With the Lens Flare layer selected in the sunrise Timeline panel, choose  
Effect > Generate > Lens Flare. The Composition panel and the Effect Controls 
panel display the visual and numeric default Lens Flare settings, respectively; 
you’ll customize the effect for this composition.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 171
6 Drag the Flare Center cross-hair icon ( ) in the Composition panel to the  
center of the sun. You cannot see the sun in the Composition panel; the  
x, y coordinates, which you can read in the Effect Controls or Info panel,  
are approximately 455, 135. 
7 In the Effect Controls panel, change the Lens Type to 35mm Prime, a more 
diffuse flare effect.
8 Make sure you’re still at 5:10. In the Effect Controls panel, click the stopwatch 
icon ( ) for the Flare Brightness property to set a keyframe at the default value 
of 100%. 
9 Adjust the brightness of the lens flare to peak when the sun is highest: 
• Go to 3:27, and set the Flare Brightness value to 0%.
• Go to 6:27, and set the Flare Brightness value to 0%, also. 
• Go to 6:00, and set the Flare Brightness to 100%.
10  With the Lens Flare layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Layer > 
Blending Mode > Screen to change the blending mode.
11  Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler, and then press the spacebar to preview the Lens Flare effect. When 
you’re done, press the spacebar again.
12  Choose File > Save to save your project.
E Tip: You can also 
enter the Flare Center 
values directly in the 
Effect Controls panel.
E Tip: You can also 
choose Screen from the 
Mode pop-up menu in 
the Timeline panel.

lesson 6 
Animating layers
animating the clock
The animation now looks very much like a time-lapse photo—except the clock isn’t 
working yet! The hands of the clock should be spinning quickly to show the 
progress of time. To show this, you will add an animation that was created specifi-
cally for this scene. The animation was created in After Effects as a set of 3D layers 
that are lit, textured, and masked to blend into the scene.
1 Bring the Project panel forward. 
Close the sunrise Layers folder, 
and then double-click an empty 
area in the panel to open the 
Import File dialog box.
2 In the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/
Lesson06/Assets folder,  
select the clock.mov file, and 
click Open.
The QuickTime movie clock.mov now appears at the top of the Project panel.
3 Click in the sunrise Timeline panel to make it active, and then go to the 
beginning of the time ruler. Drag the clock.mov footage item from the  
Project panel to the top of the layer stack in the Timeline panel. 
4 Preview the animation by pressing the spacebar. Press the spacebar again to stop 
playback when you’re done.
5 Choose File > Save to save the project.
rendering the animation
To prepare for the next task—retiming the composition—you need to render the 
sunrise composition and export it as a movie.
 Note: You’ll learn 
more about 3D layers in 
Lessons 10, 11, and 12.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 173
1 Select the sunrise composition in the Project panel, and then choose 
Composition > Add To Render Queue.
The Render Queue panel opens. 
2 Choose Maximize Frame from the 
Render Queue panel menu to make the 
panel larger.
3 Accept the default Render Settings in the Render Queue panel. Then click the 
orange, underlined words Not Yet Specified next to the Output To pop-up menu.
4 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson06/Assets folder, and name the file 
Lesson06_retime.avi (Windows) or Lesson06_retime.mov (Mac OS). Then 
click Save.
5 Expand the Output Module group, and then choose Import from the Post-
Render Action menu. This will import the movie file when it’s done.
6 Hide the Output Module section.
7 Click the Render button in the Render Queue panel.

174 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
After Effects displays a progress bar as it renders and exports the composition, and 
plays an audio alert when it is finished. It also imports the resulting movie file into 
the project.
8 When After Effects has finished rendering and exporting the composition, 
choose Restore Frame Size from the Render Queue panel menu, and then close 
the Render Queue panel. 
retiming the composition
So far, you have created a straightforward time-lapse simulation. That’s fine, but 
After Effects offers more ways to play with time using the time-remapping feature. 
Time remapping lets you dynamically speed up, slow down, stop, or reverse footage. 
You can also use it to do things like create a freeze-frame result. The Graph Editor 
and the Layer panel are a big help when remapping time, as you’ll see in the follow-
ing exercise, when you retime the project so that the time-lapse speed changes over 
the course of the movie.
For this exercise, you’ll use the movie that you just imported as the basis of a new 
composition, which will be easier to remap than the original.
1 Drag the Lesson06_retime movie onto the Create A New Composition  
button (
) at the bottom of the Project panel. After Effects creates a new 
composition named Lesson06_retime, and displays it in the Timeline and 
Composition panels. Now you can remap all of the elements of the project  
at once.
2 With the Lesson06_retime layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Layer > 
Time > Enable Time Remapping. After Effects adds two keyframes, at the first 
and last frames of the layer, visible in the time ruler. A Time Remap property 
also appears under the layer name in the Timeline panel; this property lets you 
control which frame is displayed at a given point in time.
E Tip: You can get 
even finer control with 
the Timewarp effect, 
which you’ll use in 
Lesson 13.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 175
3 Double-click the Lesson06_retime layer name in the Timeline panel to open it in 
the Layer panel. 
The Layer panel provides a visual reference of the frames you change when you 
remap time. It displays two time rulers: The time ruler at the bottom of the panel 
displays the current time. The Source Time ruler, just above the time ruler, has a 
remap-time marker that indicates which frame is playing at the current time.
4 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler in the Timeline panel, and 
notice that the source-time and current-time markers in the two Layer panel 
rulers are synchronized. That will change as you remap time.
5 Go to 4:00, and change the Time Remap value to 2:00. This remaps time so that 
frame 2:00 plays at 4:00. In other words, the composition now plays back at 
half-speed for the first 4 seconds of the composition.

176 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
6 Press the spacebar to preview the animation. The composition now runs at half-
speed until 4:00, and at a regular speed thereafter. Press the spacebar again when 
you have finished previewing the animation.
viewing time remapping in the Graph editor
Using the Graph Editor, you can view and manipulate all aspects of effects and ani-
mations, including effect property values, keyframes, and interpolation. The Graph 
Editor displays changes in effects and animations as a two-dimensional graph, 
with playback time represented horizontally (from left to right). In layer bar mode, 
in contrast, the time ruler represents only the horizontal time element, without a 
graphical display of changing values. 
1 Make sure the Time Remap property is selected for the Lesson06_retime layer 
in the Timeline panel.
2 Click the Graph Editor button (
) to display the Graph Editor.
The Graph Editor displays a time-remap graph that shows a white line connecting 
the keyframes at 0:00, 4:00, and 10:00. The angle of the line is shallow up to 4:00, 
and then becomes steeper. The steeper the line, the faster the playback time.
Using the Graph editor to remap time
When remapping time, you can use the values in the time-remap graph to deter-
mine and control which frame of the movie plays at which point in time. Each Time 
Remap keyframe has a time value associated with it that corresponds to a specific 
frame in the layer; this value is represented vertically on the time-remap graph. 
When you enable time remapping for a layer, After Effects adds a Time Remap key-
frame at the start and end points of the layer. These initial Time Remap keyframes 
have vertical time values equal to their horizontal position.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 177
By setting additional Time Remap keyframes, you can create complex motion 
effects. Every time you add a Time Remap keyframe, you create another point at 
which you can change the playback speed or direction. As you move the keyframe 
up or down in the time-remap graph, you adjust which frame of the video is set to 
play at the current time.
Have some fun with the timing of this project.
1 In the time-remap graph, drag the middle keyframe vertically from 2 up to  
10 seconds.
2 Drag the last keyframe down to 0 seconds. 
3 Go to 0:00, and then press the spacebar to preview the results. Watch the time 
ruler and Source Time ruler in the Layer panel to see which frames are playing 
at any given point in time. Now the animation progresses rapidly over the 
first 4 seconds of the composition, and then plays in reverse for the rest of the 
composition.
4 Press the spacebar to stop the preview.
Having fun yet? Keep going.
5 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the last keyframe to delete 
it. The composition is still in fast-forward mode for the first 4 seconds, but now 
it holds on a single frame (the last frame) for the rest of the composition.
6 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of 
the time ruler, and then press the spacebar to preview the animation. Press the 
spacebar again when you’re done.
7 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the dotted line at 6:00 to add 
a keyframe at 6:00 with the same value as the keyframe at 4:00.
E Tip: Watch the Info 
panel as you drag to see 
more information as you 
adjust the keyframe. 
 Note: Pressing 
Ctrl or Command 
temporarily activates 
the Add Vertex tool.

178 
lesson 6 
Animating layers
8 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) at 10:00 to add another 
keyframe, and then drag it down to 0 seconds. Now the animation progresses 
rapidly, holds for two seconds on the last frame, and then runs in reverse.
9 Go to the beginning of the composition, and then press the spacebar to preview 
the change. Press the spacebar again when you’re done.
adding an easy ease Out
Soften the shift in time that occurs at 6 seconds with an Easy Ease Out.
1 Click to select the keyframe at 6:00, and then click the Easy Ease Out button (
)
at the bottom of the Graph Editor. This slows the shift into reverse—the footage 
runs slowly in reverse at first, and then gradually speeds up.
2 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
E Tip: You can refine 
the amount of ease on 
this transition further 
by dragging the Bezier 
handle that appears out 
of the right side of the 
keyframe at 6:00. If you 
drag it to the right, the 
transition is softer; if 
you drag it down or to 
the left, the transition is 
more pronounced.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 179
Scaling the animation in time
Finally, use the Graph Editor to scale the entire animation in time.
1 Click the Time Remap property name in the Timeline panel to select all of the 
Time Remap keyframes. 
2 Make sure the Show Transform Box button (
) at the bottom of the Graph 
Editor is selected; a free-transform selection box should be visible around all of 
the keyframes.
3 Drag one of the upper transform handles from 10 seconds to 5 seconds. The 
entire graph shifts, reducing the top keyframe values and slowing playback. 
4 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of 
the time ruler, and then press the spacebar to preview the change. Press the 
spacebar again when you’re done. 
5 Choose File > Save.
Congratulations. You’ve completed a complex animation, complete with shifts  
in time. You can render and export the time-remap project if you’d like. Follow  
the instructions in “Rendering the animation” in this lesson, or see Lesson 14, 
“Rendering and Outputting,” for detailed instructions on rendering and exporting  
a composition.
E Tip: If you press 
Ctrl (Windows) or 
Command (Mac OS) 
while you drag, the 
entire free-transform 
box scales around the 
center point, which you 
can also drag to offset. If 
you press Alt (Windows) 
or Option (Mac OS) 
and drag one corner 
of the free-transform 
box, the animation is 
skewed in that corner as 
you drag. You can also 
drag one of the right 
transform handles to the 
left to scale the entire 
animation so that it 
happens more quickly.

review answers
1 When you import a layered Photoshop file into After Effects as a composition, After 
Effects preserves the layer order, transparency data, and layer styles from the source 
Photoshop document. It also preserves other features, such as adjustment layers and 
type. When you import a layered Photoshop file as a single footage item, however, 
After Effects flattens and merges the Photoshop layers into one image.
2 The pick whip creates expressions that link the values of one property or effect to 
another layer. The pick whip is also a way to create parenting relationships. To use the 
pick whip, simply drag the pick whip icon from one property to another.
3 When you want one layer to show through a hole in another layer, you can use a track 
matte. To create a track matte, you need two layers: one to act as a matte, and another 
to fill the hole in the matte. You can animate either the track matte layer or the fill 
layer. When you animate the track matte layer, you create a traveling matte.
4 There are several ways to remap time in After Effects. Time remapping lets you 
dynamically speed up, slow down, stop, or reverse footage. When remapping time, 
you can use the values in the time-remap graph in the Graph Editor to determine 
and control which frame of the movie plays at which point in time. When you enable 
time remapping for a layer, After Effects adds a Time Remap keyframe at the start and 
end points of the layer. By setting additional Time Remap keyframes, you can create 
complex motion effects. Every time you add a Time Remap keyframe, you create 
another point at which you can change the playback speed or direction.

lesson 7 Working with masks
about masks
A mask in Adobe After Effects is a path, or outline, that is used to modify layer 
effects and properties. The most common use of masks is to modify a layer’s alpha 
channel. A mask consists of segments and vertices: Segments are the lines or curves 
that connect vertices. Vertices define where each segment of a path starts and ends.
A mask can be either an open or a closed path. An open path has a beginning point 
that is not the same as its end point; for example, a straight line is an open path. 
A closed path is continuous and has no beginning or end, such as a circle. Closed-
path masks can create transparent areas for a layer. Open paths cannot create 
transparent areas for a layer, but are useful as parameters for an effect. For example, 
you can use an effect to generate a running light around a mask.
A mask belongs to a specific layer. Each layer can contain multiple masks.
You can draw masks in common geometric shapes—including polygons,  
ellipses, and stars—with the shape tools, or you can use the Pen tool to draw  
an arbitrary path.
Getting started
In this lesson, you will create a mask for the screen of a desktop computer and 
replace the screen’s original content with a TV news promo. Then you’ll adjust the 
positioning of the new footage so that it fits the perspective of the shot. Finally, 
you’ll polish the scene by adding a reflection, creating a vignette effect, and adjust-
ing the color. 
Begin by previewing the movie and setting up the project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson07 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: news_promo.mov, office_mask.mov
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson07.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson07.mov sample movie to see what you will create  
in this lesson. When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete  
the sample movie from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 185
When you begin the lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file. Click Close to close 
the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a new, untitled project.
4 Choose File > Save As > Save As, and navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/
Lesson07/Finished_Project folder.
5 Name the project Lesson07_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
Importing the footage
You’ll import two footage items for this exercise.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson07/Assets folder, Shift-click to 
select the news_promo.mov and office_mask.mov files, and then click Open.
3  In the Interpret Footage dialog box that appears, select Ignore, and then  
click OK. 
There’s an alpha channel in the news_promo movie, but it isn’t needed for this 
project.
You’ll start by organizing the files in the Project panel.

186 
lesson 7 Working with masks
about the Interpret Footage  
dialog box
After Effects uses a set of internal rules to automatically interpret footage that you 
import. Generally, you don’t need to change these settings. However, if your footage 
isn’t standard, After Effects may interpret it incorrectly. In that case, you can use the 
settings in the Interpret Footage dialog box to reinterpret your footage. The settings 
in the Interpret Footage dialog box should match your source footage settings; 
don’t use it to specify settings for your final rendered output.
When you choose Ignore, you instruct After Effects to disregard all transparency 
data in the file.
For more information on the settings in the Interpret Footage dialog box, see  
After Effects Help.
4 Choose File > New > New Folder to create a new folder in the Project panel, or 
click the Create A New Folder button ( ) at the bottom of the Project panel.
5 Type mov_files to name the folder, 
press Enter or Return to accept 
the name, and then drag the two 
movies into the mov_files folder.
6 Click the triangle to expand the 
folder so that you can see the 
footage items inside.
Creating the composition
Now, you’ll create the composition based on the aspect ratio and duration of one of 
the footage items.
1 Select the office_mask.mov footage item in the Project panel, and drag it to the 
Create A New Composition button (
) at the bottom of the panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 187
After Effects creates a composition named office_mask, and opens it in the 
Composition and Timeline panels.
2 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
Creating a mask with the Pen tool
The computer screen currently contains a word-processing document. To replace  
it with the news promo, you need to mask the screen.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 Zoom in to the Composition panel until the monitor screen nearly fills the view. 
You may need to use the Hand tool (
) to reposition the view in the panel.
3 Select the Pen tool ( ) in the Tools panel. The Pen tool creates straight lines or 
curved segments. The monitor appears to be rectangular, so you’ll try using 
straight lines first.
4 Click the upper left corner of the monitor screen to place the first vertex.
5 Click the upper right corner of the monitor to place the second vertex.  
After Effects connects the two points with a segment.
6 Click to place a third vertex in the lower right corner of the monitor, and then 
click to place a fourth vertex in the lower left corner of the monitor.
7 Move the Pen tool over the first vertex (in the upper left corner). When a circle 
appears next to the pointer (as in the middle image below), click to close the 
mask path.
E Tip: You can also 
create a mask using the 
Mocha Shapes plug-in, 
which comes with After 
Effects CS6, and then 
import it into After 
Effects. To learn more 
about using the plug-in, 
see After Effects Help.

188 
lesson 7 Working with masks
editing a mask
The mask looks pretty good, but instead of masking the information inside the 
monitor, the mask has removed everything outside the monitor. So you need to 
invert the mask. (Alternatively, you could change the mask mode, which is set  
to Add by default.)
about mask modes
Blending modes for masks (mask modes) control how masks within a layer  
interact with one another. By default, all masks are set to Add, which combines the 
transparency values of any masks that overlap on the same layer. You can apply one 
mode to each mask, but you cannot change a mask’s mode over time.
The first mask you create interacts with the layer’s alpha channel. If that channel 
doesn’t define the entire image as opaque, then the mask interacts with the layer 
frame. Each additional mask that you create interacts with masks located above it in 
the Timeline panel. The results of mask modes vary depending on the modes set for 
the masks higher up in the Timeline panel. You can use mask modes only between 
masks in the same layer. Using mask modes, you can create complex mask shapes 
with multiple transparent areas. For example, you can set a mask mode that combines 
two masks and sets the opaque area to the areas where the two masks intersect.

Inverting the mask
For this project, you need everything inside the mask to be transparent and every-
thing outside the mask to be opaque. You’ll invert the mask now. 
1 Select the office_mask layer in the Timeline panel, and press the M key to see the 
Mask Path property for the mask.
E Tip: Pressing the 
M key twice in quick 
succession displays all 
mask properties for the 
selected layer.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 189
There are two ways to invert this mask: by choosing Subtract from the Mask Mode 
pop-up menu, or by selecting the Inverted option.
2 Select the Inverted option for Mask 1.
The mask inverts.
3 Press F2, or click an empty area of the Timeline panel, to deselect the  
office_mask layer. 
If you look closely at the monitor, you will prob-
ably see portions of the screen still appearing 
around the edges of the mask.
These errors will certainly call attention to 
changes being made to the layer, and they 
need to be fixed. To fix them, you’ll change the 
straight lines to curves.
Creating curved masks
Curved or freeform masks use Bezier curves to define the shape of the mask. Bezier 
curves give you the greatest control over the shape of the mask. With them, you can 
create straight lines with sharp angles, perfectly smooth curves, or a combination  
of the two.
1 In the Timeline panel, select Mask 1, the mask for the office_mask layer. 
Selecting Mask 1 makes the mask active and also selects all the vertices.
2 In the Tools panel, select the Convert Vertex tool ( ), which is hidden behind the 
Pen tool.
E Tip: The keyboard 
shortcut for the Pen 
tool is G. Press the G key 
multiple times to cycle 
through all of the pen-
related tools.

190 
lesson 7 Working with masks
3 In the Composition panel, click any of the vertices. The Convert Vertex tool 
changes the corner vertices to smooth points.
4 Switch to the Selection tool ( ), click anywhere in the Composition panel to 
deselect the mask, and then click the first vertex that you created.
Two direction handles extend off the smooth point. The angle and length of these 
handles control the shape of the mask.
5 Drag the right handle of the first vertex around the screen. Notice how this 
changes this shape of the mask. Notice also that the closer you drag the handle 
to another vertex, the less the shape of the path is influenced by the direction 
handle of the first vertex, and the more it is influenced by the direction handle 
of the second vertex.
	
Drag the handle.
6 Once you are comfortable moving the handles, position the handle of the  
upper left vertex as in the preceding figure. As you have seen, you can create 
very fluid shapes.
Breaking direction handles
By default, the direction handles of any smooth point are connected to one  
another. As you drag one handle, the opposite handle moves as well. However, you 
can break this connection to get greater control over the shape of the mask, and 
you can create sharp points or long, smooth curves.
1 Select the Convert Vertex tool ( ) in the Tools panel.
2 Drag the right direction handle of the upper left vertex. The left direction 
handle remains stationary.
E Tip: If you make 
a mistake, press 
Ctrl+Z (Windows) or 
Command+Z (Mac OS) 
to undo your last action. 
You can also change 
the zoom level and 
use the Hand tool to 
reposition the image in 
the Composition panel 
as you work.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 191
3 Adjust the right direction handle until the top segment of the mask shape  
more closely follows the curve of the monitor in that corner. It doesn’t have  
to be perfect.
4 Drag the left direction handle of the same vertex until the left segment of the 
shape more closely follows the curve of the monitor in that corner.
Drag the right direction handle of the upper left vertex, and then  
the left direction handle, to follow the curve of the monitor.
5 For each of the remaining corner points, click with the Convert Vertex tool, and 
then repeat steps 2–4 until the mask’s shape more closely matches the curvature 
of the monitor. If you need to shift a corner point, use the Selection tool.
6 When you’re done, deselect the office_mask layer in the Timeline panel to check 
the edge of your mask. You should not see any of the monitor screen.
7 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Creating a Bezier mask
You used the Convert Vertex tool to change a corner vertex to a smooth point  
with Bezier handles, but you could have created a Bezier mask in the first place.  
To do so, click in the Composition panel with the Pen tool where you want to place 
the first vertex. Then click where you want to place the next vertex, and drag in the 
direction you want to create a curve. When you are satisfied with the curve, release 
the mouse button. Continue to add points until you’ve created the shape you want. 
Close the mask by either clicking on the first vertex or double-clicking the last  
vertex. Then switch to the Selection tool to refine the mask.
E Tip: Again, you may 
need to adjust your 
view in the Composition 
panel as you work. You 
can drag the image 
with the Hand tool. To 
temporarily switch to 
the Hand tool, press and 
hold the spacebar.

lesson 7 Working with masks
Feathering the edges of a mask
The mask looks good, but you need to soften the edges a bit.
1 Choose Composition > Composition Settings.
2 Click the Background Color box, and choose white for the background color 
(R=255, G=255, B=255). Then click OK to close the Color Picker, and OK again  
to close the Composition Settings dialog box.
The white background allows you to see that the edge of the monitor screen looks  
a little too sharp and unrealistic. To address this, you’ll feather, or soften, the edges.
3 Select the office_mask layer in the Timeline panel, and press the F key to display 
the Mask Feather property for the mask.
4 Increase the Mask Feather amount to 1.5, 1.5 pixels.
5 Hide the properties for the office_mask layer, and then choose File > Save  
to save your work.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 193
replacing the content of the mask
You are now ready to replace the background with the TV news promo movie and 
blend it with the overall shot.
1 In the Project panel, select the news_promo.mov file, and drag it to the Timeline 
panel, placing it below the office_mask layer.
2 Choose Fit Up To 100% from the Magnification Ratio pop-up menu at the 
bottom of the Composition panel so that you can see the whole composition.
3  Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the news_promo layer in the Composition 
panel until the anchor point is centered in the monitor screen.
repositioning and resizing the news clip
The news promo clip is too big for the monitor screen, so you’ll resize it as a 3D layer, 
which will give you more control over its shape and size.
1 With the news_promo layer selected in the Timeline panel, turn on the 3D 
switch for the layer.
2 Press the P key to show the Position property for the news_promo layer. 
The Position property for a 3D layer has three values: From left to right, they 
represent the x, y, and z axes of the image. The z axis controls the depth of the  
layer. You can see these axes represented in the Composition panel.
 Note: You’ll learn 
more about 3D layers in 
Lessons 10, 11, and 12.

194 
lesson 7 Working with masks
3 Position the pointer in the Composition panel over the red arrow so that a  
small x appears. The red arrow controls the x (horizontal) axis of the layer. 
4 Drag left or right as necessary to center the clip horizontally in the monitor screen.
5 Position the pointer in the Composition panel over the green arrow so that  
a small y appears. Then drag up or down as necessary to position the clip 
vertically in the monitor screen.
6 Position the pointer in the Composition panel over the blue cube where the red 
and green arrows meet so that a small z appears. Then drag down and to the 
right to increase the depth of field. 
7 Continue to drag the x, y, and z axes until the entire clip fits into the monitor 
screen, as shown in the following image. The final x, y, and z values should be 
approximately 114, 219, 365.
rotating the clip
The news clip fits better, but you need to rotate it slightly to improve the 
perspective.
1 Select the news_promo layer in the Timeline panel, and press the R key to reveal 
its Rotation properties. Again, since this is a 3D layer, you can control rotation 
on the x, y, and z axes.
2 Change the Y Rotation value to -10 degrees. This swivels the layer to match the 
perspective of the monitor.
3 Change the Z Rotation value to -2 degrees to align the layer with the monitor.
E Tip: You can also 
enter the Position 
values directly in the 
Timeline panel instead 
of dragging in the 
Composition panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 195
Your composition should now resemble the preceding image.
4 Hide the properties for the news_promo layer, and then choose File > Save to 
save your work.
adding a reflection
The masked image looks convincing, but you can make it look even more realistic 
by adding a reflection to the monitor.
1 Choose Layer > New > Solid. 
2 In the Solid Settings dialog box, name the layer Reflection, click the Make 
Comp Size button, change the Color to white, and then click OK.
Instead of trying to exactly re-create the shape of the office_mask layer’s mask,  
it is easier to copy it to the Reflection layer.
3 Select the office_mask layer in the Timeline panel, and press the M key  
to display the Mask Path property for the mask.
4 Select Mask 1, and then choose Edit > Copy or press Ctrl+C (Windows)  
or Command+C (Mac OS).
5 Select the Reflection layer in the Timeline panel, and then choose Edit > Paste 
or press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS). 
This time, you want to keep the area inside the mask opaque and make the area 
outside the mask transparent.
6 Select the office_mask layer, and then press U to hide the mask properties.

196 
lesson 7 Working with masks
7 Select the Reflection layer in the Timeline panel, and press the F key to reveal the 
Mask 1 Mask Feather property for the layer.
8 Change the Mask Feather value to 0 (zero).
9 Deselect the Inverted option. The Reflection layer now obscures the  
news_promo layer.
10 Zoom in to see the screen, and then select the Mask Feather tool ( ), hidden 
beneath the Convert Vertex tool ( ), in the Tools panel. 
When you feather a mask, the width of the feather is the same all the way around 
the mask. The Mask Feather Tool lets you vary the feathering width at points you 
define on the closed mask. 
11 Click the Reflection layer in the Timeline 
panel to select it. Then click the lower left 
vertex to create a feather point, and drag 
that feather point inward so that about one 
quarter of the screen is reflected, as in the 
image at right. 
Currently the feather extends evenly across 
the mask. You’ll add more feather points for 
greater flexibility.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 197
12 Click in the center of the top of the mask to create another feather point. Then 
drag the feather point down slightly, into the mask.
13 Right-click or Control-click the feather point you just created, and choose Edit 
Radius. Change the Radius to 0, and click OK.
This is a good start, but the sides slope in too sharply. You’ll add more feather 
points to change the angle.
14 Add another feather point by clicking the 
left edge of the matte, about one-third of the 
way from the top. 
15 Add a similar feather point on the right side. 
The shape of the reflection is good, but it’s 
obscuring the image. You’ll change the opacity 
to reduce its effect.
16 Select the Reflection layer in the Timeline 
panel, and then press the T key  
to reveal the Opacity property. Change its value to 25%.
17 Press T to hide the Opacity property, and then press F2 or click an empty area  
in the Timeline panel to deselect all layers.

198 
lesson 7 Working with masks
applying a blending mode
To create unique interactions between layers, you may want to experiment with 
blending modes. Blending modes control how each layer blends with, or reacts to,  
layers beneath it. Blending modes for layers in After Effects are identical to blend-
ing modes in Adobe Photoshop.
1 In the Timeline panel menu, choose Columns > Modes to display the Mode  
pop-up menu.
2 Choose Add from the Reflection layer’s Mode pop-up menu.
This creates a hard glare on the monitor screen image and boosts the colors 
underneath.
3 Choose File > Save to save your work.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 199
adding a 3D light layer
Instead of creating the reflection using a solid layer and a feathered mask, you  
could also use a 3D light layer to create realistic surface reflection. As noted earlier, 
you’ll learn more about 3D layers, including using 3D light layers, in Lessons 10, 11, 
and 12. If you’re ambitious, however, you can follow these steps to create a 3D light 
layer now with this project. This exercise is optional.
1
Hide the Reflection layer by clicking its Video switch.
2
Choose Layer > New > Light.
3
Click OK to accept the default values in the Light Settings dialog box.
4
With the Light 1 layer selected in the Timeline panel, press P to display its 
Position property. The Position property affects the placement of the light in  
the scene.
5
Set the Position values for the Light 1 layer to 260, -10, -350, which moves the 
light above the monitor and off the image.
6
Select the Light 1 layer in the Timeline panel, and press A to reveal its Point Of 
Interest property. The point of interest determines where the light is “looking.”
7
Set the Point Of Interest values to 135, 200, 0.
8
Select the news_promo.mov layer in the Timeline panel, and press AA to reveal 
the layer’s Material Options properties. Material Options properties determine 
how a 3D layer interacts with light and shadow, both of which are important 
components of realism and perspective in 3D animation. 
9
Increase the Specular Intensity value to 75% and the Specular Shininess value  
to 50%. 
10 Lower the Metal value to 50%. The Metal value determines how much of the 
layer’s color reflects the light. Because there are dark blues in the layer, little light 
is being reflected. Because you are simulating glass in front of the layer, lowering 
this value causes the reflection to take on the same color as the light.
11 Hide the properties for the news_promo.mov layer. 
That’s it. You’ve created the same effect using a 3D light layer.

200 
lesson 7 Working with masks
Creating a vignette
A popular effect in motion graphic design is to apply a vignette to the composition. 
This is often done to simulate light variations of a glass lens. It creates an interest-
ing look that focuses the attention on the subject and sets the shot apart.
1 Zoom out to see the whole image.
2 Choose Layer > New > Solid. 
3 In the Solid Settings dialog  
box, name this layer Vignette, 
click the Make Comp Size 
button, change the Color to 
black (R=0, G=0, B=0), and 
then click OK.
In addition to the Pen tool,  
After Effects provides tools that 
let you easily create square and 
elliptical masks.
4 In the Tools panel, select the Ellipse tool ( ), hidden behind the Rectangle  
tool ( ). 
5 In the Composition panel, position 
the cross-hair pointer in the upper left 
corner of the image. Drag to the opposite 
corner to create an elliptical shape that 
fills the image. Adjust the shape and 
position using the Selection tool, if 
necessary.
6 Expand the Mask 1 property in the Vignette layer to display all of the mask 
properties for the layer.
7 Choose Subtract from the Mask 1 Mode pop-up menu.
8 Increase the Mask Feather amount to 200, 200 pixels.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 201
Using the rectangle and  
ellipse tools
The Rectangle tool, as the name suggests, creates a rectangle or square. The Ellipse 
tool creates an ellipse or circle. You create mask shapes with these tools by dragging 
them in the Composition or Layer panel. 
If you want to draw a perfect square or circle, press the Shift key as you drag with 
the Rectangle tool or the Ellipse tool. To create your mask from the center, press 
Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) after you start to drag. Press Ctrl+Shift or 
Command+Shift after you start to drag to create a perfect square or circle mask 
from a center anchor point.
Be careful! If you use these tools without a layer selected, you’ll draw a shape, not 
a mask.
Your composition should now resemble the following figure.
Even with this large feather amount, the vignette is a bit intense and constrict-
ing. You can give the composition more breathing room by adjusting the Mask 
Expansion property. The Mask Expansion property represents, in pixels, how far 
from the original mask edge you are expanding or contracting the adjusted edge.
9 Increase Mask Expansion to 90 pixels.
10 Hide the properties for the Vignette layer, and then choose File > Save.

lesson 7 Working with masks
tips for creating masks
If you have worked with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or similar applications,  
you’re probably familiar with masks and Bezier curves. If not, here are a few addi-
tional tips to help you create them effectively:
•
Use as few vertices as possible.
•
As you saw in this lesson, you can close a mask by clicking the starting vertex. 
You can also open a closed mask: Click a mask segment, choose Layer > Mask 
And Shape Path, and deselect Closed.
•
To add points to an open path, press Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS), and 
click the last point on the path with the Pen tool. When the point is selected, you 
can continue adding points.
adjusting the color
The shot is looking quite polished, but the color of the office_mask.mov layer  
is rather dull. Warming it up will make the image really pop.
1 Select the office_mask.mov layer in the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Effect > Color Correction > 
Auto Levels. The Auto Levels effect sets 
highlights and shadows by defining the 
lightest and darkest pixels in each color 
channel as white and black, and then 
redistributing intermediate pixel values 
proportionately. Because Auto Levels 
adjusts each color channel individually, it 
may remove or introduce color casts.
Why apply this effect? Sometimes video cameras favor a certain color channel that 
makes the image cooler (bluer) or warmer (redder). The Auto Levels effect sets the 
black and white pixels for each channel, so the end result looks much more natural.
The color of the office_mask.mov layer should look much better now.
3 Choose File > Save to save the finished project.
In this lesson you have worked with the mask tools to hide, reveal, and adjust por-
tions of a composition to create a stylized inset shot. Next to keyframes, masks are 
probably the most-used feature of After Effects. 
You can preview the clip now, if you’d like, or render and export it following the 
steps in Lesson 14, “Rendering and Outputting.”

Creating a matte with the roto Brush tool
When you draw or paint on the frames of a movie, you’re rotoscoping. For example, a common use of 
rotoscoping is to trace an object, using the path as a mask to separate it from the background so you 
can work with it separately. Traditionally, this has been a time-consuming process, but the Roto Brush 
tool makes it much easier.
You use the Roto Brush tool to define the foreground and background elements; then, After Effects 
creates a matte and tracks the movement of the matte over time. There are 5 basic steps to rotoscop-
ing with the Roto Brush tool: define a segmentation boundary in a base frame, refine the boundary 
across the initial span, add new base frames as needed, freeze the results, and fine-tune your matte.
Creating a base frame
Start by adding foreground and background strokes to a base frame, creating a segmentation bound-
ary between the foreground and background. 
1
Select the Roto Brush tool in the Tools panel, and select an appropriate brush size for your content. 
2
Double-click the layer in the Timeline panel to open it in the Layer panel, where you use the Roto 
Brush tool. 
3
Draw green strokes to define the foreground object. Start in the center of the object; you don’t 
need to define a precise boundary. 
After Effects identifies the boundary of the object with a pink outline. 

204 
lesson 7 Working with masks
Sidebar head
Sidebar Text
4
Adjust the outline by adding more green strokes for additional foreground area. Or, to remove 
part of the area from the outlined area, press Alt or Option to draw red strokes that identify the 
area as background. 
refining the boundary
When you create the base frame, After Effects applies the segmentation boundary across an initial 
span of 20 frames. Step through those frames, and use the Roto Brush tool to draw foreground and 
background strokes to refine the boundary on each frame as necessary.
adding new base frames
The span of frames increases as you move through it, and you can extend the span by dragging it. 
However, the further you move from the base frame, the longer it takes After Effects to calculate the 
segmentation for each frame. If the scene changes significantly, it may be more efficient to create 
multiple base frames. 
To add a base frame:
1
Go to a point in the time ruler that isn’t included in the current span. 
2
Use the Roto Brush tool to define the segmentation boundary. 
3
Press 1 to move backward one frame to refine the boundary, and then continue to move 
backward until you reach the previous span. 
4
Move forward from the base frame, correcting the segmentation boundary as you go.
Freezing results
As you move through the clip, After Effects caches the segmentation boundary. To keep that data 
easily accessible, freeze it by clicking the Freeze button in the lower right area of the Layer panel. Note 
that once the segmentation is frozen, you cannot edit it unless you unfreeze it, so it’s best to refine the 
boundary as much as possible before freezing. 
refining the matte
There may be areas of the foreground subject that the Roto Brush tool cannot separate from the back-
ground. You can touch up your matte by painting directly on the alpha channel in individual frames.

review answers
1 A mask in After Effects is a path, or outline, that is used to modify layer effects  
and properties. The most common use of masks is to modify a layer’s alpha channel.  
A mask consists of segments and vertices.
2 You can adjust the shape of a mask by dragging individual vertices, or by dragging  
a segment.
3 A direction handle is used to control the shape and angle of a Bezier curve.
4 An open mask can be used to control effects or the placement of text; it does not 
define a region of transparency. A closed mask defines a region that will affect the 
alpha channel of a layer.
5 The Mask Feather tool lets you vary the width of feathering at different points on  
a mask. With the Mask Feather tool, click to add a Feather point, and then drag it.

lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
Getting started
The Puppet tools in Adobe After Effects let you add natural motion to raster images 
and vector graphics. Three tools create pins to define the point of deformation, 
areas of overlap, and areas that should remain more rigid. An additional tool, the 
Puppet Sketch tool, lets you record animation in real time. In this lesson, you’ll use 
the Puppet tools to animate a character slipping on a banana peel. 
Start by previewing the final movie and then setting up the project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson08 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: backdrop.psd, banana.psd, man.psd
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson08.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson08.mov file to see what you will create in this lesson. 
When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete this sample movie 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin this lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS). When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file. Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a blank, untitled project.
4 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
5 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson08/ 
Finished_Project folder.
6 Name the project Lesson08_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
Importing footage
You’ll import three Adobe Photoshop files, which you’ll use to create the scene.
1 Choose File > Import > File.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson08/Assets folder. Shift-click to 
select the backdrop.psd, banana.psd, and man.psd files, and then click Open. 
The footage items appear in the Project panel.

lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
adding the background
It’s easier to animate a character in context, so first you’ll add the background to 
the composition.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
composition.
2 Drag the backdrop.psd file to the Timeline panel.
3 Lock the layer to prevent accidental changes to it.
Scaling an object
Next, you’ll add the banana peel. At its default size, it’s large enough to do real 
damage to anyone who slips on it. You’ll scale it to a more proportional size for  
the scene.
1 Drag the banana.psd file from the Project panel to the top layer in the  
Timeline panel.
2 Select the banana.psd layer in the Timeline panel, and press S to display its  
Scale property.
3 Change the Scale value to 15%.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 211
4 Press P to display the layer’s Position property.
5 Change the Position to 160, 420. The banana peel moves to the left side of the 
composition.
6 Hide the properties for the banana.psd layer.
adding the character
The last element in the scene is the character himself. You’ll add him to the  
composition and then scale and position him appropriately.
1 Drag the man.psd footage item from the Project panel to the Timeline panel  
at the top of the layer stack.
2
Select the man.psd layer, and press S to display its Scale property.
3
Change the Scale value to 15%.
4
Press P to display the Position property, and change the Position to 575, 300.
5 Press P again to hide the Position property for the layer.
6 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
 Note: In the original 
drawing, the character 
has already slipped on 
the banana peel and 
was falling. To make it 
easier to animate, the 
character has been 
modified to be more 
upright. Sometimes 
you can make your 
work easier by making 
some adjustments 
before animation.

lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
about the Puppet tools
The Puppet tools turn raster and vector images into virtual marionettes. When you 
move the string of a marionette, the body part attached to that string moves; pull 
the string attached to the hand, and the hand goes up. The Puppet tools use pins to 
indicate where strings would be attached. 
The Puppet effect deforms parts of an image based on the positions of pins that you 
place and animate. These pins determine which parts of the image should move, 
which parts should remain rigid, and which parts should be in front when areas 
overlap.
There are three kinds of pins, each placed by a different tool:
• The Puppet Pin tool ( ) places and moves Deform pins, which deform a layer. 
• The Puppet Overlap tool (
) places Overlap pins, which indicate the parts of an 
image that should be in the front when areas overlap.
• The Puppet Starch tool (
) places Starch pins, which stiffen parts of the image 
so that they are distorted less. 
As soon as you place a pin, the area within an outline is automatically divided into 
a mesh of triangles. Each part of the mesh is associated with the pixels of the image, 
so as the mesh moves, so do the pixels. When you animate a Deform pin, the mesh 
deforms more in the area closest to the pin, while keeping the overall shape as rigid 
as possible. For example, if you animate a pin in a character’s hand, the hand and 
arm will be deformed, but most of the character will remain in place. 
adding Deform pins
Deform pins are the main component of the Puppet effect. Where you place these 
pins and how you position them determine how the objects move on the screen. 
You’ll place Deform pins and display the mesh that After Effects creates to deter-
mine the area of influence for each pin.
When you select the Puppet Pin tool, the Tools panel displays the Puppet tool 
options. Each pin has its own properties in the Timeline panel, and After Effects 
automatically creates an initial keyframe for each pin.
 Note: The mesh is 
calculated at the frame 
where the Deform pins 
are applied. If you add 
more pins anywhere  
in the timeline, they  
are placed based on  
the original position  
of the mesh.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 213
1 Select the Puppet Pin tool ( ) in the Tools 
panel. 
2 In the Composition panel, place a Deform pin 
in the character’s right arm, near the wrist. 
You may find it helpful to zoom in to see the 
character more clearly. A yellow dot 
representing the Deform pin appears in the 
Composition panel. 
If at this point you were to use the Selection tool ( ) to move the Deform pin, the 
entire character would move with it. You need more pins to keep the other parts  
of the mesh in place. 
3 Using the Puppet Pin tool, place another 
Deform pin in the left arm near the wrist.
Now you can move the right hand with the 
Selection tool. The more pins you place, the 
smaller the area of influence for each pin, and the 
less each area will stretch. If you experimented, 
undo any stretching by pressing Ctrl+Z (Windows) 
or Command+Z (Mac OS).
4 Place additional Deform pins in the man’s right 
and left legs (near the ankles), torso (near the bottom of the tie), and forehead.
5 In the Timeline panel, expand the Mesh 1 > Deform properties. Each Deform 
pin is listed. To keep track of each pin, you’ll rename them.
6 Select Puppet Pin 1, press Enter or Return, and rename the pin Right Arm. 
Press Enter or Return again to accept the new name. 
7 Rename the remaining pins (Puppet Pin 2 through Puppet Pin 6) Left Arm, 
Right Leg, Left Leg, Torso, and Head, respectively.
 Note: Be careful! 
The character’s right 
arm is on the left side 
of the image, and vice 
versa. Pin the character 
according to his left and 
right, not yours!

lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
8 Select Show in the options section of the Tools panel to display the  
distortion mesh.
9 Change the Triangles value in the options section of the Tools panel to 300. This 
setting determines how many triangles are included in the mesh. Increasing 
the number of triangles results in a smoother animation, but also increases 
rendering time. 
Defining areas of overlap
Normal human movement requires the arms to swing, so as the character walks 
across the screen, portions of his right arm and leg will be behind other areas of his 
body. You’ll use the Puppet Overlap tool to define the areas that should appear in 
front when areas overlap.
1 Select the Puppet Overlap tool (
), which is hidden behind the Puppet Pin tool 
in the Tools panel.
2 Select Show in the options area of the Tools panel to view the distortion mesh.
3 Zoom in, and use the Hand tool (
) to position the man in the Composition 
window so that you can see his torso and legs clearly. Then select the Puppet 
Overlap tool again.
4 In the options area of the Tools panel, change In Front to 100%. The In Front 
value determines the apparent proximity to the viewer; setting the value to 100% 
prevents those parts of the body that are overlapped from showing through.
E Tip: You can extend 
the mesh beyond the 
outline of the layer 
in order to ensure a 
stroke is included in the 
deformation. To expand 
the mesh, increase the 
Expansion property in 
the options section of 
the Tools panel.
 Note: You must 
select the Show option 
separately for each 
Puppet tool. You can 
also place pins without 
viewing the mesh.
E Tip: If the mesh 
doesn’t appear when 
you select Show, 
click outside the 
path shape in the 
Composition panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 215
5 Click intersections in the mesh to place Overlap pins on the right side of the 
character’s torso and left leg, which are the areas that should remain in the front. 
As you add a pin, you may want to adjust its Extent value in the options area 
of the Tools panel. The Extent value determines how far the overlap influence 
extends for the pin; the affected area appears lighter in the Composition panel. 
Use this image as a guide. 
Stiffening an area
The character’s arms and legs should move as he walks, but his torso should stay 
fairly firm. You’ll use the Puppet Starch tool to add Starch pins where you want the 
character to be stiffer.
1 Select the Puppet Starch tool (
), which is 
hidden behind the Puppet Overlap tool, in the 
Tools panel.
2 Select Show in the options area of the Tools 
panel to display the distortion mesh.
3 Place Starch pins in the lower half of the torso, 
as in the image at right. 
4 Hide the properties for the man.psd layer in the 
Timeline panel. 
5 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
 Note: The Amount 
value determines how 
rigid the area will be. 
Typically, a low value is 
fine; higher values make 
the area more rigid. You 
can also use negative 
numbers to reduce the 
rigidity of another pin.

216 
lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
animating pin positions
The Deform, Overlap, and Starch pins are in place. Now you can change the 
Deform pin positions to animate the character. The Overlap pins keep the front 
areas in the front, and the Starch pins keep specific areas (in this case, the torso) 
from moving too much.
Creating a walking cycle
Initially, the character should be walking across the screen. To create a realistic 
walking cycle, keep in mind that as humans walk, wave patterns develop in the 
motion path. You’ll create a wave pattern in the pin positions. However, the values 
will vary slightly to add a bit of randomness, and to keep the character from look-
ing too much like a robot. 
1 Select the man.psd layer in the Timeline panel, and then press U to display all the 
keyframes for the layer. 
2 Press Home, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
timeline.
Squash and stretch
As the character moves, his body squashes and stretches. Squash and stretch  
is a traditional animation technique that adds realism and weight to objects. It’s  
an exaggeration of the effect that occurs in real life when a moving object comes 
into contact with a stationary object, such as the ground. When squashing and 
stretching are applied correctly, the volume of the character doesn’t change. 
The easiest way to understand the principle of squash and stretch is to view an 
animation of a bouncing ball. As the ball lands, it partially flattens, or squashes.  
As it bounces up, it stretches.
To see squash and stretch in action, open the Squash_and_stretch.aep project file  
in the Lesson08/End_Project_Files folder.

3 In the Timeline panel, change the position of the Deform pins as follows:
•
Head: 845, 295
•
Torso: 821.5, 1210
•
Left Leg: 1000.5, 1734

 Note:  After Effects 
automatically creates

place Deform pins, so 
you don’t need to click 
the stopwatch for each 
pin before setting its 
initial position.
E Tip: The Timeline panel measures time in seconds and frames, depending on the frames-per-second (fps) rate. So 1:15 equals   
1 second and 15 frames. At 29.97 fps, 1:15 is frame 45. 
 Note:  To add a 
keyframe, click the 
diamond (between two 
arrows) on the left side 
of the Timeline panel.

lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
animating a slip
The character steps on a banana peel, loses his balance, and falls. The falling move-
ments occur more quickly than the walking cycle. To surprise the viewer, you’ll 
animate the character to fall off the screen. 
1 Choose File > Save to save the work you’ve just done. 
2 Move the current-time indicator to 2:11, and then change the position  
of the Left Leg pin to -2281, 1495.3.
3 At 2:15, move the Deform pins to the following positions:
• Head: -1298, 532.7
• Torso: -1667.5, 1246.3
• Left Leg: -2398.8, 1282.7
• Right Leg: -2277.5, 874
• Left Arm: -1219.5, 1768
• Right Arm: -1753.5, 454.7
4 At 2:20, make the character fall off the screen by moving the Deform pins  
to the following positions:
• Head: -1094, 2452.7
• Torso: -1643.5, 3219.7
• Left Leg: -2329.5, 2682
• Right Leg: -2169.5, 2234

moving an object
Of course, when the man slips on the banana peel, the banana peel moves, too. It 
should slide out from beneath the man’s feet and fly off the screen. You didn’t add 
any pins to the banana, and you don’t need them. Instead, you’ll move the entire 
layer, using its Position and Rotation properties.
1 Move the current-time indicator to 2:00.
2 Select the banana.psd layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to display its 
Position property.

3 Press Shift+R to also display the layer’s Rotation property.
4 Click the stopwatches ( ) next to Position and Rotation to create initial 
keyframes for each property.
5 Move to 2:06, and change the Position to 80, 246 and the Rotation to 19
degrees. 
6 Move to 2:15, and change the Position to -59, 361, so that the banana peel 
moves completely off the screen. 
7 At 2:15, change the Rotation to 42 degrees, so that the peel continues to rotate 
slightly as it moves off the screen.
8 Choose Fit Up To 100% in the Magnification pop-up menu at the bottom of the 
Composition panel so you can see the entire composition. Then make a RAM 
preview and view your animation. If necessary, adjust the Position property for 
the Deform pins in the Timeline panel. Then choose File > Save.

lesson 8 
distorting objects with the Puppet tools
extra credit
The character in this animation walks, but his movement is a little bit stiff. You can  
use the Easy Ease and roving keyframe features to help him move more naturally. 
You’ve used Easy Ease in other lessons. The Easy Ease In, Easy Ease Out, and Easy 
Ease options adjust the speed of an object. 
Roving keyframes create smooth movement across several keyframes at once. They 
are not linked to a specific time; their speed and timing are determined by the key-
frames near them. To create a roving keyframe, right-click (Windows) or Control-click 
(Mac OS) the keyframe, and then choose Rove Across Time from the keyframe menu. 
Note: The first and last keyframes cannot be roving keyframes. 
Go ahead and experiment with the Easy Ease and roving keyframe features, but 
start by trying to make your keyframes match those shown below.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 221
recording animation
Changing the Position property for each pin at each keyframe worked, but you 
probably found the process to be slow and tedious. If you were creating a much 
longer animation, you’d quickly tire of entering precise numbers for each keyframe. 
Instead of manually animating keyframes, you can use the Puppet Sketch tool to 
drag the objects into position in real time. After Effects starts recording the motion 
as soon as you begin dragging a pin, and it stops recording when you release the 
mouse button. The composition moves forward through time as you move the pin. 
When you stop recording, the current-time indicator returns to the point at which 
you began recording, so that you can record the path for another pin during the 
same time period. 
Experiment with this method of animation as you re-create the slipping motion 
using the Puppet Sketch tool. 
1 Choose File > Save As > Save As, and name the project Motionsketch.aep.  
Save it in the Lesson08/Finished_Project folder.
2 In the man.psd layer, delete all keyframes after 2:08. The walking cycle  
remains, but you’ve removed the keyframes that animate the character slipping 
and falling. 
3 Move the current-time indicator to 2:08.
4 Select the Puppet Pin tool ( ) in the Tools panel. 
5 In the Timeline panel, expand the man.psd layer, and then expand Effects. Select 
Puppet to see the pins in the Composition panel. 
6 Select a pin in the Composition panel, and press Ctrl (Windows) or Command 
(Mac OS) to activate the Puppet Sketch tool (a clock icon appears next to  
the pointer). 
7 Continue to press Ctrl or Command as you drag the pin into a new position. 
Release the mouse button when you’ve finished. The current-time indicator 
returns to 2:08.
8 Press Ctrl or Command and drag another pin into position. Use the outline  
of the character to guide you.
9 Continue using the Puppet Sketch tool to move all the pins through the 
animation until you’re satisfied with the movement.
10  Create a RAM preview to view the final animation.
Now you’ve used all the Puppet tools to create a realistic, engaging animation. 
Remember that you can use the Puppet tools to deform and manipulate many 
kinds of objects, not just drawn art. And watch out for banana peels! 
E Tip: By default, 
the motion is played 
back at the speed at 
which it was recorded. 
To change the ratio 
of recording speed to 
playback speed, click 
Record Options in  
the Tools panel, and 
change the Speed value  
before recording.

2
When would you use the Puppet Starch tool?
3
How can you make your animation more fluid?
4
Describe two methods of animating pin positions.
review answers
1 The Puppet Pin tool creates Deform pins, which define the position of a portion of the 
image as the image is deformed. The Puppet Overlap tool creates Overlap pins, which 
determine which areas of an object remain in front when two areas overlap. 
2 Use the Puppet Starch tool to add Starch pins to an area that you want to remain more 
rigid while other areas of the object are distorted.
3 To make your animation more fluid, you can use the Easy Ease feature or roving 
keyframes. Additionally, you can create smoother movement by increasing the 
number of triangles in the distortion mesh, but increasing the number of triangles also 
increases the time it takes to render the animation.
4 You can manually animate pin positions by changing the value of the Position property 
for each pin in the Timeline panel. To animate pin positions more quickly, use the 
Puppet Sketch tool: With the Puppet Pin tool selected, press Ctrl or Command, and 
drag a pin to record its movement.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use the Levels effect to correct the color in a shot.
• Replace the sky with a different image.
• Use the Auto Levels effect to introduce a color shift.
• Correct a range of colors using Synthetic Aperture Color  
Finesse 3. 
• Apply the Photo Filter effect to warm portions of an image.
• Remove unwanted elements with the Clone Stamp tool.
This lesson will take approximately an hour to complete. Copy the 
Lesson09 folder into the Lessons folder that you created on your hard 
drive for these projects (or create it now), if you haven’t already done 
so. As you work on this lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need 
to restore the start files, copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 
Classroom in a Book DVD.

Most shots require some degree of color correction. 
With Adobe After Effects, you can transform a dull, 
lifeless shot into a bright, sharp clip in no time.

226 
lesson 9 
Performing Color Correction
Getting started
As the name implies, color correction is a way of altering or adapting the color of 
the captured image. Color correction can help you achieve many different goals: to 
optimize source material, to focus attention on a key element in a shot, to correct 
errors in white balance and exposure, to ensure color consistency from one shot to 
another, or to create a color palette for a specific visual look desired by a director. 
In this lesson, you will improve the color of a video clip that was shot without the 
proper white-balance setting. You’ll apply a variety of color-correction effects to 
clean up and enhance the image. Finally, you will remove an unwanted portion of 
the shot with the Clone Stamp tool. 
First, you’ll preview the final movie and set up your project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson09 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: Albertson_Hall.mov, storm_clouds.jpg
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson09.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson09.mov file to see what you will create in this lesson. 
When you’re done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete the sample movie 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin this lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS). When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file. Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display an empty, untitled project.
4 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
5 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson09/ 
Finished_Project folder.
6 Name the project Lesson09_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
Importing the footage
You need to import two footage items for this lesson.
1 Choose File > Import > File.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson09/Assets folder, Shift-click to 
select the Albertson_Hall.mov and storm_clouds.jpg files, and then click Open.
 Note: This lesson 
includes the SA Color 
Finesse 3 effect, which 
requires registration.  
If you open the 
Lesson09_end file, you 
may be prompted to 
register the effect.

3 Choose File > New > New Folder to create a new folder in the Project panel,  
or click the Create A New Folder button ( ) at the bottom of the panel.
4 Type Movies to name the folder, 
press Enter or Return to accept 
the name, and then drag the 
Albertson_Hall.mov item into the 
Movies folder.
5 Create another new folder, and 
name it Images. Then drag the 
storm_clouds.jpg item into the 
Images folder.
6 Expand the folders so that you can 
see their contents.
Creating the composition
Now, you will create a new composition based on the Albertson_Hall.mov file.
1 Drag the Albertson_Hall.mov footage item onto the Create A New Composition 
button (
) at the bottom of the Project panel. After Effects creates a new 
composition named for the source file and displays it in the Composition and 
Timeline panels.
2 (Optional) Choose Composition > 
Composition Settings to check 
the composition’s aspect ratio and 
duration. This is an NTSC DV 
composition that is approximately 
5 seconds long. Click Cancel to 
close the Composition Settings 
dialog box.
3 Drag the Albertson_Hall 
composition to an empty area of 
the Project panel to move it out of 
the Movies folder.
4 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler to preview the shot. There 
is an unappealing blue cast to the entire image. You’ll correct that first. 
5 Choose File > Save to save your work.

lesson 9 
Performing Color Correction
Previewing your project 
on a video monitor
If possible, perform color correction on a video monitor instead of a computer 
monitor. The gamma values between a computer monitor and a broadcast monitor 
vary greatly. What may look good on a computer screen may be too bright and 
washed out on a broadcast monitor. 
You can view After Effects compositions on a broadcast monitor via the IEEE 1394 
(FireWire) port on your computer. One way to accomplish this is to use a video tape 
recorder that accepts FireWire. You can loop the signal from your computer to the 
video tape recorder and then run a cable to your video monitor via the monitor/
video output on the video tape recorder.
1 
With a video monitor connected to your computer system, start After 
Effects CS6.
2 
Do one of the following, depending on your platform:
• 
In Windows, choose Edit > Preferences > Video Preview. Then choose IEEE 
1394 (OHCI Compliant) from the Output Device pop-up menu.
• 
In Mac OS, choose After Effects > Preferences > Video Preview. Then choose 
FireWire from the Output Device pop-up menu.
3
For Output Mode (Windows and Mac OS), choose the appropriate format for 
your system, which is NTSC in North America.
4
To view the composition you are working on, select the Previews, Mirror On 
Computer Monitor, Interactions, and Renders options. With all of these options 
selected, you will be able to see every update and change you make to the 
composition on the video monitor.
5 
Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
Always be sure your video or computer monitor is properly calibrated before  
performing color correction. For instructions on calibrating a computer monitor,  
see After Effects Help.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 229
adjusting color balance
After Effects provides several tools for color correction. Some may do the job with 
a single click, but understanding how to adjust colors manually gives you the 
greatest freedom to achieve the look you want. You’ll use the Levels effect to darken 
the shadows, remove the blue cast, and make the image pop a little more.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 Select the Albertson_Hall.mov layer in the Timeline panel. 
3 Press Enter or Return, rename the layer Building, and then press Enter or 
Return to accept the new name.
4 With the Building layer selected, choose Effect > Color Correction > Levels 
(Individual Controls). 
The Levels (Individual Controls) effect may be a little intimidating at first, but it can 
give you great control over your shot. It remaps the range of input color or alpha 
channel levels onto a new range of output levels, functioning much the same as the 
Levels adjustment in Adobe Photoshop.
The Channel menu specifies the channel to be modified, and the histogram shows 
the number of pixels with each luminance value in the image. When the selected 
channel is RGB, you can adjust the overall brightness and contrast of the image. 
That’s a good place to start. 
5 In the Effect Controls panel, make sure RGB is selected in the Channel menu. 
Then click the triangle next to RGB to expand its properties.
6 Enter 2 for the Input Black value, slightly darkening the shadows. The Input 
Black slider under the histogram moves accordingly. 
 Note: An additional 
tool, called SpeedGrade 
Color Correction, 
is included with 
Adobe Creative Suite 
Production Premium. To 
learn about SpeedGrade 
Color Correction, refer 
to Adobe Creative Suite  
CS6 Production Premium 
Classroom in a Book.

230 
lesson 9 
Performing Color Correction
7 Enter 0.85 for the Gamma value, increasing the contrast so that it pops a little 
more. The Gamma value represents the midtones.
To correct the blue cast, you must first determine what areas are supposed to be 
gray (or white or black) in the image. In this shot, the building is supposed to be a 
neutral color. 
8 Move the cursor over the concrete areas of the building, and note the RGB 
values in the Info panel. The values change as you move the cursor. 
In a region near the door, the RGB value is R=70, G=95, B=125. To determine what 
the values should be, divide 255 (the highest possible RGB value) by the highest of 
the values in the sample. That gives you 255 divided by 125 (the blue value near the 
door), or 2.04. To equalize the colors so that blue is no longer prominent, you need 
to multiply 2.04 by the original red and green values (70 and 95, respectively). The 
new values are 142.8 for red and 193.8 for green.
9 In the Effect Controls panel, expand the Red and Green properties.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 231
10 For the Red Input White value, enter 142.8; for the Green Input White value, 
enter 193.8.
The blue cast is gone, revealing a much more realistic scene. 
For each channel, the Input settings increase the value, while the Output settings 
decrease the value. For example, lowering the Red Input White value adds red to 
the highlights in the shot, and increasing the Red Output White value adds red to 
the shadows or dark areas in the shot. 
Performing the math lets you zero in on the appropriate settings quickly. If you  
prefer, you could experiment with the settings to find the best values for the footage 
you’re using. 
11 Hide the Levels (Individual Controls) properties in the Effect Controls panel.
replacing the background
This shot was taken on a clear day with a cloudless sky. To add a little drama, you’ll 
key out the sky and replace it with storm clouds. 
Keying out an area with the Color range effect
The Color Range effect keys out a specified range of colors. This key effect is espe-
cially useful where the color to be keyed is unevenly lit. The current sky ranges in 
color from light blue to dark blue—a perfect candidate for the Color Range effect. 
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.

Changing the background color of the composition can help you spot any  
keying errors.
3 Choose Composition > Composition Settings. Click the Background Color  
box, and select red (R=255, G=0, B=0). Click OK to close each dialog box.

4 In the Effect Controls panel, choose RGB from the Color Space menu.
5 Select the Key Color eyedropper, next to the Preview window in the Effect 
Controls panel. Then, in the Composition panel, click a midtone blue color in 
the sky to sample it. The keyed-out area appears red in the Composition panel, 
and black in the Preview window in the Effect Controls panel.
6 Select the Add To Key Color eyedropper in the Effect Controls panel, and then 
click another area of the sky in the Composition panel.
7 Repeat step 6 until the entire sky has been keyed out. 
Even with the sky keyed out, a slight fringe of color remains around the building.

adding a new background
With the original sky keyed out, you’re ready to add the clouds to the scene.
1 Click the Project tab to display the Project panel. Then drag the  
storm_clouds.jpg item from the Project panel to the Timeline panel,  
placing it below the Building layer.
2 Select the storm_clouds.jpg layer, press Enter or Return, rename the layer 
Clouds, and press Enter or Return again.
3 Click the Video switch ( ) for the Building layer to hide it. Now you can fully 
see the storm clouds layer. You need to scale and reposition the clouds to fit the 
sky area of the image.
4 With the Clouds layer selected in the Timeline panel, press the S key to display 
its Scale property. 
5 Decrease the Scale values to 60, 60%.

6 Make sure the Clouds layer is selected in the Timeline panel, and press P to 
display its Position property.
7 Change the Position values to 360, 145.
8 Press P to hide the Position property.
Color-correcting the clouds
Although the storm clouds are dramatic, the contrast of the image and the color 
cast don’t really match the building. You’ll use the Auto Levels effect to correct that.
The Auto Levels effect automatically sets highlights and shadows by defining the 
lightest and darkest pixels in each color channel as white and black, and then  
redistributing intermediate pixel values proportionately. Because Auto Levels 
adjusts each color channel individually, it may remove or introduce a color cast.  
In this case, with the default settings applied, Auto Levels introduces a blue color 
cast that makes the clouds more intense.
1 With the Clouds layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect > Color 
Correction > Auto Levels.

removing unwanted elements
The color is looking great, but you’re not quite done. The director wants you to 
remove the lamppost that appears directly in front of the doors to the building, 
as she believes it’s distracting. You’ll use the Clone Stamp tool to paint out this 
unwanted element of the scene. Cloning in After Effects is similar to cloning in 
Photoshop, but in After Effects, you can clone across the entire timeline, rather than 
in a single image.
Because the lamppost doesn’t move, you can touch up a single frame and apply it to 
the entire movie.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler. 
2 Double-click the Building layer in the Timeline panel to open it in the Layer 
panel. You can paint only on individual layers—not the composition as a whole. 
3 Zoom in to see the area around the doors clearly. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 237
4 Select the Clone Stamp tool ( ) in the Tools panel. 
The Clone Stamp tool samples the pixels on a source layer and applies the sampled 
pixels to a target layer; the target layer can be the same layer or a different layer in 
the same composition.
When you select the Clone Stamp tool, After Effects opens the Brushes and  
Paint panels.
5 In the Brushes panel, select a hard, 5-pixel brush. 
6 In the Paint panel, choose Constant from the Duration menu. The Constant 
setting applies the Clone Stamp effect from the current time forward. Because 
you’re starting at the beginning of the composition, the changes you make will 
affect every frame in the composition.
7 In the Layer panel, position the cursor to the right of the top of the lamp- 
post. Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) to designate a source  
point for cloning. 
8 Click on the lamppost to clone an area, and then continue clicking to remove 
the entire lamppost.
9 When the lamppost is gone, select the Selection tool, and then close the Layer 
panel, returning to the Composition panel. 
10 Hide the Building layer properties in the Timeline panel.
E Tip: If you make 
a mistake, just press

lesson 9 
Performing Color Correction
Correcting a range of colors
You’ve corrected the overall color for the scene, but you can also enhance a specific 
area as a secondary color correction. In this shot, the color correction caused the 
grass in front of the building to look like a mature bluegrass instead of a welcoming 
green lawn. To shift the grass to green, you will use the Synthetic Aperture Color 
Finesse 3 effect, a third-party plug-in that installs with After Effects and offers the 
capability to isolate a color range and adjust only those colors.
Color Finesse 3 applies its effect to the original layer, ignoring any effects. Because 
you’ve already performed some color correction, you’ll precompose the layer to 
include the results of the effects you’ve already applied.
1 Select the Building layer in the Timeline panel, and then press Ctrl+D 
(Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) to duplicate the layer.
2 With the duplicate layer  
(Building 2) selected, choose 
Layer > Pre-compose.
3 In the Pre-compose dialog box, 
name the new composition 
Grass Enhance, select Move 
All Attributes Into The New 
Composition, and click OK. 
You’ve created the precomposed layer, so you’ll retain the color-correction effects 
you’ve applied. However, to avoid any issues with the cloning you performed to 
remove the lamppost, you’ll mask the grass area. The mask will ensure that only the 
grass is affected.
4 With the Grass Enhance layer selected in the Timeline panel, select the Pen tool 
( ) in the Tools panel. Click around the grass area to create a mask.
5 With the Grass Enhance layer still selected in the Timeline panel, press the F 
key to display the Mask Feather property, and change the amount to 2, 2 pixels. 
Feathering blends the layers more naturally.
 Note: Synthetic 
Aperture Color  
Finesse 3 is a powerful 
color-correction plug-in. 
Once you’re familiar 
with it, you can use it to 
perform a wide variety 
of color corrections.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 239
6 Press the F key again to hide the Mask Feather property.
Now you’re ready to use Color Finesse 3.
7 With the Grass Enhance layer 
selected, choose Effect > 
Synthetic Aperture > SA 
Color Finesse 3. 
8 In the SA Color Finesse 3 area 
of the Effect Controls panel, 
click Full Interface.
SA Color Finesse 3 opens in its own window.
9 Check the box in the Secondary tab to activate secondary color correction, and 
open its color-correction controls.
SA Color Finesse 3 enables you to perform up to six different secondary color- 
correction operations. You’ll need only one for this project, however. 
10 Check the box on the A tab, where you’ll perform the color correction.
11 Using the four Sample eyedroppers, click to collect four color samples in the 
grass area. Try to sample various shades of green from light to dark; zoom in if 
necessary to help you select a range of hues. 
Four samples don’t encompass the entire contrast range of the grass, but SA Color 
Finesse 3 has controls to refine the color selection.
12 Still on the A tab, choose Mask from the Preview Style menu, and then select 
Show Preview. Now you can see the areas that are selected and those that are 
masked (shaded in red).
13 Adjust the Chroma Tolerance, Luma Tolerance, and Softness sliders until all the 
grass is selected. It’s okay if trees or shrubs are selected; the mask you applied 
earlier ensures that those adjustments will not appear in the final composition.
 Note: SA Color 
Finesse 3 may prompt 
you to register the 
effect. If you don’t 
register, a Synthetic 
Aperture logo appears 
on your video where 
you’ve used the effect.

16  Choose File > Save to save your work.
Warming colors with the Photo Filter effect
Finally, you’ll use the Photo Filter effect to warm up the entire shot and make it 
more inviting. 
The Photo Filter effect mimics the technique of using a colored filter on a camera 
lens to adjust the color balance and color temperature of the light transmitted 
through the lens. You can choose a color preset to apply a hue adjustment to an 
image, or you can specify a custom color using the Color Picker or the eyedropper.
To apply the warming filter to all the elements in the shot, you’ll apply the Photo 
Filter effect to an adjustment layer.

review answers
1 Color correction is performed to optimize the source material, to focus attention on 
a key element in the shot, to correct errors in white balance and exposure, to ensure 
color consistency from one shot to another, or to create a color palette to match the 
visual look the director prefers.
2 SA Color Finesse 3 is a third-party plug-in installed with After Effects CS6. It  
performs a wide variety of color-correction effects, such as isolating a color range  
for enhancement. SA Color Finesse 3 affects the original layer, ignoring any effects  
that have already been applied to the layer.
3 You can use the Photo Filter color-correction effect to warm up the color of an image. 
The Photo Filter effect mimics the technique of using a colored filter over the lens of  
a camera to adjust the color balance and color temperature. Choose the Warming 
Filter in the Photo Filter Effect Controls panel to warm up the color of an image.
4 To ensure that cloning occurs across the entire timeline, move the current-time 
indicator to the beginning of the time ruler, and then choose Constant from the 
Duration menu in the Paint panel.

lesson 10 
building 3d objects
Getting started
Adobe After Effects can work with layers in two dimensions (x, y) or in three  
dimensions (x, y, z). So far in this book, you’ve worked almost exclusively in two 
dimensions. When you specify a layer as three-dimensional (3D), After Effects adds 
the z axis, which provides control over the layer’s depth. By combining this depth 
with a variety of lights and camera angles, you can create animated 3D projects that 
take advantage of the full range of natural motion, lighting and shadows, perspec-
tive, and focusing effects. In this lesson, you’ll explore how to create and control 
basic 3D layers. Then, in Lesson 11, “Using 3D Features,” you’ll continue work-
ing with this project, adding lights, effects, and other elements to animate the 3D 
objects and complete the composition, a promotional video for a book. 
First, you’ll preview the movie you’re creating, and then set up the project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson10 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: AEBack.jpg, AEFront.jpg, AESpine.jpg
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson10.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson10.mov file to see what you will create in this lesson. 
When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete this sample movie 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin this lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS). When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file. Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display an empty, untitled project.
4 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
5 In the Save Project As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/
Lesson10/ Finished_Project folder.
6 Name the project Lesson10_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
Creating the composition
The animation you will create in this lesson features a 3D representation of a book 
about After Effects CS6. First, you’ll set up a composition to model the book. 
1 Click the Create A New Composition button (
) at the bottom of the  
Project panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 247
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, name the composition Book, and 
choose NTSC DV from the Preset menu. 
3 Choose Square Pixels from the Pixel Aspect Ratio menu, because you will  
be working with graphics that have square pixels. 
4 Enter 10:00 for the Duration, make sure the Background Color is black,  
and click OK.
Importing assets
You’ll use three Photoshop files in this project: images of the front cover, back 
cover, and spine of the book.
1 Double-click an empty area of the 
Project panel.
2 In the Import File dialog box, 
navigate to the AECS6_CIB/

lesson 10 
building 3d objects
Building a 3D object
In order to move the book in 3D space, you’ll need to create the 3D object. You’ll 
build it piece by piece. Initially, any layer is flat, with only x (width) and y (height) 
dimensions, and can be moved only along those axes. But all you have to do to move 
a layer in three dimensions is to turn on its 3D Layer switch. With that switch on, 
you can also manipulate the object along its z axis (depth).
Before you build the book, you’ll create an environment to help you work in 
perspective.
Creating the 3D floor
A grid layer, serving as a floor for the 3D space, can help you maintain perspective.
1 Click in the Timeline panel to make it active.
2 Choose Layer > New > Solid.
3 In the Solid Settings dialog 
box, name the layer 3D Grid.
4 Enter 800 pixels for the Width 
and the Height, and then click 
OK to create the layer.
5 With the 3D Grid layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect > 
Generate > Grid. 
The Effect Controls panel displays the Grid effect properties. You can customize 
the grid if you want to, but the default settings will work for this lesson. The grid  
is simply to help you see objects in perspective as you work.
6 In the Timeline panel, expand the 3D Grid Transform properties. The Position 
property is 360, 240, the center of the composition. Whenever you add an 
element to the Timeline panel, its anchor point will be at this center point.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 249
7 In the Timeline panel, select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the 3D Grid layer  
to give the layer three dimensions. 
Three 3D Rotation properties appear in the Transform group for the layer, and 
properties that previously supported only two dimensions now display a third value 
for the z axis. In addition, a new property group named Material Options appears.
A color-coded 3D axis appears over the layer’s anchor point in the Composition 
window. The red arrow controls the x axis, the green arrow controls the y axis, and 
the blue arrow controls the z axis. At the moment, the z axis appears at the intersec-
tion of the x and y axes. The letter x, y, or z appears when you position the pointer 
over the corresponding axis. When you move or rotate the layer while the pointer is 
over a particular axis, the layer’s movement is restricted to that axis.
8 In the Timeline panel, change the X Rotation angle to 90 degrees. The grid 
seems to disappear, but don’t worry—it’s still there!
 Note: Material 
Options properties 
specify how the layer 
interacts with light. 
You’ll work with the 
Material Options 
property group in 
Lesson 11, “Using 
3D Features.”

250 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
Using 3D views
Sometimes the appearance of 3D layers can be deceptive. For example, a layer might 
appear to be scaling smaller along its x and y axes when it’s actually moving along 
the z axis. You can’t always tell from the default view in the Composition panel. 
The Select View Layout pop-up menu at the bottom of the Composition panel lets 
you divide the panel into different views of a single frame, so you can see your work 
from multiple angles. You specify different views using the 3D View Popup menu.
1 At the bottom of the Composition panel, click the Select View Layout pop-up 
menu, and choose 2 Views – Horizontal. The left side of the Composition 
panel displays the Top view of the frame, and the right side displays the Active 
Camera view, which you’ve been viewing.
2 Click in the left side of the Composition panel to make the Top view active. 
Orange corner tabs appear around the active view.
3 Choose Custom View 1 from the 3D View Popup menu at the bottom of  
the panel.
In the Custom View 1 window, you can see that the layer is a grid that can offer 
true perspective in 3D space.
4 Hide the properties for the 3D Grid layer in the Timeline panel.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 251
Creating a guide layer
Guide layers help you position and edit elements in the Composition panel. For 
example, you can use guide layers for visual reference, audio timing, timecode ref-
erence, or even to store comments to yourself. In this project, you want to use the 
3D Grid layer to help you place objects, but you don’t want to render it in the final 
artwork. You’ll convert it to a guide layer and lock it to ensure it stays in place.
1 Select the 3D Grid layer in the Timeline panel, and choose Layer > Guide Layer. 
A cyan grid appears next to the layer name in the Timeline panel to indicate 
that it’s a guide layer.
2 Select the Lock switch ( ) for the 3D Grid layer in the Timeline panel to lock  
the layer. 
adding the first side of the object
With your grid in place as a guide layer, you’re ready to start building the book. 
What better place to start than the front cover?
1 Click the Project tab to make the panel active. Deselect everything in the Project 
panel, and then drag the AEFront.jpg item into the Timeline panel, placing it at 
the top of the layer stack, above the 3D Grid layer.
2 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the AEFront.jpg layer.
The book cover is much larger than the composition, and it intersects the grid. 
You’ll scale the AEFront.jpg layer later, after the entire object is built. But you’ll 
reposition the cover to rest firmly on the floor of the grid now. To do this, you’ll 
reposition the layer’s anchor point to the bottom of the book cover.
3 With the AEFront.jpg layer selected in the Timeline, press the A key to display 
the layer’s Anchor Point property.

252 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
Currently, the anchor point for the AEFront.jpg layer is in the center of the book. 
You want the anchor point to be at the bottom of the book cover, to match the 
anchor point at the center of the grid. Because the current y-axis value is at the 
center, and therefore halfway down the book, you can simply multiply that value 
by 2 for the new Anchor Point value. 
4 Click the y-axis value (the middle value), and add *2 to the value, so that it reads 
617*2. Press Enter or Return to accept the calculation. The layer moves to sit on 
the grid.
Importing 3D images from 
adobe Photoshop extended
Adobe Photoshop Extended can import and manipulate 3D models in several popu-
lar formats. You can manipulate these models in Photoshop Extended, and then 
save one or more frames as PSD files for import into After Effects.
Alternatively, you can use the Vanishing Point feature in Photoshop Extended to 
create 3D images, and then use the Export For After Effects command to save the 
results as a collection of PNG files—one for each plane—and a VPE (Vanishing Point 
Exchange) file that describes the geometry of the scene. When you import the VPE 
file, After Effects uses its information to re-create the scene as a composition con-
taining a camera layer and one perspective-corrected 3D layer for each PNG file. 
Positioning 3D elements
When you build a 3D object, you need to position the 3D layers in relationship to 
each other. You’ll position the spine of the book by moving its anchor point and 
then adjusting the front cover as necessary. 
1 Drag the AESpine.jpg item from the Project panel into the Timeline panel, 
placing it at the top of the layer stack. 
2 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the AESpine.jpg layer. 
3 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the triangle in the Label 
column for the AESpine.jpg layer to display all of its Transform properties.
 Note: Positive 
values on the x axis 
move an element to  
the right; positive 
values on the y axis 
move an element  
down; and positive 
values on the z axis 
move an element  
away from the 
active camera.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 253
4 Click the y-axis value (the middle value) for the Anchor Point property, and 
then add *2, so that its value is 617*2. Press Enter or Return to accept the 
calculation.
As with the front cover, moving the anchor point for the spine positions it to sit  
on the floor of the 3D space. However, the spine is facing the same direction as  
the front cover. You’ll need to rotate it. 
5 Change the Y Rotation property for the AESpine.jpg layer to +90.
Now the spine is facing the right direction, but it’s in the middle of the front cover. 
To move it into place, you’ll use the same simple math trick you used to position 
the book on the floor.
6 Select the AEFront.jpg item in the Project panel, and note its width. It’s exactly 
1000 pixels wide. 
The AESpine.jpg layer currently intersects the middle of the AEFront.jpg layer. 
Therefore, moving the spine 500 pixels to the left will align it appropriately. To move 
an object to the left on the x axis, you subtract pixels. 
7 In the Timeline panel, click the x-axis value (the first value) for the Position 
property, and then append -500 to the value, so the new value is 360.0-500, or 
-140. Press Enter or Return.

254 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
The spine moves to the end of the book. It’s close, but it protrudes from the front  
of the book. You’ll move the AEFront.jpg layer forward to fix that.
8 In the Timeline panel, select the AEFront.jpg layer, and then press P to display  
its Position property.
9 Click the z-axis value (the third value) for the Position property of the 
AEFront.jpg layer, and change the value to -56. A negative value on the z axis 
moves the layer toward the active camera view (forward). 
10 Close all properties for the AESpine.jpg and AEFront.jpg layers to keep the 
Timeline panel neat.
replacing a 3D element with another
Instead of repeating all the steps to position the back cover, you’ll duplicate the 
front cover and replace it with the back cover. 
1 Select the AEFront.jpg layer in the Timeline panel, and press Ctrl+D (Windows) 
or Command+D (Mac OS) to duplicate the layer.
2 With the duplicate layer selected, press P to display its Position property.
3 Change the z-axis value to +56 to move the layer away from the active camera 
view. Because this will be the back cover, you want to position it at the back of 
the spine, which is 112 pixels wide.
4 In the Composition panel, change the right view to Custom View 3 so you can 
see both ends of the book.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 255
5 With the duplicate layer selected in the Timeline panel, press R to display  
the layer’s Rotation properties, and change its Y Rotation value to 180 degrees.  
The rotation flips the layer.
6 With the duplicate layer selected in the Timeline panel, press Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) as you drag the AEBack.jpg item from the Project panel onto 
the duplicate layer. After Effects replaces the front cover with the back cover, 
and changes the layer name to AEBack.jpg.

256 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
adjusting views with the camera tools
By definition, 3D objects can appear different from different angles. You can adjust 
the camera view to see the object from other directions so that you can identify 
gaps, make positioning adjustments, and otherwise evaluate and plan your project.
1 Select the Track Z Camera tool ( ), hidden 
behind the Unified Camera tool (
) in the 
Tools panel. The Track Z Camera tool lets 
you zoom in and out of a composition view.
2 Click in the left view (Custom View 1) in  
the Composition panel to ensure it’s active. 
Then click and drag to the left or down to 
zoom out from the scene and see the  
entire book. You may need to click and  
drag multiple times.
3 Select the Orbit Camera tool ( ), hidden 
behind the Track Z Camera tool in  
the Tools panel. The Orbit Camera tool 
rotates the current 3D view by moving the 
camera around the point of interest.
4 Drag the Orbit Camera tool to the left or 
right in the left view of the Composition 
window so that you can see the back of the book. Remember, when you’re using 
the Orbit Camera tool, you’re rotating the view, not the object itself. 
5 Drag the Orbit Camera tool again so that you 
are viewing the front of the book.
6 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools 
panel, and choose File > Save to save your 
work so far.

adding solid layers to a 3D object
You’ve assembled the front cover, back cover, and spine of the book. But it’s still 
lacking a top and right side (opposite the spine). Because these sides don’t require 
specific content, you can create them using solid layers.
1 Click in the Timeline panel. 
Then press Ctrl+Y (Windows) 
or Command+Y (Mac OS) to 
create a new solid layer.
2 In the Solid Settings dialog 
box, name the layer Top 
Pages, and change the width 
to 1000 pixels (to match the 
cover width) and the height to 
112 pixels (to match the width 
of the spine). 
3 Click the eyedropper, and 
click a white area of the book 
cover to sample it. Click OK 
to create the layer.
4 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the Top Pages layer.
5 Press R to display the Rotation properties, and change the X Rotation property 
to 90 degrees. 
6 Press P to display the Position property. Click the y-axis value, and type 240-
1234. Press Enter or Return to accept the calculation.

Why those numbers? The current position is 240, and you want to move it up the 
height of the book, which is 1234 pixels. 
7 Press Ctrl+Y (Windows) or 
Command+Y (Mac OS) to 
create another solid layer for 
the right side of the book, 
representing the edges of the 
pages that are bound by the 
spine on the left side. 
8 In the Solid Settings dialog 
box, name the layer Pages, 
and change the Width to 112 
pixels (the width of the spine) 
and the Height to 1234 pixels 
(the height of the covers). 
Make sure the layer is white, 
and then click OK.
9 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the Pages layer. 
The Pages layer needs to be on the right side of the book. You’ll change its Anchor 
Point, Rotation, and Position properties to get it there. 
10 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the triangle next to the Label 
column to display all of the Transform properties for the Pages layer.
11 Change the y-axis value for the Anchor Point property to 1234 (placing the layer 
on the virtual floor); change the Y Rotation amount to 90 degrees to make it face 
the right direction; and change the x-axis value for the Position property to 
360+500 to move the layer to the right side of the book. 
12 With the Timeline panel active, press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A  
(Mac OS) to select all the layers. Then press the U key to close all the properties 
for the layers.
 Note: For this 
project, it’s unlikely 
that anyone will see the 
bottom of the book. 
But if you want to add a 
bottom layer, duplicate 
the top layer and move 
it into position.
E Tip: Pressing the 
U key multiple times 
cycles through the 
reveal/hide options.

Working with a null object
A null object is an invisible layer that has all the properties of a visible layer, so  
that it can be a parent to any layer in the composition. You’ll use a null object to 
scale the layers of the 3D object down to a more manageable size. If you scaled the 
layers individually, you’d have to reposition each of them again. By parenting the 
layers to a single null layer, they all scale at once, maintaining their relationship to 
each other.
1 With the Timeline panel active, choose Layer > New > Null Object. After Effects 
names the layer Null 1.
2 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the Null 1 layer to make it three-dimensional. 
The null object moves to the origin point of the composition, at the center of the 
grid. Though you can see the null object in the Composition panel, remember that 
there isn’t really anything there—it’s an invisible layer. The representation of the 
object is to help you keep track of it as you work with it. 
3 In the Timeline panel, select the Pages layer, and then Shift-click the  
AEFront.jpg layer to select all the layers in between. (Only the 3D Grid and  
Null 1 layers should not be selected.)
4 Choose 1. Null 1 from the Parent pop-up menu for the Pages layer. The same 
selection is automatically applied to all selected layers. 
Because the 3D object layers are now parented to the Null 1 layer, any changes  
to the null object also affect them. 

260 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
5 Select the Null 1 layer in the Timeline panel, and press S to reveal its Scale 
property. Then change the Scale amount to 20, 20, 20%.
The entire book is smaller, and each of the elements retains its relationship with  
the others. 
6 Select the Track Z Camera tool ( ), hidden behind the Orbit Camera tool ( ) in 
the Tools panel. Then drag to the right in the left view of the Composition panel 
to zoom in so you can see the book more clearly.
7 Select the right view in the Composition panel to make it active. Then choose 
Active Camera from the 3D View Popup menu at the bottom of the Composition 
panel. 
8 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
Working with 3D text
Just as you can create other 3D objects in After Effects, you can create 3D text. 
Flat text isn’t as interesting, so you’ll give the text more depth using expressions. 
However, if your system supports the Ray-Traced 3D Renderer in After Effects CS6, 
you can extrude the text using the steps in the Extra Credit section on page 265.
 Note: Because 
the Scale property 
values are linked, you 
need only enter the 
value once to affect all 
three axes.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 261
Creating the composition
You’ll create a new composition for the text, and just as you did before, you’ll create 
a 3D grid to serve as the floor of the space to help you maintain perspective.
1 Click the Create A New Composition button (
) at the bottom of the Project 
panel.
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, name the composition 3D Text, and 
choose NTSC DV from the Preset menu. Then click OK to close the dialog box 
and create the composition.
3 Press Ctrl+Y (Windows) or Command+Y (Mac OS) to create a new solid layer.
4 In the Solid Settings dialog box, name the layer 3D Grid, set the Width and 
Height both to 800 pixels, and click OK.
5 With the 3D Grid layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect > 
Generate > Grid. 
6 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the 3D Grid layer.
7 With the 3D Grid layer selected in the Timeline panel, press R to reveal its 
Rotation properties. Then change the X Rotation value to 90 degrees. Press  
R again to hide the Rotation properties.
8 With the 3D Grid layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Layer >  
Guide Layer. 
The grid you’ve created will guide you as you work with 3D text, but won’t render 
with your project.
Creating 3D text
With the grid in place, you’re ready to create the text. You’ll type the words first, 
and then convert the layer to a 3D layer.
1 Select the Horizontal Type tool ( ) in the Tools panel. After Effects opens the 
Character and Paragraph panels.
E Tip: If you plan to 
work with 3D objects 
in the future, save the 
composition to use as a 
basis for later projects 
so that you’ll already 
have a 3D grid in place.

262 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
2 In the Character panel, do the following:
• Choose Myriad Pro for the font family.
• Choose Bold for the font style.
• Select white for the text color.
• Set the stroke color to none.
• Change the font size to 120 pixels.
3 In the Paragraph panel, select the Center Text alignment option.
4 Click anywhere in the Composition panel, in either view, and type AECS6.  
Then click an empty area of the Timeline panel to deactivate the Horizontal  
Type tool. 
5 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the AECS6 layer.
6 With the AECS6 layer selected in the Timeline panel, press P to reveal its 
Position property.
7 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the Position property  
name, and choose Reset from the context menu. The text moves to the center  
of the grid.
adding depth to the text with expressions
The text is three-dimensional, but one of those dimensions—the z axis—is only 1 
pixel wide. You’ll duplicate the layer and offset it by 1 pixel to add depth to the text.
1 Select the AECS6 layer in the Timeline panel, and choose Edit > Duplicate.
 Note: This tech-
nique gives you the 
effect of extrusion in 
some views, but may 
not provide good 
results when you rotate 
the text at some angles. 
For true extruded text, 
use the steps in the 
Extra Credit section.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 263
A new layer, named AECS7, is added to the Timeline panel. The duplicate layer  
is named AECS7 because After Effects continues the layer numbering from AECS6, 
but the content of the layer has not been changed.
2 Double-click the original AECS6 layer in the Timeline panel to select its 
contents. 
3 In the Character panel, change the text color to blue (R=19, G=125, B=245),  
and click an empty area of the Timeline panel to deactivate the Horizontal  
Type tool. 
Text in the Composition window appears white because it’s in front of the blue layer.
4 Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) as you click the stopwatch icon ( )
next to the Position property for the original AECS6 layer. 
After Effects displays the words transform.position in the expression field in the 
time ruler. With expressions, you can create relationships between layer properties 
and use one property’s keyframes to dynamically animate another layer. To learn 
more about expressions, see the sidebar “About expressions” in Lesson 6.
5 Type thisComp.layer(index-1).transform.position+[0,0,1] to replace 
transform.position in the expression field. 
6 Click an empty area of the Timeline panel to accept the expression. 
The expression you typed instructs After Effects to use the layer immediately above 
it, changing the Position property by 1 pixel on the z axis. Here’s how it breaks 
down: thisComp.layer refers to this composition, index-1 refers to the layer imme-
diately above the current layer, transform.position means to change the Position 
property, and +[0,0,1] means add 1 pixel to the z axis. 
E Tip: If you’re using 
the Ray-Traced 3D 
Renderer, After Effects 
names the new layer 
AECS6 2, not AECS7.
 Note: While you  
edit an expression, 
all previews are 
suspended.

264 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
You don’t have to memorize this expression or learn JavaScript, the language used 
in expressions. You can adapt simple expressions and modify them to meet your 
needs. Or you can use a pick whip, as you did in Lesson 6, to create relationships 
between layer properties. 
7 Select the Orbit Camera tool ( ), and drag across the left view in the 
Composition window to see the back of the text. The back is blue and the front 
is white. But it’s still only 2 pixels deep. 
8 Select the original AECS6 layer in the Timeline panel, and press Ctrl+D 
(Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) 19 times to create 19 additional layers. 
9 Use the Orbit Camera tool to move around the object. The text object is much 
deeper now, as you copied the expression along with each of those 19 layers. 
The front layer is white, but all the other layers are blue. To see the effect more 
clearly, change the right view to Custom View 3.

extruding 3D text
If you have hardware that supports the Ray-Traced 3D Renderer, you can extrude 3D text in After 
Effects CS6. Extruded text includes additional properties that give you greater control and flexibility 
over the 3D effect.
1
Create a new text composition, following the directions in the “Creating the composition” and 
“Creating 3D text” sections of the lesson, but name the new composition Extruded text. 
2
Make sure the Extruded Text composition is active in the Timeline panel.
3
Choose Composition > Composition Settings.
4
In the Composition Settings dialog box, click the Advanced tab. Then choose Ray-Traced 3D from 
the Renderer menu, and click OK to close the dialog box. Read the Alert box that appears, and 
click OK. 
Now that the Ray-Traced 3D Renderer is enabled, you can extrude the text.
5
Select the 3D Layer switch for the AECS6 layer, if it isn’t already enabled.
6
Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the triangle in the Label column for the AECS6 
layer in the Timeline panel to display all the properties for the layer. 
7
Under Geometry Options, choose Angular from the Bevel Style menu, change the Bevel Depth  
to 3, the Hole Bevel Depth to 60%, and the Extrusion Depth to 20. 
These settings give you a very basic 3D object that you can work with. The Hole Depth Extrusion 
keeps the open spaces in the text from becoming too tight. When you extrude text, you may also 
need to adjust the kerning (the space between the letters) to keep the 3D letters from bumping into 
one another. 
8
Choose Layer > New > Light to add a spot light. Choose Spot from the Light Type menu, and select 
a warm yellow color (R=255, G=247, B=216). Select Casts Shadows, reduce the Shadow Darkness 
to 60%, and increase the Shadow Diffusion to 10. Then click OK.

9
Select the Light 1 layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its Position property. Then 
change its position to 110, 55, -400 to show off the depth of the text.
10 Click the Animate menu button next to the Text properties in the AECS6 layer, and choose  
Bevel > Color > RGB. Then click the Bevel Color color swatch under Animator 1 Range Selector 1, 
and select a golden yellow color (R=240, G=200, B= 80).
11 Click the Add menu button next to Animator 1, and choose Property > Bevel > Specular Intensity. 
Then change the Bevel Specular Intensity amount to 100%.
Increasing the specular intensity of a beveled edge makes the edges pop and stand out  
a bit more.
You can experiment with other Ray-Traced 3D options in After Effects. When you complete 
Lesson 11, you can add your extruded 3D text to the project to see the difference in the final 
rendered project.

Creating a backdrop for 3D animation
The book and text are both ready for animation. But they need to be animated 
against a backdrop. You’ll create a two-dimensional environment for the 3D objects 
in a new composition.
1 Click the Project tab, and then click the Create A New Composition button  
(
) in the Project panel.
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, name the composition Final Comp,  
and choose NTSC DV from the Preset menu. Click the Advanced tab, and 
choose Classic 3D from the Renderer menu. Then click OK.
3 In the Composition panel, choose 1 View from the Select View Layout  
pop-up menu.
4 Choose Custom View 1 from the 3D pop-up menu at the bottom of the 
Composition panel so you can see the backdrop from an angle other than  
a flat, forward view.
5 Choose Layer > New > Solid.
6 In the Solid Settings dialog box, name the layer Background, set the Width  
and Height to 1000 pixels, and click OK.
7 With the Background layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect > 
Generate > Ramp. The layer becomes a gradient.
8 In the Effect Controls panel, change the Start Of Ramp value to 500, 500. Then 
change the Start Color to a light blue (R=36, G=195, B=254) and the End Color 
to black (R=0, G=0, B=0). Choose Radial Ramp from the Ramp Shape menu.
9 Select the Lock switch for the Background layer to prevent accidental changes 
to it. There’s no need to convert this layer to a 3D layer, because it will be an 
infinite distance from the animated 3D objects.
10 Press Ctrl+Y (Windows) or Command+Y (Mac OS) to create a new solid layer.
11 In the Solid Settings dialog box, name the layer Ground, and confirm that both 
the Width and Height are 1000 pixels. Then click OK.
12 With the Ground layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect > Noise  
& Grain > Fractal Noise.

268 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
13 In the Effect Controls panel, choose Dynamic Twist from the Fractal  
Type menu.
14 In the Timeline panel, select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the Ground layer.
15 With the Ground layer selected, press R to reveal the Rotation properties,  
and change the X Rotation value to 90 degrees.
16 Press S to reveal the Scale property. Change the Scale values to 1000,  
1000, 1000.
17 Click the Toggle Switches/Modes button at the bottom of the Timeline  
panel to display the Modes column.
18 For the Ground layer, choose Overlay from the Mode menu.
19 Press S to close the Scale property, and then lock the Ground layer.
nesting a 3D composition
You’ve set up the environment for the 3D objects that you created earlier: the book 
and the text. The Book composition contains all the elements of the book. You’ll 
add that composition to the Final Comp composition, and then select the Collapse 
Transformations switch so that it behaves as a 3D layer.
1 Click the Project tab to display the panel. Then drag the Book composition from 
the Project panel to the Final Comp Timeline panel, placing it at the top of the 
layer stack.
E Tip: If the Mode 
menu isn’t available 
for the Ground layer, 
you’re using the Ray-
Traced 3D Renderer, 
which doesn’t support 
blending modes. 
Choose Composition > 
Composition Settings, 
click the Advanced 
tab, and choose Classic 
3D from the Renderer 
menu.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 269
The Book composition doesn’t show up, because it’s not yet a 3D layer. 
2 Click the Toggle Switches/Modes button at the bottom of the Timeline panel  
to display switches.
3 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the Book layer to convert it to 3D.
The Book composition appears in the Composition window, but only the front  
cover appears to be included. When you nest a 3D composition in another com-
position, you need to select the Collapse Transformations switch for the layer. 
Otherwise, the composition is rendered as a 2D layer, and does not interact with  
3D layers.
4 Select the Collapse Transformations switch ( ) for the Book layer. 
Now the entire book appears, just as you created it. If you change Rotation prop-
erty values, the entire object rotates, rather than individual layers. The guide layer 
is not visible in the nested composition.
adding a camera
You can view 3D layers from any number of angles and distances using layers called 
cameras. When you set a camera view for your composition, you look at the layers 
as though you were looking through that camera. You can choose between viewing 
a composition through the active camera or through a named, custom camera. If 
you have not created a custom camera, then the active camera is the same as the 
default composition view.
So far, you have primarily been viewing this composition from the Custom View 1 
angle, which doesn’t take blending modes or 2D layers into account. Switching to 
the Active Camera view doesn’t let you see your composition from an angle. To see 
everything you want to see, you’ll create a custom camera.
1 Choose Layer > New > Camera. 

270 
lesson 10 
building 3d objects
2 In the Camera Settings dialog box, accept all of the defaults, including the name 
(Camera 1) and the 50mm preset, and then click OK.
The Camera 1 layer appears at the top of the layer stack in the Timeline panel 
(with a camera icon next to the layer name), and the Composition panel updates 
to reflect the new camera layer’s perspective. The view doesn’t appear to change, 
however, because the 50mm camera preset uses the same settings as the default 
Active Camera view.
3 Choose 2 Views – Horizontal from the Select View Layout pop-up menu at the 
bottom of the Composition panel. Change the left view to Right and the right 
view to Active Camera from the 3D View Popup menu.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 271
Setting the camera’s point of interest
Camera layers have a point of interest that can be used to determine what the cam-
era looks at. By default, the camera’s point of interest is the center of the composi-
tion. You’ll set this camera layer to look at the Book and Ground layers from a very 
specific angle.
1 Expand the Camera 1 layer’s Transform property group in the Timeline panel.
2 While watching the right view (on the left side) in the Composition panel, drag 
the Point Of Interest property y-axis value to the left in the Timeline panel until 
the point of interest icon ( ) in the Composition panel is in the middle of the 
book. The final value should be 123; enter it manually if necessary.
3 In the Timeline panel, change the Point Of Interest x-axis value to 602 and the 
z-axis value to 157.
This perspective looks a little more interesting, but the camera is intersecting the 
Ground layer plane. The Point Of Interest property determines where the camera  
is looking, but its placement is controlled by its Position property.
4 Change the Position property values for the Camera 1 layer to 27, 132, -640.
The book in the Active Camera view (on the right) looks a lot better.
5 Close all the properties for the Camera 1 layer, and choose File > Save.

Completing the scene
You’re ready to add the 3D Text composition you created earlier. As with the Book 
composition, you’ll need to select the 3D switch and the Collapse Transformations 
switch for it to behave as a true 3D object.
1 Drag the 3D Text composition from the Project panel to the Timeline panel, 
placing it directly below the Camera 1 layer.
2 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) and the Collapse Transformations switch ( ) for 
the 3D Text layer.
3 In the Composition panel, choose 1 View from the Select View Layout menu, 
and choose Active Camera from the 3D View Popup menu.
4 With the 3D Text layer selected in the Timeline panel, press R to reveal the 
Rotation properties for the layer. Then change the Y Rotation value to 60
degrees.
5 Press the P key to reveal the Position property for the 3D Text layer. Change the 
Position values to 762, 240, 100. 
6 Close any open properties in the Timeline panel, and choose File > Save. 
You’ve created 3D objects and assembled them in a virtual space. In Lesson 11, 
“Using 3D Features,” you’ll continue working on this project. For the final movie, 
you’ll add lights, adjust surface properties, and animate the camera.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 273
about 3D rotation
You can adjust 3D rotation two ways: by changing a layer’s Orientation values,  
or by changing its X, Y, and Z Rotation values. You can use the Rotation tool to 
change any of these values.
When you animate any of a 3D layer’s Orientation values, the layer moves along 
the shortest possible rotational path in 3D space, creating natural and predictable 
rotations. You can smooth this path by changing the spatial keyframe interpolation 
to Auto Bezier.
When you animate any of a 3D layer’s X, Y, or Z Rotation values, the layer rotates 
along each individual axis. You can adjust the number of rotations as well as the 
angle of rotation. You can also add keyframes to the layer’s rotation on each axis 
individually. Animating these properties allows for more alternatives for fine control 
with keyframes and expressions than animating with the Orientation property, but 
also may result in motion that is less predictable. The individual Rotation properties 
are useful for creating rotations with multiple revolutions along a single axis.

review questions
1
What happens to a layer when you select its 3D Layer switch?
2
Why is it important to look at multiple views of a composition that contains 3D layers?
3
What happens when you move a layer’s Anchor Point values in the Timeline panel?
4
What is a camera layer?
review answers
1 When you select a layer’s 3D Layer switch in the Timeline panel, After Effects adds 
a third axis, the z axis, to the layer. You can then move and rotate the layer in three 
dimensions. In addition, the layer takes on new properties that are unique to 3D layers, 
such as the Material Options property group.
2 The appearance of 3D layers can be deceptive, depending on the view in the 
Composition panel. By enabling 3D views, you can see the true position of a layer 
relative to other layers in the composition.
3 When you adjust the Anchor Point values for a layer in the Timeline panel, the layer 
moves in the Composition panel even though its Position values remain the same. 
4 You can view After Effects 3D layers from any number of angles and distances using 
layers called cameras. When you set a camera view for your composition, you look at 
the layers as though you were looking through that camera. You can choose between 
viewing a composition through the active camera or through a named, custom camera. 
If you have not created a custom camera, then the active camera is the same as the 
default composition view.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Animate 3D objects.
• Add reflections to 3D objects.
• Use an adjustment layer to blur multiple layers.
• Animate a camera layer.
• Create and position light layers.
• Add a Linear Wipe effect to reveal objects in the composition.
This lesson will take approximately an hour to complete. Copy the 
Lesson11 folder into the Lessons folder that you created on your hard 
drive for these projects (or create it now), if you haven’t already done 
so. As you work on this lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need 
to restore the start files, copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 
Classroom in a Book DVD.

In Lesson 10, you created 3D objects and positioned 
them in a virtual world. Animation, lights, adjust-
ment layers, and animated cameras complete the 
composition.

lesson 11 
Using 3d features
Getting started
This lesson picks up where the previous lesson left off. In Lesson 10, “Building 3D 
Objects,” you created the first half of an animation promoting a book. So far, a 3D 
representation of the book and 3D text are positioned in 3D space. In this les-
son, you will complete the project by adding lights, effects, reflections, and other 
elements to the composition. In doing so, you’ll learn how to use additional 3D 
features available in Adobe After Effects. 
Begin with the Lesson11_Start.aep project file provided with this book, or, if you 
completed Lesson 10, you can use the project file that you saved at the end of that 
lesson. The two files should be equivalent.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson11 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: AEBack.jpg, AEFront.jpg, AESpine.jpg, brush.psd
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson11.mov
• In the Start_Project_File folder: Lesson11_Start.aep
2 Open and play the Lesson11.mov file to see what you will create in this lesson. 
When you are done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete this sample movie 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin this lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS). When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file. Click Close to close the Welcome screen.

When you select only one axis in the Composition panel, you restrict movement  
of the 3D layer to that axis. 
7 Manually move the current-time indicator from 0:00 to 0:15 to see the text 
come into the frame. It arrives abruptly; you’ll ease that transition.
8 Click the Position property name to select all the Position keyframes for the  
3D Text layer.
9 Choose Animation > Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease.
10 Press the P key to hide the Position property.
adding reflections to 3D objects
In the real world, objects cast reflections in certain lighting conditions. Those 
reflections add depth and interest. After Effects can’t cast real reflections on sur-
faces, but you can add them by duplicating layers and applying a blur effect. 
Creating a simple reflection
A reflection is a mirror image of an object, though it’s usually a little distorted, 
depending on the light source. You’ll duplicate objects to create a simple reflection.
1 Go to 0:15, if you’re not there already, so you can see the text.
2 Select the 3D Text layer in the Timeline panel, and press Ctrl+D (Windows)  
or Command+D (Mac OS) to duplicate the layer.
3 Select the duplicate layer, press Enter or Return, and rename it 3D Text 
Reflection. Press Enter or Return again.
4 Move the 3D Text Reflection layer below the Ground layer in the Timeline 
panel. 
The duplicate layer is in the same position as the original 3D Text layer. You’ll flip  
it to create the reflection.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 281
5 With the 3D Text Reflection layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Layer > 
Transform > Flip Vertical. 
6 Press the T key to reveal the Opacity property, and change the Opacity value  
to 30%. Then press the T key again to hide the Opacity property.
You’ve created a reflection for the text. Now, you’ll do the same thing for the book.
7 Select the Book layer in the Timeline panel, and press Ctrl+D (Windows) or 
Command+D (Mac OS) to duplicate the layer. 
8 Rename the duplicate layer Book Reflection, and move it below the Ground 
layer in the Timeline panel.
9 With the Book Reflection layer selected, press S to reveal the Scale property, 
click the Constrain Proportions icon ( ) to unlink the values, and change the 
y-axis value to -100%.
10 Press the T key to reveal the Opacity property, change the Opacity value to 30%, 
and press T again to hide the Opacity property.
adding an adjustment layer
A simple reflection is pretty good, but a blur would make it look more realistic. 
You’ll use an adjustment layer to apply a blur effect. Effects applied to an adjust-
ment layer affect all the layers beneath it.

282 
lesson 11 
Using 3d features
1 Choose Layer > New > Adjustment 
Layer. After Effects adds a new 
adjustment layer at the top of the  
layer stack. 
2 Move the Adjustment Layer 1 layer below 
the Ground layer in the Timeline panel. 
Moving the adjustment layer below the 
Ground layer ensures that it will affect only 
the reflection and Background layers.
3 With the Adjustment Layer 1 layer selected, choose Effect > Blur & Sharpen > 
Directional Blur.
4 In the Effect Controls panel, change the Blur Length to 20. Leave the Direction 
setting at its default, as the reflections are perpendicular to the floor.
5 Lock the Adjustment Layer 1 layer to prevent any accidental changes to it.
6 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
animating a camera
In Lesson 10, you created a camera layer, Camera 1. So far, that camera has been 
steady. Now, you’ll animate the camera, so that it begins far from the 3D objects 
and moves closer to them as the movie progresses.
1 Go to 4:00 in the Timeline panel. This is the point where the camera will come 
to rest, after it’s moved closer to the subject.
2 Select the Camera 1 layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its  
Position property.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 283
3 Press the Shift key as you press A to reveal the Point Of Interest property for  
the Camera 1 layer as well.
4 Click the stopwatch icons for the Position and Point Of Interest properties  
to create keyframes for each.
You’ve set the keyframes for the end of the camera movement. Rather than starting 
the camera movement at the beginning of the time ruler, you’ll begin at 0:10,  
so that viewers have a moment to orient themselves before the camera begins  
to zoom in.
5 Go to 0:10 in the Timeline panel.
6 Change the Point Of Interest values to 360, 240, 0, and the Camera 1 Position 
values to -185, 132, -3000. Now the camera is much farther from the objects 
and the book is centered in its view.
7 Shift-click the Point Of Interest and Position property names to select all the 
keyframes for the layer, and then choose Animation > Keyframe Assistant >  
Easy Ease.
8 Press the spacebar to preview your work so far. Press the spacebar again to stop 
the preview.
9 Hide the Camera 1 layer properties.
adjusting layer timing
Earlier, you animated the 3D text and set it to arrive at 0:13. But with the book  
centered at the beginning of the movie, the animated text will be more effective  
if it arrives much later. You’ll move it now.
1 Go to 3:23 in the time ruler. This is just before the camera reaches its resting 
point, so there will be some overlap in movement as the text comes in.
2 Select the 3D Text layer in the Timeline panel, and then press Ctrl (Windows)  
or Command (Mac) as you select the 3D Text Reflection layer as well.

284 
lesson 11 
Using 3d features
3 Press the [ (left bracket) key to move the In point for both layers to the  
current time.
4 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of 
the time ruler. Then press the spacebar to preview the animation. When you’ve 
finished watching the animation, press the spacebar again to stop the preview.
Using 3D lights
The composition is looking good so far. Adding lighting will give the scene depth 
and make it more dramatic.
Creating a light layer
In After Effects, a light is a type of layer that shines light on other layers. You 
can choose from among four different types of lights—Parallel, Spot, Point, and 
Ambient—and modify them with various settings. Lights, by default, point to a 
point of interest, just as camera layers do.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning  
of the time ruler.
2 Choose Layer > New > Light.
3 In the Light Settings dialog box, do the following:
•
Name the layer Spotlight.
•
Choose Spot from the Light Type menu.
•
Set Color to a light yellow (255, 255, 230).
•
Set Intensity to 100% and Cone Angle to 90 degrees.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 285
•
Set Cone Feather to 50%.
•
Select the Casts Shadows option.
•
Make sure Shadow Darkness is set to 100%, and set Shadow Diffusion  
to 20 pixels.
•
Click OK to create the light layer.
The light layer is represented by a light bulb icon ( ) in the Timeline panel,  
and the point of interest appears in the Composition panel as a cross-hair icon ( ).
Positioning the spotlight
The point of interest for this light is pointed at the center of the scene, which just 
happens to be where the 3D book is located, so you don’t need to adjust it. You only 
need to change the light position. Simply dragging the axes in the Composition 
panel would cause the light’s point of interest to move, however, so you’ll change 
the light layer’s position in the Timeline panel instead.
1 Go to 5:00 in the Timeline panel.

286 
lesson 11 
Using 3d features
2 In the Composition panel, choose 2 Views – Horizontal from the Select View 
Layout pop-up menu. Then click the left view to make it active, and choose Top 
from the 3D View pop-up menu. (The right view should be Active Camera.) 
The light will appear throughout the composition, but by working at 5:00, you can 
see how repositioning the light affects other objects in the scene.
3 Select the Spotlight layer in the Timeline panel, and then press P to display its 
Position property.
4 While watching the Top and Active Camera views in the Composition panel, 
drag the Position property’s y-axis value (the middle value) to the left in the 
Timeline panel until the light cone is at -105, high above the composition. 
5 Change the Position property’s x-axis value to -102 and its z-axis value to  
-208. Moving the light to a negative value on the z axis moves the light back  
in 3D space.
6 Hide the Position property for the Spotlight layer in the Timeline panel.
7 Choose 1 View from the Select View Layout pop-up menu at the bottom of the 
Composition panel, and make sure Active Camera is selected in the 3D View 
pop-up menu. 
8 Press F2 to deselect all layers in the Timeline panel, press the Home key, and 
then press the spacebar to preview the lighted animation. Press the spacebar 
again to end the preview. Then choose File > Save to save your work.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 287
adding an ambient light
The shadows are a little harsh, so you’ll add ambient light to lighten the scene.
1 Choose Layer > New > Light.
2 In the Light Settings dialog box, do the following:
•
Name the light Ambient Light.
•
Choose Ambient from the Light Type menu.
•
Change Color to a light blue (180, 233, 255).
•
Set Intensity to 50%.
•
Click OK to create the light layer.
animating lights
Light doesn’t need to be steady. You’ll animate the spotlight so that it flickers  
on over a second, and then you’ll fade in the ambient light over 15 frames.
1 Go to 3:15.
2 Select the Ambient Light layer in the Timeline panel, and press the T key  
to display the Light Intensity property for the layer.
3 Click the stopwatch icon ( ) next to the Intensity property to set a keyframe.
4 Go to 3:00, and change the Intensity value to 0%.
5 Press T to hide the Intensity property.
6 Select the Spotlight layer in the Timeline panel, and press the T key to display 
the Light Intensity property.

7 Go to 3:15, and click the stopwatch icon for the Intensity property to set  
a keyframe.
8 Go to 3:00, and change the Intensity value to 0%.
9 Set additional Intensity keyframes for the Spotlight layer as follows:
•
At 2:28: 100% 
•
At 2:26: 0%
•
At 2:24: 100%
•
At 2:21: 0%
•
At 2:18: 100%
•
At 2:15: 0%
10 Press T to hide the Intensity property. 
11 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler. Press F2 to deselect all layers. Then press the spacebar to preview the 
composition. 
With the lights off at the beginning of the composition, the book is backlit by the 
Ramp effect in the Background layer, making for a dramatic opening shot.
adding effects
After Effects provides many options for special effects that you can use with either 
2D or 3D scenes. You’ll add a few animated brush strokes to this scene to give it 
more drama and flair.
adjusting the material Options properties
The Material Options properties determine how 3D layers interact with lights and 
shadows. You’ll add a layer that won’t be affected by the lights you added earlier.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 289
2 Click the Project tab. Then drag the brush.psd item from the Project panel into 
the Timeline panel, and place it at the top of the layer stack.
3 Select the 3D Layer switch ( ) for the brush.psd layer to convert it to a 3D layer.
The layer jumps to the center of the composition, but you can no longer see it, 
because the brush.psd layer is affected by the lights in the scene.
4 Select the brush.psd layer in the Timeline panel, and press AA to reveal the 
Material Options properties for the layer. 
5 Click the value for the Accepts Shadows property (currently On) twice to 
change it to Off. 
6 Click the value for the Accepts Lights property (currently On) once to change  
it to Off.
7 Press the P key to display the Position property for the brush.psd layer, and  
then change the Position value to -6, 308, -2200. The layer moves very close  
to the camera.
adding a transition effect
Currently, the brush stroke is present throughout the composition. You’ll add  
a transition effect to change the way the brush stroke arrives on the scene. 
1 With the brush.psd layer selected, choose Effect > Transition > Linear Wipe.
2 In the Effect Controls panel, change Transition Completion to 100%, Wipe 
Angle to -90 degrees, and Feather to 50.

290 
lesson 11 
Using 3d features
3 In the Effect Controls panel, click the stopwatch icon for the Transition 
Completion property to create an initial keyframe.
4 Go to 0:15.
5 Change the Transition Completion value to 0%. The brush stroke will be 
revealed from left to right on the screen.
6 In the Timeline panel, hide all the properties for the brush.psd layer.
7 Select the brush.psd layer, and then press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D 
(Mac OS) to duplicate the layer.
8 With the duplicate layer selected, press P to display the Position property, and 
then enter a new position of -238, 383, -523.
9 Press P to hide the Position property.
There are two brush strokes on the screen, one in the foreground and one  
further back. You’ll create two more brush strokes, flipped so that they arrive  
from the right.

8 Choose File > Save.
adding motion blur
Objects in motion tend to have blur. To make the entire composition more realistic 
and exciting, you’ll add motion blur to all the layers. However, in order to apply 
motion blur to the 3D compositions, you must also apply it to their layers separately.
1 Click the Enable Motion Blur button ( ) at the top of the Timeline panel. 
2 Select the Motion Blur switch ( ) for each layer in the Timeline panel. 
 Note: Calculating 
motion blur is 
processor-intensive. 
This exercise is optional.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 293
When the Collapse Transformations switch is selected, After Effects uses the set-
tings in the original composition to determine whether to apply motion blur. You’ll 
need to open the 3D compositions to apply motion blur to them.
3 Select the Book tab in the Timeline panel to open the Book composition.
4 Select the Motion Blur switch for each of the layers in the Book composition.
5 Click the 3D Text tab in the Timeline panel, and select the Motion Blur switch 
for each of the layers in the 3D Text composition.

How are 3D lights handled in After Effects?
3
What is a point of interest?
review answers
1 Animating a 3D layer is similar to animating a 2D layer, except that you can move 
the object on three axes: the x axis, the y axis, and the z axis. You can animate other 
Transform properties, effects, and other settings just as you would those for a 2D layer.
2 In After Effects, a light is a type of layer that shines light on other layers. You can 
choose from among four different types of lights—Parallel, Spot, Point, and Ambient—
and modify them with various settings.
3 Cameras and lights include a property that specifies the spot in the composition at 
which the camera or light points. By default, this point of interest is set at the center 
of the composition, and the camera or light’s view is automatically oriented toward 
it. You can change this behavior by choosing Layer > Transform > Auto-Orient. Of 
course, you can move the point of interest at any time.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
•
Track footage using the 3D Camera Tracker.
•
Add camera and text elements to a tracked scene.
•
Create realistic shadows for new 3D elements.
•
Lock elements to planes using null objects. 
•
Adjust camera settings to match real-world footage.
•
Remove rolling shutter distortions from DSLR footage.
This lesson will take approximately 11⁄2 hours to complete. Copy the 
Lesson12 folder into the Lessons folder that you created on your hard 
drive for these projects (or create it now), if you haven’t already done 
so. As you work on this lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need 
to restore the start files, copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 
Classroom in a Book DVD.

The new 3D Camera Tracker effect analyzes two-
dimensional footage to create a new 3D camera that 
matches the original. You can use this data to add 3D 
objects that merge realistically with the scene.

298 
lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
about the 3D Camera tracker effect
The new 3D Camera Tracker effect automatically analyzes the motion present in 
existing 2D footage, extracts the position and lens type of the real camera that shot 
the scene, and creates a new 3D camera in After Effects to match it. The effect also 
overlays 3D track points onto the 2D footage, so you can easily attach new 3D layers 
onto the original footage.
These new 3D layers have the same movement and perspective changes as the 
original footage. The 3D Camera Tracker effect even helps create “shadow catch-
ers,” so your new 3D layers can appear to cast realistic shadows and reflections onto 
the existing footage.
The 3D Camera Tracker performs its analysis in the background. Therefore, you  
can work on other compositions while the footage is being analyzed.
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll create the opening scene for a fictional reality show that esti-
mates the value of everyday objects found on office desks. You’ll begin by importing 
the footage and tracking it with the 3D Camera Tracker effect. Then you’ll add 3D 
text elements that track precisely with the scene. Finally, you’ll animate the text, add 
audio, and enhance the footage to complete the show’s introduction. 
First, you’ll preview the final movie and set up your project.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson12 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
• In the Assets folder: DesktopC.mov, Treasures_Music.aif, and  
Treasures_Title.psd
• In the Sample_Movie folder: Lesson12.mov
2 Open and play the Lesson12.mov file to see what you will create in this lesson. 
When you’re done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete the sample movie 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
When you begin this lesson, restore the default application settings for After Effects. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS). When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file. Click Close to close the Welcome screen.

Importing the footage
You need to import three footage items for this lesson.
1 Choose File > Import > File.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson12/Assets folder, Shift-click to select 
the DesktopC.mov, Treasures_Music.aif, and Treasures_Title.psd files, and then 
click Open.
3 Choose File > New > New Folder to create a new folder in the Project panel,  
or click the Create A New Folder button ( ) at the bottom of the panel.
4 Type Footage to name the  
folder, press Enter or Return  
to accept the name, and then  
drag the DesktopC.mov and 
Treasures_Title.psd items into  
the Footage folder.
5 Create another new folder, and 
name it Audio. Then drag the 
Treasures_Music.aif item into the 
Audio folder.
6 Expand the folders so that you can 
see their contents.
Creating the composition
Now, you will create a new composition based on the aspect ratio and duration  
of the DesktopC.mov file.
1 Drag the DesktopC.mov item onto the Create A New Composition button (
)  
at the bottom of the Project panel. After Effects creates a new composition 
named DesktopC and displays it in the Composition and Timeline panels.

300 
lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
2 Drag the DesktopC composition to an empty area of the Project panel to move  
it out of the Footage folder.
3 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler to preview the shot. The 
camera moves around a desktop so that you can see the objects on it. You’ll add 
labels and dollar amounts, animated in time with background music. 
4 Choose File > Save to save the file.
repairing rolling  
shutter distortions
Digital cameras with CMOS sensors—including video-capable DSLRs, which are 
becoming increasingly popular for the creation of films, commercials, and television 
shows—typically have what is commonly known as a “rolling” shutter, which cap-
tures a frame of video one scan line at a time. Due to time lag between scan lines, 
not all parts of the image are recorded at exactly the same time, causing motion to 
ripple down the frame. If the camera or the subject is moving, the rolling shutter can 
cause distortions, such as leaning buildings and other skewed images.
The new Rolling Shutter Repair effect attempts to correct this problem automati-
cally. To use it, select the problem layer in the Timeline panel, and choose Effect > 
Distort > Rolling Shutter Repair.
Due to a rolling shutter distortion, the pillars After applying the effect, the building 
of the building appear to be leaning. 
looks much more stable.
The default settings usually do the trick, but you may need to change the Scan 
Direction or the Method being used to analyze the footage. 
If you plan to use the 3D Camera Tracker effect with footage on which you’ve used 
the Rolling Shutter Repair effect, precompose the footage first.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 301
tracking the footage
The 2D footage is in place. Now you’ll let After Effects track it and interpolate 
where a 3D camera should be placed. 
1 In the Timeline panel, click the Audio icon for the DesktopC.mov layer to mute 
the audio. You’ll add a soundtrack later, and you don’t want any ambient noise 
from this clip.
2 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the DesktopC.mov layer  
in the Timeline panel, and choose Track Camera. 
After Effects opens the Effect Controls panel and displays its progress as it analyzes 
the footage in the background. When the analysis is complete, many tracking points 
appear in the Composition panel. The size of a tracked point indicates its proximity 
to the virtual camera: larger points are closer and smaller points are further away. 
The default analysis of the footage often yields satisfactory results, but you can 
perform a more detailed analysis to better solve the camera position. 
3 In the Effect Controls panel, expand the Advanced category, and then select 
Detailed Analysis.

302 
lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
After Effects analyzes the footage again. If you’re working with a slower machine 
and you suspect you’ll need a detailed analysis, you can save time by selecting 
Detailed Analysis while the 3D Camera Tracker is performing its initial analysis. 
The detailed analysis may take a few minutes, depending on your system. Because 
the analysis is performed in the background, you could work on other aspects  
of your project while it progresses.
4 When the analysis is complete, choose File > Save to save your work so far. 
Creating a camera and the initial text
You have a 3D scene, but it needs a 3D camera. You’ll add a camera when you 
create the first text element, and then you’ll add a second text element related  
to the first.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning  
of the time ruler.
2 In the Composition panel, hover the cursor over the hole in the record on the 
desk until the displayed target is most in line with the plane and the perspective 
matches. (If you don’t see the track points and target, click the 3D Camera 
Tracker effect in the Effect Controls panel to make it active.)
When you hover the cursor between three or more neighboring track points 
that can define a plane, a semi-transparent triangle appears between the points. 
Additionally, a red target shows the orientation of the plane in 3D space.
3 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the plane, and choose Create 
Text And Camera.
 Note: You can  
also add a camera  
by clicking the Create 
Camera button in the 
Effect Controls panel. 
 Note: If the size 
of the target makes 
it difficult to see the 
plane, resize the target 
by pressing Alt or 
Option as you drag from 
the center of the target.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 303
After Effect displays a large text item lying flat in the Composition panel. It also 
adds two layers to the Timeline panel: Text and 3D Tracker Camera. The 3D switch 
is enabled for the Text layer, but the DesktopC.mov layer remains 2D. Because the 
text elements are the only ones that need to be positioned in 3D space, there is no 
reason to make the background footage layer a 3D layer.
4 Move the current-time indicator along the time ruler. The text remains in 
position, tracking with the camera. Return the current-time indicator to the 
beginning of the time ruler.
5 Double-click the Text layer in the Timeline panel to open the Character and 
Paragraph panels.
6 In the Paragraph panel, select Center Text for the alignment. The text is centered 
over the record.
7 In the Character panel, change the font to a sans serif font such as Arial Narrow. 
Then change the font size to 20 px, the stroke width to 1 px, and the stroke type 
to Fill Over Stroke. Make sure the fill color is white and the stroke color is black 
(the default colors). 
The text looks great, but you want it to stand on end. You’ll change its location in 
space, and then replace it with the price of the object.
8 With the Text layer selected in the Timeline panel, press the R key to display the 
Rotation property of the layer. Then change the Orientation values to 26.1, 19.3, 
355.7 degrees.
9 Double-click the Text layer in the Timeline panel to make it active in the 
Composition panel. When the text is editable, it appears to have a light red mask 
surrounding it.
 Note: Instead  
of entering values, you 
could use the Rotation 
tool to adjust the 
individual axes in the 
Composition panel.

lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
10 With the text selected in the Composition panel, type $35.00 to replace it.
So far, so good. Next, you want to label the item, and the label needs to stay with 
the price as the camera moves. You’ll duplicate the layer, modify it, and then parent 
one layer to another.
11 Select the $35.00 layer in the Timeline panel, and press Ctrl+D (Windows) or 
Command+D (Mac OS) to duplicate it. 
12 Double-click the $35.2 layer, and type HENDRIX 45 RPM (in all capital letters) 
in the Composition panel.
The text is too large; it’s the same size as the price text. You’ll parent it to the $35.00 
layer and then scale it.
13 Select the Hendrix 45 RPM layer in the Timeline panel, and press the P key to 
reveal the Position property for the layer. Drag the pick whip from the Hendrix 
layer to the $35.00 layer.
The Position value for the Hendrix layer changes to 0,0,0 because its position  
is in relationship to the parent layer. However, you want the Hendrix layer to 
appear above the $35.00 layer, not in front of it. 
14 Change the y-axis position value to -18 to move the Hendrix label above the 
price text.

15 With the Hendrix layer selected, press the S key to reveal the Scale property, and 
change the Scale values to 37.4, 37.4, 37.4%.
16 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
Creating realistic shadows
You’ve set up your first text elements, but unlike 3D objects, they aren’t casting any 
shadows. You’ll create a shadow catcher and a light to add depth to your video.
1 Press the Home key or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 Select the 3D Camera Tracker effect under the DesktopC layer in the Timeline 
panel. (If the 3D Camera Tracker effect isn’t visible, press the E key.)
3 Select the Selection tool in the Tools panel. Then, in the Composition panel, 
hover until you find the same plane you used to create the text layer.
4 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the target, and choose Create 
Shadow Catcher And Light.

306 
lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
After Effects adds a light source to the scene. The default settings are applied, so 
a shadow appears in the Composition panel. However, you’ll need to reposition 
the light to match the light in the source footage. The Shadow Catcher 1 layer 
that After Effects adds to the Timeline panel is a shape layer that has its material 
options set so that it only accepts shadows from the scene.
5 Select the Light 1 layer in the Timeline panel, and press the P key to reveal the 
Position property for the layer. 
6 Enter the following values for the Position property to reposition the light: 
1145.8, 800, 1200.
7 Choose Layer > Light Settings. You can change the intensity, color, and other 
attributes of the light in the Light Settings dialog box.
8 Name the light Key Light. Choose Point from the Light Type menu, and then 
select a slightly red color (we used R=232, G=214, B=213) to match the slight 
color cast in the room. Then change the Shadow Darkness to 15% and the 
Shadow Diffusion to 100 px. Click OK.
9 Select the Shadow Catcher 1 layer in the Timeline panel, and press the S key  
to reveal the Scale property. 
10 Change the Scale value to 340%. 
Scaling the Shadow Catcher 1 layer changes the area in which shadows can appear 
for the light that was created with it. 
E Tip: In a real-world 
project, it’s ideal to work 
with the lighting plan 
that was used to shoot 
the original 2D scene. 
The goal is to have the 
new 3D lights match the 
original source lighting 
as closely as possible.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 307
adding ambient light
The shadow looks better after the adjustments you made to the light, but it’s now 
causing the text to appear black. You’ll add ambient light to address this. Unlike a 
point light, ambient light creates a more diffuse light throughout the scene.
1 Choose Layer > New > Light.
2 Name the light Ambient Light, choose Ambient from the Light Type menu, and 
change its Intensity value to 80%. The light color should be the same as the color 
you selected for the point light.
3 Click OK to add the light to the scene.
4 Hide the properties for all layers in the Timeline panel, except for the  
DesktopC.mov layer.
Creating additional text elements
You created the label for the Hendrix record. Now you need to perform the same 
tasks to create labels for the camera, gold statue, pocket knife, and ukulele. You’ll 
use the same steps to create each label, but because the objects are in different 
places on the table, you’ll need to use different orientation and scaling values,  
as listed in the following chart. You’ll also find it easiest to attach the label for each 
to the correct plane at different points in the time ruler. 
E Tip: If a 3D object 
should be obscured 
by an object in the 
background, duplicate 
the background layer, 
move it to the top of 
the layer stack, and 
then use the Mask 
tool to create masks 
around portions of the 
foreground elements. 
You will need to 
animate these masks 
over time, but if you 
do it carefully, you 
can create a seamless 
composition.

5 Select the Text layer in the Timeline panel, and press the R key to reveal the 
Rotation values. Then change the Orientation values.
6 Double-click the Text layer to make it editable, and then type the price in the 
Composition panel. 
7 Select the price layer in the Timeline panel, and press S to reveal the Scale 
property. Change the Scale value.
8 With the price layer selected, press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) 
to duplicate the layer.
9 Double-click the duplicate layer in the Timeline panel, and then type the label in 
the Composition panel.
10 Select the label layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal its Position 
property. Then drag the pick whip from the label layer (e.g., 35MM CAMERA) 
to the price layer (e.g., $298.00).
11 Change the y value of the Position property for the label layer to -18 to move the 
label above the price.
 Note: If you turn 
Caps Lock on to type 
the label, be sure to turn 
it off again. Otherwise, 
you’ll get unexpected 
results and After Effects 
won’t be able to update 
the layer name.

lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
Locking a layer to a plane with a null object
The title card for the show should be flat on the table, using the same plane you 
used to attach text to the record. You’ll use a null object to attach the title card  
to that plane. The title card is an Adobe Photoshop file.
1 Press the Home key or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
2 In the Timeline panel, select the 3D Camera Tracker (under the DesktopC.mov 
layer) to make it active. (If you don’t see the 3D Camera Tracker, press the E key 
to reveal it.) 
3 Select the Selection tool, and then move the cursor so that the target is lying flat 
over the record. 
4 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the target, and choose  
Create Null. 
After Effects adds a Track Null 1 layer to the top of the layer stack in the Timeline 
panel. Because we know that the record is on the same plane as the desktop, we  
can use this null object to position the title of the show in the open area of the  
desk, and still have it move correctly in relation to other elements and the camera 
in the scene.
5 Select the Track Null 1 layer in the Timeline panel, press Enter or Return, and 
change the name to Desktop Null. Press Enter or Return again to accept the 
name change.
6 From the Project panel, drag the Treasures_Title.psd asset to the Timeline panel, 
placing it directly above the Desktop Null layer.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 311
7 Drag the pick whip from the Treasures_Title layer to the Desktop Null layer  
to parent the layer. 
8 Select the 3D switch for the Treasures_Title layer to make it a 3D layer.
Because you’ve parented the title layer to the null object, when it becomes  
a 3D layer, it is automatically oriented to be flat on the desktop.
9 Move to the end of the time ruler so you can see how the title card is positioned.
You need to move the title to the empty area of the desktop, and then rotate it and 
resize it.
10 Select the Treasures_Title layer in the Timeline panel, and press P to reveal the 
Position property. Then change the Position values to 3532.4, -2432.6, 184.8. 
11 Press the R key to reveal the Rotation property for the layer, and then change  
its Z Rotation value to 300 degrees.
12 Press the S key to reveal the Scale property, and change the Scale amount  
to 450%.
13 Click the Toggle Switches/Modes button at the bottom of the Timeline panel. 
Choose Luminosity from the Mode menu for the Treasures_Title layer. 
14 Click the Toggle Switches/Modes button again to return to displaying switches.
15 Choose File > Save to save your work so far.
E Tip: Instead of 
dragging the pick 
whip, you could choose 
2.Desktop Null from 
the Parent menu in the 
Treasures_Title layer.

lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
animating the text
The 3D text elements, camera, and lighting are all complete, but you can make the 
introduction more interesting by animating the text to appear according to cues 
in the soundtrack. You’ll add an audio track, and then animate the labels to appear 
when cash register sounds occur. 
animating the first text elements
You’ll animate the record label and price to appear early in the intro, with the price 
cycling through characters until it arrives at the final text.
1 In the Project panel, drag the Treasures_Music.aif file from the Audio folder to 
the bottom of the layer stack in the Timeline panel.
2 Move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the timeline, and then 
create a RAM preview for the first few seconds of the composition. Notice that 
the cash register sound occurs periodically. You’ll animate the text to appear at 
those points.
3 Go to 1:00, and select the $35.00 layer. Press the S key to reveal the Scale 
property, and then change the Scale amount to 0%. Click the stopwatch icon ( ) 
to create an initial keyframe. 
4 Go to 1:08, and change the Scale amount for the $35.00 layer to 2800% so that 
the text is larger than its final size. 
5 Go to 1:10, and change the Scale amount to 2500%, the final value for the text.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 313
6 Go to 1:00, and press S to hide the Scale property. Then click the arrow next  
to the $35.00 layer to reveal all its properties. 
7 Next to the Text property, click the arrow next to Animate, and choose 
Character Offset from the pop-up menu. 
8 Expand Range Selector 1 in the Animator 1 properties. Then click the stopwatch 
next to Offset to create an initial keyframe, and make sure the value is 0%.
9 Create an initial keyframe for Character Offset, and make sure its value is 0.
10 Go to 1:12, and change the Range Selector 1 Offset value to -100%.
11 Click the word Offset to select both keyframes, right-click (Windows) or 
Control-click (Mac OS) one of the keyframes, and then choose Keyframe 
Assistant > Easy Ease.

314 
lesson 12 Working with the 3d Camera tracker
12 Go to 1:17, and change the Character Offset value to 20.
13 Create a RAM preview to see the first 2 seconds of the composition. The title 
of the record pops up as the text cycles through to the estimated price. The 
character offset values determine how the text cycles through characters to 
arrive at its final character.
Copying the animation to other text elements
Now that you’ve animated the text for the record, you can copy the animation for 
the other objects, placing the keyframes at the appropriate point in the time ruler. 
1 Select the $35.00 layer, and press the U key to reveal only the properties that 
have keyframes.
2 In the time graph, drag a marquee around all the keyframes to select them. 
3 Choose Edit > Copy to copy the keyframes and their values.
4 Go to 3:00, and select the $298.00 layer. Choose Edit > Paste to paste  
the keyframes and their values, beginning at the current time.
5 Go to 5:00, and select the $612.00 layer. Press Ctrl+V (Windows)  
or Command+V (Mac OS) to paste the keyframes and their values.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 315
6 Go to 7:00, select the $75.00 layer, and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V 
(Mac OS).
7 Go to 9:00, select the $500.00 layer, and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V 
(Mac OS). 
8 Hide the properties for all the layers, and then choose File > Save.
adjusting the camera’s depth of field
The intro is looking pretty good, but you can make the computer-generated elements 
more closely match the source footage if you adjust the depth of field for the 3D 
camera. You’ll use the values that were used in the camera that shot the original 
footage, so the text that is further away from the camera appears to be more out  
of focus.
1
Select the 3D Tracker Camera layer in the Timeline panel.
2
Choose Layer > Camera Settings.
3
In the Camera Settings dialog box, do the following, and then click OK:
•
Select Enable Depth of Field.
•
Set the Focus Distance to 200 mm.
•
Change the F-Stop value to 5.6.
•
Set the Focal Length to 27.2.

review questions
1 What does the 3D Camera Tracker effect do?
2 How can you make an added 3D element look like it is the same size as elements that 
are farther from the camera?
3 Can you use DSLR footage with the 3D Camera Tracker?
review answers
1 The new 3D Camera Tracker effect automatically analyzes the motion present in 
existing 2D footage, extracts the position and lens type of the real camera that shot 
the scene, and creates a new 3D camera in After Effects to match it. The effect also 
overlays 3D track points onto the 2D footage, so you can easily attach new 3D layers 
onto the original footage.
2 To make the object appear to recede, so that it looks like it’s further from the camera, 
adjust its Scale property. Adjusing the Scale property keeps its perspective locked with 
the rest of the composition.
3 Yes, but if you’re using DSLR footage, first evaluate the footage to determine whether 
there is any wobbling, skewing, or other artifacts from a rolling shutter. If there are any 
artifacts, correct the footage using the Roller Shutter Repair effect before applying the 
3D Camera Tracker effect.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Stabilize a shaky camera shot.
• Use single-point motion tracking to track one object in a shot  
to another object in a shot.
•
Perform multipoint tracking using perspective corner-pinning.
•
Use Imagineer Systems mocha for After Effects to track motion.
•
Create a particle system.
•
Use the Timewarp effect to create slow-motion video.
This lesson will take approximately 2 hours to complete. Copy the 
Lesson13 folder into the Lessons folder that you created on your hard 
drive for these projects (or create it now), if you haven’t already done 
so. As you work on this lesson, you’ll preserve the start files. If you need 
to restore the start files, copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 
Classroom in a Book DVD.

Getting started
In previous lessons, you’ve used many of the essential 2D and 3D tools you need for 
motion graphics design. But Adobe After Effects CS6 also offers motion stabiliza-
tion, motion tracking, advanced keying tools, distortion effects, the capability to 
retime footage using the Timewarp effect, support for high dynamic range (HDR) 
color images, network rendering, and much more. In this lesson, you will learn  
how to use the Warp Stabilizer to stabilize a handheld camera shot and to track 
one object to another in an image so that their motion is synchronized. Then you 
will use corner-pinning to track an object with perspective. Finally, you will explore 
some of the high-end digital effects available in After Effects CS6: a particle system 
generator and the Timewarp effect. 
This lesson includes multiple projects. Take a peek at all of them before beginning.
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
•
In the Assets folder: flowers.mov, Group_Approach[DV].mov, majorspoilers.
mov, metronome.mov, mocha_tracking.mov, multipoint_tracking.mov
•
In the Sample_Movies folder: Lesson13_Multipoint.mov, Lesson13_ 
Particles.mov, Lesson13_Stabilize.mov, Lesson13_Timewarp.mov,  
Lesson13_Tracking.mov
2 Open and play the sample movies in the Lesson13/Sample_Movies folder to see 
the projects you will create in this lesson. 
3 When you’re done, quit QuickTime Player. You may delete these sample movies 
from your hard disk if you have limited storage space.
Using the Warp Stabilizer
If you shoot footage using a handheld camera, you will probably end up with shaky 
shots. Unless this look is intentional, you’ll want to stabilize your shots to eliminate 
unwanted motion.
 Note: You can 
view these movies 
all at once or, if you 
don’t plan to complete 
these exercises in one 
session, you can watch 
each sample movie 
just before you are 
ready to complete the 
associated exercise.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 321
The Warp Stabilizer in After Effects automatically removes extraneous jitters. When 
played back, the motion appears smooth, because the layer itself is scaled and 
moves incrementally to offset the unwanted movement.
Setting up the project
As you start After Effects, restore the default application settings for After Effects.  
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
1 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file.
2 Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a new, untitled project.
3 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
4 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13/ 
Finished_Projects folder. 
5 Name the project Lesson13_Stabilize.aep, and then click Save.
Importing the footage
You need to import one footage item to start this project.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13/Assets folder. Select the  
flowers.mov file, and then click Open.

lesson 13 
Advanced editing techniques
Creating the composition
Now, you will create the composition.
1 Drag the Flowers.mov clip in the Project panel onto the Create A New 
Composition button (icon) at the bottom of the panel.
After Effects creates a new composition named Flowers with the same pixel size, 
aspect ratio, frame rate, and duration of the source clip. 
2 Click the RAM Preview button in the Preview panel to preview the footage. 
This clip was shot with a handheld camera in the late afternoon. A slight breeze 
rustles the vegetation, and the camera moves unsteadily. 
applying the Warp Stabilizer
The Warp Stabilizer gets to work as soon as you apply it. Stabilization is a back-
ground process, so you can work on other compositions while it works. How long it 
takes depends on your system. After Effects displays a blue banner while it analyzes 
the footage, and an orange banner while it applies stabilization.
1 Select the flowers.mov layer in the Timeline panel, and choose Animation > 
Warp Stabilizer. The blue banner appears immediately.
2 When the Warp Stabilizer has finished stabilizing, and the orange banner has 
disappeared, create another RAM preview to view the changes.
3 Press the spacebar to stop the preview.
The clip is still shaky, but it’s smoother than it was initially. The Warp Stabilizer 
moved and repositioned the footage. To see how it applied changes, view the 
effects in the Effect Controls panel. For example, the clip’s borders were scaled to 
102.8% to hide black gaps that occur when the image is repositioned in the stabili-
zation process. You’ll adjust the settings the Warp Stabilizer uses. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 323
adjusting the Warp Stabilizer settings
You’ll change the settings in the Effect Controls panel to make the shot smoother.
1 In the Effect Controls panel, increase the Smoothness amount to 75%. 
The Warp Stabilizer immediately begins stabilizing again. It doesn’t need to analyze 
the footage, because the initial analysis data is stored in memory.
2 When the Warp Stabilizer has finished, create another RAM preview to view 
the changes.
3 Press the spacebar to stop playback when you’re done.
It’s better, but still a little rough. The Auto-scale setting in the Effect Controls panel 
now displays 103.75%; the effect moved the frames more dramatically, requiring 
more scaling to eliminate black gaps around the edges. 
Rather than change the amount the Warp Stabilizer smooths the footage, now 
you’ll change its goal.
4  In the Effect Controls panel, choose No Motion from the Result menu. With 
this setting, the Warp Stabilizer attempts to lock the camera in position. This 
requires even more scaling. When No Motion is selected, the Smoothness 
option is dimmed.
5 When the orange banner disappears, create another RAM preview. Press the 
spacebar to stop the playback.

324 
lesson 13 
Advanced editing techniques
Now the camera stays in position, so that the movement you notice is the rustling 
of the flowers in the wind, not the shakiness of the camera. In order to achieve this 
effect, the Warp Stabilizer had to scale the clip to 114.5% of its original size.
Fine-tuning the results
The default analysis works well most of the time, but sometimes you may need to 
massage the end results even further. In this project, the clip skews subtly in a few 
places, most noticeably at about the five-second mark. Casual viewers may not 
notice the problem, but a keen producer will. You’ll change the method the Warp 
Stabilizer uses to remove the skew.
1 In the Effect Controls panel, choose Position, Scale, Rotation from the  
Method menu. 
2 Choose Stabilize Only from the Framing menu. 
3 Increase the Additional Scale to 114%.
4 Create another RAM preview. Now the shot looks rock-steady, with the only 
movement that caused by the wind rustling the flowers.
5 Press the spacebar to stop the playback when you’re done.
6  Choose File > Save to save your work.
7 Choose File > Close Project.
As you have discovered, stabilizing a shot is not without its drawbacks. To com-
pensate for the movement or rotation data applied to the layer, the frames must 
be scaled, which could ultimately degrade the footage. If you really need to use the 
shot in your production, this may be the best compromise.
 Note: Scaling a 
video layer up degrades 
the image. A good rule 
of thumb is to keep the 
scale amount below 
15% if possible.

Warp Stabilizer settings
This is just a summary of the Warp Stabilizer settings to help you get started. To learn 
more about the settings, and to read more tips for using the effect successfully, see 
After Effects Help.
•
Result controls the intended result. Smooth Motion makes camera movement 
smoother, but doesn’t eliminate it; use the Smoothness setting to control how 
smooth the movement becomes. No Motion attempts to remove all camera 
motion. 
•
Method specifies the most complex operation the Warp Stabilizer performs 
on the footage to stabilize it: Position Tracking, which is based on position 
data only; Position, Scale And Rotation, which uses these three types of data; 
Perspective, which effectively corner-pins the entire frame; or Subspace Warp 
(the default), which attempts to warp various parts of the frame differently to 
stabilize the entire frame. 
•
Borders settings adjust how borders (the moving edges) are treated for footage 
that is stabilized. Framing controls how the edges appear in a stabilizing result, 
and determines whether the effect crops, scales, or synthesizes edges using 
material from other frames.
•
Auto-scale displays the current auto-scale amount, and allows you to set limits 
on the amount of auto-scaling. 
•
Advanced settings give you even greater control over the actions of the Warp 
Stabilizer effect. 
Using single-point motion tracking
With the increase in the number of productions that incorporate digital elements 
into final shots, compositors need an easy way to synchronize computer-generated 
effects with film or video backgrounds. After Effects lets you do this with the capa-
bility to follow, or track, a defined area in the shot, and to apply that movement to 
other layers. These layers can contain text, effects, images, or other footage. The 
resulting visual effect precisely matches the original moving footage.
When you track motion in an After Effects composition that contains multiple 
layers, the default tracking type is Transform. This type of motion tracking tracks 
position and/or rotation to apply to another layer. When tracking position, this 
option creates one track point, and generates Position keyframes. When tracking 
rotation, this option creates two track points, and produces Rotation keyframes.
In this exercise, you will track a shape layer to the weighted arm of a metronome. 
This will be especially challenging as the camera operator chose not to use a tripod.

Setting up the project
If you’ve just completed the first project, and After Effects is open, skip to step 3. 
Otherwise, restore the default application settings for After Effects. See “Restoring 
default preferences” on page 2. 
1 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore default preferences settings. 
When prompted, click OK to delete your preferences file.
2 Click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display a new, untitled project.
3 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
4 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13/ 
Finished_Projects folder. 
5 Name the project Lesson13_Tracking.aep, and then click Save.
Importing the footage
You need to import one footage item to start this project.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13/Assets folder. Select the 
metronome.mov file, and then click Open.
Creating the composition
Now, you will create the composition.
1 In the Project panel, drag the metronome.mov clip onto the Create A New 
Composition button at the bottom of the panel.
After Effects creates a new composition named Metronome with the same pixel 
size, aspect ratio, frame rate, and duration of the source clip. 
2 Drag the current-time indicator across the time ruler to manually preview  
the footage.
Creating a shape layer
You’re going to attach a star to the end of the metronome. First, you need to create 
the star. You’ll use a shape layer.
1 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of  
the time ruler, and then click an empty area of the Timeline panel to deselect  
the layer.

2 Select the Star tool ( ), hidden behind the Rectangle tool in the Tools panel. 
3 Click the Fill Color swatch, and select a light yellow such as R=220, 
G=250, B=90. Click the word Stroke, select None in the Stroke Options dialog 
box, and click OK.
4 In the Composition panel, draw a small star.
5 Use the Selection tool to position the star over the weighted end of the 
pendulum arm. 
6 Select Shape Layer 1 to see the layer’s anchor point. Use the Pan Behind tool to 
move the anchor point in the center of the star shape, if it isn’t already there.
Positioning the track point
After Effects tracks motion by matching pixels from a selected area in a frame to 
pixels in each succeeding frame. You create tracking points to specify the area to 
track. A track point contains a feature region, a search region, and an attach point. 
After Effects displays the track point in the Layer panel as it tracks.

lesson 13 
Advanced editing techniques
You will track the metronome weight (the rhombus at the end of its arm) by placing 
tracking regions around the area that you’ll track another layer to. With the star 
shape added to the Tracking composition, you are ready to position the track point.
1 Select the metronome.mov layer in the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Animation > Track Motion.
3 The Tracker panel opens, and After Effects opens the selected layer in the Layer 
panel. A Track Point 1 indicator is in the center of the image. 
Notice the settings in the Tracker panel: Metronome.mov is selected in the Motion 
Source menu. The Current Track is Tracker 1, and the Motion Target is Shape Layer 
1, because After Effects automatically sets the Motion Target to the layer immedi-
ately above the source layer.
Now, you’ll position your track point.
4 Using the Selection tool ( ), move the Track Point 1 indicator (drag the empty 
portion of the feature region) in the Layer panel over the metronome weight.
5 Enlarge the search region (the outer box) to encompass the area around the 
pendulum. Then adjust the feature region (the inner box) within the weight. 
 Note: In this 
exercise, you want the 
star to move atop the 
metronome weight. 
However, if you wanted 
an object to move in 
relationship to the 
tracked area but not 
on top of it, you could 
reposition the attach 
point accordingly.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 329
moving and resizing  
the track points
In setting up motion tracking, it’s often necessary to refine a track point by adjusting 
its feature region, search region, and attach point. You can resize or move these 
items independently or in groups by dragging with the Selection tool. The pointer 
icon changes to reflect one of many different activities.

analyzing and applying tracking
Now that the search and feature regions are defined, you can apply the tracker.
1 Click the Analyze Forward button ( ) in the Tracker panel. Watch the analysis 
to ensure the track point stays with the metronome weight. If it doesn’t, press 
the spacebar to stop the analysis, and reposition the feature region. (See the 
sidebar “Checking for drift.”)
2 When the analysis is complete, click the Apply button.
3 In the Motion Tracker Apply Options dialog box, click OK to apply the tracking 
to the x and y dimensions. 
Checking for drift
As an image moves in a shot, the lighting, surrounding objects, and angle of the 
object can all change, making a once-distinct feature no longer identifiable at the 
subpixel level. It takes time to develop an eye for choosing a trackable feature. Even 
with careful planning and practice, you may often find that the feature region drifts 
away from the desired feature. Readjusting the feature and search regions, changing 
the tracking options, and trying again are all standard parts of digital tracking. When 
you notice drifting occurring, try the following:
1
Immediately stop the analysis by pressing the spacebar.
2
Move the current-time indicator back to the last good tracked point. You can see 
this in the Layer panel.
3
Reposition and/or resize the feature and search regions, being careful to not 
accidentally move the attach point. Moving the attach point will cause a 
noticeable jump in your tracked layer.
4
Click the Analyze Forward button to resume tracking.
 Note: The tracking 
analysis may take quite 
a while. The larger the 
search and feature 
regions, the longer 
After Effects takes to 
analyze tracking.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 331
The motion-tracking data is added to the Timeline panel, where you can see that 
the track data is in the metronome layer, but the results are applied to the Position 
property of the Shape Layer 1 layer. 
4 Watch a RAM preview. The star not only follows the pendulum; it moves with 
the camera’s movement.
5 When you’re ready, press the spacebar to stop playback.
6 Hide the properties for both layers in the Timeline panel, choose File > Save, 
and then choose File > Close Project.
Motion tracking an element onto background footage can be fun. As long as you 
have a stable feature to track, single-point motion tracking can be quite easy.
Using multipoint tracking
After Effects also offers two more advanced types of tracking that use multiple 
tracking points: parallel corner-pinning and perspective corner-pinning.
When you track using parallel corner-pinning, you simultaneously track three 
points in the source footage. After Effects calculates the position of a fourth point 
to keep the lines between the points parallel. When the movement of the points is 
applied to the target layer, the Corner Pin effect distorts the layer to simulate skew, 
scale, and rotation, but not perspective. Parallel lines remain parallel, and relative 
distances are preserved.
When you track using perspective corner-pinning, you simultaneously track four 
points in the source footage. When applied to the target footage, the Corner Pin 
effect uses the movement of the four points to distort the layer, simulating changes 
in perspective.
You’ll attach an animation to a computer monitor using perspective corner-pinning. 
If you haven’t already watched the sample movie for this exercise, do so now. 
Setting up the project

Now, you’ll create a new composition.
1 Press Ctrl+N (Windows) or Command+N (Mac OS).
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, type Multipoint_Tracking in the 
Composition Name field.
3 Make sure the Preset pop-up menu is set to NTSC DV. This automatically sets 
the width, height, pixel aspect ratio, and frame rate for the composition.
4 Set the Duration to 7:05, which matches the length of the majorspoilers.mov 
file, and then click OK.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 333
You will now add the footage items to the Timeline panel, one at a time.
5 Drag the multipoint_tracking.mov item from the Project panel to the Timeline 
panel. It automatically appears in the Composition panel.
6 Manually preview the footage, which is shaky because it was shot with a 
handheld camera. 
Because you’re positioning the majorspoilers.mov layer on the computer monitor, it 
will be fairly easy to place tracking markers on the flat plane. By default, the tracker 
tracks by luminance, so you will use the areas around the screen that have high 
contrast differences for tracking.
7 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler.
8 Drag the majorspoilers.mov footage item from the Project panel to the Timeline 
panel, placing it at the top of the layer stack.
9 To make it easier to see the underlying movie as you place the tracking points, 
turn off the Video switch for the majorspoilers.mov layer in the Timeline panel.
Positioning the track points
You’re ready to add the track points to the multipoint_tracking.mov layer.
1 Select the multipoint_tracking.mov layer in the Timeline panel.
2 Choose Window > Tracker to open the Tracker panel if it isn’t open.
3 In the Tracker panel, choose multipoint_tracking.mov from the Motion  
Source menu. 
4 Select the multipoint_tracking.mov layer again, and then click Track Motion. 
The desk scene opens in the Layer panel, with a track point indicator in the 
center of the image. However, you will be tracking four points in order to attach 
the animated movie to the computer screen.

5 Choose Perspective Corner Pin from the Track Type menu. Three more track 
point indicators appear in the Layer panel.
6 Drag the track points to four different high-contrast areas of the image. The four 
corners of the computer screen provide excellent contrast. Use the following 
image as a guide. (Because the areas of high contrast are also where you want  
to attach the majorspoilers layer, you don’t need to move the attach points.)
applying the multipoint tracker
You’re ready to analyze the data and apply the tracker.
1 Click the Analyze Forward button ( ) in the Tracker panel. When the analysis is 
complete, click the Apply button to calculate the tracking.
2 Notice the results in the Timeline panel: You can see the Corner Pin and 
Position property keyframes for the majorspoilers layer and the track point data 
for the motion_tracking layer.
3 Make the majorspoilers layer visible again, move the current-time indicator to 
the beginning of the timeline, and watch a RAM preview to see the results of  
the tracker.
4 When you’re done watching the preview, press the spacebar to stop playback.
If you don’t like the results, return to the Tracker panel, click the Reset button, and 
try again. With practice, you will become adept at identifying good feature regions.
5 Hide the layer properties to keep the Timeline panel neat, and choose File > 
Save to save your work.
6 Choose File > Close Project.
E Tip: Refer to the

mocha for after effects
In most cases, you’ll get better and more accurate tracking results using mocha  
from Imagineer Systems to track points in video. Now, mocha is included in After 
Effects. To track using mocha, choose Animation > Track In Mocha AE.
One advantage of mocha for After Effects is that you don’t have to accurately place 
tracking points to obtain a perfect track. Rather than using tracking points, mocha 
for After Effects uses a planar tracker, which attempts to track an object’s transla-
tion, rotation, and scaling data based on the movement of a user-defined plane. 
Planes provide more detail to the computer than is possible with single-point and 
multipoint tracking tools. 
When you work with mocha for After Effects, you need to identify planes in a clip 
that coincide with movement you want to track. Planes don’t have to be tabletops 
or walls. For example, if someone is waving goodbye, you can use their upper and 
lower limbs as two planes. After you track the planes, you can export the tracking 
data for use in After Effects. 
mocha for After Effects uses two different spline technologies for tracking: X splines 
and Bezier splines. X splines may work better for tracking, especially with perspec-
tive motion, but Bezier splines work well, too, and are the industry standard.
To learn more about mocha for After Effects, choose Help > Manual in mocha. 
We’ve saved some tracking data for the computer monitor in mocha for After 
Effects, so that you can apply it in After Effects if you’d like. To apply the data, follow 
these steps:
1
Create a new project in After Effects, and import the majorspoilers.mov 
and mocha_tracking.mov files from the Lesson13/Assets folder. Create a 
new composition from the mocha_tracking.mov file, and then drag the 
majorspoilers.mov file to the top of the layer stack in the Timeline panel. 
2
Open the mocha_data.txt file (in the Lesson 13/Optional_Mocha_Tutorial folder) 
in a text editor such as WordPad or TextEdit. (Don’t use Notepad on Windows. 
It doesn’t retain the mocha formatting, so After Effects doesn’t recognize its 
content on the clipboard.) Choose Edit > Select All, and then Edit > Copy to copy 
all the data.
3
Select the majorspoilers.mov layer in the Timeline panel, and choose Edit > 
Paste. All the data is applied to the layer.

Creating a particle simulation
After Effects includes several effects that do an excellent job of creating particle 
simulations. Two of them—CC Particle Systems II and CC Particle World—are 
based on the same engine. The major difference between the two is that Particle 
World enables you to move the particles in 3D space, rather than in a 2D layer.
In this exercise, you’ll learn how to use the CC Particle Systems II effect to create a 
supernova that could be used as the opening of a science program or as a motion 
background. If you haven’t already watched the sample movie for this exercise, do so 
now before continuing. 
Setting up the project

You don’t need to import any footage items for this exercise. However, you do need 
to create the composition.
1 In After Effects, press Ctrl+N (Windows) or Command+N (Mac OS).
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, type Supernova in the Composition

5 Go to 4:00 to see the particle system.
A large stream of yellow particles appears in the Composition panel.
Customizing the particle effect
You will turn this stream of particles into a supernova by customizing the settings 
in the Effect Controls panel.
1 Expand the Physics property group in the Effect Controls panel. The Explosive 
Animation setting works fine for this project, but instead of the particles  
falling down, you want them to flow out in all directions, so change the Gravity 
value to 0.0.
2 Hide the Physics property group, and expand the Particle property group. Then 
choose Faded Sphere from the Particle Type menu. 
Now the particles look intergalactic. Don’t stop there, though.
3 Change the Death Size to 1.50, and increase the Size Variation to 100%. This 
allows the particles to change birth size randomly.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 339
4 Reduce the Max Opacity to 55%. This make the particles semi-transparent.
5 Click the Birth Color swatch, and change the color to R=255, G=200, B=50 to 
give the particles a yellow hue at birth. Then click OK.
6 Click the Death Color swatch, and change the color to R=180, G=180, B=180 to 
give the particles a light gray hue as they fade out. Then click OK.
7 To keep the particles from staying onscreen too long, decrease the Longevity 
value to 0.8 seconds. 
The Faded Sphere particle type softens the look, but the particle shapes are still  
too sharply defined. You will fix that by blurring the layer to blend the particles 
with one another. 
 Note: Even though 
they’re at the top of the 
Effect Controls panel, it 
is often easier to adjust 
the Longevity and 
Birth Rate settings after 
you have set the other 
particle properties.

Understanding Particle 
Systems II properties
Particle systems have a unique vocabulary. Some of the key settings are explained 
here for your reference. They’re listed in the order in which they appear (top to bot-
tom) in the Effect Controls panel.
Birth Rate Controls the number of particles generated per second. The value itself 
is arbitrary and does not equal the actual number of particles being generated. 
However, the higher the number, the more densely packed the particles become.
Longevity Determines how long the particles are visible.
Producer Position Controls the center point or origin of the particle system. The 
position is set based on the x, y coordinates. All particles emanate from this single 
point. You can control the size of the producer by making adjustments to the x and y 
radius settings. The higher these values, the larger the producer point will be. A high 
x value and a y value of zero (0) result in a line.
Velocity Controls the speed of particles. The higher the number, the faster the 
particles move.
Inherent Velocity % Determines how much of the velocity is passed along to the 
particles when the Producer Position is animated. A negative value causes the par-
ticles to move in the opposite direction.
Gravity Determines how fast particles fall. The higher the value, the faster the par-
ticles fall. A negative value causes particles to rise.
Resistance Simulates particles interacting with air or water, slowing over time.
Direction Determines which directions the particles flow. Use with the Direction 
Animation type.
Extra Introduces randomness into the movement of the particles.
Birth/Death Size Determines the size of the particles when they are created and 
when they expire. 
Opacity Map Controls opacity changes for the particle over its lifetime.
Color Map Use with the Birth and Death colors to shade the particles over time.

about high dynamic  
range (hDr) footage
After Effects CS6 also supports high dynamic range (HDR) color.
The dynamic range (ratio between dark and bright regions) in the physical world 
far exceeds the range of human vision and of images that are printed or displayed 
on a monitor. But while human eyes can adapt to very different brightness levels, 
most cameras and computer monitors can capture and reproduce only a limited 
dynamic range. Photographers, motion-picture artists, and others working with 
digital images must be selective about what’s important in a scene, because they’re 
working with a limited dynamic range.
HDR footage opens up a world of possibilities, because it can represent a very wide 
dynamic range through the use of 32-bit floating-point numeric values. Floating-
point numeric representations allow the same number of bits to describe a much 
larger range of values than integer (fixed-point) values. HDR values can contain 
brightness levels, including objects as bright as a candle flame or the sun, that far 
exceed those in 8-bit-per-channel (bpc) or 16-bpc (non-floating-point) mode. Lower 
dynamic range 8-bpc and 16-bpc modes can represent RGB levels only from black 
to white, which represents an extremely small segment of the dynamic range in the 
real world.
Currently, HDR images are used mostly in motion pictures, special effects, 3D work, 
and some high-end photography. After Effects CS6 supports HDR images in a vari-
ety of ways. For example, you can create 32-bpc projects to work with HDR footage, 
and you can adjust the exposure, or the amount of light captured in an image, when 
working with HDR images in After Effects. For more information about support in 
After Effects for HDR images, see After Effects Help.

retiming playback using the timewarp effect
The Timewarp effect in After Effects gives you precise control over a wide range of 
parameters when changing the playback speed of a layer, including interpolation 
methods, motion blur, and source cropping to eliminate unwanted artifacts. 
In this exercise, you will use the Timewarp effect to change the speed of a clip for  
a dramatic slow-motion playback. If you haven’t already watched the sample movie 
for this exercise, do so now. 
Setting up the project
Start by launching After Effects and creating a new project.
1 If After Effects isn’t open, start it, and then immediately hold down 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS) to restore 
default preferences settings. When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file, and click Close to close the Welcome screen.
After Effects opens to display an empty, untitled project.
2 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
3 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13/ 
Finished_Projects folder.
4 Name the project Lesson13_Timewarp.aep, and then click Save.
Importing the footage and creating the composition
You need to import one footage item for this exercise.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import File  
dialog box.
2 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson13/Assets folder on your hard disk, 
select the Group_Approach[DV].mov, and click Open. 
3 Click OK in the Interpret Footage dialog box.
Now, you’ll create a new composition based on the footage item’s aspect ratio and 
its duration.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 347
4 Drag the Group_Approach[DV].mov file onto the Create A New Composition 
button (
) at the bottom of the Project panel. After Effects creates a new 
composition named for the source file, and displays it in the Composition and 
Timeline panels.
5 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Using timewarp
In the source footage, a group of young people approaches the camera at a steady 
pace. At around 2 seconds, the director would like the motion to begin to slow 
down to 10%, and then ramp back up to full speed at 7:00.
1 With the Group_Approach [DV] layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose 
Effect > Time > Timewarp.
2 In the Timewarp area of the Effect Controls panel, choose Pixel Motion from 
the Method menu. This instructs Timewarp to create new frames by analyzing 
the pixel movement in nearby frames and creating motion vectors. Also,  
choose Speed from the Adjust Time By menu, to control the time adjustment  
by percentage rather than by a specific frame. 
3 Go to 2:00.
4 In the Effect Controls panel, set the Speed to 100, and click the stopwatch ( )  
to set a keyframe. This tells Timewarp to keep the speed of the clip at 100% until 
the 2-second mark.

348 
lesson 13 
Advanced editing techniques
5 Go to 5:00, and change the Speed to 10. After Effects adds a keyframe.
6 Go to 7:00, and set the Speed to 100. After Effects adds a keyframe.
7 Press the Home key, or move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the 
time ruler, and then watch a RAM preview of the effect. 
You will see that the speed adjustments are rather abrupt—not the smooth, slow-
motion curve you would expect to see in a professional effect. This is because the 
keyframes are linear instead of curved. You’ll fix that next.
8 Press the spacebar to stop playback when you’re ready.
9 With the Group_Approach[DV] layer selected in the Timeline panel, press the  
U key to see the animated Timewarp Speed property.
10  Click the Graph Editor button (
) in the Timeline panel so you can see the 
Graph Editor instead of the layer bars. Make sure the Speed property name for 
the Group_Approach[DV] layer is selected. The Graph Editor displays its graph.
11  Click to select the first Speed keyframe (at 2:00), and then click the Easy Ease 
icon (
) at the bottom of the Graph Editor. This adjusts the influence into and 
out of the keyframe to smooth out sudden changes.
12  Repeat step 11 for the other two Speed keyframes in the motion graph,  
at 5:00 and 7:00.
The motion graph is now smoother, but you can tweak it even more by dragging 
the Bezier handles. 
 Note: Be patient. 
The RAM preview 
might take some time 
to calculate, but it 
will provide a more 
accurate playback than 
a spacebar preview.
E Tip: Close columns 
in the Timeline panel to 
see more icons in the 
Graph Editor. You can 
also apply an Easy Ease 
adjustment by pressing 
the F9 key.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 349
13  Using the Bezier handles for the keyframes at 2:00 and 5:00, adjust the curve  
so that it resembles the following image. 
14  Watch another RAM preview. This time, the slow-motion Timewarp effect  
looks professional. 
15  Choose File > Save to save the project, and then choose File > Close Project.
You’ve now experimented with some of the advanced features in After Effects, 
including motion stabilization, motion tracking, particle systems, and the 
Timewarp effect. To render and export any or all of the projects you completed  
in this lesson, see Lesson 14, “Rendering and Outputting,” for instructions.
 Note: If you need 
a refresher on using 
Bezier handles, see 
Lesson 7, “Working  
with Masks.”

review questions
1
What is the Warp Stabilizer, and when do you need to use it?
2
Why might drifting occur when you’re tracking an image?
3
What is the birth rate in a particle effect?
4
What does the Timewarp effect do?
review answers
1 Shooting footage using a handheld camera typically results in shaky shots. Unless 
this look is intentional, you will want to stabilize the shots to eliminate unwanted 
motion. The Warp Stabilizer in After Effects analyzes the movement and rotation of 
the target layer, and then makes adjustments to it. When played back, the motion 
appears smooth, because the layer itself moves incrementally to offset the unwanted 
motion. You can change the way the Warp Stabilizer crops, scales, and performs other 
adjustments by modifying settings for the effect.
2 Drifting occurs when the feature region loses the feature that’s being tracked. As an 
image moves in a shot, the lighting, surrounding objects, and angle of the object can 
change, making a once-distinct feature unidentifiable at the subpixel level. Even with 
careful planning and practice, the feature region often drifts away from the desired 
feature. Readjusting the feature and search regions, changing the tracking options, and 
trying again are all standard procedures in digital tracking.
3 The birth rate in a particle effect determines how often new particles are created.
4 The Timewarp effect gives you precise control over a wide range of parameters to 
change the playback speed of a layer, including interpolation methods, motion blur, 
and source cropping to eliminate unwanted artifacts.

The success of any project depends on your ability to 
deliver it in the format you need, whether it’s for the 
web or broadcast output. Using Adobe After Effects, 
you can create timesaving templates, and then render 
and export a final composition in a variety of formats 
and resolutions.

lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
Getting started
This lesson continues from the point at which all preceding lessons end: when 
you’re ready to output the final composition. In order to produce several versions 
of the animation for this lesson, you’ll explore options available within the Render 
Queue panel. After creating render-settings and output-module templates, you’ll 
produce both a broadcast version and a web version of the final movie. For this  
lesson, we provide you with a starting project file that is essentially the final  
composition from Lesson 5 of this book. 
1 Make sure the following files are in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson14 folder  
on your hard disk, or copy them from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom  
in a Book DVD now:
•
In the Assets folder: CarRide.psd, GordonsHead.mov, HeadShape.ffx,  
piano.wav, studer_Comcast.jpg, studer_Map.jpg, studer_music.jpg,  
studer_Puzzle.jpg, and studer_Real_Guys.jpg
•
In the Start_Project_File folder: Lesson14_Start.aep
•
In the Sample_Movies folder: Lesson14_JPEG2000_Final.mov,  
Lesson14_MPEG4_Final.mov, Lesson14_NTSC_Final.mov
2 Open and play the sample movies for Lesson 14, which represent different final 
versions of the animation—rendered with different quality settings—that you 
created in Lesson 5. When you’re done viewing the sample movies, quit 
QuickTime Player. You may delete the sample movies from your hard disk if you 
have limited storage space.
As always, when you begin the lesson, restore the default application settings for 
After Effects. See “Restoring default preferences” on page 2.
3 Start After Effects, and then immediately hold down Ctrl+Alt+Shift (Windows) 
or Command+Option+Shift (Mac OS). When prompted, click OK to delete your 
preferences file. Click Close to close the Welcome screen. 
4 Choose File > Open Project. 
5 Navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson14/Start_Project_File folder, select 
the Lesson14_Start.aep file, and click Open.
6 Choose File > Save As > Save As.
7 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson14/ 
Finished_Project folder.
8 Name the project Lesson14_Finished.aep, and then click Save.
9 Choose Window > Render Queue to open the Render Queue panel.
 Note: Because the 
Lesson14_NTSC_Final.
mov file is ready for 
broadcast, it is a large 
file and may not play 
back in real time in 
QuickTime Player.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 355
Creating templates for the rendering process
In previous lessons, you selected individual render and output-module settings on 
those occasions when you output your compositions. In this lesson, you’ll create 
templates for both render settings and output-module settings. These templates 
are presets that you can use to streamline the setup process when you render items 
for the same type of delivery format. After you define these templates, they appear 
in the Render Queue panel on the appropriate pop-up menu (Render Settings or 
Output Module). Then, when you’re ready to process a job, you can simply select 
the template that is appropriate for the delivery format that your job requires, and 
the template applies all the settings. 
Creating a render-settings template for full resolution
The first template you’ll create is for full-resolution output.
1 Choose Edit > Templates > Render Settings to open the Render Settings 
Templates dialog box.
2 In the Settings area, click New to open the Render Settings dialog box.

356 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
3 In the Render Settings area, confirm that Best is selected for Quality and Full  
for Resolution.
4 In the Time Sampling area, do the following:
• For Frame Blending, make sure On For Checked Layers is selected.
• For Motion Blur, make sure On For Checked Layers is selected.
• For Time Span, choose Length Of Comp.
• In the Frame Rate area, make sure Use Comp’s Frame Rate is selected.
5 Click OK to return to the Render Settings Templates dialog box. 
All the settings you selected appear in the lower half of the dialog box. If you need 
to make any changes, click Edit, and then adjust your settings.
6 For Settings Name, type Final Render_Fullres (for full resolution).

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 357
7 At the top of the dialog box, in the Defaults area, choose Final Render_Fullres 
for Movie Default. Then click OK to close the dialog box.
Final Render_Fullres is now the default Render Settings option, and will appear 
(instead of Current Settings) when you add a composition to the Render Queue 
panel to make a movie, which you’ll do later in this lesson.
Creating a render-settings template for test renderings
Next, you’ll create a second render-settings template, selecting settings appropri-
ate for rendering a test version of your final movie. A test version is smaller—and 
therefore renders faster—than a full-resolution movie. When you work with 
complex compositions that take relatively long times to render, it is a good practice 
to render a small test version first. This helps you find any final tweaks or blunders 
that you want to adjust before you take the time to render the final movie.
1 Choose Edit > Templates > Render Settings. The Render Settings Templates 
dialog box appears.
2 In the Settings area, click New to create a new template.
E Tip: If you want to 
save a render-settings 
template for use on 
another system, click 
Save All in the Render 
Settings Templates 
dialog box before you 
close it in step 7. Save 
the file with an .ars 
extension, and copy 
it to the other system. 
There, choose Edit > 
Templates > Render 
Settings, click Load, 
and select the .ars file 
to load the settings 
you saved.

358 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
3 In the Render Settings area of the Render Settings dialog box, do the following:
•
Leave Quality at Best.
•
For Resolution, choose Third, which reduces the linear dimension of the 
composition to one-third.
4 In the Time Sampling area, do the following:
• For Frame Blending, choose Current Settings.
• For Motion Blur, choose Current Settings.
• For Time Span, choose Length Of Comp.
5 In the Frame Rate area, select Use This Frame Rate, and type 12 (fps). Then click 
OK to return to the Render Settings Templates dialog box. 
6 For Settings Name, type Test_lowres (for low resolution). 
7 Examine your settings, which now appear in the lower half of the dialog box. If 
you need to make any changes, click Edit to adjust the settings. Then click OK.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 359
The Test_lowres option will be available on the Render Settings pop-up menu in 
the Render Queue panel.
You have created two render-settings templates. One is for a full-resolution final 
version, and one is for a low-resolution test version of your final composite.
Creating templates for output modules
Using processes similar to those in the previous section, you’ll create templates to 
use for output-module settings. Each will include unique combinations of settings 
that are appropriate for a specific type of output.
Creating an output-module template 
for broadcast renderings
The first template you’ll create for output-module settings is appropriate for an 
NTSC broadcast-resolution version of your final movie.
1 Choose Edit > Templates > Output Module.
2 In the Settings area, click New to open the Output Module Settings dialog box.

360 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
3 In the Output Module area, do the following:
• For Format, choose QuickTime.
• For Post-Render Action, choose Import. 
4 In the Video Output area, click Format Options. 
 5 In the QuickTime Options dialog box, choose Animation from the Video Codec 
menu. Click OK to close the dialog box. 
6 Review the settings in the Output Module Settings dialog box to make sure that 
the Channels pop-up menu is set to RGB and Depth is set to Millions Of Colors. 
7 Select the Audio Output option, and choose 44.100 kHz from the first pop-up 
menu. Make sure the other two are set to 16 Bit and Stereo.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 361
8 Click OK to return to the Output Module Templates dialog box. Review the  
settings in the lower half of the dialog box; click Edit if you need to adjust any of 
your settings.
9 For Settings Name, type Final Render_QT_audio (to remind you that this 
template for QuickTime includes audio).
10  In the Defaults area, choose Final Render_QT_audio from the Movie Default 
menu. Then click OK.
The Final Render_ QT_audio template is now the default selection for the Output 
Module pop-up menu, and will appear (instead of Lossless) each time you add a 
composition to the Render Queue panel.
Creating a low-resolution output-module template
Next, you’ll create a second output-module template, with settings appropriate for 
producing a low-resolution test version of the movie. In this case, the settings that 
you’ll select are also appropriate for a web version of the movie.
1 Choose Edit > Templates > Output Module to open the Output Module 
Templates dialog box.
2 In the Settings area, click New to create a new template.
3 In the Output Module Settings dialog box, for Format, choose QuickTime. 
E Tip: As with 
the render-settings 
templates, you can 
save output-module 
templates for use on 
other systems. Click 
Save All in the Output 
Module Templates 
dialog box. Save the file 
with an .aom extension, 
and copy it to another 
system. There, choose 
Edit > Templates > 
Output Module, click 
Load, and select 
the .aom file to load 
the settings.

362 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
4 For Post-Render Action, choose Import.
5 In the Video Output area, click Format Options, and then select the following 
settings in the QuickTime Options dialog box:
s
•
For Video Codec, choose 
MPEG-4 Video. This 
compressor automatically 
determines the color 
depth. 
•
Set the Quality slider to 80. 
•
In the Advanced Settings 
area, select Key Frame 
Every, and then type 30 
(frames).
•
In the Bitrate Settings area, 
select Limit Data Rate To, 
and type 150 (kbps). 
6 Select the Audio tab, and 
choose IMA 4:1 from the 
Audio Codec menu.
7 Click OK to close the QuickTime Options dialog box and return to the Output 
Module Settings dialog box.
8 Select Audio Output at the bottom of the dialog box, if it’s not already selected. 
Then choose the following audio settings, from left to right:
• Rate: 22.050 kHz.
• Use: Stereo.
 Note: The IMA 
4:1 compressor is 
commonly used 
when compressing 
audio for web or 
desktop playback.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 363
9 Click OK to close the Output Module Settings dialog box.
10 In the lower half of the Output Module Templates dialog box, examine your 
settings, and click Edit if you need to make any changes.
11 For Settings Name, type Test_MPEG4, and then click OK. Now this output 
template will be available on the Output Module pop-up menu in the Render 
Queue panel. 
As you might expect, greater compression and lower audio sample rates create 
smaller file sizes, but they also reduce the quality of the output. However, this  
low-resolution template is fine for creating test movies or movies for the web.
exporting to different output media
Now that you have created templates for your render settings and output modules, 
you can use them to export different versions of the movie. 
Preparing to output a test movie
First, you’ll produce the test version, selecting the Test_lowres render-settings  
template and the Test_MPEG4 output-module template that you created. 

364 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
about compression
Compression is essential to reduce the size of movies so that they can be  
stored, transmitted, and played back effectively. When exporting or rendering a 
movie file for playback on a specific type of device at a certain bandwidth, you 
choose a compressor/decompressor (also known as an encoder/decoder), or codec, 
to compress the information and generate a file that is readable by that type of 
device at that bandwidth.
A wide range of codecs is available; no single codec is the best for all situations. 
For example, the best codec for compressing cartoon animation is generally not 
efficient for compressing live-action video. When compressing a movie file, you can 
fine-tune it for the best-quality playback on a computer, video playback device, 
the web, or from a DVD player. Depending on which encoder you use, you may be 
able to reduce the size of compressed files by removing artifacts that interfere with 
compression, such as random camera motion and excessive film grain.
The codec you use must be available to your entire audience. For instance, if you 
use a hardware codec on a capture card, your audience must have the same capture 
card installed, or a software codec that emulates it.
For more about compression and codecs, see After Effects Help.
1 Drag the Lesson05 composition from the Project panel to the Render  
Queue panel.
In the Render Queue panel, note the default settings in the Render Settings  
and Output Module pop-up menus. You’ll change those settings to your  
low-resolution templates.
E Tip: Alternatively, 
you can select the 
Lesson05 composition 
in the Project panel and 
choose Composition > 
Add To Render Queue.

2
Choose Test_lowres from the Render Settings menu.
3
Choose Test_MPEG4 from the Output Module menu.
4
Click the orange, underlined words next to Output To.
5 In the Output Movie To dialog box, locate the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson14 
folder, and create a new folder called Final_Movies:
• In Windows, click the Create New Folder icon, and then type a name for  
the folder.
• In Mac OS, click the New Folder button, name the folder, and click Create. 
6 Open the Final_Movies folder.
7 Name the file Final_MPEG4.mov, and then click Save to return to the Render 
Queue panel. 
8 Choose File > Save to save your work.
You’ll do a few more things before you render the movie. Leave the Render Queue 
panel open for the next exercise.

366 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
Working with multiple output modules
Next, you’ll add another output module to this render queue item so that 
you can compare the results of two compressors. You’ll set this one for JPEG 
2000 compression.
1 With the Lesson05 composition still selected in the Render Queue panel,  
choose Composition > Add Output Module. A second set of Output Module 
and Output To options appears directly beneath the first. 
2 From the lower Output Module pop-up menu, choose Test_MPEG4.
3 Click the orange, underlined words Test_MPEG4 to open the Output Module 
Settings dialog box, and then click Format Options in the Video Output area.
4 In the QuickTime Options dialog box, choose JPEG 2000 from the Video  
Codec menu.
The other settings should remain the same from the Test_MPEG4 template, as 
shown here. 
 Note: You do not 
need to render a movie 
multiple times to export 
it to multiple formats 
with the same render 
settings. You can export 
multiple versions of 
the same rendered 
movie by adding output 
modules to a render 
item in the Render 
Queue panel.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 367
5 Click OK to close the QuickTime Options dialog box.
6 Click OK again to close the Output Module Settings dialog box.
7 Next to Output To, click the orange, underlined words Lesson05.mov to open 
the Output Movie To dialog box.
8 Name the movie Final_JPEG2000.mov, and save it in the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/
Lesson14/Final_Movies folder. 
9 Choose File > Save to save the project, and then click the Render button in the 
Render Queue panel. After Effects renders the movie and processes both of 
these formats simultaneously. 
When the processing is complete, both the Final_MPEG4 and Final_JPEG2000 
movies appear in the Project panel. 
 Note: You may find 
it helpful to further 
reduce the size of the 
movie before posting 
it to a website. You 
may want to create 
streaming video, or 
simply reduce the size 
based on the majority of 
the audience’s available 
bandwidth. You can 
do this with a media-
compression or media-
cleaner application 
specifically designed for 
this purpose.

368 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
To preview each movie, double-click it in the Project panel, and then create a RAM 
preview. Then, in Explorer or the Finder, select the movie that looks better to you, 
and rename it Final_Web.mov (do not rename it within After Effects). This version 
is ready for Gordon Studer’s prospective clients to view on the web.
If you need to make any final changes to the animation, reopen the composition 
and make those adjustments now. Remember to save your work when you finish, 
and then output the test movie again using the appropriate settings. After examin-
ing the test movie and making any necessary changes, you’ll proceed with output-
ting the movie for full-resolution broadcast.
Preparing the composition for full-resolution output
Next, you’ll prepare to render and output the final composition at full resolution. 
This animation is intended primarily for NTSC video output. You’ll begin by  
creating a new composition at the appropriate size for your final delivery format.
1 Choose Composition > New Composition.
2 In the Composition Settings dialog box, do the following:
•
For Name, type Final Comp NTSC.
•
For Preset, choose NTSC D1. This automatically sets the dimensions  
(720 x 486), pixel aspect ratio (D1/DV NTSC), and frame rate (29.97).
•
For Resolution, choose Full.
•
For Duration, type 2000 to specify 20 seconds, and then click OK. 

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 369
The new, empty composition opens in the Composition and Timeline panels.
3 In the Project panel, drag the Lesson05 composition onto the Final Comp  
NTSC composition icon.
Using pixel aspect ratio correction 
As you preview the animation, you may notice that the items in the Composition 
panel now appear a bit wider than before. That’s because this NTSC D1 composi-
tion has a nonsquare pixel aspect ratio. However, your computer monitor displays 
images using square pixels. Therefore, the images that you see in the Composition 
panel appear stretched unless you enable a feature called pixel aspect ratio correc-
tion. Pixel aspect ratio correction squeezes the view of the composition slightly 
to display the image as it will appear on a video monitor. By default, this feature is 
turned off, but you can easily turn it on.
1 Go to 3:00, where there are a few  
elements, including Gordon  
Studer’s masked head, in the  
Composition panel.
2 Choose View Options from the 
Composition panel menu.
3 In the View Options dialog box, 
select Pixel Aspect Ratio Correction 
(in the View area). Then click OK to 
close the dialog box.

370 
lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
The image in the Composition panel is squeezed, appearing (at a modified pixel 
aspect ratio) as it will when this item is rendered, laid off to tape, and viewed on a 
video monitor. The layers in the Composition panel may appear a bit jagged while 
you have this view turned on. You’ll want to turn it off to see your images with full 
anti-aliasing. This view does not affect rendering for final output.
4 Turn pixel aspect ratio correction off and on a couple of times by clicking 
the Toggle Pixel Aspect Ratio Correction button ( ) at the bottom of the 
Composition panel. 
Using pixel aspect ratio correction, you can work in a composition with a non-
square pixel aspect ratio but still view your images as they would appear on a 
video monitor.
 Note: You may 
need to widen the 
Composition panel to 
see all its buttons.

Adobe After effeCts Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 371
Preparing movies for  
mobile devices
You can create movies in After Effects for playback on mobile devices, such as the 
Apple iPad and mobile phones. To render your movie, add the composition to the 
Adobe Media Encoder encoding queue, and choose an appropriate device-specific 
encoding preset. 
For the best results, consider the limitations of mobile devices as you shoot footage 
and work with After Effects. For a small screen size, pay careful attention to lighting, 
and use a lower frame rate. See After Effects Help for more tips. 
rendering the final movie for broadcast
Now you’ll render and output the NTSC broadcast version of your final animation. 
This may take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour or more, depending on 
your system.
1 Click the Render Queue panel tab to bring the panel forward, and hide the 
Lesson05 render details so you can focus on your next renders.
2 Drag the Final Comp NTSC composition from the Project panel to the Render 
Queue panel below the Lesson05 composition.
3 Next to Output To, click the orange, underlined words Final Comp NTSC.mov 
to open the Output Movie To dialog box.
4 Name the movie Final_NTSC.mov (indicating that this item will be rendered 
at NTSC D1 resolution), and specify the AECS6_CIB/Lessons/Lesson14/Final_
Movies folder. Then click Save to return to the Render Queue panel.
The Final Render_Fullres setting is selected in the Render Settings menu and the 
Final Render_QT_audio setting is selected in the Output Module menu because 
you set these as the defaults when you created the templates.

lesson 14 
rendering and outputting
The composition is now ready to render.
5 Save the project one more time, and then click the Render button.
6 When After Effects has finished rendering and outputting the file, close the 
Render Queue panel. 
7 In the Project panel, double-click the Final_NTSC.mov file to open it in the 
Footage panel, and then make a RAM preview. Or, you can play the movie from 
the Explorer or Finder.
As you play the movie, compare your final rendered output to the NTSC sample 
movie you watched at the beginning of this lesson. If necessary, reopen the compo-
sition and make changes. Then save the project and render the movie again. 
You have created both a web version and a broadcast version of the final animation. 
Congratulations! You have completed all the lessons in Adobe After Effects CS6 
Classroom in a Book. 
While this book is intended to give you a good foundation for working with  
After Effects, it can’t cover everything. To continue learning about After Effects, 
check out the resources described in the Getting Started section at the beginning  
of the book.
 Note: Because this 
movie is so large, it 
may not play back in 
real time in QuickTime 
Player. If you have a 
video playback card 
installed on your 
system, output the 
movie after choosing 
the appropriate 
compressor and frame 
size for that card in the 
QuickTime Options 
dialog box. Import 
the movie into your 
editing software, and 
play it back using your 
hardware for real-time 
playback.

review questions
1 Name two types of templates, and explain when and why to use them.
2 What is compression, and what are some issues associated with it?
review answers
1 In After Effects, you can create templates for both render settings and output-module 
settings. These templates are presets that you can use to streamline the setup process 
when you render items for the same type of delivery format. After you define these 
templates, they appear in the Render Queue panel on the appropriate pop-up menu 
(Render Settings or Output Module). Then, when you’re ready to render a job, you 
can simply select the template that is appropriate for the delivery format that your job 
requires, and the template applies all the settings.
2 Compression is essential to reduce the size of movies so that they can be stored, 
transmitted, and played back effectively. When exporting or rendering a movie file for 
playback on a specific type of device at a certain bandwidth, you choose a compressor/
decompressor, or codec, to compress the information and generate a file readable by 
that type of device at that bandwidth. A wide range of codecs is available; no single 
codec is the best for all situations. For example, the best codec for compressing 
cartoon animation is generally not efficient for compressing live-action video. When 
compressing a movie file, you can fine-tune it for the best-quality playback on a 
computer, video playback device, the web, or from a DVD player. Depending on which 
encoder you use, you may be able to reduce the size of compressed files by removing 
artifacts that interfere with compression, such as random camera motion and excessive 
film grain.

appendix: Color management in after effects CS6
about color management
Without color management, the color you see at one stage of design and production may not match 
what you see at another. In other words, color is device-dependent: The color you see depends on the 
device producing it. A color management system is designed to reconcile the different color capa-
bilities of the various components in your workflow—cameras, scanners, monitors, televisions—to 
ensure consistent color throughout the production process, and to help you see accurately the colors 
you specify in a project. 
A color management system maps colors from the color gamut of one device, such as a digital cam-
era, to a device with a different color gamut, such as a monitor. ICC color profiles, which describe the 
colors available to each device or color model, are used by a color management system (CMS) to map 
colors into device-independent gamuts, and then back to different devices.
In After Effects CS6, color management makes it possible for you to do the following:
• 
View accurate color and tone when using linear light (gamma 1.0) for compositing.
• 
Repurpose material for different output conditions.
• 
Work on projects using different computers.
• 
Manage footage from multiple sources.
• 
View color consistently in other applications.
• 
Simulate different output conditions without altering the color values in your project.
Using color management in after effects CS6
To turn color management on, choose File > Project Settings, and then select a working-space color 
profile from the Working Space menu.
To assign a color profile to footage, select the footage item, and choose File > Interpret Footage > 
Main. Then click the Color Management tab, and select an ICC profile.
To color-manage a file you’re rendering, click the Color Management tab in the Output Module 
Settings dialog box, and choose the appropriate ICC color profile.
To simulate output, choose View > Simulate Output > [film or print stock].
For more information about color management in After Effects CS6, specific ICC color profiles, and 
specific color management workflows, see After Effects Help.
