Foreword
From our earliest memories, my brothers, my 
sister, and I can picture our mother with a 
camera in her hands. Most of us developed an 
interest in photography from seeing all the 
photo albums my mom made. A case in point 
is my sister, Tammi, who had been shooting for 
years with a point-and-shoot camera and was 
achieving good results. She gradually became 
interested in portrait photography and found 
that her point-and-shoot camera just didn’t give 
her the quality she wanted.
One day Tammi called me and asked, “Dar-
rell, I want to buy a better camera. What would 
you suggest?” I told her she needed a camera 
with a larger imaging sensor (the camera part 
that captures the light) to get rid of that grainy 
look she was seeing in her pictures. I explained 
how using various lenses would give her the 
ability to compose her pictures in a more pleas-
ing way, blurring the background to focus at-
tention on her subject. I recommended a small 
digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera and a 
couple of lenses. She bought the camera and 
lenses and started trying to use them, only to 
run into the complexities of operating a more 
advanced camera. She asked for some help, so I 
gave her a book I had written for her particular 
camera model (from my Mastering the Nikon 
DSLR series). Over the next few days she read 
my book and tried to understand all the photo-
graphic terminology within. In frustration she 
called me and said, “I can’t figure out what all 
these words mean.”
I was flabbergasted for a moment because 
my books are rated highly in reviews as being 
easy to read and understand. Then it dawned 
on me what the problem was. My sister is a very 
intelligent person, but she lacked knowledge 
of what many photographic words mean. My 
more advanced books assume a certain level of 
photographic knowledge in explaining how to 
use a particular camera. Tammi simply didn’t 
have that basic knowledge about the terms of 
digital imaging. Photography has a language of 
its own with words most people—even those 
who have been using point-and-shoot cameras 
for years—simply would not know without 
studying. When Tammi read my book, some of 
the concepts made sense to her, but many of the 
words I used held no meaning. It was as if she 
were reading a Spanish textbook with only ru-
dimentary skills in speaking Spanish. Some of it 
made sense, but the rest was gibberish.
Therefore, being the loving brother that I 
fancy myself, I started roaming the bookstores 
in search of a basic tutorial book that would 
teach her the language of photography, without 
assuming any knowledge of digital imaging 
other than pushing the shutter-release but-
ton. I found lots of tutorial books out there and 
read them, only to find that they assumed basic 
knowledge that many complete newbies to the 
more advanced camera systems do not have. 
You see, authors are so familiar with the sub-
jects they write about that it’s easy for them to 
forget that others may not be as familiar, and 
they dive in using advanced terminology as 
they teach about the subject. For the newbie, it’s 
like joining a class halfway through the course, 
and the knowledge one missed from previous 

11

parts of the course makes it hard to move 
forward.
After failing to find a basic tutorial book that 
was truly basic—assuming no previous knowl-
edge of photography—I wrote some things 
down for Tammi and sent her the documents. 
She enjoyed reading material that she could 
easily understand and she made suggestions. 
After that, I sent my material to a few pro pho-
tographer friends and had them let members of 
their families and friends who are interested in 
learning about photography read the material 
and make suggestions. One 17-year-old boy sent 
word back to me that after reading my material 
he finally understood how the lens aperture and 
shutter speed works. He had taken a course and 
couldn’t quite get it, until he read my notes.
The book you have in your hands is the result 
of my quest to help my sister learn to use her 
camera, and my epiphany that this type of book 
is sorely needed in today’s extremely techni-
cal digital-photography world. If you have had 
problems with other books using words that 
make no sense to you, I hope this book will help 
you. I assume that you know absolutely noth-
ing about cameras other than how to turn your 
camera on and press the shutter-release button. 
If you have struggled to learn how to control 
a more advanced DSLR or other type of inter-
changeable lens camera (ILC), then this book 
will provide a great starting place to build your 
basic knowledge.
You will be able to build upon the knowledge 
you’ll learn in this book by using your camera, 
by getting good and bad results, and most im-
portantly, by learning why you get those results. 
Later, I encourage you to read other good books 
and to  keep growing your skill. This book will 
start you on your journey to excellence and help 
you learn the basics of the language of photog-
raphy. I wish you much success!
Keep on capturing time…

You are a different kind of photographer! While 
others are satisfied to use their tiny point-and-
shoot cameras and are perfectly happy with the 
lower-quality images and lack of control over the 
photographic process, you are more passionate 
about photography and you want higher quality 
and greater control.
You’ve used point-and-shoot cameras for 
years and recently have acquired a more pow-
erful digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) or inter-
changeable-lens camera (ILC), or you are at least 
considering it. Your images make people smile, 
and you are recognized as the photographer of 
the family. When friends or family get married, 
they ask you to shoot the wedding. At a party 
you always have your camera with you. In fact, 
you rarely go anywhere without your camera. 
You can no longer tolerate the “press the button 
and hope for good results” attitude. It’s time for 
something better!
Does this describe you? Even if it doesn’t, 
exactly, you have a deeper love for photography 
than the average person. You have taken point-
and-shoot technology as far as you can and are 
not satisfied with the quality of the resulting 
images. You want to control the camera more 
effectively and learn to make sharp, colorful, and 
well-composed images. You may feel a bit over-
whelmed by the complexity of the photographic 
process, but you are willing to learn. You have 
become what the photography industry calls an 
enthusiast. This book is for you! It will help you 
move beyond point-and-shoot photography into 
the world of more powerful cameras and ad-
vanced photographic skills.
This Book Assumes No Previous 
Knowledge
Unfortunately, many other instructional books 
assume that people who are coming over from 
the point-and-shoot world have knowledge they 
haven’t learned—yet. This book doesn’t make 
that assumption! We will discuss deep technical 
matters in an understandable way, without re-
sorting to unexplained technical jargon. We will 
use the terminology of the photographic world 
but not without first explaining all of the words. 
In a sense you are learning to speak a new lan-
guage, the language of photography. You’ll need 
to learn what the technical words mean, not just 
read them and wonder.
Is Camera Brand Important?
The brand of camera you have or will buy 
doesn’t matter, but let me qualify this statement. 
If you ask other photographers about camera 
brands, you will get varying opinions. Most pho-
tographers acknowledge that all of today’s DSLR 
and ILC cameras can make beautiful images. 
However, most photographers have strong opin-
ions about what camera brand to buy.
If you ask this question in an online camera 
forum, expect to see the flames fly. It can almost 
be like a discussion on religion or politics, with 
the accompanying emotion. The bottom line is 
that you must decide what brand to buy. Ask 
questions and consider the replies, then make 
your own decision. Go to camera stores and 
Chapter 1

handle the cameras. Read online reviews from 
people who already own a certain brand. You’ll 
soon get a feel for what you like best.
An important thing to consider before you 
decide on a certain brand of camera is the popu-
larity of the brand. This is important primarily 
because of the support systems that build up 
around camera brands over time. The more 
popular the brand, the easier it is to get lenses, 
accessories, educational materials, and support 
for the RAW image format of the camera. (We’ll 
discuss the RAW format in chapter 6. It is the 
camera’s proprietary file format for the highest 
possible image quality.)
One of the more important things a DSLR or 
ILC can do—that most point-and-shoot cameras 
can’t—is use different lenses. Lens availability 
should be a strong consideration when you are 
deciding which brand to buy. If a camera has 
only a few affordable lenses available, you may 
be held back as a photographer. Make sure your 
chosen brand has lenses from consumer level to 
pro level so you’ll have a clear upgrade path as 
your skill and desire grows. Collecting lenses can 
be quite expensive, yet very addictive. It would 
be even more expensive to change your mind 
later and start over.
If there is no clear path from enthusiast to 
professional in the camera body and lens line, 
and you later become a semiprofessional or 
professional photographer, you’ll have made 
an initial investment in one brand that must 
be replaced outright. That could be a terribly 
expensive mistake. Take this seriously because 
you may want to sell your images as your pho-
tography skills improve. Many enthusiasts use 
income from things like stock or event photog-
raphy to help finance new investments in ex-
pensive lenses and accessories. Try not to limit 
yourself now, even if you don’t think you’ll do 
anything commercial with your photography 
later. You may change your mind!
The two most popular camera brands—
Nikon and Canon—have massive support 
systems and a huge number of lenses and acces-
sories. Other brands that are making excellent 
progress in system support are Sony, Panasonic, 
Samsung, Olympus, Sigma, Pentax, and Fuji. 
Then there is the expensive Leica brand, whose 
lenses can cost as much as a compact car. With 
the rapid economic changes in today’s world, 
camera brands are sometimes absorbed by 
other camera companies or even disappear alto-
gether (remember Minolta?).
You have an amazing choice of camera 
brands and will get a lot of advice from different 
people. My advice is to stay with a larger cam-
era company so you’ll be able to grow as your 
skills and needs change. There is an interesting 
article on Wikipedia about camera brands at 
the following URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_digital_camera_brands.
I use Nikon cameras and lenses; therefore, 
many of the illustrations and most of the 
pictures in this book have been taken with 
the Nikon DSLRs and Nikkor lenses I’ve used 
through the years. I am quite biased about my 
choice of camera brand, and you are liable to 
find me on camera forums adding fuel to the 
flames. If you don’t already, you may soon feel 
strongly about your own choice of camera 
brand. Join the camera forums and we’ll discuss 
our choices. Additionally, when I show pictures 
of cameras and lenses in this book, they will be 
mostly Nikon brand merely because I have sev-
eral Nikon cameras and lenses available to take 
pictures of. If you ask me in person what brand 
of camera to buy, I will say Nikon, of course. 
However, it honestly doesn’t matter! Buy the 
brand that you can afford, and make sure it has 
good system support (see the upcoming section 
called “Choosing a Camera System”). All modern 
DSLRs and ILCs will take great pictures. We’ll 
talk more about this issue later in the chapter.
Let’s talk about the differences between the 
two types of cameras discussed in this book: 
DSLRs and ILCs. First we’ll discuss DSLRs.

W H AT  IS  A  DSLR?
What Is a DSLR?
Before single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras be-
came popular in the late 1950s, cameras had a 
separate viewfinder that was offset from the 
camera lens and showed an image slightly dif-
ferent than the one that was photographed. The 
photographer could not see through the lens 
the camera used to take a picture. In certain cir-
cumstances this led to a problem called parallax 
failure, which simply means that the viewfinder 
did not accurately register where the subject 
was located in the final image. The closer the 
photographer was to the subject, the worse the 
problem. Do you remember seeing all those old 
black-and-white pictures from years ago with 
cut off heads? That was because of parallax 
failure.
SLRs solved the problem with the reflex mir-
ror and prism system shown in figure 1.1. The 
reflex mirror redirects light from the lens up 
through the prism, out a viewfinder, and then 
into the photographer’s eye. As a result, photog-
raphers could look through the mounted lens 
and see the actual image the camera sees. To-
day’s DSLRs work in basically the same way.
Figure 1.1 shows the path taken by the light 
as it passes through the camera. Notice how you 
can see through the lens mounted on the cam-
era. This allows you to better control the compo-
sition of the image since you can see the subject 
the way it will appear in the final picture. No 
parallax failure with cut off heads!
When you take a picture with a DSLR, the 
reflex mirror moves up out of the way and lets 
light from the lens reach the camera’s imaging 
sensor. The sensor then records the image and 
the camera writes it to a memory card.
Figure 1.2 shows an older film SLR and a 
newer DSLR side by side. There’s not a lot of 
difference in appearance, is there? Do you have 
an older SLR camera and maybe a few older 
lenses? If so, that may be a good thing! Older SLR 
lenses will often work on a DSLR, and even 
on an ILC, with an adapter made by the camera 
manufacturer.
With so many new styles of cameras be-
coming available you should choose a camera 
system that will let you grow to whatever point 
you want to take your photography. DSLRs gen-
erally have a larger selection of lenses than ILCs, 
including lenses with a much longer reach (tele-
photo). Since the SLR style has been around for a

long time, you can often use less expensive, yet 
high quality, older SLR lenses on your new DSLR.
Primarily, a DSLR is a camera with a view-
finder based on a reflex mirror and prism sys-
tem, many interchangeable lenses, a big selec-
tion of accessories, and a large imaging sensor 
for high-quality image capture. Most current 
DSLRs have excellent HD video modes, too.
Now, what about ILCs?
What Is an ILC?
ILCs (interchangeable-lens cameras) are harder 
to describe because this category includes many 
types of cameras with interchangeable lenses1. 
There are basic ILCs with larger imaging sensors 
that are a step above point-and-shoot cameras, 
and there are ILC systems with lots of lenses 
that rival DSLR systems.
The primary difference between an ILC and a 
DSLR is that an ILC does not have a reflex mirror 
and prism; subsequently, they are called mirror-
less cameras. Instead, ILCs use various view-
finder styles, including the following:
1 
Other terms commonly used to describe these 
types of cameras are Mirrorless Interchangeable-
Lens Cameras (MILCs) and Electronic Viewfinder 
Interchangeable Lens (EVIL) cameras. Throughout 
this book we will use “ILC” to refer to these types of 
cameras.
 
f A basic viewfinder that doesn’t see through 
the lens (the older style with potential paral-
lax failure)
 
f An electronic viewfinder inside an eyepiece, 
similar to a DSLR camera
 
f A live view LCD monitor on the back of the 
camera
 
f A combination of any of these viewfinder 
styles
A small ILC camera can be indistinguishable 
from a better quality point-and-shoot cam-
era, and large ILC camera bodies can resemble 
DSLRs, although the bump on top of the camera 
is much smaller since there is no need for a 
bulky prism (figure 1.3). Two main things distin-
guish ILCs from point-and-shoot cameras:
 
f A larger imaging sensor allows very high 
quality images
 
f Various interchangeable lenses can be 
mounted on the camera body
Although their viewfinder systems differ, ILCs 
are similar to DSLRs in how they capture im-
ages. Their image quality can be similar to 
DSLRs, as long as the imaging sensor is a compa-
rable size. The most important thing to consider 
when buying an ILC is that it should have as 
large an imaging sensor as possible, and plenty 
of lenses and accessories to choose from. An 
upcoming section of this chapter will discuss 
imaging sensors and their available sizes.
Should I Choose a DSLR or an ILC?
The most enthusiastic enthusiasts use DSLR 
cameras! However, ILCs are increasing in power 
and capability with each new generation. ILCs 
used to be considered less powerful cameras 
with a better imaging sensor than point-and-
shoot cameras but with few other advantages. 
However, the differences between DSLRs and 
Figure 1.3: Small and large ILC cameras

17
W H AT  IS  A N  IM AGIN G  SENS O R?
ILCs are much less pronounced in the newest 
cameras. Some ILCs are very basic—similar to 
point-and-shoot cameras—and others are more 
like DSLRs (figure 1.3).
When should you choose a DSLR over an ILC? 
If you are going to do commercial work (even 
eventually), you may want to consider using a 
DSLR. If you want to make the best possible im-
ages, a DSLR may still provide an edge over an 
ILC due to more rapid and precise viewing of the 
subject through the viewfinder.
This is a touchy subject for some people; 
however, it is generally recognized that DSLRs 
are professionals’ camera of choice, mainly be-
cause of the support system in place from the 
longer existence of SLR-style cameras. As time 
goes by and as ILCs grow in power and popular-
ity, this may change. For now, if you see yourself 
specializing in things like action or sports pho-
tography, portrait work, or event shooting, you 
may want to choose a DSLR over an ILC.
ILCs are limited by the slowness of an elec-
tronic viewfinder, in comparison to the mir-
ror and prism system of DSLRs. The autofocus 
system (automatic camera focusing) can also 
be significantly slower in an older ILC because 
many of them used a type of autofocus called 
contrast detection. This type of autofocus is very 
precise, but can be slower than the phase detec-
tion system used in DSLRs. That’s why you see 
all those sports photographers with their DSLRs 
and huge, long lenses at sporting events. They 
must have very fast response times in order to 
capture fast-moving subjects. DSLRs excel for 
that type of photography. Additionally, the extra 
weight and size of a DSLR simply works better 
at balancing longer and heavier lenses.
When you are shooting action with an older 
ILC, it can be harder for you to keep up with 
the movement of subjects due to the camera’s 
slower autofocus and slower electronic view-
finder, or LCD monitor. However, newer ILCs 
have faster autofocus and electronic viewfind-
ers/LCD monitors, so you may do just fine with 
an ILC instead of a DSLR. Some of the latest 
ILCs offer both contrast detection and phase 
detection autofocus systems, like many DSLRs. 
Therefore, the gap in autofocus speed is quickly 
narrowing.
If you are primarily doing things like street 
photography, landscapes, and family pictures, 
an ILC is easily up to the task. Any type of 
slower, contemplative photography can be done 
equally well with a DSLR or ILC. Once again, it all 
boils down to your own preferences and style. 
Which camera type do you like best? That’s the 
one to use!
Better yet, get both. Use the DSLR when 
you are doing serious commercial-type work, 
and use the ILC when you just want to enjoy 
photography. Many photographers take that 
route. They use a DSLR when they don’t mind 
the extra size and weight of the camera and an 
ILC when they are interested in using a smaller 
camera, such as for travel photography.
Other than in this chapter, there is little 
mention of camera type in the rest of this 
book. Beyond Point-and-Shoot is about how to 
make great pictures using your chosen camera 
system, not so much about the type of camera 
hardware you choose to use. As long as you are 
using a camera with a large imaging sensor for 
quality (see the next section), interchangeable 
lenses, and normal camera controls, this book 
will help you become a more accomplished 
photographer.
What Is an Imaging Sensor?
In the old days of photography, people used 
various light-sensitive chemical coatings on 
some sort of base material to make an image. 
The first real photograph was made in 1826 
by a man in France named Joseph Niépce. He 
set up a box with a lens—called a camera ob-
scura—in an upper-story window of his estate 
and put a polished pewter plate coated with 

18
CH APTER 1
C A MER A  T YPES: M AKIN G  A CH OICE
a petroleum-based substance, called bitumen 
of Judea, inside the box. He uncapped his lens 
and let the light from the sunny day shine on 
his coated plate for eight hours. The sun shin-
ing through the lens exposed and hardened 
the sun-exposed parts of the bitumen, while 
areas that were darker on the image were not 
hardened. He then took the plate and used a sol-
vent to remove the softer bitumen. The world’s 
first genuine photograph made with a camera 
box and lens was the result. You can read more 
about this historic event and view the first im-
age at the following website: www.hrc.utexas.
edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp.
By the 1850s photography had caught on as 
something enthusiasts of the time could enjoy. 
It was a lot of work since there was no place 
to buy premade photography supplies. The 
photographer had to coat a base material with 
a light-sensitive substance and then process it 
into a photograph.
As time went by photography became more 
and more popular. Companies stepped up and 
provided premade film and cameras to take 
pictures so any enthusiastic person could be 
a photographer. For many years the medium 
of photography was film—either negatives or 
transparencies.
In 1888 George Eastman created the Kodak 
Camera. His slogan was “You press the button, 
we do the rest.” Within a year it became a well-
known saying, and photography exploded in 
popularity. The point-and-shoot camera was 
born! You can read about the early development 
of photography and film-based cameras at the 
following Kodak website: www.kodak.com/
global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/historyIntro.
jhtml.
Many enthusiasts of the time went beyond 
Kodak’s “we do the rest” concept and built a 
darkroom, where they used toxic chemicals to 
develop the film, which was then placed in an 
enlarger to make paper-based prints—using 
more toxic chemicals, of course. Those were the 
prints of yesteryear. Enthusiasts had to work 
harder than the people who were satisfied with 
letting Kodak do the rest.
Around 1999 photography changed in a ma-
jor way when manufacturers introduced profes-
sional level digital SLR cameras. Instead of using 
film, the image was captured on an electronic 
chip called an imaging sensor. At first, the digi-
tally captured images did not have the resolu-
tion of film, and most people didn’t take digital 
cameras seriously. However, by 2002 Nikon and 
Canon were releasing more consumer-oriented 
and affordable enthusiast DSLR cameras, along 
with less costly digital point-and-shoot models. 
The imaging sensor resolution was sufficient by 
then to make a reasonably large print. The rest 
is history.
The camera you now have, or wish to have, 
is based on digital technology. Instead of using 
film, chemicals in a darkroom, and an enlarger 
to make prints, a digital camera uses an imaging 
sensor to capture the image, a memory card to 
store the images, and an inkjet printer to make 
prints. The whole process is more flexible and 
faster, yet in some ways it is more complex.
How Does an Imaging Sensor Work?
The size of the imaging sensor in a DSLR or ILC 
can produce image quality that is unobtainable 
by even the best point-and-shoot cameras (fig-
ures 1.4 and 1.5). Many people do not realize why 
a camera with a large sensor can make such 
high-quality images. Let me explain.
What Is a Megapixel? All digital cameras have 
an imaging sensor that uses tiny light-gathering 
points called pixels—an abbreviation for picture 
elements (pix-els). There are millions of pixels 
on the imaging sensor. Each pixel captures a 
tiny part of the image, and all the pixels work 
together to capture the full image.
You have probably heard the word mega-
pixels, which simply means there are millions of 

19
W H AT  IS  A N  IM AGIN G  SENS O R?
pixels. The letters MP are used to represent the 
word megapixels. If your camera has 18 mega-
pixels, it will be called an 18 MP camera. Some 
common megapixel sizes are 6 MP, 8 MP, 10 MP, 
12 MP, 14 MP, 16 MP, 18 MP, and 24 MP. If the 
technology improves at its current pace, you can 
expect the number of megapixels to keep in-
creasing as camera manufacturers try to outdo 
one another. Camera companies advertise how 
many megapixels their cameras have as a major 
selling point. Most people think that the more 
megapixels, the better the image; however, that 
may not always be true, as we’ll discuss in a 
moment.
The size of the imaging sensor and the 
number of megapixels on it determine the 
maximum resolution (size) of the images you 
can create with the camera. However, there is a 
trade-off in quality when too many pixels are 
added to a sensor. The problem with a point-
and-shoot camera is that the sensor is very 
small, so as the number of pixels increases, the 
size of each individual pixel decreases. That can 
cause some problems, as discussed in the next 
section.
What about Imaging Sensor Size? To make 
a comparison, a point-and-shoot camera has 
an imaging sensor about the size of your little 
fingernail (figure 1.6). Imagine cramming 
millions of pixels into a space the size of your 
little fingernail. If you have a point-and-shoot 
camera with 14 MP, that means the camera 
manufacturer packed 14 million pixels onto a 
tiny little imaging sensor. Those pixels are so 
small that they are not very sensitive to light; 
subsequently, the camera has a much harder 
time making high quality images. The gain 
(sensitivity) of the pixels must be increased in 
lower light levels so a point-and-shoot camera 
can make a good picture. That degrades the im-
age by introducing random, meaningless color-
flecked graininess in the image, which is called 
noise.

camera before being installed in the camera

You know how static sounds when you turn 
up a radio to hear a station that is slightly out of 
range. The static is a noisy sound that degrades 
your radio-listening experience. Digital image 
noise is similar to static on a radio, except it 
is visual. Noise appears as random specks of 
grainy-looking dark or light colored specks that 
were not in the scene you photographed. It is 
one of the reasons people realize they need a 
better camera and move into the DSLR or ILC 
world.
On the other hand, a DSLR or ILC has an im-
aging sensor nearer the size of a postage stamp. 
That’s quite a difference! The same number of 
pixels put into a larger sensor area means the 
pixels can be larger and can gather light much 
more efficiently. The images can be sharper and 
have better color, contrast, and dynamic range 
(how much light, along a scale of dark to light, 
can be captured).
The photos from a DSLR or ILC can be en-
larged more efficiently and with higher quality. 
You’ll be amazed at the difference, and so will 
your friends and family.
Figure 1.6 shows a series of imaging sensor 
sizes used by many of today’s better cameras. 
If you already have a camera, check your user 
manual to see how big the imaging sensor is. 
The larger the sensor, the bigger the pixels can 
be, and the higher the potential quality of the 
images. Point-and-shoot cameras have tiny pix-
els and lower image quality; DSLR and ILC cam-
eras have bigger pixels and better image quality.

IMAGING SENSOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION
Imagine a calendar. In a month with 30 days, it has 30 squares on a rectangular sheet of paper. 
Each square represents a day, and the squares are arranged in a grid with rows and columns, 
where the rows are weeks (seven days) and the columns are weekdays (Sunday through 
Saturday).
If you look through a microscope and see the surface of an imaging sensor, it would look 
somewhat similar to a calendar grid, but are a lot more squares on an imaging sensor than on 
a calendar. Each pixel is like a tiny square on the surface of the sensor. Take a 16 MP camera, 
for instance, which has 16 million microscopic squares. Like a calendar, the imaging sensor has 
rows and columns. Each row on my 16 MP camera is 4,928 pixels wide (columns), and there are 
3,264 rows. Here is how the math works to arrive at 16 megapixels:
4,928 × 3,264 = 16,084,992
That means there are slightly more than 16 million pixels on the sensor. The camera companies 
usually round the number off to something like 16 MP or 16.2 MP. Often the advertised number 
will be slightly larger than the actual effective megapixel count because it just sounds better.
Each pixel is light sensitive and has a color filter over the top of it to help the camera deter-
mine the colors in your final image. We will talk more about how the sensor works with color in 
a later chapter when we discuss a principle called bit depth.
Full-frame (FX or 35 mm) 24×36 mm
APS-C (DX) 23.4×16.7 mm
APS-H 20.7×13.8 mm
Micro Four Thirds 18×13.5 mm
Nikon CX 13.2×8.8 mm
Point-and-Shoot 7.2×5.3 mm

CH O OSIN G A C A MER A SYSTEM
Pixel size is a strong determining factor in 
image clarity and lack of noise. As discussed 
previously, the larger the pixel, the better it can 
gather light. Sometimes more megapixels is not 
the best thing for your photography. If a camera 
manufacturer comes out with a new model that 
has even more megapixels yet they haven’t in-
creased the size of the imaging sensor, beware! 
When the pixel size is reduced to the size of a 
point-and-shoot camera’s pixels, image degrada-
tion can result.
Thankfully, camera manufacturers are usu-
ally balanced about this and don’t push the 
pixel sizes down too far. They know noise will 
result and people will be unhappy. One leading 
camera manufacturer just recently reduced the 
number of pixels in one of its cameras because 
people were complaining about noise.
Don’t be fooled by the hype in advertising. 
The number of pixels is an important factor in 
maximum image size, and the size of the pixels 
is an important factor in maximum image qual-
ity. Just be aware of the trade-off between the 
size and the number of pixels. More megapixels 
can sometimes make for a lower-quality image.
Choosing a Camera System
What exactly does camera system mean? Sim-
ply put, the manufacturer of the camera body 
(camera without a lens attached) makes a lot of 
stuff you can buy for the camera. It is a camera 
system when the camera body has a series of 
lenses and accessories that allow you to do al-
most any type of photography you choose.
Camera systems may consist of camera bod-
ies, several lenses, a global positioning system 
(GPS) unit, external flash units (for lighting), 
extended battery packs for extended shooting 
time, external microphones for recording better 
sound for your videos, wireless image transmit-
ters, and all sorts of other goodies to support the 
camera. Figure 1.7 shows two camera systems, 
one for a DSLR and one for an ILC. If your camera 
system doesn’t look like this, and you remain an 
enthusiast, it soon will.
You may be happy with just your camera and 
a lens or two to start out; however, if you are 
like most people your enthusiasm for lenses and 
accessories will almost seem like an addiction 
after a while. The desire for camera accessories 
never seems to end, and manufacturers keep 
making new and exciting things for us to buy. I 
guess that’s why they call us enthusiasts!
Seriously, though, if you plan to move beyond 
point-and-shoot photography, you’ll need to use 
a camera that allows you to grow. If your cho-
sen camera has only a few lenses available and 
you need a special lens that the manufacturer 
doesn’t make, you’ll have to change camera sys-
tems to get what you need. That would mean 
starting over and spending the megabucks it 
takes to build a camera system. If you haven’t

purchased your camera yet, please talk to expe-
rienced photographer friends and discuss the 
type of camera you’re considering. If you have 
already purchased a camera and lens, ask an 
experienced photographer if your camera has 
enough lenses and accessories available to allow 
you to grow. You will find that photographers 
are a friendly bunch and like to talk about their 
camera systems. You’ll have no problem finding 
camera forums that offer much advice—some 
good, some bad. Take your time!
If all else fails, contact me at the link found 
at www.PhotographyWriter.com and I’ll happily 
discuss it with you. I’ve been a photographer for 
a long time and even changed camera systems 
once. I learned about the expense of changing 
and wished I had started out with the correct 
system in the first place. Don’t make the mis-
take of buying from a camera manufacturer 
with a weak system. Take a little time at first to 
determine what is best for the type of photogra-
phy you plan to do.
When all else fails, stick with the top two 
camera system companies: Nikon and Canon. 
Each camera body they release will have a large 
selection of lenses and accessories. Those two 
companies are masters at making cameras that 
work within a complete, robust camera system. 
Do it right to begin with and you’ll have a clear 
path to explore your own photographic needs 
and style.
Buy One Camera Instead of Three!
What does that mean? You simply need to 
choose the right camera at the outset. Most 
of us considered only the camera’s initial cost 
when we bought our first camera, not the fea-
tures. Later, we traded in our first camera for 
one with more features. Only a little later did 
we determine that we needed the next camera 
above that one to accomplish our photography 
goals, so we sold that camera and moved up to 
a more expensive model. In all, most people end 
up buying at least three camera bodies in their 
quest to find the right one.
That can be time consuming and expensive, 
and it may limit you on the number of lenses 
you can afford to buy. In my opinion, lenses are 
more important than camera bodies! Choose 
the correct camera body in the beginning and 
you’ll save yourself a lot of money that you can 
spend on better lenses.
There are several levels of camera bodies in 
the DSLR world. The following is a rough list of 
how camera manufacturers create classes or 
levels of cameras (this may vary significantly 
among brands):
 
f Point-and-shoot level
 
f Consumer level
 
f Enthusiast level
 
f Semipro level
 
f Pro level
Levels are more pronounced for DSLRs than 
ILCs, although some ILCs are imitating DSLRs in 
that respect. The DSLR cameras along the back 
row of figure 1.8 are in the following level order 
from left to right: consumer, advanced, semipro, 
and pro. The front row of figure 1.8 shows a tiny 
point-and-shoot camera on the left, and on the 
right are two levels of ILC cameras: consumer 
(red) and advanced (black).
Most photographers started out on the point-
and-shoot level and after a while determined

that there was simply not enough quality there, 
so they moved up to a DSLR or ILC. If you are just 
now at that point and haven’t made a choice 
of camera level, or if you have already bought 
your first camera body and lens, please consider 
this section carefully. There is still time to make 
decisions.
Which Level Should I Choose?
The primary differences among the levels are 
determined by three things: imaging sensor 
size, number of camera features, and camera 
body robustness. Even the lower-end cameras 
have a huge number of features these days, but 
each progressive level adds special features that 
are more professional in nature.
If you start on the consumer level, you will 
definitely save money; however, you may find 
yourself wishing you had waited and bought a 
more powerful camera. It is hard to describe the 
different features the levels add since it varies 
among camera brands. You need to do some 
initial research and decide what you can afford 
to buy. If you simply choose according to price, 
though, you may quickly find yourself wishing 
you had waited for a better camera. Most of us 
do that! Buy the highest level camera you can 
possibly afford, and you’ll be able to use it much 
longer.
Somewhere around the enthusiast to semi-
pro level, the camera bodies stop being made 
entirely of polycarbonate (a fancy word for plas-
tic) and start using metals like magnesium alloy 
instead. A metal-bodied camera can take more 
abuse than a plastic camera. If you are going to 
be climbing mountains or hiking through rain 
forests, you may want the weather sealing of 
a more expensive camera. If you want to shoot 
action sports, you may want the very fast frame 
rate (how many pictures you can take in one 
second) of a higher-priced camera.
The bottom line is this: you can learn photog-
raphy with the lowest-cost DSLR or ILC camera. 
However, the low-end models will be missing 
features that you don’t even know you need 
until you suddenly need them. It may be better 
to buy a little higher in the camera hierarchy, if 
you can afford it. Otherwise, you will follow the 
same path as most of us and spend two or three 
times the money you really planned to spend 
just to get to where you needed to be in the first 
place. Cameras and lenses are expensive—sort 
of like collecting used Boeing 747 airplanes 
(hyperbole alert!). Therefore, don’t rush into a 
camera purchase, buying only by price consid-
erations. Get a camera with more features than 
you think you need now. Later, you’ll be able to 
spend money on more important things, such 
as better lenses and helpful accessories, instead 
of upgrading the camera body to the next level.
Another consideration is the size of the 
camera body. If you have very small hands, a 
larger camera may feel uncomfortable. If you 
are older or have little strength in your arms, a 
heavier camera may quickly wear you out when 
shooting. On the other hand, the larger cameras 
are usually bigger and heavier because they 
have metal bodies and weather sealing. The 
increased mass of a larger camera can help you 
make sharper pictures, too, because the extra 
weight cuts down on shutter-induced vibrations 
(camera shake) when you take a picture.
The best thing you can do is go to a camera 
store and handle the cameras, or find a friend 
with a camera like the one you want and take a 
few pictures with it. You could even rent a cam-
era from an online rental company for surpris-
ingly little money. Spending a little time investi-
gating or a few dollars on a rental may save you 
thousands of dollars over the years. Make the 
right choice and you won’t regret it later. Take 
your time and get it right in the first place!
Enthusiasts are enthusiastic when it comes 
to owning equipment. Although a person can 
take the lowest-level camera and make beauti-
ful images, it is a lot easier when the camera’s 
features allow you enough flexibility that you 

24
CH APTER 1
C A MER A  T YPES: M AKIN G  A CH OICE
aren’t eventually fighting the camera when tak-
ing pictures. Get a better (more expensive and 
fully featured) camera than you think you need, 
and you’ll probably learn faster and with less 
distraction. Remember, you are not a point-and-
shooter. You are an enthusiast!
Conclusions
Over the next several chapters we will discuss 
most of the things you initially need to know 
to become a more accomplished photographer. 
One thing I want you to realize up front is that 
during your photographic journey, camera bod-
ies will come and go, especially in the digital 
world. Camera bodies are like computers in 
that they become obsolete within a few years. 
You don’t absolutely have to buy a new camera 
when a new one comes out. I have a nine-year-
old DSLR camera body that works perfectly.
However, new cameras add more features 
and increase the quality of the image, so you are 
bound to upgrade eventually. Your photographic 
enthusiasm will insist, even if your partner or 
spouse doesn’t understand why. One of the rea-
sons photography is so expensive is that nearly 
every time you want a new accessory you will 
have to buy something new for your partner 
too. If you buy a new shoe-mounted GPS unit 
for your camera, your partner isn’t going to 
settle for a nice coffee mug!
I’ve found that showering your partner with 
extra affection for several weeks before a ma-
jor camera purchase works wonders. That and 
new stuff for the partner. Be careful, though; 
one time I bought a new lens for myself and a 
new vacuum cleaner for my wife. I never knew 
a female of the species had enough upper-body 
strength to swing a vacuum cleaner like a ball 
bat as she chased me from the house. Right after 
that is when I bought her a new camera. I fig-
ured it out!
Learn these lessons well because, if you are 
like most of us, photography can become a pas-
sionate endeavor that involves not only the 
pleasure of a beautiful image, but also the en-
joyment of owning quality camera equipment. 
Go for quality equipment and you’ll get back 
quality images.
Remember the camera levels we discussed 
in the previous section? Well, there are also 
lens levels. There are lenses made of plastic 
and decent glass that cost only a few bucks, 
and there are lenses made of metal and exotic 
glass that cost as much as a new compact car. In 
reality (remember this), lenses are much more 
important than the camera body. Camera bod-
ies will come and go, but lenses last for a very 
long time—if you buy good ones. I have lenses 
from the mid-1970s that work perfectly well on 
my newest DSLR cameras. I bought well-made 
lenses, and they have never worn out on me. 
I treat them like babies, of course, but the point 
is they can last a lifetime. This is why it is so 
important to choose wisely when selecting a 
camera brand. You want a manufacturer that 
has longevity and makes lenses that last. Lenses 
are the crown jewels in the photography world. 
Don’t skimp on them.
The next chapter, “Choosing and Using 
Lenses,” looks deeply into lenses and how they 
work. Although you may have the initial kit lens 
that came with your camera body, it will soon 
be time to consider other lenses. Most photogra-
phers have at least a basic three-lens kit, which 
we will discuss in the next chapter. The biggest 
benefit of using a DSLR or ILC are those wonder-
ful tubes of polycarbonate, metal, and glass. Let’s 
talk about lenses!

For a while after getting your first DSLR or ILC 
camera and a normal zoom lens, everything is 
great. You take hundreds of pictures and enjoy 
the enhanced quality the big imaging sensor 
gives you. You look through your pictures, post 
them on social networking sites, and e-mail 
them to friends and family. All is well!
Then something occurs to you. You are look-
ing at a picture you took of a bird sitting on a 
tree limb in your yard. Although it is sharp and 
shows the bird’s colors well, you realize that the 
bird is rather tiny in the image. If you try to get 
closer to another bird to take a picture, it flies 
away. Your lens cannot reach out and get a 
closeup of a bird in a tree. You need a long lens, 
one that can pull in distant subjects and make 
them bigger—you need a telephoto lens 
(figure 2.1). 
This sudden realization and need is both 
pleasure and pain in a photographer’s life. Get-
ting new lenses and having the ability to take 
specialized pictures is one of the greatest plea-
sures of being a photographer. Since lenses are 
rather expensive, it is also one of the pains of 
being a photographer. Convincing your partner 
you need another lens can help you become a 
very proficient negotiator. Fortunately, develop-
ing your negotiating skills will help you if you 
later decide to license some of your pictures to 
books and magazines.
This chapter will help you understand how 
lenses work, the types of lenses you can buy, 
and why you will need them. We will discuss 
zoom lenses versus prime lenses; wide-angle, 
normal, and telephoto lenses; macro and mirror 
lenses; and even filters to put on your lenses. We 
will also discuss autofocus and manual focus 
lenses; lenses with image stabilization; and how 
to build a basic three-lens kit. Finally, we will 
look into various lens concerns including a good 
understanding of bokeh, flare, light falloff, and 
distortion. There are many terms to wrap your 
head around when talking about lenses. We will 
examine what each term means, and you will 
end this chapter with a much better knowledge 
of lenses, how they work, and which types you 
might need.
First, let’s examine how a lens works.

How Does a Lens Work?
Have you ever used a magnifying glass to 
enlarge an object? You used a single lens ele-
ment to change the perspective of your subject. 
As you moved the magnifying glass closer or 
farther away, the subject got larger or smaller 
(figure 2.2).
A magnifying glass is a very basic lens, with 
only a single element. It works in conjunction 
with the lens of your eye to focus an image of 
the subject on the retina of your eyeball. In a 
sense, by using the magnifying glass with your 
eye, you formed a compound lens that has more 
than one element. In this case, the retina of your 
eye is like the imaging sensor of a camera. The 
magnifying glass and the lens in your eye are 
like a camera lens in that it focuses the subject 
on something that can capture an image. To 
change the size (magnification) of the image 
you have to move the magnifying glass closer to 
and farther away from your eye. A camera lens 
similarly focuses the image on the camera’s im-
aging sensor. The lens on your camera has a lot 
more elements inside it than the two elements 
in the magnifying glass and eye combo. Fig-
ure 2.3 is a drawing of a lens with nine elements 
(blue). The gray part of the graphic represents 
the housing of the lens that holds the elements 
in place. If you sawed a lens in half lengthwise, 
it would look something like the figure.
Instead of moving the whole camera forward 
and backward to focus on your subject, a zoom 
lens internally moves groups of elements for-
ward and backward to focus on the subject. 
If you are using autofocus, the camera does it 
automatically. If you are using manual focus, 
you will have to turn a focus ring.
If you want to pull your subject in close to 
you without walking closer to the subject, you 
can zoom your lens in (telephoto). The lens may 
get a little longer as parts of it extend outward. 
This way you can pull in subjects like a bird on 
a tree limb. When you want to take in a wider 
area of your subject, you can zoom out (wide 
angle). The lens may get physically shorter as 
you zoom it. In the wide-angle position, you can 
take in a group of people or a beautiful land-
scape. Lenses allow you to change the angle of 
view, or how much the lens can see at one time. 
This is called the focal length of the lens. We will

examine the concept of focal length in the next 
section.
Figure 2.4 is a picture of one of my Nikon 
lenses and its controls. Your lenses should have 
similar controls, although they may vary in 
position. 
Let’s look at each control on the lens:
1. Zoom ring: This is the most-used control on 
the lens. You will use it constantly to zoom 
in and out, and you can stop at any point. 
On the lens shown, the 18 mm setting is a 
wide-angle setting, which allows you to take 
group portraits or get sweeping landscape 
shots. The 105 mm setting is a short telephoto 
position. Use the telephoto setting to pull a 
subject closer and fill the image frame. You 
can use the zoom ring to select the exact fo-
cal length for the best angle of view you will 
need to make the best image composition. 
As you turn the zoom ring, you will see the 
numbers turn with it. The numbers on the 
lens in figure 2.4 are 18, 24, 35, 50, 70, and 105. 
Each represents a focal length in millime-
ters (mm). Place any number from 18 to 105 
next to the dot or dash on top of the lens to 
set a focal length position. In between the 
numbers are other focal lengths. Let’s say you 
turned the lens to halfway between 35 mm 
and 50 mm. That is about 42 mm. The focal 
length is constantly variable as you turn the 
zoom ring. We will discuss focal length, with 
examples, in the upcoming section called 
“Focal Length.” Most basic starter (kit) lenses 
have focal lengths ranging from 18 mm to 
55 mm.
2. Focus ring: The focus ring is not often used 
on a camera with autofocus, which is why it 
is usually somewhat narrow in comparison 
to the zoom ring. However, for macro pictures 
(extreme closeup shots) it is sometimes eas-
ier to turn off autofocus and manually focus 
the lens. Then you can control exactly where 
you want to place the sharpest point of 
focus. Make sure you understand the auto or 
manual focus (A/M) switch, next in this list, 
before you use the focus ring or you could 
damage some lenses. The zoom and focus 
rings are reversed in position on some lenses.
3. Auto or manual focus (A/M) switch: Many 
modern autofocus lenses have an A/M 
switch (or something similar) on the side of 
the lens. You can use it to temporarily turn 
off autofocus so you can manually focus the 
lens. M stands for manual focus, and A stands 
for automatic focus. Some lenses have a third 
position on the switch called something 
like M/A–A, which lets you manually fine-
tune the focus after autofocus has done its 
job. The way to tell if your lens allows focus 
fine-tuning is to carefully attempt to turn 
the focus ring after autofocus is finished. If 
you feel resistance, stop immediately! If you 
feel no resistance, your camera may allow 
you to touch up (fine-tune) its focus decision. 
You will need to read the lens documenta-
tion to see what the switch does. Some basic 
autofocus lenses do not have this switch and 
will not allow you to turn autofocus off. With 
those lenses, you can generally disable auto-
focus in the camera menus or with a switch 
on the camera body near the lens mount. Old 
or new lenses that can be focused only man-
ually do not have an A/M or MA–A switch.

locations will vary on different brands)

4. Image stabilization on/off switch: We will 
discuss image stabilization in the upcom-
ing section called “Lens versus Sensor Image 
Stabilization.” For now, just know that image 
stabilization allows the lens to counteract 
small vibrations when you handhold the 
camera and while you press the shutter-
release button. Image stabilization can lead 
to sharper pictures. Nikon calls their image-
stabilized lenses VR lenses. VR stands for vi-
bration reduction. Canon calls their stabilized 
lenses OIS lenses, which stands for Optical 
Image Stabilization. Such terms will vary 
greatly by manufacturer. There is a list of 
acronyms in the upcoming “Lens versus Sen-
sor Image Stabilization” section so you can 
identify whether or not your lens has image 
stabilization.
Some older and even new retro-styled lenses 
have an additional ring called the aperture ring 
(figure 2.5). This ring is now mostly obsolete and 
is not included on lenses for most new DSLR and 
ILC cameras. However, if you see an additional 
ring on the lens with numbers, such as 1.4, 2, 2.8, 
3.5, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, and 22, that is an old-style aper-
ture ring. We will discuss aperture later in this 
chapter and in a large section in the next 
chapter.
Additionally, some lenses have a window 
with figures or engravings that end in “∞“ (an 
infinity symbol, as shown in the lens windows 
of figures 2.5 and 2.6). These are focus distance 
scales that range from a few inches to infinity. 
They show approximately how far away your 
subject is in feet (ft) or millimeters (mm). Most 
photographers rarely use this scale. It is one of 
those items from many years ago when cam-
eras had a function called zone focusing. You 
had to guess the distance and set the lens on the 
approximate number to get a good focus. The 
cameras that used zone focusing did not let you 
look through the lens itself, but they often had a 
separate viewfinder.
Now, let’s examine how focal length works. 
We’ll examine how a camera uses various focal 
lengths to capture more or less of the subject 
in front of the lens, and we’ll look at examples 
from extreme wide angle to long telephoto.

HYPERFOCAL DISTANCE
Older lenses have a distance scale, like the one shown in figure 2.6, that allows you to use a tech-
nique called hyperfocal distance. This older technique allows a photographer to figure out how 
deep the depth of field (zone of sharp focus) is in an image. We will discuss depth of field in the 
next chapter. It is an important concept to all photographers who are serious about their work. 
The depth of field preview button has mostly replaced the hyperfocal distance technique. Don’t 
worry about learning the hyperfocal technique for now. It can be useful, especially for those 
who shoot landscapes, because it allows you to get everything from the foreground to the back-
ground in acceptably sharp focus. Hyperfocal distance is an advanced technique that is beyond 
the scope of this book, and it is not necessary to know it for daily shooting. Unfortunately, fewer 
and fewer lenses support distance scales these days, so hyperfocal distance focusing may be a 
dying technique. If you are interested in reading more about hyperfocal distance, read the article 
at the following website: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocal_distance.
Focal Length: Wide Angle, Normal, 
and Telephoto Settings
To discuss focal length you will first need to un-
derstand the difference between a wide-angle, 
normal, and telephoto lens. The angle of view 
classifies a lens as being wide-angle, normal, or 
telephoto. Angle of view simply describes how 
much of a scene a lens can see. The longer the 
focal length, the narrower the angle of view (the 
lens sees less of the scene horizontally and ver-
tically). The shorter the focal length, the wider 
the angle of view (the lens sees more of the 
scene horizontally and vertically). Let’s see some 
samples of how angle of view works.
Angle of View
The easiest way to determine whether a lens is 
wide angle, normal, or telephoto is to compare 
the size of the subject seen in the viewfinder to 
what the human eye sees. If you look through 
the viewfinder with both eyes open, and the eye 
looking through the viewfinder sees a subject 
that is smaller than what your other eye sees 
directly, the lens is probably a wide-angle lens. 
If both eyes see a subject of approximately the 
same size, the lens is probably a normal lens. If 
the viewfinder eye sees a subject larger than the 
subject seen by the other eye, the lens may be a 
telephoto lens.
If your camera has no viewfinder, but uses 
only a live view screen to see the subject, you 
will have to learn which focal length numbers 
are considered wide angle, normal, or telephoto 
for your camera by consulting the camera’s 
manual.
Let’s discuss each lens type and look at each 
angle of view in the following figures.

32
CH APTER 2
CH O OSIN G  A N D USIN G LENSES
Wide-angle lens: Wide-angle lenses allow you 
to capture more of a scene than other lens types. 
Wide-angle lenses have a short focal length. You 
will use a wide-angle lens (or wide zoom lens 
setting) to take a picture of a group of people or 
a sweeping landscape (figure 2.7). Any time you 
need to photograph a larger section of your sub-
ject, use a short focal length wide-angle lens. 
Normal lens: A normal lens creates a view that 
looks similar in size to what you see with your 
normal vision when you are the same distance 
from the subject as the lens. A normal lens (or 
medium zoom lens setting) is not especially 
wide, nor does it magnify the scene; it is in the 
middle. Normal lenses have a medium focal 
length.
Telephoto lens: A telephoto lens works like a 
magnifying glass. It magnifies the subject so 
small objects appear larger. A picture of a bird 
in a tree taken with a wide-angle or normal 
lens would be rather tiny and hard to see. How-
ever, if you use a telephoto lens (or a telephoto 
zoom lens setting), the bird will appear larger in 
the picture. Telephoto lenses have a long focal 
length. 
Angle of view is an important topic that we will 
investigate more in the next section. We will 
look at pictures all the way from a 10 mm focal 
length to a 400 mm focal length, and you will 
see how the angle of view changes according 
to the focal length of the lens. First, though, let’s 
talk a little more about focal length.

focal length). Horses in Cades Cove of Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park.

Focal Length Changes Angle of View
The simplest way to describe focal length is to 
say, in general terms, it is the length of the lens 
in millimeters (mm). Physically longer lenses of-
ten have longer focal lengths, and shorter lenses 
often have shorter focal lengths. Figure 2.10 
shows a short focal length lens (50 mm) and a 
long focal length lens (200 mm).
However, defining focal length in this way is a 
little misleading because today’s lenses, made 
with computer-assisted design techniques, 
can manipulate (bend) light in ways that older 
lenses simply could not. A telephoto lens from 
today is often significantly shorter and lighter 
than a telephoto lens from years ago.
Focal length does not really mean the actual 
physical length of the lens, although that is the 
way most photographers think about it. Tech-
nically speaking, focal length simply means 
the distance from the nodal point—often in 
the middle of the lens—to the imaging sensor 
surface (point of focus). If the distance from the 
nodal point to the imaging sensor is 50 mil-
limeters, you have a 50 mm lens; if the distance 
is 200 millimeters, the lens is a 200 mm lens 
(figure 2.10). But don’t worry about it! That is as 
technical as we need to get. You do not have to 
worry about nodal points and distances to im-
aging sensors. All you have to do is learn to rec-
ognize how a certain focal length lens (or zoom 
setting) performs on your camera. If you want to 
know more about nodal points, there are plenty 
of articles on the web. Here is an article that 
is useful, although it is quite technical: http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_point_(optics).
Examine figures 2.12 through 2.19. Each pic-
ture is from the indicated focal length setting on 
three of my zoom lenses mounted on a camera 
with an APS-C imaging sensor (see chapter 1 to 
review sensor sizes).
When you examine a zoom lens, you can see 
that the available focal lengths are indicated 
by numbers on the lens body (figure 2.11). Most 
zoom lenses included with a new camera body 
have a range of focal lengths, usually 18–55 mm.
I used a 10–20 mm zoom lens, a 16–85 mm 
zoom lens, and an 80–400 mm zoom lens to 
make the series of pictures in figures 2.12 to 2.19. 
Each of those zoom lenses has a nice range of 
focal lengths (and angles of view). Zoom lenses 
are very convenient compared to lenses with 
only one focal length (called a prime lens). We 
will discuss zoom lenses versus prime lenses in 
an upcoming section.

In the series of pictures, notice that the larger 
the focal length number (mm), the narrower the 
angle of view. Conversely, the smaller the focal 
length number, the wider the angle of view. A 
10 mm lens is a wide-angle lens, and a 400 mm 
lens is a telephoto lens. The angle of view for 
each focal length varies according to which 
camera you are using. Let’s see why!
Imaging Sensor Size Affects Angle of View
One important fact you must know about fo-
cal length is that the size of the imaging sensor 
affects the angle of view. For instance, a 35 mm 
focal length provides a normal angle of view 
on an APS-C sensor and a slightly wide angle of 
view on a full-frame imaging sensor (same size 
as a frame of 35mm film). You will have to read 
your camera manual to determine what is con-
sidered wide-angle, normal, and telephoto focal 
lengths for your camera. In general, the follow-
ing focal lengths and associated angles of view 
are accurate for most lenses:
 
f 6 to 12 mm is an extreme wide-angle lens
 
f 16 to 25 mm is a wide-angle lens
 
f 30 to 50 mm is a normal lens
 
f 60 to 150 mm is a short telephoto lens
 
f 200 to 1200 mm is a long telephoto lens
Notice that there are gaps in the list. That is 
because a particular focal length’s angle of view 
is hard to classify for different camera designs, 
and this list is generalized. Each imaging sensor 
size has a specific range of how it displays the 
angle of view at each focal length.
An easier way to remember this concept is as 
follows: the smaller the camera’s imaging sen-
sor, the narrower the angle of view (less wide 
angle). With a smaller Micro Four Thirds sensor, 
a 50 mm lens is soundly in the short telephoto 
range. On a larger full-frame sensor, a 50mm 
lens is a normal lens. The smaller the imag-
ing sensor, the harder it is to find an extreme 
wide-angle lens, but the easier it is to find a long 
telephoto lens.
Likewise, the smaller a camera’s sensor, the 
greater the telephoto effect (narrower angle 
of view, or greater magnification) will be at a 
particular focal length. A 200 mm lens is a long 
telephoto on a small Micro Four Thirds sensor, 
but it is a medium telephoto on a large full-
frame sensor. The larger the imaging sensor, the 
easier it is to find an extreme wide-angle lens, 
but the harder (and more expensive) it is to find 
a long telephoto lens.
Telephoto lenses are usually much more 
expensive than wide-angle lenses, so for those 
who like to shoot wildlife pictures there are 
some benefits to having a smaller sensor. To get 
a similar field of view, a camera with a smaller 
sensor can use a shorter focal length than a 
camera with a full-frame sensor. For instance, 
an APS-C sensor with a 400 mm lens has a simi-
lar angle of view as a full-frame sensor with 
a 600 mm lens. A 400 mm lens costs a lot less 
than a 600 mm lens!
You will have to determine what range of fo-
cal lengths work best and are available for your 
camera. That is why it is so important to buy 
a camera with a nice system of lenses and ac-
cessories, as we discussed in chapter 1. Camera 
manufacturers usually offer wide-angle, normal, 
and telephoto lenses for their camera bodies. 
It is your job to determine which lenses you 
will need and what angles of view you want to 
cover. Most photographers end up with at least 
four lenses: a basic kit of three zoom lenses—
like the three I used to take the sample focal 
length pictures—covering a wide range of focal 
lengths, and a macro lens for extreme closeups. 
We will discuss macro (closeup) lenses and a 
three-lens kit in later sections of this chapter.
The pictures from my camera’s APS-C sen-
sor in figures 2.12 to 2.19 will match your cam-
era only if your camera has an APS-C imaging 
sensor (which many do). If your camera has a 
smaller sensor, the wide-angle images shown

ASSIGNMENT: 
Take a series of pictures with your lenses at successive focal length settings (18 mm, 24 mm, 
35 mm, 50 mm, etc.). Start with the shortest focal length (wide-angle setting) and zoom in 
after each shot until you have reached your longest focal length (telephoto setting). Choose a 
subject that will work with wide-angle to telephoto focal lengths (e.g., a cityscape or scenes in a 
park or at a lake), and photograph the same subject in each picture. Look at each image on your 
computer and see how the perspective changes with each focal length. See how much more of 
the image a wide-angle lens captures and how the angle of view narrows as the focal length 
increases with each successive picture. Use a tripod for the best results!
will not be quite as wide, and the telephoto 
images will pull in even closer. On the other 
hand, if your camera has a full-frame sensor, the 
wide-angle focal lengths will capture even more 
of the image (a wider angle of view), but the 
telephoto images will not be as close (less mag-
nification, since the angle of view is somewhat 
wider).
In Summary: Focal length and angle of view 
work together to let you capture different views 
of your subject. You can use wide angle for a big 
sweeping view, or you can zoom in to telephoto 
for a narrow, up-close view. The size of the 
imaging sensor in your camera modifies what 
the angle of view for each focal length looks 
like compared to cameras with different sized 
sensors. The best way you can learn about focal 
lengths and angles of view for your camera is 
by experimenting. The assignment above will 
encourage you to experiment with your current 
lens or lenses and see what range you can cap-
ture. Try it and you will learn a lot!
Using Wide-Angle Lenses
Let’s discuss some gotchas when using wide-
angle lenses. If you want to keep your friends 
and family happy, under no circumstances 
should you take an up-close portrait of anyone 
with a wide-angle lens. Look at the pictures of 
my daughter taken with a 10 mm lens up close 
Figure 2.20: A portrait taken with a 10 mm wide-
angle lens (up close) compared to a lens set to 85 mm

in figure 2.20 and the same approximate angle 
of view with an 85 mm lens. Which do you think 
looks better (and I don’t mean funnier)?
It can be great fun to use extreme wide-angle 
lenses because of the way they tend to distort 
the perspective of an image. In fact, wide-angle 
lenses are known for a concept called perspec-
tive distortion. They can bend straight lines and 
distort images in a strange way. Look at the im-
ages in figure 2.21.
Another problem that can be caused by 
shooting scenes with a wide-angle lens is called 
the falling-over effect. When you tilt a camera up 
with a wide-angle lens, the bottom of the lens is 
closer to the subject than the top of the lens, so 
the bottom of the subject is magnified and the 
top recedes. In addition, the edges tend to bend 
inward or outward. It is much harder to keep 
lines straight when using a wide angle lens. Do 
your best to keep the lens square with the sub-
ject to avoid perspective distortion.
Figure 2.22: Is this person’s hand really that big?
As shown in figure 2.22, objects that are closer 
to the lens will look much larger than objects 
that are farther away, especially on superwide 
lenses (6 to 12 mm). Wide-angle lenses are excel-
lent for capturing things that narrower-angle 
lenses cannot even see, so compose your images 
carefully.
Choosing a Focal Length for Portraits
To successfully create a portrait that does not 
distort the face of your subject, it is important 
to understand that a longer than normal fo-
cal length should be used. Even a normal focal 
length, such as 35–50 mm, may have too much 
wide-angle effect to use up close.
Figure 2.23: Similar portraits taken at 35 mm and 
85 mm
Look at the two shots I took with my zoom lens 
set at 35 mm and 85 mm. Even though I used a 
similar view for both focal lengths, you can see 
that the 35 mm view emphasizes the nose of the 
subject in an unflattering way because her nose 
is closer to the lens than the rest of her face.
For a big group shot, a wide-angle lens is 
great, as long as you do not get too close to the 
group. If you get too close, the people in front 
will look like giants, and those in back will look 
pint-sized.

Compression of Perspective with 
Telephoto Lenses
Shooting with a telephoto lens lets you pull 
distant subjects in close. If you do not yet have 
a telephoto lens, you will have to use the good 
old-fashioned sneaker zoom, where you run 
closer to the subject (in your sneakers) to make 
it larger in your picture. A telephoto lens is a 
great addition to your lens arsenal and is one 
of the choices in the proverbial three-lens kit 
we will discuss shortly. Most photographers 
have a kit lens with a reasonably wide angle 
of view. Therefore, the first lens most people 
want to buy is a telephoto to pull in distant sub-
jects. A telephoto zoom lens with a maximum 
focal length of 200 mm or 300 mm is a great 
investment and is not too costly. We will talk 
more about how to choose one in an upcoming 
section. 
For now, let’s discuss an interesting thing 
that a telephoto lens does called perspective 
compression (figure 2.24). Whenever you shoot 
a picture that has several objects in front of and 
behind your subject, and you use a telephoto 
lens, the distance between each object seems 
much smaller than if you looked at the same 
scene with your eyes. The telephoto lens seems 
to pull everything closer together. This is per-
spective compression. You can use this look cre-
atively when you have a subject that works well 
with the effect.
To really see perspective compression, you 
will need to use a lens of at least 200 mm. For-
tunately, a 55–200 mm telephoto is a reason-
ably priced lens (if any lens can be considered 
reasonably priced). I’m sure that if you don’t 
already have one, you will soon!
Lens Aperture
The aperture of a lens is an adjustable opening 
or hole controlled by blades in your lens. The 
aperture determines how much light gets into 
the camera, giving you the ability to control the 
exposure (light level) of the pictures you take. 
Figure 2.25 shows the front end of a lens with its 
aperture blades partially closed, forming a hole 
that light can pass through into the camera.
In the next chapter, “Understanding Exposure 
Controls,” we will closely examine how aperture 
works, with lots of examples of what it does. We 
will discuss how the aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO sensitivity controls work together in 
your camera to let you manage exactly how 
your pictures will look.
The most important thing to remember 
about lens aperture, for now, is that it controls 
how much light comes into the lens. Just as 
the diameter of a water hose controls how 
much water can flow through it (a garden hose 
Figure 2.24: Perspective compression with a telephoto lens

that controls how much light comes into the camera

ZO O M LENSES VERSUS PRIME LENSES
passes less water than a firefighter’s hose), the 
diameter of the aperture controls how much 
light flows into the camera. A camera’s ad-
justable aperture size is labeled by a series of 
f-numbers that look like this: f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, 
f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22. Each f-number describes 
the diameter of the hole formed by the aperture 
blades, in relation to the focal length of the lens. 
Other than remembering what an aperture 
number looks like, don’t worry about this for 
now; we will discuss this principle in exquisite 
detail in the next chapter. The aperture is part 
of a triad of controls that allow you to manage 
how much, and how long, light hits your cam-
era’s imaging sensor.
 
■
FAST VS. SLOW LENSES
As you read photography books and Internet forum comments, you will read about lens speed. 
What is a fast lens, as compared to a slow lens? A fast lens allows a lot of light into the camera 
when needed. A fast lens has a larger maximum aperture (bigger opening) than a slow lens. The 
hole the aperture blades form in a fast lens can be larger than in a slow lens. Most fast lenses 
have maximum apertures in the f/1.0 to f/2.8 range. There is an interesting article on lens speed 
at this website: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_speed.
The cost of a fast lens is considerably higher than a slow lens because fast lenses require 
much bigger lens elements. The diameter of a lens element must be sizable to let in a lot of light 
when needed. These larger elements require special designs to prevent various aberrations from 
showing up. You will hear words like aspherical and low-dispersion elements bandied about in 
conversations about fast lenses. Those words simply mean that fast lenses must be highly cor-
rected so they remain sharp and contrasty. Most low-cost kit lenses are medium-speed lenses 
with apertures in the f/3.5–5.6 range. Check your lens to see what speed it is.
Zoom Lenses versus Prime Lenses
A prime lens is like the biggest jewel in the king’s 
crown. It is an object of desire for many photog-
raphers. You will hear photographers talk about 
prime lenses in hushed, respectful tones and 
with reverence in their voices. OK, maybe I am 
overdoing it a little, but prime lenses are really 
cool. What is a prime lens?
Well, you know how your kit lens can zoom 
in and out, going wide angle one minute and 
telephoto the next? A prime lens cannot do 
that. It is a lens that does not have a range of 
focal lengths built in. Instead, a prime lens has 
only one focal length, such as 35 mm, 50 mm, or 
85 mm. That does not sound very convenient, 
and it really isn’t. Prime lenses are not for conve-
nience. That is why zoom lenses were invented!
A zoom lens allows you to select from a range 
of focal lengths and angles of view so you do 
not have to use sneaker zoom very often. In-
stead of walking to get closer to or farther away 
from your subject, a zoom lens lets you simply 
zoom in and out. A prime lens, on the other 
hand, has a single focal length, so you will have 
to use sneaker zoom to create the best image 
composition (where the subject appears in the 
picture). Why would anyone consider using a 
prime lens when it requires more work than a 
zoom lens? One word: quality!
In figure 2.26 you can see an arrow that 
points to the 50 mm setting on the zoom lens. 
You can also see how the zoom lens on the right 
has a range of focal lengths from 16 mm to 
85 mm. The prime lens on the left has only one 
focal length, 50 mm.

40
CH APTER 2
CH O OSIN G  A N D USIN G LENSES
Since a prime lens has only one focal length, 
it can be optimized for that particular angle 
of view. The lens elements can be carefully 
designed to control light in a very precise way. 
Instead of the compromise of having multiple 
focal lengths in one lens and the resulting lower 
image quality at certain zoom settings, a prime 
lens can give you absolutely the best images 
your camera can make.
Prime lenses are usually faster (they have a 
bigger aperture) than zooms, which means you 
can shoot with them in lower ambient light 
levels, such as in dark shade, in an interior room, 
or at night. Additionally, prime lenses are usu-
ally designed to be smaller and lighter.
If you want to experiment with the higher 
quality a prime lens can provide, you could 
buy a new or used 50 mm f/1.8 lens. The cost 
is usually low for that particular lens, yet it is 
fast. When you read the next chapter and learn 
about controlling exposure, you will learn about 
depth of field, which is simply how much of the 
subject and its surroundings are in focus (the 
zone of sharp focus). Since the aperture of a lens 
controls depth of field, and a prime lens has a 
large maximum aperture, it will often give you 
greater choices for where you place the sharp 
focus in your picture.
I am not suggesting that you abandon your 
zoom lenses for general photography. However, 
you should acquire a prime lens or two in the 
next few months so you can see the best im-
ages your camera can make. With a prime lens, 
you can experiment with shallow depth of field, 
shooting in low light, and maximizing quality. 
Try one; you’ll be hooked like the rest of us!
Macro Lenses and Closeup Filters
Sometimes you want to get very close to your 
subject. Maybe you found a flower you like, or 
a bee taking pollen. Maybe you need to photo-
graph some coins or stamps from your collec-
tion for insurance purposes. Any time you need 
to take a picture up close, you need a macro lens. 
A macro lens is especially designed for closeup 
pictures. Most genuine macro lenses are also 
prime lenses. On the surface, they don’t look 
much different than a regular prime lens, but 
the internal lens elements are designed to make 
life-size images.
True Macro Lenses
A true macro lens (figure 2.27) has a 1 : 1 magni-
fication ratio, which means it can take a picture 
of an object and render it in its actual size. A bee 
on a flower is the same size in the picture as 
in real life. Such a photo is hard to take with a 
zoom lens or a regular prime lens because those 
lenses will not focus close enough. Some zoom 
lenses are advertised as macro zoom lenses. 
They can focus closer than most zoom lenses, 
but they are not true macro lenses. Most macro 
zooms are limited to about half-life size, or a 1 : 2 
magnification ratio, which means a bee on a 
flower would be only half its actual size in the 
picture. You just cannot get close enough with 
most zoom or regular prime lenses. For maxi-
mum closeups, only a true macro lens will do.

(Nikon calls their macro lenses “MICRO” 
which makes them sound different and special)
Figure 2.28: A picture from a 60 mm f/2.8 macro 
lens
Real macro lenses are more expensive than 
standard prime lenses because they are spe-
cialty prime lenses. They have special features 
to make pictures look their best, such as a flat-
field design, which keeps the edges of the pic-
ture from curving in a distracting way. Macro 
lenses are highly corrected lenses, which means 
the lens elements are carefully designed to give 
maximum quality and minimum aberrations. 
They are optimized for closeup work. That does 
not mean you shouldn’t use a macro lens to 
take a picture of a more distant object; they 
do fine there, too. They are simply made to do 
their best work at a 1:1 magnification ratio for 
extreme closeups.
For maximum image quality, it is a good idea 
to use a real macro lens. However, there are sub-
stitutes that cost a lot less money. Let’s consider 
one low-cost way to get extreme closeup images 
without the expense of a macro lens.
Figure 2.30: The same picture taken with a prime 
lens and a diopter filter (compared to figure 2.28)
Screw-On Closeup Filters
The lowest-cost way to take closeup pictures 
is to use a closeup diopter filter on your lens. 
These filters cost only a few bucks online and 
do a reasonably good job of making extreme 
closeups. I bought a package of four filters with 
diopters (magnification factors) from +1 to +10 
(figure 2.29). 
A diopter filter simply screws onto the front 
of your prime lens (or zoom lens) and adds 
magnification to the lens. It is sort of the same 
principle as using a magnifying glass. There are 
various diopter powers in the filter set so you 
can increase or decrease the magnification. The 
main limitation of diopter closeup filters is a 
very limited amount of focus control and some-
what lower-quality images. They are not as con-
venient to use by any means, in comparison to a 
true macro lens. However, they do a pretty good 
Figure 2.29: A set of macro diopter filters for closeups on a budget

CH O OSIN G  A N D USIN G LENSES
job of taking extreme closeup pictures and are 
much lower in cost.
With a diopter filter on your lens, it cannot 
focus sharply on anything farther away than a 
few inches; therefore, the filter cannot be left 
on a lens for any purpose other than shoot-
ing the closeup. Although diopter filters can’t 
possibly give you the same quality from edge 
to edge as a true macro lens, they do provide 
photographers on a budget with a way to make 
interesting closeup pictures without spending a 
lot of money.
Note: There are threads on the front of most 
lenses for attaching filters, and the filters you 
buy must be the same size as the threads. Check 
the back of the lens cap for each lens; it usually 
lists the filter size for that lens (e.g., 52 mm, see 
figure 2.45). We’ll discuss this further in an up-
coming section called, “Match the Filter Size to 
Your Lens.”
 
■
EXTENSION TUBE AND LENS BELLOWS
You can get by without a true macro lens by using either an extension tube or a lens bellows. 
I’m not going into any detail about these two options in this book because they require know-
ing some advanced techniques, such as stop-down metering (no automatic lens aperture) and 
shooting without your camera’s light meter being active. However, remember that these two 
alternatives exist and check them out when you feel ready (do a Google search on the terms for 
information). If you are serious about excellent photography and can afford it, get a true macro 
lens. It is a lot less hassle to use and gives you much better quality.
Autofocus vs. Manual Focus Lenses
Why in the world would anyone consider a 
manual focus lens in today’s autofocus world? 
Good question! It is a bit like the question of 
why someone would choose to use prime lenses 
when zoom lenses are more convenient.
The reason many photographers use manual 
focus lenses at least some of the time is, again, 
maximum quality. Some focusing situations 
require very careful focus control, and the pho-
tographer may disable autofocus with a switch 
on the lens or the camera body, or from camera 
menu selections. Doing closeup or macro pho-
tography often works better with manual focus. 
The zone of sharp focus (depth of field) is so 
shallow in macro shooting that it is often bet-
ter to focus the lens manually. We will discuss 
depth of field thoroughly in chapter 4, under 
the sub-heading called “Understanding Depth 
of Field.”
Additionally, there are certain lenses that do 
not have autofocus capability. I have a series of 
older prime lenses from the mid-1970s that I ab-
solutely adore. They are not autofocus because 
they were made before that capability became 
a mainstream feature. However, the lenses are 
of such high quality construction that I cannot 
quit using them.
Some lens manufacturers—such as the 
German brand Zeiss—make extremely high-
quality lenses for various camera brands. Many 
of these lenses have all-metal construction, are 
very precisely made, and have premium glass 
elements. They do not offer autofocus because 
the looser tolerances required for the operation 
of autofocus lenses can reduce lens accuracy. 
Photographers who are fanatical about their im-
age quality often sacrifice convenience for the 
absolute best image possible. Money is no object 
for many who acquire these lenses. They can be 
very expensive!

BA SIC  T H REE-LENS KIT
As you progress in your photographic jour-
ney, you will be exposed to all the different 
things that make photographers happy. It can 
become an obsession. If you are satisfied (for 
now) with your current lenses, that is fine. How-
ever, just be aware that there are options, albeit 
expensive ones, for you to consider later. Lenses 
are a photographer’s tools, just like brushes are 
a painter’s tools. There are different brushes for 
different purposes and different lenses for dif-
ferent objectives. Photography has lots of room 
for creativity and personal expression.
Basic Three-Lens Kit
Did you ever wonder why enthusiast photog-
raphers carry around camera bags when most 
people carry just their cameras? It’s because 
they have several lenses! It is unthinkable for an 
enthusiast to find him- or herself in a situation 
and not have a lens to cover it.
Most photographers end up with a three-lens 
kit for daily use. Why three lenses and not just 
one of the new superzoom lenses that covers 
the entire spectrum of focal lengths? Primar-
ily, enthusiasts are interested in above-average 
quality for their images. There are times when 
convenience overrides quality, but not often!
Several lens manufacturers provide one-lens-
does-it-all solutions. The lenses are very conve-
nient and might even be a good choice if you are 
forced to use just one lens and camera body for 
a wide range of photography purposes, such as 
on vacation or on a hike where a lot of walking 
is required.
For instance, several camera manufacturers 
offer 18–200 mm f/3.5–5.6 zoom lenses. Some 
aftermarket lens manufacturers offer even 
wider coverage in one lens. However, no single 
lens can offer high quality at all focal lengths. 
There are compromises that must be made 
when too many focal lengths are crammed 
into one lens design. In fact, you will not find 
any truly professional lenses that have a wide 
range of focal lengths. Pro lenses are made for 
demanding photographers who will not put 
up with softness or aberrations at one or more 
zoom settings.
Although most enthusiasts are not profes-
sionals (yet), they seek higher quality and end 
up with three lenses that cover a very wide 
range of focal lengths. Figure 2.31 shows a typi-
cal enthusiast’s three-lens kit. The focal lengths 
range from extremely wide angle (10 mm) to 
long telephoto (400 mm), with a small amount 
of focal-length overlap between lenses. With 
this type of kit, a photographer is ready for al-
most any type of shooting situation, and since 
there are not too many focal lengths crammed 
into one lens, the quality of the image is 
maintained.

The three-lens kit shown in figure 2.23 can be 
carried in a medium-sized camera bag. It does 
not weigh too much and can easily be carried to 
any location. Many photographers use a small 
backpack-type camera bag, and others use an 
over-the-shoulder bag.
The reason you purchase a camera brand 
with a system concept is to have a variety of 
lenses and accessories to carry with you, such 
as extra batteries, memory cards, an external 
flash, and even a small GPS unit. If you are like 
most of us, you will be constantly seeking the 
ultimate camera bag to contain your camera 
system. If you find it, please let me know!
Lens vs. Sensor Image Stabilization
Image stabilization is when the lens or camera 
body tries to adjust for small movements when 
you are handholding your camera. No one can 
truly hold a camera still because of breathing, 
natural hand shakiness, environmental vibra-
tions, and shutter-release vibrations. Image 
stabilization helps you capture sharper images 
when you are shooting without a tripod. Al-
though a tripod is preferable for maximum im-
age sharpness, a stabilized lens or camera body 
can help a lot. Sometimes it is not convenient 
or possible to use a tripod, yet you still must get 
the shot. Since most new lenses or camera bod-
ies offer stabilization, why not take advantage 
of it?
What is the difference between image stabi-
lization built into a lens and the type built into 
a camera body? Lens stabilization allows a lens 
element to move within the lens to counteract 
small vibrations. Camera body stabilization 
either physically moves the imaging sensor or 
uses software to compensate for vibrations. Im-
age stabilization can allow you to have sharper 
images, especially when the picture is taken 
with a slower shutter speed (shutter speed is 
discussed in the next chapter). Figure 2.33 shows 
the difference between images taken with and 
without stabilization.
Refer to your camera manual to see whether 
your camera uses lens or sensor image stabiliza-
tion. The following list of acronyms will help 
you determine if your lens or camera body is 
stabilized. If you see these acronyms on your 
lens or camera body (or in the documentation), 
it may well have image stabilization built in:

In any case, you should learn to hold your cam-

must stand with your legs a few inches apart, 
one foot in front of the other, and keep your el-
bows pressed into your chest as you squeeze the 
shutter-release button carefully.
Autofocus Motor Types
Most new lenses have a type of autofocus motor 
that uses ultrasonic sound waves to move the 
lens elements and focus the lens. The following 
acronyms are used by various manufacturers 
to indicate their newest type of autofocus; if 
your lens brand is not listed, check your lens 
documentation:
 
f Canon: USM (Ultra Sonic Motor)
 
f Nikon: SWM (Silent Wave Motor, also known 
as AF-S)
 
f Olympus: SWD (Supersonic Wave Drive)

f Pentax: SDM (Silent Drive Motor)
 
f Tamron: USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive)
 
f Sigma: HSM (Hyper-Sonic Motor)
 
f Sony: SSM (Super Sonic Wave Motor)
Older lenses may not have the almost-silent 
ultrasonic focusing system, so you will hear a 
whine as the lens focuses. Ultrasonic focus is 
fast and relatively silent. Buying lenses with 
that type of focusing is better, not only because 
of speed and accuracy, but also because of the 
reduced noise during autofocus. If you are 
shooting pictures where you must be quiet, 
such as at a wedding or while hiding from wild-
life, you certainly want the quietest lenses you 
can own. Use ultrasonic when possible!
Lens Concerns
All lenses have imperfections in how they trans-
mit light. Correcting for one problem in lens 
design often creates a different problem. Lens 
reviews in magazines and on the Internet often 
use all sorts of charts and graphs to illustrate 
good and bad lenses. Often those charts and 
graphs mean little to people who use the lenses, 
but they do look official and make a review 
seem more important.

holding technique for maximum sharpness

CH O OSIN G  A N D USIN G LENSES
You and I, though, are probably more inter-
ested in how a lens performs in real life. As you 
will find, that is the best way to rate a lens. I am 
not overly impressed with a lot of charts and 
graphs, but I do like to see plenty of pictures 
from a lens I am interested in purchasing. I re-
member a particular lens that I wanted some 
time ago. I read some reports on the Internet. 
They had charts and graphs and said the lens 
does not perform well on shooting line-resolu-
tion charts mounted on a wall. Since I am not in 
the habit of shooting line charts against walls—
and I read good real-life reviews from bloggers 
and on forums—I bought the lens anyway, and 
it is now one of my favorite lenses.
Do not be overly influenced with what some 
reviewers have to say about a lens. Often they 
are simply trying to outdo other reviewers and 
get more traffic to their websites. One way to 
get a lot of website traffic is to talk negatively. I 
don’t know why people are attracted to negative 
talk, but it seems to be true. If you are interested 
in a lens, you will learn a lot more from people 
who are actually using the lens in real life. Talk 
to people on forums and read reviews that 
have plenty of pictures taken with the lens. You 
could even rent a lens for a week from a rental 
agency and try it before you buy it. Surprisingly, 
it doesn’t cost much to rent lenses.
Today’s lenses, made with computer-aided 
design, are some of the best lenses in the his-
tory of photography. Digital cameras are rather 
unforgiving of lens imperfections; therefore, a 
truly poor lens will earn a terrible reputation 
rather quickly. There are not that many bad 
lenses. Some are better than others, but today’s 
low-cost lenses are often better than premium 
lenses of yesteryear—due to improved design 
and lens coatings that reduce light problems. 
Buy lenses from major manufacturers and you 
should do well. Even low-cost lenses from major 
lens companies make wonderful images.
If you regularly shoot JPEG images, the lens 
concerns we will discuss next can be more of an 
issue for you than if you shoot RAW images be-
cause it means you will have to adjust your JPEG 
images, which can reduce their quality because 
of extra compression (JPEG images throw away 
data every time they are modified and saved). 
We will discuss RAW versus JPEG images in 
chapter 6, “Understanding Image Formats.”
Let’s discuss some lens issues that you will 
need to know about when you consider a new 
lens.
Flare
Lens flare is sort of like the glare you see on your 
car windshield when it is hit directly by the 
sun. It lowers the contrast of what you can see 
clearly. When strong light hits the front element 
of your camera lens, it can cause reflections 
inside the lens that can lower the contrast and 
quality of the picture. Reflections between lens 
elements, reflections from internal parts of the 
lens, and even reflections from the front of the 
image sensor can cause flare.
Most new lenses come with a twist-on lens 
hood. Use it when shooting in direct sunlight! 
When possible, keep direct sunlight off the front 
of your lens. Many professional photographers 
wear a nice floppy hat so they can use it to 
shield the front of the lens from flare. They di-
rect the shadow of the hat onto the front of the 
lens while taking the picture, and of course they 
keep the hat itself out of the picture. This only 
works well when shooting from a tripod, so use 
your tripod when shooting in very bright light. 
You can also reduce lens flare by using different 
shooting angles that minimize the flaring effect.
Figure 2.35 shows an example of lens flare. 
The two red spots are reflections of the bright 
sun from a lens element, and the shape of 
the flare spots are influenced by the aperture 
opening.
Some lenses have a greater tendency to 
cause lens flare. In your pictures it can look like 
a lower-contrast area (such as the foggy look 

47
LENS CO N CERNS
in figure 2.36) or even little blobs or circles of 
rainbow-colored light in various places in the 
image. Even the highest-quality lens designs 
(expensive lenses) can suffer lens flare prob-
lems. The best way to find out if the lens has 
problems with flare is to look for pictures taken 
with that lens in which the sun is directly in the 
frame. Most good hands-on reviews will discuss 
lens flare.
Higher-quality lenses have special coatings 
that reduce lens flare. However, my experience 
with lens flare is that some lenses seem to be 
more prone to flare than others, regardless of 
cost. You will learn which of your lenses are 
more prone to flare than others as you gain ex-
perience with your camera system.
Light Falloff
Light falloff, or optical vignetting, is a problem 
with nearly all lenses. It is worse in some lenses 
than in others. Fortunately, light falloff can be 
corrected with computer software rather easily, 
so it is not usually of great concern.
When a lens is used with its largest aperture 
(largest hole), light has to travel a little farther 
from the edges of the lens than from the middle 
of the lens to reach the rear lens elements. This 
can cause the rear lens elements to be shaded 
by the front lens elements, so the light is less 
bright at the corners of the picture (figure 2.37). 
We will discuss aperture settings in detail in the 
next chapter.
Most lenses do not have light falloff when 
the aperture is set to a smaller opening. Since 
it is relatively easy to correct for light falloff 
in your computer, usually with the included 
camera software, it is not of great concern to 
most photographers. I certainly would buy an 
otherwise high-quality lens that has minor light 
falloff at wide-open apertures.
The imaging sensor size affects light falloff. 
On cameras with full-frame sensors, light falloff 
can be worse than with smaller imaging

sensors. Incoming light hits the edges of the 
larger sensor’s pixels at an angle, dimming the 
light slightly. Again, though, it is not a serious 
problem because it is easily corrected after the 
fact.
Distortion
There are several types of distortion that can af-
fect lenses and pictures. The most important of 
these are the following:
 
f Softness at the edges of the image
 
f Color fringing on the edges, also called chro-
matic aberration
 
f Barrel and pincushion distortion
Let’s discuss each of these issues so you can 
check your current lenses and analyze reviews 
for future lens purchases.
Softness at the Edges of the Image
Edge softness is usually seen only when a lens is 
used at its wide-open aperture. The image ap-
pears a little less sharp at the edges than at the 
center of the picture (figure 2.38). This sort of dis-
tortion is present in nearly all lenses, to some 
degree. Lenses that are more expensive have 
corrections in place for edge softness, so you 
won’t see it as clearly. Some very expensive 
lenses are designed to perform well at wide-
open apertures; therefore, this issue can often be 
corrected by spending more money. When you 
read lens reviews, look for information on edge 
softness in wide-open shooting.
All lenses have a sweet spot where they pro-
vide the maximum sharpness they can deliver. 
The sweet spot is usually at a middle aperture 
setting (around f/5.6 to f/8). We will discuss 
aperture settings in detail in the next chapter. 
For now, though, just be aware that if you shoot 
often in low light and must use a large aperture 
to let in a lot of light, your images may be less 
sharp, especially at the edges.
You can use sharpening in-camera and later 
in your computer to help overcome this effect, 
but it is not as acceptable as getting a sharp 
image in the first place. To prevent less-sharp 
images you will need to use smaller apertures 
or invest in lenses that are designed to shoot at 
wide-open apertures.
Color Fringing or Chromatic Aberration
You’ve seen how a prism can break up a beam of 
sunlight into different wavelengths and create 
a rainbow. When you take a picture with hard 
edges, where the light transitions from bright to 
dark, your lens may exhibit chromatic aberration 
or color fringing, where the light-to-dark contrast 
occurs. For instance, if you are shooting backlit 
tree limbs, it is common to see some fringed out-
lines, usually reddish-purple or cyan, especially 
in the corners of the image. Less commonly, 
there could even be blue and yellow fringing.
Color fringing is caused by the lens refracting 
(bending) different wavelengths of light at dif-
ferent angles and failing to focus all the wave-
lengths in the same place. This is a lens problem 
called dispersion. Using low-dispersion lenses 
can remedy color fringing to a large degree, but 
there could still be color fringing at some wide-
open apertures.
Figure 2.38: Example of edge softness

49
LENS CO N CERNS
Figure 2.39 shows a classic example of chro-
matic aberration. While this is an extreme en-
largement, it clearly shows cyan and purple 
fringing at the points of the blue arrows, with 
cyan on the left and purple on the right edges of 
the tower. This problem is sometimes not easily 
noticed by inexperienced photographers. The 
best way to see if your lens has the problem is to 
shoot backlit bare tree branches and then en-
large the image to 100 percent on your com-
puter. Check the edges of the tree limbs and see 
if you detect cyan or purple (or blue/yellow) 
fringing. Chromatic aberration usually shows up 
where bright and dark areas meet in your pic-
tures. Learn to see it!
This problem can be hard to correct and may 
not be completely removable from some im-
ages. Newer cameras often try to correct this 
problem automatically. Manufacturers know 
which lenses have chromatic aberration and in-
clude software in the camera to correct it.
Lens reviews usually consider color fringing 
carefully, and you should pay close attention. 
Color fringing lowers the overall sharpness of 
the image and distorts the color of dark-to-light 
edges in an ugly way. Low-cost lenses without 
aspherical, low dispersion, or apochromatic ele-
ments will suffer more with this problem. If you 
buy lenses with these special elements, your im-
ages won’t suffer as badly from this problem.
Of all the distortion issues, this is one of the 
most important to consider because it is so dif-
ficult to correct. Buy lenses with as little chro-
matic aberration as possible, and your images 
will be much better.
Barrel and Pincushion Distortion
Imagine the way a barrel bulges outward in the 
middle, with a narrower top and bottom. When 
your lens exhibits barrel distortion, your sub-
jects can bulge in the middle. Pincushion distor-
tion is the opposite; the top and bottom are 
wider and the middle bows inward. You won’t 
see these effects in a terribly pronounced way in 
most cases, unless the lens is cheap and uncor-
rected.
Zoom lenses generally have these two types 
of distortion in varying degrees and at different 
zoom settings. Most new lenses are well cor-
rected and have very low distortion, so it is not 
a big issue. Some lenses have a small amount of 
barrel distortion at wide-angle settings and pin-
cushion distortion at telephoto settings.

For most photographers who shoot nature, 
portraits, sports, friends, and family, these aren’t 
overly important problems. However, for a pho-
tographer who shoots architectural images, or 
if there are many straight lines in an image, this 
can be an important issue.
Wide-angle zoom settings tend to have 
more issues than telephoto zoom settings. If 
you get close to flat or straight objects with a 
wide-angle lens you may notice that the image 
tends to bulge toward you in a weird way. On 
the other hand, you may experience the oppo-
site effect with longer telephoto lens settings. 
Figure 2.40 clearly shows emphasized versions 
of barrel and pincushion distortion. If you take a 
picture and it looks like this, get rid of that lens 
(unless it is a super wide-angle or “fish-eye” lens, 
which can exhibit very strong distortion).
You’ll need to experiment with your lenses to 
see if anything looks objectionable. A good way 
to test for barrel or pincushion distortion is by 
putting your camera on a tripod and shooting 
pictures of things like door or window frames. 
If the edges curve out, that’s barrel distortion; 
curving in is pincushion distortion.
Again, read lens reviews before you buy a 
new lens and see if the distortion is severe at 
certain settings. Newer lenses are generally well 
corrected for these types of distortion.
Bokeh
Bokeh is open to interpretation and how a per-
son feels about a picture’s out-of-focus elements 
in front of and behind the subject. Bokeh comes 
from the Japanese word boke, which means 
blur.
Good bokeh—the appearance of background 
blur—simply means that the blurred elements 
are smooth and attractive. Any points of out-of-
focus light should be round and smooth with-
out hard, bright edges or strange shapes. This is 
a difficult concept to describe and is best shown 
in pictures (figure 2.41).
Once again, this issue is subject to personal 
opinion. If you think the out-of-focus elements 
in your images look good, then that’s what 
matters. Don’t be overly concerned about it. 
However, your images may be criticized if the 
bokeh is bad. If you enter photo contests where 
experienced judges view your images, they will 
look for good bokeh.
Bokeh, especially of out-of-focus points of 
light, is affected by the number of aperture 
blades in the lens. Cheap lenses may have only 
five blades and form an aperture hole that is not 
round. The out-of-focus points of light will look 
like little white stop signs (polygons) with sev-
eral flat sides.
If you buy lenses with at least seven to nine 
aperture blades, the aperture holes will be more 
round and form lovely circular out-of-focus 
points of light in the image. More aperture 
blades usually means more cost. Although it

is hard to recognize at first, learn to see good 
bokeh. If an out-of-focus background (or fore-
ground) looks busy or distracting, it probably 
has bad bokeh. If it looks smooth and appealing, 
it may have good bokeh. You will learn how to 
judge good and bad bokeh as your images get 
better and better.
Bokeh is often discussed in good lens reviews. 
Just by being aware of the issue, you will tend 
to pick up information on it and have a better 
understanding of what to look for. Watch the 
out-of-focus areas of your images and see if 
they look smooth. If not, find out why! Details 
like this will make your images look better. It’s 
worth the extra effort.
Filters
There are all sorts of filters available to screw 
into the filter threads on the front of your 
lenses. Filters modify the light that comes into 
the lens in various ways, including adding a 
color tint and removing reflections, and they 
protect the lens from scratches.
A digital camera is so much better than a 
film camera at modifying light that filters are 
not as important to photographers as they used 
to be. However, there are some strong excep-
tions! Let’s talk about a couple of filters that you 
should get right away.
Before we discuss filters, though, I want you 
to keep in mind an important fact. A filter that 
you screw into the front of your expensive lens 
becomes another lens element. If you use cheap 
superstore brand filters you will seriously de-
grade the quality of your images. You must buy 
the highest quality filters that you can afford. 
Multicoatings matter, and we will discuss them 
later in this chapter. Again, do not use cheap 
filters! Save up and get the best ones you can af-
ford. Your images will reward you.
Now, let’s talk about a couple of filters that 
you should have in your camera bag right now.
UV or Skylight Filter
An ultraviolet or UV filter is one that most pho-
tographers use regularly (figure 2.42). It may 
also be called a skylight filter.
The sales literature for UV or skylight filters 
say they help remove the scattered blue light 
you see in the distance when taking a landscape 
shot. That may be true, but the effect is so weak 
as to be of little importance. Why, then, do most 
photographers keep UV filters on their lenses? 
Mainly for lens protection!
If you accidentally drop a lens or bump it 
against a hard object, the big front lens element 
takes the abuse. Photographers would rather 
scratch or break a relatively inexpensive UV 
filter instead of the front element of their much 
more expensive lens. If a filter is not mounted 
on the lens and the front element gets damaged, 
sometimes the filter threads can be dented and 
filters can no longer be mounted. A UV filter 
prevents that damage, except in high-impact 
accidents.
Careless lens cleaning can scratch or damage 
the coatings on the front lens element. These 
coatings cut down on things like lens flare and 
provide extra clarity for your images. It is better 
to clean a fingerprint off a UV filter instead of 
the front element of the lens itself. Keeping a UV 
filter on your expensive lens can help prevent 
expensive lens damage.

element of your expensive lens

FILTERS CAN SLIGHTLY LOWER THE IMAGE QUALITY
When you use a UV filter (or any filter), you may want to remove it for maximum quality while 
shooting your best work. When I am shooting landscapes and need maximum resolution and 
light transmission, I remove the UV filter. Any time you add glass to the front of your lens, you 
add an impediment to light transmission and a potential source of lens flare, and you lower the 
maximum quality your lens can produce. You have to weigh the danger of lens damage from lack 
of protection against your desire for maximum quality.
It is not a good idea to stack filters on a lens. Adding multiple pieces of glass to a lens will 
definitely lower the image quality. In addition, you may experience a condition called mechanical 
vignetting, where the filter rims extend into view of the front lens element and cuts the edges of 
the picture. In other words, if you put multiple filters on your lens, the lens may be able to see the 
rim of the extra filter and it will show up in your pictures. Don’t stack filters!
Polarizing Filter
If you buy no other filter for your lenses, you 
must own a polarizing filter (figure 2.43). This 
filter is also called a polarizer or PL filter. Polar-
izing filters come in two basic types: linear and 
circular.
Due to the way the autofocus system works 
on most digital cameras, it is important that 
you only use a circular polarizer. Some rings on 
filters may indicate something like “Cir. Polar-
izer” or PL-CIR. If it just says “Polarizer” on the 
lens, avoid it. You really need a circular polarizer 
and should be firm about getting only that type. 
Otherwise, if your camera’s autofocus system 
uses a beam splitter to focus, you may get focus-
ing errors.
Some newer cameras may not use beam 
splitters for focusing and will work fine with 
both linear and circular polarizers; however, you 
should get a circular polarizer since the effect is 
the same with either type, and you won’t have 
to worry about if the filter will work on multiple 
cameras. As an enthusiast, you will eventually 
have multiple cameras. I feel very confident in 
making that statement.
What does a polarizer do? Its most important 
function is to remove reflections. Light is nor-
mally scattered in all directions. A polarizer lines 
up, or polarizes, the light so it vibrates in one di-
rection. By removing some of the scattered light, 
the polarizer loses a portion of the brightness 
and cuts down on the amount of light that hits 
the imaging sensor. It makes the image darker 
when it polarizes the light because it throws 
away light that is not vibrating in the correct 
direction to pass through the filter.
What good is polarized light if we suffer the 
penalty of less light getting to our camera’s 
imaging sensor? Simply this: polarized light, by 
not having strong reflections, tends to saturate 
colors in images. If you are taking a picture of a 
beautiful autumn scene with colorful leaves, a 
large percentage of the color saturation is lost to 
reflections.
Figure 2.43: A circular polarizer, the most important 
filter for a landscape photographer

FILTERS
If you are taking a picture of a beautiful 
stream, the light reflected back from the surface 
of the water is glare that can be removed with a 
polarizer—which darkens the water in a beauti-
ful way (figure 2.44). Notice how the foliage has 
more color saturation in the polarized picture on 
the right. This is because the polarizer filter re-
moves reflections from foliage too, raising con-
trast and deepening color in the entire image.
The interesting thing about a polarizer is 
how it is constructed. It is made in two parts, 
with a front and rear element. When you screw 
the polarizer into the front of your lens, you can 
rotate the polarizer’s outer element. This lets 
you select the angle of light you want to polar-
ize so you can dial out reflections, deepening the 
saturation of colors and even darkening certain 
portions of the sky (at a 90-degree angle from 
sun) in an attractive way. If you point your index 
finger at the sun while extending your thumb 
(as if you were imitating a gun, with the other 
three fingers folded), the direction your thumb 
points is 90 degrees from the sun. If you rotate 
your arm so that your thumb rotates around 
your stationary index finger, your thumb will 
draw an arc that defines the area of the sky that 
can be darkened by a polarizer.
Screw a polarizer into a lens that is mounted 
on your camera, then go outside and look 
through the camera. Rotate the outside element 
of the polarizer and watch what happens to the 
colors. Look at a car that has reflections in its 
windows and watch how rotating the polarizer 
removes those reflections. It is a quite interest-
ing filter that landscape photographers love to 
use. If you shoot anything outdoors that needs 
deeper color or fewer reflections, it’s important 
to have a polarizer.
 
■
FILTER TIGHTENING CAUTION
There is one important warning about filters, especially polarizers: never (and I mean never) over-
tighten a polarizer on a lens or you will not be able to remove it without damaging the filter, the 
lens, or both. Since the outer element of a polarizer rotates, it is very difficult to remove one that 
has been screwed on too tightly. I’ll never admit how I know this.
Be careful not to overtighten any filter on a lens. Aside from making it difficult to remove, the 
glass element in the filter can warp and degrade the light that passes through it. Tighten a filter 
only enough so it doesn’t fall off.

polarization)

Match the Filter Size to Your Lens
Each lens may have a different filter size. The 
filter size is usually engraved on the back of the 
lens cap for your lens, as shown in figure 2.45. If 
not, it may be indicated on the lens itself. If you 
can’t find the filter size in millimeters (mm), 
you’ll need to refer to the lens documentation.
Figure 2.45: Filter size on the back of a lens cap
Often a series of lenses will use the same filter 
size, but you cannot be sure without checking. 
Many times, I’ve had to buy different filter sizes 
for several different lenses. One lens filter ring 
may be 52 mm, another may be 67 mm, and a 
third may be 72 mm. In that case, you’ll need UV 
and polarizer filters for each lens size.
Multicoatings Matter
One final piece of advice is that when you buy 
any type of filter, it should be multicoated. You 
can clearly see why in figure 2.46. See how the 
multicoated filter on the left passes much more 
light than the single-coated filter on the right? A 
single-coated filter reflects light, so the camera 
can’t use that light.
I have experimented with filters for many 
years, and I have very strong opinions about 
particular brands. There are cheap brands and 
premium brands. My favorite brand is Hoya’s 
older HMC (Hoya Multi-Coated) or newer DMC 
(Digital Multi-Coated) professional filters. In 
fact, despite my previous advice, I might even 
leave a Hoya HMC or DMC filter on my camera 
while shooting my best work! Hoya also makes 
lower-cost filters that are not multicoated, as do 
many other companies. However, because a fil-
ter becomes another element of the lens, do you 
really want a cheaper filter? If you want maxi-
mum quality, you must buy multicoated filters.
Conclusions
We have looked at a lot of information about 
lenses. This chapter should give you the ability 
to begin understanding how to choose and use 
lenses that will give you good results. Lenses are 
the most important investments you will make 
in your photography. If I had to decide between 
a cheap lens and an expensive camera body, or 
an expensive lens and a cheap camera body, I 
would go for the expensive lens every time.
If you buy the right lenses, you can use them 
for many years, but camera bodies come and go 
as technology changes. Lenses are expensive, 
but a good lens is worth it in extra quality and 
longevity. A certain satisfaction results from 
owning excellent glass.
Other photographers will recognize your 
photographic maturity by looking into your 
camera bag. If they see the latest expensive 
camera body and cheap lenses, they will know 
they’ve looked into the camera bag of an ama-
teur photographer. If, instead, they look in your 
bag and see a good camera body and premium

glass, they will understand you are a mature 
photographer. If they see both premium lenses 
and the best camera body, they will know you 
are either independently wealthy or you are a 
professional who needs that level of equipment 
to make a living.
All of us want the last circumstance, the best 
of everything. However, unless you are wealthy 
enough to own the best, and few people are 
these days, choose premium lenses and you will 
do better as a photographer over time.
Now, let’s switch gears for a while. We’ve 
learned a lot about camera bodies, imaging sen-
sors, filters, and lenses. Now let’s start learning 
how to use them in the best way. Let’s learn how 
a camera’s three exposure controls work.


57
What Is a Good Exposure?
A good exposure is in the eye of the beholder. 
Making a good exposure simply means that the 
resulting image is pleasing to you and, usually, 
to others. Your camera uses its light meter to de-
termine what it thinks is a good exposure. Most 
of the time, you can depend on your camera’s 
meter. Other times, it will need some help.
In other words, you may not agree with the 
camera on what a good exposure looks like in 
all picture-taking situations. Camera-suggested 
exposure settings can vary somewhat, accord-
ing to the type of light meter your camera is 
currently using. Most modern cameras have 
multiple light meter types, which we will dis-
cuss in chapter 5 in a section called “Selecting a 
Light Meter Type.”
This chapter will center on using the three 
primary exposure controls on your camera. 
You’ll learn how to use the controls in coopera-
tion with each other to manage a wide array of 
photographic situations. What are these three 
controls? When is one more important than the 
other two? Let’s find out!
Three Controls for a Good Exposure
As you read camera books and magazines you’ll 
soon understand how important it is to get a 
good exposure. You’ll learn about using the aper-
ture and shutter speed to control the light enter-
ing the camera and how changing the camera’s 
ISO sensitivity will make the camera’s imaging 
sensor more or less sensitive to light.
It is important that you learn how to use 
these three most basic camera controls or you 
will always be dependant on the camera’s 
software, not your own knowledge, to make 
pictures. Although that is fine with most people, 
you are different—otherwise you would have 
kept using a point-and-shoot camera.
How do aperture and shutter speed work? 
What is ISO sensitivity? How can you use them 
to get the best exposures you’ve ever made? 
Let’s see how!
Learning about the Three Exposure Controls
In order to consistently get good exposures, 
you’ll have to learn how to control your camera 
more efficiently than when you were letting the 
camera do it all in the point-and-shoot world. 
Of course, you could just leave the camera in 
auto mode, but then your more powerful cam-
era would just be a heavier point-and-shoot 
camera. Why not learn these basic photography 
principles now so you can make the camera do 
what you want it to do? Then you’ll be able to 
get good pictures when others come away with 
weak or bad ones.
As previosuly mentioned, in this chapter we 
will consider how to get a good exposure by 
learning to use three important controls in your 
camera:
 
f ISO sensitivity: How sensitive the imaging 
sensor is to light
 
f Aperture: How much light gets to the imaging 
sensor
 
f Shutter speed: How long the imaging sensor 
is exposed to light

You’ll also learn how to make pictures without 
all that spotty-looking, color-flecked graininess 
(called noise) that you often see in images made 
with a digital point-and-shoot camera.
As discussed in chapter 1, ILCs and DSLRs 
have a larger digital imaging sensor (the camera 
part that captures the picture) with bigger 
pixels (microscopic light gathering points on 
the sensor) than point-and-shoot cameras. Since 
the sensor is larger, there is room to make the 
pixels larger, too. With the larger pixels your 
camera can gather light more efficiently and 
make better-looking images—even in low light 
situations.
In figures 3.1 to 3.3 we see the progression of 
possible exposures, one good and two bad (from 
over- and underexposure). Let’s start investigat-
ing how you can make only good exposures 
with your more powerful DSLR camera or ILC.
 
✚
ASSIGNMENT:
Create a series of images like those in 
figures 3.1 to 3.3. Take the camera off auto-
matic exposure (use M or manual mode) 
and make three pictures, one with a good 
exposure, one overexposed, and one under-
exposed. Remember how you did it!
Understanding the Camera’s Limitations
The camera has some limitations in how much 
light it can capture in one image. The image can 
show good detail in the bright or dark areas of 
your chosen subject—but usually not both. You 
will have to learn how to expose for the subject 
in order to get a good exposure. Let’s talk about 
the limitations your camera has so you can 
learn to work with them.
Your eye and brain combination has the abil-
ity to see detail in a much larger range of light 
than your camera. You can stand in the direct 
sun and see clothing detail of someone in the 
shade on the front porch of a house. Your cam-
era cannot do that in a single image. You would 
have to expose one image for a subject standing 
in the sun and use a different exposure for a 
second image of a subject standing in the shade. 
Cameras do not have enough dynamic range to

capture detail in both very light and very dark 
areas of a scene at the same time.
Figure 3.4 is a picture of Bud Ogle’s cabin in 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The 
bright sunlit yard and building are well exposed, 
but if a man were standing on the porch, the 
camera would have trouble capturing detail in 
his image. Your eyes could easily see someone 
on the porch, but your camera can’t because of 
the excessively large range of light on a sunny 
day. 
Your eyes have a significantly larger dynamic 
range of light-capturing capacity than your 
camera does—usually about double. In figure 3.4 
I exposed for the subject and the cabin, and I 
made a good picture of it. There is not much de-
tail from the front porch or surrounding woods. 
The camera’s dynamic range is too limited. 
Whenever you are shooting an image in a very 
bright-light situation, remember your camera’s 
limitations. You can see more than it can!
Note: In an upcoming chapter we will talk 
about an important feature, called a histogram, 
found in most digital cameras. A histogram al-
lows you to see at a glance the amount of light 
range in an image after you have taken it. You 
can see a sample histogram in the top right 
corner of figure 3.4. The histogram shows the 
dynamic range of luminance (brightness) in 
an image and is an important tool for digital 
photographers. In chapter 7 we’ll discuss how 
you can use the histogram to validate your 
exposures.
If I had taken the picture of the cabin on an 
overcast day, it is most likely that the full range 
of light would have been captured by the cam-
era. On a day without direct sun a camera may 
be able to capture detail in both the cabin logs 
and the front porch area. As long as you keep 
the light range within the camera’s capacity 
to capture light, it will record all the detail in 
the image. The histogram readout will allow 
you to see if that is possible with current light 
conditions.
You can use a technique called high dynamic 
range (HDR) photography, which allows you to 
combine multiple images with various expo-
sures into one image. The combined image can 
approach the dynamic range that your eyes can 
see. For now, though, let’s see how we can ex-
pose a single image and make a good exposure.
 
■
WHAT IS DYNAMIC RANGE?
The ratio between the brightest light and the darkest shadows in an image is its dynamic range. 
Dynamic range is also known as luminance range. A human is capable of seeing detail over a 
wider range than a camera. If you think about doubling the value of light in steps, the human 
eye can detect detail in 10 to 14 light-doubled steps. Most digital cameras can manage only 
5 to 9 light-doubled steps. I’m sure future generations of cameras will gradually have improved 
dynamic ranges.

Exposing for the Subject
In difficult lighting situations, where your 
camera cannot capture the full range of light, 
you have to expose for the subject of your im-
age. Figure 3.5 is an image I took as part of an 
engagement shoot. To light this picture I had an 
assistant hold a large gold-colored reflector and 
direct sunlight onto the young couple from a ray 
of sunshine about 15 feet away. This image was 
lit entirely with natural warm sunlight, and the 
gold reflector gave the image an even warmer 
feeling. I wanted a warm mood to reflect the 
love between two young people about to get 
married.
The young couple is standing in a darker area, 
with a bright sky in the background and lots of 
highlights on the leaves behind them. I placed 
one of my camera’s focus points on the young 
lady’s eye and used it to focus on her face and 
meter her skin tones. In other words, I exposed 
the image for her.
Notice how the sky area above the young 
couple’s heads has lost most color and detail 
and is washed out to pure white. This is referred 
to as blown out. The darker areas of the forest 
surrounding them have turned almost pure 
black, with no shadow detail. That means the 
camera’s sensor could not record the full range 
of light and dark contrast, and it lost detail in 
the brightest and darkest areas. That’s fine for 
this particular shot because it adds to the mood, 
but it could be problematic for other images. If 
the sky area had been much larger in this image, 
I would have repositioned the couple to get the 
sky out of the picture. There is nothing more de-
structive to a fine art image than large expanses 
of blown out, colorless sky.
Excessive light range is the bane of photog-
raphy, and you must be fully aware of it. You 
will constantly work to make the exposure of 
your image accommodate the range of avail-
able light. Current cameras cannot see as much 
as you can, so you must expose specifically for 
your subject when the light range is broad, such 
as outside on a sunny day or in high-contrast 
areas like a forest (figure 3.5). Don’t let your eyes 
fool you into thinking your camera is capturing 
the entire range of light. We’ll talk about light 
ranges in more depth in chapter 7, in a section 
called “Using the Camera’s Histogram.”
 
■
USING YOUR CAMERA’S HIGHLIGHT BLINK MODE
Most digital cameras have a function called something like highlights mode, where overexposed 
(blown out) areas of the image will blink from black to white on the camera’s LCD monitor. Many 
people call this blink mode. Look in your camera manual for this mode and turn it on. It will help 
you see what areas of the image have lost highlight detail. If those areas are important, you will 
have to figure out how to expose for your subject and control the overexposure. We’ll discuss 
more about how to control light in upcoming sections.

ASSIGNMENT
Your advanced camera has multiple autofocus points, or AF points—the little squares or brackets 
in the viewfinder or LCD that you can use to focus the camera wherever you want. Check your 
camera manual if you don’t know how to use a single AF point because you’ll need to understand 
it for this assignment. You won’t be able to control an individual AF point when your camera is 
in an automatic shooting mode. You’ll need to switch to aperture priority (A or Av) instead. Take 
a picture of a subject in direct sunlight. Expose for the subject by placing a single AF point some-
where on the subject when you take the picture. Then examine the picture on your computer and 
look at nearby shadows. Do they have detail? Are there any blown out areas that have become 
pure white? This will teach you about your camera’s dynamic range.
Camera Exposure Control Relationship 
Illustrated
Let’s begin our examination of how the three 
main exposure controls relate to one another 
with an illustration. Think about your kitchen 
faucet when you are filling a glass with water. 
There are four factors involved:
1. The water
2. The faucet nozzle with a hole in the end 
where the water flows out
3. The faucet handle that controls how long the 
the water flows out
4. The glass you are filling with water
Figure 3.6: Water flow controls compared to light 
exposure controls (water = light)
As shown in figure 3.6, let’s directly compare 
the concept of filling a glass with water (getting 
a nice drink) to taking a picture (getting a nice 
exposure):
1. Water = light: You need water to drink in the 
same way a camera needs light for an expo-
sure. You could drink just the right amount, 
too much, or too little water in the same way 
a camera could get just the right amount, too 
much, or too little light. Both getting a drink 
(water) and taking a picture (light) need flow 
controls. Your water flow controls are the fau-
cet nozzle, faucet handle, and glass size. Your 
light flow controls are the aperture, shutter 
speed, and ISO sensitivity.
2. Faucet nozzle = aperture: The camera ap-
erture is like the nozzle of the faucet where 
the water comes out. The size of the nozzle 
controls how much water volume can flow 
into the glass, in the same way the camera 
lens aperture opening size controls how much 
light volume can get to the imaging sensor. 
A large aperture (such as f/2.8) lets in more 
light than a small aperture (such as f/11).
3. Faucet handle = shutter speed: The camera 
shutter speed is like the handle of the faucet. 
The handle controls how long the water runs 
into the glass in the same way the shutter 
speed controls how long the light hits the 
imaging sensor. A slow shutter speed (such 

62
CH APTER 3
U N DERSTA N DIN G  EXPOSU RE  CO N TROLS
as 1/60 second) lets light come in for a lon-
ger time than a fast shutter speed (such as 
1/500 second).
4. Glass = camera imaging sensor: The glass is 
like your camera imaging sensor. The glass is 
a container for water, like the imaging sen-
sor (with its pixels) is a container for light. 
To satisfy your thirst, the glass should be full 
of water, not half full and not running over. 
In the same way, the imaging sensor should 
have a full exposure, not an underexposure 
and not an overexposure. The size of the glass 
controls the amount of water it will hold. A 
large glass holds more water than a small 
glass. The ISO sensitivity is like the size of the 
glass. A low ISO sensitivity (such as 100 ISO) 
will gather only a little light, in the same way 
a small glass will hold only a little water. A 
high ISO sensitivity (such as 400 ISO and 
higher) will gather more light, like a large 
glass will hold more water.
With this illustration in mind, let’s examine ISO 
sensitivity, aperture, and shutter speed individu-
ally. But first, let’s take a look at some terminol-
ogy that is used to describe how they work 
cooperatively to control exposure.
Understanding Stops, F-Stops, and EV Steps
In our quest to learn the language of photogra-
phy, there are certain words used to describe the 
concept of light control. You’ll need to under-
stand these words because photography books, 
magazines, and articles use them frequently. It’s 
part of the language photographers speak. The 
words are stop, f-stop, and EV step. Let’s find out 
more about these three terms.
What Is a Stop?
The term stop is used in photography to repre-
sent a relative change in the amount of light 
that is allowed into the camera. If you double 
the light that gets into the camera with any of 
the exposure controls, you have increased the 
light by one stop. If you reduce the light by half 
with any of the controls, you have reduced the 
light by one stop. This is an important word to 
photographers because it gives us an easy way 
to describe either letting twice as much or half 
as much light into the camera. One stop up lets 
in twice as much light, one stop down lets in 
half as much light.
What tends to confuse many people at first 
is that the word stop is often used when refer-
ring to three different exposure controls: ISO 
sensitivity, aperture, and shutter speed. That’s 
because all three can manage the light that 
creates the picture. In other words, all three 
exposure controls allow more or less light into 
the camera. Adjusting these controls is referred 
to as stopping down (allowing less light let in) or 
stopping up (allowing more light in).
The term stopping down is used much more 
often in photography than the term stopping 
up. For whatever reason, you’ll more often hear 
stopping up called opening up instead. The term 
stop originated in the discussion of aperture, but 
it eventually came to mean letting in more or 
less light.
However you hear or read it, just remember 
that changing a setting by one stop up (open-
ing or stopping up) lets in twice as much light; 
changing by one stop down (stopping down) 
lets in half as much light. When you read some-
thing like “let in an extra stop of light,” that sim-
ply means doubling the light. If you read “take 
away a stop of light,” it means cut the light in 
half. Basically, the term stop is a shortcut way of 
saying twice as much or half as much light.
What Is an F-Stop?
There is a similar term used in photography that 
is related directly to how a lens works: f-stop. 
This is the origin of the term stop, which is just 
a shortened form of f-stop. The word stop by 
itself can pertain to any of the light controls, but 
f-stop is limited to the aperture control.

63
T H REE  CO N TROLS  FO R  A  G O O D  EXPOSU RE
Basically, f-stop means the same thing as 
stop, except it is related to the physical aperture 
control on your camera. You could interchange 
the words f-stop or stop when talking about 
controlling the light with your camera aperture. 
Saying “open up one stop” means the same 
thing as “open up one f-stop”; that is, let in 
twice as much light. So when you read the word 
f-stop, remember it means the same thing as 
stop, except it is directly related to the aperture 
control of the camera, not the shutter speed or 
ISO sensitivity.
The word f-stop comes from the good old 
days of having f/numbers (aperture numbers) 
on a ring at the back of a lens (e.g., f/3.5, f/5.6, 
f/8). When you turn the aperture ring in one di-
rection you let in more light (make the aperture 
hole bigger), and the other direction lets in less 
light (makes the aperture hole smaller). Most 
new cameras control the f-stops with a dial 
you turn on the camera body. You’ll learn more 
about aperture and f-stops in the upcoming sec-
tion called “What Is Aperture?”
What Is an EV Step?
Most camera user’s manuals also call a stop 
by yet another name: EV step. EV stands for 
exposure value, and an EV step is a doubling or 
halving of light, which is the equivalent of one 
stop. The term EV step is the accurate way to 
generically refer to the doubling or halving of 
light values. However, the simple word stop has 
been used for so long to represent what is bet-
ter named EV step—as in “give it another stop 
of light”—that it has arguably become the most 
common way to express the concept. Some 
photographers might argue this point because 
the word stop originated with the aperture con-
trol (f-stop), but those same photographers will 
know exactly what you mean when you say “it 
needs another stop of light.”
Whenever you see the words stop, f-stop, 
or EV step, just realize that they all can mean 
the same thing—a doubling or halving of the 
amount of light getting into the camera. How-
ever, one caution is in order here: examine the 
context when you hear or read the word f-stop 
to see if it means the physical aperture size or 
the amount of light passing through the ap-
erture. It can be used both ways. F-stop is the 
only one of the three words that is specific to 
the aperture only. The words stop and EV step 
can be used to refer to any of the three light 
flow controls (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO 
sensitivity).
Additionally, sometimes you’ll see the word 
step used instead of stop. I have read literature 
where step is used to mean the same thing as 
stop, although not often. I think some authors 
use step as a shortened form of EV step. Usually 
you can figure out from the context what the 
author is trying to say.
From here on, to keep things simple, I will 
usually call twice as much or half as much light 
by its most basic word, stop. Now, let’s start ex-
amining each exposure control individually.
Note: Often in photography literature you 
will see the word f/stop used instead of f-stop. 
Just remember they mean the same thing.
What Is ISO Sensitivity?
The acronym ISO stands for International Or-
ganization for Standardization. ISO sensitivity 
numbers simply represent different levels of 
light sensitivity for the camera’s imaging sensor. 
Similar to how your eyes automatically adjust 
to the dark so you can see detail in low-light ar-
eas, your camera’s imaging sensor can be made 
more sensitive to light in darker areas, too. Like 
your eyes, your imaging sensor can adjust au-
tomatically, or you can take manual control of 
its sensitivity, which is the best choice for most 
photography. We’ll learn about both ways in 
this book, with emphasis on manual ISO sensi-
tivity control in this chapter.
Many cameras come from the factory with 
the ISO sensitivity set to auto. That’s fine while 

64
CH APTER 3
U N DERSTA N DIN G  EXPOSU RE  CO N TROLS
you are learning to use the camera. However, 
you will later want to take full control of ISO 
sensitivity for the best results.
Camera books talk about ISO numbers in 
a couple of ways. Some will say ISO 100, and 
others will say 100 ISO. Either way it means the 
same thing, a certain light sensitivity level. In 
this book I will note the number last (such as 
ISO 100).
A low number, such as ISO 100, is usually 
best for outdoor daylight pictures, and higher 
numbers, such as ISO 400 to 800, are better for 
overcast days or indoor use without flash. When 
you absolutely must get the shot, feel free to set 
the ISO to whatever high level is needed, with 
the understanding that the higher the ISO num-
ber, the greater the noise potential (color-flecked 
graininess) in the image.
Doubling the ISO sensitivity, by changing it 
from 100 to 200, adds one stop of light sensitiv-
ity (it is twice as sensitive). Lowering the ISO 
from 200 to 100 removes one stop of light sensi-
tivity (it is half as sensitive). Each step up in the 
ISO number scale doubles the light sensitivity, 
and each step down halves the light sensitivity. 
Here is a list of ISO numbers with a one-stop 
difference between each number (doubling in 
sensitivity):
100 > 200 > 400 > 800 > 1600 > 3200 > 6400 > 
12800 > 25600...
Minimum and Maximum ISO Sensitivity Levels
Your camera may go as low as ISO 100 and as 
high as over ISO 200,000 (mostly in semipro 
and pro cameras). One or two manufacturers of-
fer ISO 50, and some limit the lowest ISO num-
ber to ISO 200.
The highest ISO sensitivity numbers are 
always being pushed upward by camera manu-
facturers—mainly for bragging rights. Very few 
of us will need an ISO sensitivity of more than 
about ISO 1600. Most of us can shoot between 
ISO 100 and 800 for the majority of our pictures. 
On darker, overcast days, or indoors without 
flash (your camera’s popup light), ISO 400–800 
will often make the imaging sensor sensitive 
enough to take a good picture.
On a beautiful, sunny day your camera can 
be set to its lowest ISO sensitivity for the sharp-
est noise-free images. As you learn how to use 
the camera’s ISO sensitivity you will begin to 
develop a feel for what ISO is needed to cap-
ture your current subject. The nice thing about 
digital photography is that you can experiment 
without cost.
In figure 3.7 you can see the ISO sensitivity 
selections in the menu of my Nikon. Refer to 
your camera manual and find the ISO sensitiv-
ity setting for your camera. It may have a differ-
ent name than ISO sensitivity; however, ISO will 
be included in the name of the function, and 
you will have menu screens or buttons to select 
from a range of ISO numbers. If your camera has 
a custom menu that allows you to store settings 
you use often, place the ISO sensitivity setting 
there because you’ll need it often.
Your camera will come from the factory with 
a default ISO sensitivity already set, usually ISO 
100 or 200. You can change the ISO number any 
time you think you need more or less sensitivity.
Using In-Between ISO Sensitivity Values
Many cameras let you select points between the 
one-stop ISO numbers for not quite doubling 
the ISO sensitivity (less than one stop). Many 
cameras let you change the ISO sensitivity in 1/3 
or 1/2 stops, or both. The following is a list of ISO 
numbers from ISO 100 to 1000 in 1/3 stops (all 
Figure 3.7: ISO sensitivity number selection on a Nikon

65
T H REE  CO N TROLS  FO R  A  G O O D  EXPOSU RE
in-between ISO numbers are shown in blue, and 
the full-stop ISO numbers are shown in black):
100 > 125 > 160 > 200 > 250 > 320 > 400 > 500 > 
640 > 800 > 1000…
You can use these in-between (partial stop) 
values when you want finer control over the 
exposure. Increasing the ISO sensitivity to an 
in-between value adds just a touch more sensi-
tivity with the penalty of a very slight increase 
in the possibility of introducing noise into your 
image.
It is best to use the lowest ISO sensitivity that 
will capture the picture well. Any greater ISO 
sensitivity than needed tends to very slightly 
lower the image clarity. You will have to decide 
how much tolerance you have for the noise that 
starts showing up in darker areas of the image 
as the ISO sensitivity increases.
In images that have been underexposed and 
then later brightened in a computer, the noise 
becomes much more apparent. It is best to get 
the exposure just right when you shoot the im-
age. Using incremental values between main 
ISO numbers gives you an edge when you need 
it. Most of the time it is not critical that you use 
intermediate numbers because the imaging 
sensor has a range of somewhere around five 
to nine stops of light levels that it can contain 
within one image.
You’ll often select a certain ISO number and 
use it for a while. When the light starts to fade 
you might want to raise the ISO, or if the subject 
is stationary you can use a tripod to prevent 
camera shake while you use a slower shutter 
speed. We’ll talk about shutter speed in the up-
coming section called “What Is Shutter Speed?”
Choosing an ISO Sensitivity Level: 
Some Important Issues
Why not just set your camera to its highest ISO 
sensitivity number and go shoot, because it will 
be so sensitive that you can take pictures in 
both light and dark areas? Or why not set it to 
its lowest setting and not worry about it? Good 
questions!
There are several reasons why you want to 
control the camera’s sensitivity to light, and 
they have to do with the final appearance of the 
pictures you take. The following are some good 
reasons to control the ISO sensitivity yourself:
 
f High ISO numbers are wonderful when you 
absolutely have to get the picture—no matter 
what—and there isn’t much light. A high ISO 
number (above ISO 1600) is so sensitive that 
you can shoot without flash in darker places. 
However, there are some serious drawbacks 
with high ISO sensitivity. The worst thing is 
the noise—or random, color-flecked graini-
ness. Remember how the images looked from 
your point-and-shoot camera when you were 
trying to make pictures or movies on a dark, 
overcast day? The nasty, grainy look that re-
sulted wasn’t very pleasing, was it? A DSLR or 
ILC is not immune to that digital noise. When 
you turn up the ISO sensitivity by selecting 
a higher ISO number, the camera boosts the 
signal on the sensor’s pixels so they can cap-
ture light more easily. However, adding the 
power boost can add random noise to the im-
age. Similar to how static on a radio station 
interferes with the sound of music, digital 
noise interferes with the clear, sharp, color-
ful look you want in your images. By setting 
the ISO sensitivity too high, your pictures or 
movies won’t look any different than they 
did back in the point-and-shoot days.
 
f Too-high ISO sensitivity can make it impos-
sible for the camera to take pictures in bright 
light. The camera can be too sensitive to light, 
and the other two light-adjusting controls 
(aperture and shutter speed) may not be able 
to limit the brightness enough to keep from 
making the image too light (blown out) and 
losing details in the highlights.

66
CH APTER 3
U N DERSTA N DIN G  EXPOSU RE  CO N TROLS
 
f Too-low ISO sensitivity can make it hard for 
the camera to get enough light to make a 
good picture when the ambient light is low. 
Often the pictures will be blurry from camera 
shake while you’re taking the picture (we’ll 
discuss why in the upcoming section on 
shutter speed).
You have a lot of flexibility with your digital 
camera. You can use ISO sensitivity, aperture, 
and shutter speed to control the exposure. ISO 
sensitivity is just the first of three controls you 
can use to capture well-exposed images.
 
✚
ASSIGNMENT:
Take a picture of the same subject at ISO 200, 800, 1600, and 3200. Look at the pictures on 
your computer monitor at 100 percent size (zoomed in). Check for noise in the darker areas and 
shadows. How well does your camera handle high ISO sensitivity? Learn where your tolerance for 
noise ends. Use an ISO one stop under that value as a maximum ISO number for regular shoot-
ing. You can still use the higher ISO numbers in an emergency.
 
■
WHAT DOES ISO STAND FOR?
The acronym ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization, an organization that 
sets numerical standards for businesses, governments, and society. The world is becoming a 
smaller place, so it’s important for different groups of people to agree on standards. If you want 
to know more about the ISO organization, you can visit their website: www.iso.org.
When it comes to photography, it is important that all cameras have the same level of sen-
sitivity for a certain ISO number. By using the ISO standard, you can talk intelligently with your 
friends in different parts of the world and in different languages while being assured that your 
camera’s ISO sensitivity number is the same as theirs.
What Is Aperture?
Have you ever looked in a mirror at your eye and 
noticed the pupil? When the light in the room 
is bright, your pupil is small. If the light is dim, 
your pupil enlarges to let in more light.
A lens aperture is very similar to the pupil 
of your eye (figure 3.8). In fact, your pupil is an 
automatic, brain-controlled aperture. Cameras 
have become very intelligent in the past few 
years, and the brain of the camera (its CPU) can 
automatically control the aperture (or pupil) of 
the lens. The aperture is inside the lens between 
the glass elements, usually toward the rear of 
the lens.
Take a look at figure 3.9 and focus only on 
the size of the apertures opening in the lenses. 
These represent a series of lenses with different 
aperture settings. See how the blades that form 
the aperture come together to create an open-
ing that lets in just the right amount of light for 
the exposure? The aperture is simply a hole that 
can be varied in size, like the pupil of your eye.
Fortunately, for discriminating photogra-
phers who want to control their own image 
making, the aperture can be controlled manu-
ally instead of by the camera. By changing the 
camera’s shooting mode to a setting called 
aperture priority, you can control the aperture 
yourself. We’ll talk more about aperture priority

67
T H REE  CO N TROLS  FO R  A  G O O D  EXPOSU RE
in chapter 5, in a section called “Exploring Semi-
automation for More Control.”
Tip: You can also set the camera to manual 
mode (M) to control the aperture. However, 
when you use manual mode, you absolutely 
must understand everything in this chapter or 
you will get bad exposures. I use aperture prior-
ity (A or Av) most of the time because I shoot 
portraits of people and nature scenes. Many ac-
complished photographers use either aperture 
priority (A or Av) or shutter priority (S or Tv) 
most of the time. We’ll discuss why in the next 
few sections.
What Does the Aperture Do?
The aperture simply controls how much light 
hits the camera’s imaging sensor. With a small 
aperture, less light comes in. With a large aper-
ture, more light comes in. It’s that simple!
On a really bright day, the aperture may need 
to be small (like your pupil) to keep too much 
light from coming into the camera and making 
the exposure too bright. When it is darker out-
side, or when you are shooting inside without 
flash, the aperture may have to be large (like 
your pupil) to allow enough light in for a good 
exposure.
Understanding Aperture Numbers
A camera’s aperture size (the size of the hole) 
is numbered. It works backwards from what 
you would expect. A small aperture has a big 
number, and a big aperture has a small number. 
An aperture that lets in a lot of light (has a big 
opening) is f/2.8. Near the other end of the scale 
is f/16, which lets in very little light (has a small 
opening).
Figure 3.10 shows an aperture set to f/2.8 and 
then stopped down, in full stop increments, to 
f/16. Remember the phrase stopped down? It 
simply means setting the aperture to a smaller 
physical opening (smaller pupil) than the cur-
rent opening. If the aperture was set to f/4 and 
you changed it to f/8, you stopped the lens 
down by two stops (f/4 > f/5.6 > f/8).
Figure 3.10 is similar to figure 3.9, but now 
look at the sizes of the apertures and the num-
bering system that describes those openings.

settings

See what I mean by the numbers working 
backwards from what you would expect? You 
might think that f/2.8, being a small number, 
would represent a smaller hole (aperture), but it 
doesn’t. It indicates a larger aperture opening. In 
the same way, you might think f/16 represents 
a large aperture since it’s a big number, but it 
means a small opening. The following is a series 
of aperture numbers from large to small; each 
aperture is one stop down (it allows half the 
amount of light to come in) from the previous 
aperture:
f/1.4 > f/2.0 > f/2.8 > f/4 > f/5.6 > f/8 > f/11 > 
f/16 > f/22
Most cameras allow you to use intermediate 
aperture openings between the main ones. For 
instance, on most cameras you can find f/3.5 
between f/2.8 and f/4. Remember that we previ-
ously discussed how ISO sensitivity can be set to 
values between the full-stop ISO numbers. The 
same goes for apertures!
Most kit lenses, like the 18–55 mm f/3.5–5.6 
version found on many new cameras, are low 
cost and have a maximum aperture of f/3.5. If 
you want a lens with a larger aperture, you’ll 
have to buy a better one. The reason most cam-
eras come with a basic kit lens is they can be 
manufactured inexpensively yet do a reason-
ably good job of taking pictures. The cost of a 
lens is often based on the maximum size of its 
aperture. All other things being equal, a lens 
with a larger maximum aperture will be more 
expensive. Many lenses cost more (sometimes 
much more) than camera bodies.
Most cameras will let you set the aperture 
in 1/3 or 1/2 stop settings. Remember, a stop 
permits either one-half or double the amount 
of light into the camera, depending on whether 
you are making the aperture larger (stopping up 
or opening up) or smaller (stopping down). In 
other words, one stop down (make the aperture 
hole smaller) equals half the light coming into 
the camera. One stop up (make the aperture 
hole bigger) means twice the light gets in. When 
working with apertures, you might more accu-
rately use the term f-stop instead of stop. How-
ever, most photographers will know what you 
mean if you use either term.
If your camera’s aperture is set to f/4 and you 
stop down 1/3 stop, the aperture will be at f/4.5. 
Another 1/3 stop down is f/5, and another third 
takes the lens to f/5.6. Between the two main 
aperture numbers f/4 and f/5.6, there are two 
1/3 stop settings, as follows (in-between f-stops 
are shown in blue):
f/4 > f/4.5 > f/5 > f/5.6
This holds true through the entire aperture 
range of each lens. If you use the camera in 
manual mode, you can open the aperture 1/3 or 
1/2 stop to make the image a little brighter than 
the meter suggests. Or you can stop down a little 
to darken it. If you use a semiautomatic mode—
such as aperture priority or shutter priority—
you can use the exposure compensation button 
on your camera to override the light meter 
and add or subtract a little light to brighten or 
darken the exposure. Check your camera user’s 
manual to read about the exposure compensa-
tion button. It is a handy tool when you want to 
add or subtract a little light. 
In review, an aperture is a lens opening or 
hole that can be varied in size. It uses numbers 
that range from small to large (f/1.4 to f/22) 
to represent apertures from large to small (it 
seems backwards at first, but it soon becomes 
second nature). The aperture controls how much 
light reaches the camera’s imaging sensor.
Some very expensive DSLR and ILC lenses 
have apertures as large as f/0.95 and as small 
as f/32. The lenses most of us use vary between 
about f/1.4 and f/22. The larger the aperture, the 
more expensive the lens!

need to contemplate for controlling exposure:

the shutter speed. In chapter 4, we’ll bring it 
all together to see how we can use the three 
controls to manage the exposure, depth of field 
(very important, especially for static subjects), 
and motion control (most important for moving 
subjects).

ASSIGNMENT
Set your camera to ISO 400 and aperture priority mode (A or Av), and then find a subject out-
doors that is about three feet (one meter) away. Take a series of pictures of the subject at f/3.5, 
f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, and f/22. Make sure you include the background. 
Look at each picture on your computer monitor at 100 percent and notice that some have a 
blurry background and others have a sharper background. Ask yourself, “Why do the pictures look 
different?” Chapter 4 will help you understand depth of field so that you will understand why the 
background was blurry in some of the shots and not in others.

WHAT IS AN F-STOP, EXACTLY?
For the technical people among us, an f-stop is a ratio between the focal length of the lens (how 
long it is) and the diameter of the lens aperture. Focal length is measured in mm (millimeters) 
all over the world, such as 50 mm, 300 mm, or 55–200 mm. Most kit lenses are zoom lenses with 
focal lengths around 18–55 mm or 18–105 mm.
How does the ratio work? For example, on a 50 mm single focal length lens (a prime lens) 
with an aperture of 25 mm, f/2 simply means that the aperture diameter is half of the lens focal 
length. The formula is as follows:
Focal length ÷ diameter of aperture = f-stop (50 ÷ 25 = 2)
There is no point in getting more technical than this, but if you love math and enjoy things like 
remembering that pi is 3.14159265, you can find plenty of books and Internet sites about the 
diameter of an aperture in relation to the focal length of a lens.
The following is the most important thing to remember: F-stops are consistent across different 
focal lengths, so any lens at f/5.6 will put the same amount of light on the camera’s imaging sensor 
as any other lens at f/5.6.
Interestingly, the “f” in f-stop stands for focal (or focal ratio), and the word stop comes from 
the click detents on older lenses that stop the aperture ring from turning until you are ready to 
turn it yourself. In the old days, the click detents of a low-cost lens stopped only at main aperture 
numbers, such as f/2.8 or f/4, so each click represented one-half or double the amount of light 
entering the lens. More expensive lenses offered additional stops between the main aperture 
numbers, just like f/3.5 comes between f/2.8 and f/4 on a digital camera. The word stop came 
to mean half or double the light entering the lens, according to which direction you turn the 
aperture ring.

What Is Shutter Speed?
To help you understand shutter speed, you 
might think of a shutter like your eyelids. Your 
eyelids open to let in light, and they close to cut 
off light. So does the shutter in a camera. You 
can blink quickly or slowly. Your camera can fire 
the shutter at a slow or high speed, too—that’s 
called the shutter speed.
Let’s say someone leads you, with your eyes 
closed, to a place where an interesting object is 
standing. You have the task of opening and clos-
ing your eyes as fast as you can, and in that 
short time you have to recognize the object. If 
there is plenty of light during that short blink 
while you open and close your eyes, your su-
persmart brain should have little trouble seeing 
the object and understanding what it is. 
Now, let’s say you are led, with your eyes 
closed, to another interesting object in a dark 
room. When you blink your eyes again, it may 
take a moment for the retinas of your eyes to 
absorb enough light for you to see the object 
and understand what it is. You will have to leave 
your eyes open longer so light can stay on your 
retinas long enough for your brain to register 
and understand what the object is.
That’s similar to how a camera shutter works. 
When light is bright, the shutter (eyelid) needs 
to be open only briefly for enough light to hit 
the sensor and a well-exposed image to be re-
corded (like your brain understanding the inter-
esting object), and then it closes. If the ambient 
light is dim, the shutter will have to stay open 
longer to let in enough light for the sensor to 
correctly expose the subject.
Figure 3.11 shows the shutter assembly from 
one of my Nikon DSLR cameras. The red arrow 
points to the shutter blades. These blades are 
what open and close in a timed fashion, giving 
you shutter speed control. They allow light to 
reach the imaging sensor, which is mounted di-
rectly behind the shutter blades.
The shutter controls how long light hits the 
imaging sensor. The shutter speed is adjusted 
in a time range running from thousandths of a 
second to several seconds, or even minutes. For 
instance, my Nikon offers camera-controlled 
shutter speeds from as fast as 1/8000 second to 
as slow as 30 seconds. Additionally, most cam-
eras offer a setting called bulb to lock the shut-
ter open for hours-long exposures. Check your 
user manual for how to use the bulb setting 
for time exposures, such as star trails. Since my 
Nikon’s slowest camera-controlled shutter speed 
is 30 seconds, this means I could set my camera 
up on a tripod and let light hit the sensor for up 
to 30 seconds. It would have to be really dark to 
need a shutter speed that long.
On the other end of the scale, my camera’s 
shutter speed can go as fast at 1/8000 second 
(that’s quite an eyeblink). To register light on the 
sensor that fast means there will have to be a 
lot of light to get a good exposure. Think about 
that kind of speed. At 1/8000 second, your cam-
era divides one second into 8,000 parts, and it 
uses light from only one of those parts. That’s 
not much light!

the shutter blades that control shutter speed

CO N CLUSIO NS
Note: From this point forward I will refer to 
shutter speeds in a specific way to make them 
easy to read. If a shutter speed is 1/125 second, 
I will notate it as 1/125s. If a shutter speed is 
1/15 second, I will show it as 1/15s, and if it is 
10 seconds, I will use 10s.
Also, you’ll need to remember your fractions 
to understand shutter speeds. A shutter speed of 
1/125s is a shorter amount of time than 1/60s. If I 
say “cut in half” when referring to 1/125s, I mean 
you should switch to 1/250s (half the time). If I 
say “double the speed” when referring to 1/125s, 
I mean 1/60s (twice the time, rounded to the 
camera’s nearest setting).
Whew! Aperture numbers that work back-
wards and now shutter speeds that sound back-
wards, too. Well, no one ever said photography 
is easy. It is a rather technical hobby or profes-
sion. That’s why not everyone can excel at it. 
Don’t expect to fully absorb this entire chapter 
in one sitting; even with simple explanations it 
may seem overwhelming. Take your time and 
use your camera to experiment with adjusting 
the controls while you are reading. Do the as-
signments to get hands-on training with your 
own camera. It will all work out in the end. Like 
the fish said, “Just keep swimming, swimming, 
swimming.” Or, for us photographers, “Just keep 
shooting, adjusting, shooting!”
Shutter Speed Number Series
Like the ISO sensitivity and aperture controls, 
the shutter speed control has a series of num-
bers that are used to set various shutter speeds. 
The following list starts at 1/15s—the slowest 
shutter speed that most people can use to hand-
hold a camera—and goes to 1/1000s, in one-stop 
intervals:
1/15s > 1/30s > 1/60s > 1/125s > 1/250s > 1/500s > 
1/1000s
Remember that most cameras can have shutter 
speeds way longer than 1/15s, to as long as 30s 
(or minutes and hours in bulb mode), and they 
can be as fast as 1/8000s. There are also 
in-between shutter speeds that can be set in 
1/3 or 1/2 stops. Here is a list of shutter speeds 
in 1/3 stop increments from 1/15s to 1/60s (in-
between shutter speeds are shown in blue):
1/15s > 1/20s > 1/25s > 1/30s > 1/40s > 1/50s > 
1/60s

ASSIGNMENT:
Set your camera to ISO 100 and shutter 
priority mode (S or Tv). Now take a hand-
held indoor picture of the same subject at 
1/125s, 1/60s, 1/30s, 1/15s, and 1/8s. Look 
at the pictures on your computer monitor 
at 100 percent and see if any of them are 
blurry, or at least not as sharp. Listen as 
the camera fires the shutter to see if some 
exposures take a little more time than oth-
ers. Which shutter speed makes the picture 
less sharp and why? Which shutter speed 
sounds longest? Chapter 4 will help you 
learn how shutter speed controls motion 
and blur.
Conclusions
In this chapter we examined and explained 
some of the terminology a photographer uses, 
along with how the three physical exposure 
controls work.
In the next chapter, “Taking Control of Ex-
posure,” we will discuss how to best use those 
three controls to manage exposure. This knowl-
edge is the core of photography!


73
Now that you understand the concepts behind 
what the three exposure controls do, it is time to 
learn how to use them well. As a photographer, 
you will make choices about how your images 
look. Those choices are made with the three ex-
posure controls. Different styles of photography 
require using the controls in different ways.
As you develop and explore your own style 
of photography—your photographic eye, as it’s 
called—you will gradually form a look that is 
unique to you. People will recognize that you 
took certain pictures because that’s your style.
Even now you have a style, or favorite way of 
shooting. Look back through some of your point-
and-shoot work and see if there is a repeating 
pattern of the things you like to shoot. That is 
an early form of your photographic eye learning 
to see. As time passes you will develop that eye 
even more and learn new ways to shoot.
Having a complete understanding of the ex-
posure system so you can control it will allow 
you to experiment with all sorts of shooting 
styles on your journey through life as a photog-
rapher. Let’s examine how to use the exposure 
controls—ISO sensitivity, aperture, and shut-
ter speed— to further develop your style of 
shooting.
Using the Three Exposure Controls 
Together
Your camera has no idea how you want the final 
image to appear. It only knows how to make a 
good exposure. You have to make certain choices 
to change the appearance of the image. Those 
choices usually include deciding how many 
of the things surrounding your subject you 
want to have in focus (called depth of field) and 
whether you must stop a subject’s motion or 
allow it to blur and imply movement (called 
motion control).
Motion control: Are you taking a picture of 
a waterfall and want to have that wispy look of 
flowing water, as shown in figure 4.1? That look 
requires a very slow shutter speed. Or maybe 
you want to freeze an energetic dancer in mid-
air, as shown in figure 4.2. That requires a fast 
shutter speed.
Depth of field: When you are taking a por-
trait of someone, you may want the background 
to be very blurry, which requires a large ap-
erture (figure 4.3). Or, when you are taking a 
shot of a beautiful landscape image and want 
everything from the foreground to the far back-
ground (called infinity) to be very sharp (fig-
ure 4.4), you need to use a small aperture.
Let’s spend some time looking at both depth 
of field and motion control. It will quickly be-
come clear why your DSLR or ILC can do more 
than most point-and-shoot cameras. By learn-
ing why, when, and how to control the aperture 
and shutter speed, instead of just using what 
the camera gives you in auto mode, you will 
take control of the final look of your images and 
create pictures that make people wonder how 
you did it. They’ll invariably say something like, 
“That one turned out well.” And you’ll reply (or 
at least think), “No it didn’t, I made it that way!”

Understanding Depth of Field
Depth of field is the zone of sharp focus in your 
image. It extends from in front of your subject 
to behind it. You may be focused on a person’s 
face, yet with a deep depth of field, things in 
front of and behind the person will be in focus, 
too. With a shallow depth of field, only the per-
son’s face will be in focus.
You control the aperture, and the resulting 
depth of field, by turning your aperture control, 
which is either a wheel on the camera body or 
a ring on the lens. Refer to your camera user’s 
manual to learn where to find your aperture 
control. This will be one of the most used con-
trols on your camera!
Depth of field is extremely important to pho-
tographers who shoot landscape images and 
portraits. It is controlled by the size of the ap-
erture opening. When you use a large aperture 
opening, such as f/1.4, the only thing that will 
be sharp in your image is the exact area where 
you focused the lens. Nothing else will be sharp 
in front of or behind the subject. Instead, the

surroundings will have a blurry look. That can 
be a good thing for portraits.
Figure 4.5 is a portrait taken with a shallow 
depth of field. I took the portrait next to a lake 
and wanted to blur the background to empha-
size the subject. I used a large aperture, in this 
case f/1.4 on my 50 mm lens. When you look at 
the image, the blurry background draws atten-
tion to the face of the child. Your eye is naturally 
attracted to the sharpest thing in a picture. If 
you want to make a person stand out, use a 
shallow depth of field by opening your camera’s 
aperture to a large hole. The large aperture will 
cause the subject’s surroundings to fade into 
blurriness while the subject remains sharp. 
On the other hand, when you are out shoot-
ing beautiful nature images, you will want to 
have a deep depth of field, so you’ll use a smaller 
aperture opening, such as f/8 or f/11. This makes 
not only the point of focus sharp, but also every-
thing surrounding the spot where you focused 
the lens. In figure 4.6 I used a small aperture to 
make nearly everything in focus. I focused about 
one-third of the way into the scene and let the 
depth of field from the small aperture cover 
both the foreground and the background. 
Tip: In figure 4.6 I wanted to simulate a 3-D 
look. A picture is two dimensional (flat), so a 
scenic photo can often look flat and even unin-
teresting. If you add a foreground object to the 
image, as I did with the trees on the right side, 
it causes the viewer’s brain to detect depth even 
though a 2-D image really has no depth. If you 
want your landscape images to look even better, 
try to include a foreground object in the im-
age. You will need a deep depth of field (a small 
aperture) to make sure the foreground object is 
acceptably sharp. How can you do that?
Let’s use a series of images that shows 
how depth of field, or the zone of sharp focus, 
changes whenever you change the aperture 
size. You will learn to control depth of field so 
you can include or exclude sharpness for certain 
objects in your image.
Suppose you are taking a picture of a young 
lady in a red blouse who is standing six feet 
(two meters) away from you. About six feet be-
hind her is a girl. A young lad is standing about 
six feet behind the girl. There are three people 
total, each about six feet apart, and the young 
lady in front is wearing a red blouse (figure 4.7).
Assume that you are shooting with a 50 mm 
f/1.8 lens (f/1.8 is the maximum aperture, and 
f/22 is the minimum aperture). You focus on the

face of the young lady in red and take a picture. 
It looks like the picture in figure 4.7. A big 
aperture like f/1.8 has a very shallow depth of 
field, therefore the young lady in red is sharp, 
but the two other people behind her are not. 
The background has been deemphasized, and 
the young lady in red has been emphasized. The 
depth of field (or zone of sharp focus) in this 
picture is only about 1.5 feet (0.45 meter). It looks 
strange for two out of the three people in this 
image to appear blurry. It would look better if 
we extended the depth of field (zone of sharp-
ness) to include all of the people. We can do 
that, as we’ll soon see, by simply closing down 
(stopping down) the aperture without changing 
where the camera is focused (on the face of the 
young lady in red).
What would happen if you stopped down 
to a medium-sized aperture like f/8? Figure 4.8 
shows what that does to the depth of field.
Remember, you are focused on the young 
lady in front, and at f/1.8 (a big aperture hole) 
the others were out of focus. Without changing 
your focus in any way, you adjusted the aper-
ture to f/8. Something changed! Even though 
the camera is focused on the young lady in 
front, now the girl to the right is sharp, too.
Figure 4.8 shows that the depth of field 
now extends past the young lady in front and 
includes the girl. The depth of field got deeper. 
Since the girl to the right is about six feet (two 
meters) behind the young lady in red, the depth 
of field is at least six feet, but it is probably 
more like 9 feet (2.75 meters) because it extends 
toward the camera, too. Interestingly, depth of 
field extends farther behind a subject than it 
does in front of a subject.
However, also notice that the young lad to 
the left is still not in focus. The background is 
not in focus, either. The depth of field is deeper, 
but it is still not deep enough to cover all your 
subjects. Figure 4.8 is the result of a medium ap-
erture opening (f/8), not a big one (f/1.8), and not 
a small one (f/22). Now, let’s consider what hap-
pens if we stop down, or close the aperture, to a 
small opening like f/22 (see figure 4.9).
Aha! Now everything in the picture is in fo-
cus (figure 4.9). An aperture as small as f/22 
makes it easy to get a deep depth of field. Re-
member, you focused on the young lady in front 
in all of these pictures. At first, only she was in 
focus (f/1.8), and as the aperture got progres-
sively smaller (f/8 and f/22), more and more of

the surroundings became sharp without chang-
ing where the lens was focused.   
Again, depth of field is simply the zone of 
sharp focus. It extends in front of and behind 
your focused subject, and it gets deeper both 
toward the camera and away from it as you stop 
down your lens.
If you set your camera to aperture priority 
(usually A or Av) or manual (M) on the mode 
dial, you can adjust the aperture to help control 
how deep the depth of focus is in your pictures. 
In the previous series of figures I used aperture 
priority, which let me set the aperture while 
the camera automatically adjusted the shutter 
speed (half automation is convenient).
We will discuss shutter speed next, so notice 
how the camera changed the shutter speed. 
In figure 4.7 the shutter speed was 1/6000s 
because it was a sunny day and I used a large 
aperture (which controls how much light comes 
in).
With such a big aperture, lots of light came 
into the camera. Since I used aperture priority 
(A or Av) mode, the camera selected an appro-
priately fast shutter speed to let the light in for 
only a very short period of time. With a longer 
shutter speed, the image would have been over-
exposed from too much light.
I used ISO 100 for these pictures so they 
would be noise free. Yet even at that relatively 
insensitive ISO setting, because I used a large 
aperture and a lot of light came in, the camera 
needed to limit the light by using a very fast 
shutter speed of 1/6000s (which controls how 
long light comes in).
Later, as I stopped down the aperture to let 
in less light (smaller hole), the camera compen-
sated by letting the light come in a little longer 
with a slower shutter speed (figure 4.8 was 
taken with a shutter speed of 1/500s).
Finally, in figure 4.9 I stopped the lens all the 
way down to f/22 (tiny aperture hole), which 
considerably limited the amount of light com-
ing in. The camera compensated by using a very 
slow shutter speed of 1/40s to let the light come 
in for a much longer time.
If I had been using manual mode instead of 
aperture priority, I would have had to adjust 
both the aperture and the shutter speed myself. 
Aperture priority made it easier for me by ad-
justing the shutter speed automatically when 
I changed the aperture. I like semiautomation 
because it works very well in today’s cameras. 
We’ll talk more about semiautomation in the 
next chapter.
The pictures in this section were fairly easy 
to take under sunny skies with stationary 
subjects, but you can see where shutter speed 
exposure compensations could get troublesome 
if these three subjects had been playing ball or 
jumping around, because 1/40s will not stop ac-
tion very well.
This is when experienced photographers take 
advantage of motion control (later in this chap-
ter) and become less concerned about depth of 
field. Sometimes you have to make a trade-off 
(speed over depth). When you want to freeze 
action, depth of field cannot take absolute prior-
ity because the slow shutter speed that results 
from a small aperture will not stop action. The 
emphasis must switch from aperture control to

shutter speed control. Shutter speed provides 
motion control.
Tip: I could have used manual mode to 
take the pictures in this section by setting the 
aperture and shutter speed manually, but I’m 
a believer in using technology to help myself 
when it is appropriate to do so. I controlled what 
I wanted to control—the aperture—and let the 
camera save me time by automatically adjust-
ing the shutter speed. My purpose was to ef-
fectively control and extend the depth of field in 
these three images by using the aperture (depth 
of field control), not the shutter speed (motion 
control). I was not overly concerned about the 
shutter speed, except the speed of 1/40s in fig-
ure 4.9. That shutter speed is slow for the lens I 
used, so my picture could have started getting 
blurry from camera vibrations. Please refer to 
the upcoming section called “Reciprocal of Fo-
cal Length Shutter Speed Rule” to gain a better 
understanding of why you have to pay careful 
attention to shutter speed when handholding 
your camera.

ASSIGNMENT:
Set your camera to ISO 800 and aperture priority mode (A or Av). Take a picture of an outdoor 
subject with your camera’s largest aperture opening (f/1.4 to f/4) as close as your lens will focus. 
Include some background, and use a large aperture for a shallow depth of field to make the back-
ground look blurry. If you are using a kit lens with a maximum aperture of f/3.5, it will be a little 
harder to blur the background, but if you get close to your subject, the background will blur. Now, 
shoot a second picture of the same subject at your lens’s minimum aperture (usually f/22). Com-
pare the two pictures on your computer monitor at 100 percent. Pay careful attention to how the 
depth of field difference between the maximum and minimum apertures affect the subject and 
the background. Does the subject look different? Does the background look different?
Using the Depth of Field Preview Button
Many modern cameras have a depth of field 
preview button. It is usually where your fingers 
can find it, to the right of the lens, when you 
are holding the camera up to view the subject. 
Check your camera manual to find the location 
of the depth of field preview button and then 
use it often to actually see the depth of field be-
fore you take the picture.
When you press the depth of field preview 
button, the image in your viewfinder or on the 
LCD live view will darken, and you will see what 
the lens sees with the aperture stopped down 
to the current aperture setting. The reason the 
display or viewfinder darkens is because you are 
looking through the smaller aperture.
Interestingly, the camera does not stop down 
to the aperture you have selected until just 
before it fires the shutter and takes the picture. 
That way, you are always looking at a nice 
bright viewfinder or LCD monitor screen. How-
ever, when you press the depth of field preview 
button, the camera stops down prematurely so 
you can preview the actual depth of field. Your 
eye may take a moment to adjust to the darker 
viewfinder, but the depth of field preview but-
ton is a very useful tool to help you judge how 
much depth of field (and resulting aperture size) 
you need for a particular subject.

Capturing the Star Effect with a Small Aperture
One other benefit of a small aperture is called 
the star effect. Whenever you shoot an image 
with a bright point of light in it and use a small 
aperture, the light tends to form rays that ex-
tend from the point of light (figure 4.10). Many 
people think this is beautiful, especially when 
the sun is the source of light. It also works on 
lights at night, so you can make a cool star effect 
on city lights by setting your camera up on a tri-
pod and stopping the lens down to f/22.
Warning! Do not look directly at the sun 
through your viewfinder if your camera has 
one or you may lose your vision. Similar to 
how focusing the sun on something through a 
magnifying glass can set it on fire, your eye can 
be severely damaged by letting the sun focus 
on your retina. The lens acts like a magnifying 
glass! Use your camera’s live view LCD mode or 
glance only very briefly through the viewfinder 
with a squinted eye. You’ve been warned!
The star effect works only at the smallest 
apertures, such as f/11 or f/22—the smaller, the 
better. Large apertures just show a big white 
spot in the sky where the sun is. Stop way down 
to get the rays!
Fried sensor warning: Be wary when you are 
shooting the sun through a telephoto (long focal 
length) lens because the highly focused rays of 
the sun on your imaging sensor make it very 
hot. Like sizzled leaves under a magnifying glass, 
the sun may burn a hole right into the sensor, 
thereby ruining your camera and voiding the 
warranty at the same time. Be very careful 
when photographing the sun!
Large and Small Aperture Consideration
One final thing I want to mention before we 
discuss using shutter speed for motion control 
is that, for most lenses, the largest and small-
est apertures usually cannot focus as sharply 
as other apertures. If you want the absolute 
sharpest images your lens can make, use a 
medium aperture around f/5.6 or f/8. There’s an 
old saying in photography about how to get the 
best pictures: “f/8 and be there!” Many years of 
proof back up that statement.
The loss of sharpness is usually worse at 
wide-open apertures, except in professional, 
highly corrected lenses that often cost many 
times more than camera bodies. The problem 
gets progressively better one or two stops down 
from the maximum.
The smallest apertures, starting around f/11 
with some lenses, also lose sharpness due to 
light diffraction. As light enters the lens and 
passes the aperture blades, some of the light 
hits the edges of the blades and is diffracted, or 
bent, slightly away from its original path and 
causes the image to be less sharp. For maximum 
image sharpness, use a medium-sized aperture.
If you are interested in learning more about 
how diffraction affects sharpness, do an Inter-
net search on “circle of confusion” and “Airy 
disk.” You’ll learn some interesting things!
We’ll now move into our discussion of mo-
tion control and see how to effectively use shut-
ter speed to control action.

Tip: The closer you get to your subject, the 
less apparent depth of field your picture will 
have. Macro photography (extreme closeups) 
has an extremely shallow depth of field. When 
you take a closeup picture of a flower, it may be 
hard to get the front and back of the flower in 
focus at the same time. Something similar ap-
plies to shooting with a telephoto lens, which 
pulls your subject in closer. Starting at around 
200 mm, telephoto lenses have less depth of 
field. The longer the lens, the less apparent 
depth of field. The apparent depth of field of 
a normal kit lens zoomed to its longest focal 
length is less than its depth of field at a wide an-
gle setting. For the maximum depth of field, use 
the widest setting on your lens (18–24 mm). Ba-
sically, any method you use to bring the subject 
closer will reduce the apparent depth of field.
Motion Control
Motion control is very important to photog-
raphers who shoot wildlife, sports, and action 
shots of any kind. In some cases, it even be-
comes important to nature shooters, such as 
when they want to blur a waterfall and make it 
look wispy.
ILCs and DSLR cameras have a mode called 
shutter priority. Check your manual to learn 
how to select it. It is probably on a mode dial 
with a symbol like S or Tv. You’ll also need to 
read about how to adjust the shutter speed. On 
most cameras you turn a wheel or select a speed 
from a menu. Learn how to do this because it is 
a commonly used control, especially if you are 
an action shooter.
The shutter assembly is inside your camera. 
Your camera may use a mechanical shutter or 
an electronic one. A mechanical shutter has 
physical blades that open and close (like your 
upper and lower eyelids) and allow light in for 
a specified period of time. An electronic shut-
ter turns the imaging sensor on and off quickly. 
In either case, the purpose of a shutter speed 
control is to allow light to be recorded for a 
certain period of time. Let’s see how we can use 
shutter speed to control motion.
Stopping Action When the Subject 
Never Stops Moving
Many of us like to shoot pictures of things like 
air shows, race cars, action sports, and flying 
birds. Since most of these subjects are in con-
tinuous motion, you have to use a fast shutter 
speed, focus tracking, and high-speed continu-
ous shutter release mode to capture an image 
that is not blurred. We’ll talk more about these 
camera features as we discuss stopping action 
in various ways.
Figure 4.11 is a bird I stopped in flight with a 
fast shutter speed. I was in a superstore park-
ing lot on an overcast day, sitting in the car and 
waiting for my wife, and several sea gulls were 
flying around above my car. I couldn’t resist 
jumping out, camera blazing, even though peo-
ple walking to their cars were giving me strange 
looks.
Figure 4.11: Sea gull stopped in flight with a fast 
shutter speed
I was shooting at 1/500s shutter speed and ISO 
100 using shutter priority mode. The camera 
was adjusting the aperture for me. While a gull 
flew back and forth, I was using the autofocus 
points (AF points) of my camera’s autofocus 
tracking system to keep the bird in focus as 
I followed it with my camera (this motion is 

81
USIN G  T HE  T H REE  EXPOSU RE  CO N TROLS  TO GET HER
called panning). Autofocus tracking helps keep 
a moving subject sharply focused much better 
than you can when you focus manually. I firmly 
believe in using automation, like focus tracking, 
when it will improve my images. Look up auto-
focus tracking (or focus tracking) in your camera 
manual and learn how to turn it on for action 
shots.
As I panned with the bird—that is, I kept the 
lens trained on the bird while it moved, which 
required me to move my camera back and forth 
as it flew—I fired off bursts of shots with my 
camera’s high-speed continuous shutter release. 
Many cameras can fire from three to six shots 
per second (and pro cameras can shoot even 
faster) when you use what is usually called 
continuous release mode. You just hold down the 
shutter-release button and the camera continu-
ously fires the shutter. Check your manual for 
continuous release mode and learn how to turn 
it on if you shoot action often.
Tip: Most photographers won’t tell you that 
they took 200 pictures of a moving subject in 
order to get a few usable ones, but that’s the 
reality of shooting action. Prepare to shoot a 
lot of images and later delete the ones that 
don’t make the grade. There are photographers 
out there who can take a much higher ratio of 
good to bad shots than me when shooting ac-
tion. However, my keepers look as good as their 
keepers, even if it took me longer to get the shot 
I want. Yours will too! Digital images are basi-
cally free to shoot, so do it. Shoot hundreds of 
shots until you get one or two you like. As you 
get more experience with shooting action, your 
keeper rate will improve. Don’t get discouraged; 
keep shooting.
Stopping Action with a Medium Shutter Speed 
and Peak of Action
Let’s say you are shooting pictures of some fast-
moving subjects. You may want a variety of 
shots showing different amounts of motion. On 
some shots you may want to freeze the action 
completely, such as in figure 4.2 (page 74) where 
the dancer is frozen in the air (the shutter speed 
was 1/1000s). On other shots you may want to 
mostly freeze the action but allow a little blur 
so that movement is implied in the otherwise 
static image.
In figure 4.12 we see a boy jumping off a cliff 
into the water. This image was taken at a small 
river, between two mountains, so the light was 
not very bright. With dim light, it is difficult to 
get a fast enough shutter speed to stop action. 
However, I really wanted these shots, so I used 
several photographic tricks to get them.
I increased the ISO sensitivity and fired 
bursts of images at the peak of the action, and I 
used the shutter speed to get the shots I wanted. 
Notice in figure 4.12 how the boy seems to be 
suspended in midair. He flung himself into 
the air and is about to plunge into the water. 
Because of the weak light, I selected a shutter 
speed of 1/250s and ISO 800.
Figure 4.12: Boy jumping into water, stopped at peak of action

82
CH APTER 4
TAKIN G  CO N TROL  OF  EXPOSU RE
I had to increase the ISO sensitivity to make 
the camera more sensitive to light. Otherwise I 
would have had to use a shutter speed of about 
1/60s, which would not have stopped the action 
very well. Since I was using semiautomation 
(shutter priority mode), the camera selected a 
medium-sized aperture of f/6.3.
A shutter speed of 1/250s is marginally fast 
enough to stop action, but I didn’t want to in-
crease the ISO sensitivity above 800 (which 
could introduce noise), so this picture was taken 
at an exact moment called peak of action to 
prevent blurring of the falling subject. If you 
look at the boy’s position, you will see that he is 
above his launch point (the edge of the cliff). He 
jumped into the air, and the peak of action oc-
curred just as the momentum from that upward 
jump paused and gravity started taking over.
I was firing my camera in high-speed con-
tinuous shutter release mode from the moment 
he started moving. I knew that the peak of ac-
tion was coming, but since it only lasts a few 
milliseconds, it can be hard to capture. Because 
I was firing in bursts, I captured several frames 
before, during, and after the peak of action. I got 
my shot!
No matter what shutter speed you use in 
action shooting, if a subject is moving quickly 
enough there is danger of blur. Shooting at the 
peak of action will often allow you to use a 
slower shutter speed than normally needed to 
stop the action. It’s a good method to use when 
there is a peak of action, as opposed to continu-
ous movement.
Allowing Blur in an Image as a Creative Effect
When you use motion control you may want 
to allow a little or a lot of blur in your image, 
depending on the subject. Let’s look at two sce-
narios: one where we want a little blur, and one 
where a lot of blur is appropriate.
A Little Blur Can Be a Good Thing: When you 
are shooting a closeup of a subject in high-speed 
movement, it is sometimes a good idea to slow 
the shutter speed down a little bit in order to in-
troduce a small amount of blur, implying move-
ment. This is similar to how you can include a 
foreground object in a landscape image to imply 
a 3-D effect in a 2-D picture, as we discussed in 
the section on depth of field.
Figure 4.13: Boy jumping into water, with a small 
amount of blur to imply movement
In figure 4.13 I used my zoom lens to pull in the 
boy jumping off the cliff. I decreased my shutter 
speed to 1/125s so I could shoot a burst of frames 
around the peak of action while leaving a little 
blur in parts of the image.
Most of the time, the limbs of humans or ani-
mals in motion move much more rapidly than 
their bodies. In the case of the boy leaping off 
the cliff, his body is sufficiently frozen, and his 
feet and hands have some blur from movement. 
The image looks better than figure 4.12, where he 
is completely stopped in midair as if levitating. 
A little blur implies action. Too much blur would 
ruin the shot, of course, so you’ll have to shoot a 
lot of images to get the right amount of blur.
Remember, when you shoot action use high-
speed continuous shutter release and focus 
tracking in addition to whatever shutter speed 
you choose.

USIN G  T HE  T H REE  EXPOSU RE  CO N TROLS  TO GET HER
As shown in figure 4.14, if you are shooting 
airplanes that have propellers or helicopters 
that are landing, it is often advantageous to 
shoot with a slightly slower shutter speed. In-
stead of using 1/1000s shutter speed and stop-
ping action, try 1/500s to leave a little blur in the 
propellers or rotor. You’ll have to experiment a 
bit. Fire off many frames to find the best shutter 
speed—it’ll be worth it when you get the shot 
you want. 
A Lot of Blur Can Work for Some Subjects: 
The natural world can be beautiful and fasci-
nating. I often shoot waterfalls in Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park. Have you seen pic-
tures where a lovely waterfall or cascade has 
that beautiful wispy effect? That is done by 
using a slow shutter speed to capture the flow-
ing water. Since the reflected light from the wa-
terfall enters the camera for a longer time with 
a slow shutter speed, you must limit the light 
with a small aperture and a low ISO setting. 
Otherwise the image would be overexposed 
from too much light. The nice thing is that a 
small aperture gives you a deep depth of field so 
the scenic shot will have good focus throughout, 
and the low ISO setting makes the image noise 
free.
Figure 4.15 shows two images. The first was 
shot with a fast shutter speed, and the second 
was shot with a slow shutter speed. Which do 
you like best? Most people do not like the effect 
of a fast shutter speed with flowing water be-
cause the water seems frozen, even agitated. In-
stead, most people prefer the smooth flowing 
look of a waterfall that is shot with a slow shut-
ter speed. 
Tip: The human eye maintains an image 
for about 1/10s, so a waterfall shot around that 
speed will look like your eye normally sees it. If 
you are shooting moving water, try to keep your 
shutter speed at or below 1/15s. You must use a 
tripod at shutter speeds slower than 1/15s or the 
entire image will be blurry from camera shake.
Figure 4.14: A composite of two images showing the effect of a fast 
shutter speed (top) and a slower shutter speed (bottom). Notice that 
in the top image, the propellers of the plane don’t seem to be spin-
ning at all, as if its engines weren’t running. With a bit of blur, the 
bottom image corrects that effect and makes it look more natural.

Figure 4.16 is an example of how a slow shut-
ter speed looks when a camera is handheld. 
Nothing in the image is sharp! Use a tripod for 
the sharpest shots. A lens or camera with vibra-
tion reduction (stabilization) can help to a de-
gree, but only a tripod can really give you sharp 
images at slow shutter speeds. You do have a 
tripod, don’t you?
Now, let’s take a look at figure 4.17, which is a 
carefully prepared image of cascades in autumn 
in the Tremont area of Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park. The wispy, flowing water with a 
sharp view up the stream and a lack of image 
noise demonstrates the combination of a very 
slow shutter speed, small aperture, and low ISO 
sensitivity.
Interestingly, the exposure for this lovely im-
age was a shutter speed of 10s, an aperture of 
f/22, and an ISO sensitivity of 100. It was a rather 
dark afternoon with dim, overcast skies that pro-
vided even lighting with few shadows. I used a 
circular polarizer filter on my lens to remove re-
flections from the water, which darkened it and 
provided a nice contrast to the white water.
Tip: When shooting waterfalls and other 
scenes in wooded areas, it is best to wait until 
you can shoot on an overcast day. The exces-
sive contrast between sunlight and shadows 
in the woods can make it nearly impossible to 
get good images. Things like closeups of flow-
ers and plants look better when they are shot 
under even lighting. Some of the best images 
I’ve ever made were shot on rainy days between 
showers. I’ve even gone so far as to shoot plants 
like mushrooms and wildflowers while it was 
raining. I carry a large golf umbrella for that 
purpose. The glistening wetness provided by the 
raindrops and the even lighting of the overcast 
sky can give you some very pretty images. Try it 
sometime!
Reciprocal of Focal Length Shutter Speed Rule
There is another important principle in photog-
raphy that we should talk about now. It is called 
the reciprocal of focal length shutter speed rule, 
and it affects the sharpness of your images. This 
impressive-sounding rule simply means that you 
should use a tripod (no handholding) whenever 
the shutter speed is slower than the reciprocal of 
the lens focal length. What does that mean?
Simply, for whatever focal length is being 
used (e.g., 18 mm, 35 mm, 50 mm, 105 mm), the 
shutter speed should not be slower than the 
same number, unless the camera is on a tripod. 
In other words, if you are using a 50 mm zoom 
setting, you should not use a shutter speed 
slower than 1/50s without having the camera 
on a tripod. With a 105 mm focal length, the 
minimum handheld shutter speed is 1/100s or 
1/125s—there is no shutter speed of 1/105s, so 
you can use the closest one. If you are using a 
300 mm lens, you should not use a shutter speed 
slower than 1/300s unless the camera is on a 
tripod.
The reason for this rule is that a longer focal 
length (zoomed all the way in) tends to magnify 
the subject and any vibrations you introduce 
when you press the shutter-release button. Vi-
brations can also be caused by your heartbeat, 
the movement of the reflex mirror in a DSLR 
(that clunking sound when you fire the shutter), 
or natural hand shakiness when you hold the 
camera. It’s best to use a tripod when you shoot 
at speeds slower than the reciprocal of the lens 
focal length. Otherwise you will be known for 
your well-exposed, blurry images.
Today’s vibration reduction (image stabiliza-
tion) lenses and camera bodies help to control 
camera shake, so use it when you can. (See the 
section called “Lens versus Sensor Image Stabi-
lization” in chapter 2 to review image stabiliza-
tion.) It will help you handhold your camera at 
slower shutter speeds, but it is better to use a tri-
pod for maximum quality at slow shutter speeds.

The size of the camera’s imaging sensor af-
fects the reciprocal of focal length shutter speed 
rule. The smaller the sensor, the more a longer 
lens magnifies vibrations. In today’s cameras 
there are various sensor sizes, ranging from full 
frame (which is the approximate size of a frame 
of 35mm film from the old days) to Nikon CX 
(which is one of the smallest sensors in a DSLR 
or ILC). We discussed sensor sizes in chapter 1.
If your camera has an APS-C, DX, APS-H, Four 
Thirds, or comparable size sensor, you need to 
be extra careful to avoid handheld vibrations. 
Instead of using the reciprocal of the lens focal 
length (such as 60 mm = 1/60s), you should use 
1.5 times the reciprocal. In other words, if your 
zoom lens is set at 60 mm, it may be better to 
use a minimum of 1/80s or 1/100s instead of 
1/60s (1.5 times is 1/90s, which is not available). 
A smaller sensor with a longer focal length lens 
tends to magnify the vibrations even worse. 
Again, this is assuming you are not using a vi-
bration reduction lens, which will help cut down 
on vibrations and allow a slower handheld shut-
ter speed. When in doubt, use a tripod for maxi-
mum sharpness!

ASSIGNMENT:
Part 1. Using shutter priority mode (S or Tv), take some pictures of quickly moving subjects, such 
as cars passing on a road (be careful to not look threatening). Use various shutter speeds from 
1/30s to 1/1000s. Do not move your camera while taking the pictures. Examine the images on 
your computer to see which shutter speeds stopped the action. Which left a lot of blur? Which 
left only a little blur?
Part 2. Set the shutter speed to 1/125s and try following a moving subject with your lens (called 
panning). Fire multiple images with high-speed continuous shutter release mode (see your cam-
era user’s manual) while you hold down the shutter-release button. Examine how those pictures 
look on your computer monitor. Do you have sharp images of the moving subject? Does the 
background have an interesting look and imply motion? Do the moving parts, but not the rest of 
the subject, have blur? Panning with a medium shutter speed can result in interesting images 
with implied motion.
Part 3. Set your camera up on a tripod outside next to a water faucet. Turn on the faucet and 
take pictures at 1/1000s, 1/125s, 1/15s, and 1s. Examine the images on your computer monitor 
and see what the different shutter speeds do to the look of the water. Does the water appear agi-
tated and frozen at 1/1000s? Less so at 1/125s, normal at 1/15s, and wispy at 1s? Try this same 
thing at a stream with cascades or waterfalls the next time you are near one. Do you like the way 
water looks at 1/15s, or do you prefer 1s?

Final Thoughts on ISO Sensitivity
Before we move into the section that brings ev-
erything together, it would be good to visit ISO 
sensitivity again and decide how to best use it.
ISO sensitivity is like the base or foundation 
of your good exposure. In the previous sections 
on depth of field and motion control, I men-
tioned how I adjust the ISO sensitivity when I 
need more exposure control than normal. Think 
of ISO sensitivity as an emergency control. The 
best images are at low ISO sensitivities because 
the camera makes its best-looking images when 
the pixels on the sensor are capturing light at 
their native power level.
Turning up the ISO sensitivity is basically 
boosting the power to the pixels. Although the 
pixels are more light sensitive at higher ISO 
numbers, there are some issues with things like 
noise and image softening from high-ISO noise 
reduction routines in your camera’s software. 
The bottom line on ISO sensitivity is this: only 
increase it when you can’t get enough light.
When you use a smaller aperture for more 
depth of field, but there’s just not enough light 
to get the shot, use a higher ISO number. When 
you use a faster shutter speed than the native 
ISO sensitivity can support, boost the ISO num-
ber. Use a higher ISO when you would other-
wise lose the shot.
All the ISO sensitivity does is make it seem 
as if there is more light than there actually is. 
You are asking the camera to turn up the power, 
gather more light, and add electricity to the pix-
els to make them more sensitive! More, more, 
more!
Fortunately, camera manufacturers are in-
creasing the capabilities of their imaging sen-
sors. Today’s cameras can make lovely pictures 
at ISO sensitivities unheard of even a few years 
ago. Just remember that image quality may suf-
fer with higher ISO numbers. Sometimes that’s 
warranted, other times it’s not.
Experiment with ISO sensitivity to see how 
sensitive you are to the effects of high ISO set-
tings on your images.
Shutter Speed and Aperture Relationship
As you can tell by the differences in the pictures 
you’ve seen in this chapter, it is important to 
understand the relationship between the ap-
erture and the shutter speed. I’m going to state 
a rule again, even though it may be obvious to 
you by now.
Basic Exposure Rule: The aperture controls 
how much light gets to the imaging sensor. The 
shutter speed controls how long the light shines 
on the sensor.
How to Use This Rule: To maintain a good 
exposure, when you decrease the value on one 
side, you must increase the value on the other 
side by an equivalent amount. In other words, 
if you reduce the size of the aperture one stop 
(f/5.6 becomes f/8), you must increase the 
shutter speed by one stop to compensate for 
it (1/125s becomes 1/60s). Or if you reduce the 
shutter speed (1/125s becomes 1/250s), you must 
increase, or open, the aperture (f/5.6 becomes 
f/4).
Read the last two paragraphs and think 
about them until they make sense to you. This is 
one of the most fundamental tidbits of knowl-
edge that a photographer needs for successful 
images. If you do not understand this basic 
principle, little of what you read next will make 
sense.

Using Your Camera to Test Your Knowledge
 
✚
ASSIGNMENT:
Let’s examine how to control exposure while changing your camera’s controls. Before we pro-
ceed, please find the following items in your camera manual and learn how to use them:
g How to set your camera to aperture priority mode (A or Av)
g How to set your camera to shutter priority mode (S or Tv)
g How to change to a different aperture setting
g How to change to a different shutter speed setting
g How to set the ISO sensitivity to 200, 400, etc.
Now, with knowledge of how to do those five things, find a subject to take some pictures of. It 
can be anything with consistent lighting that won’t change for however long you are photo-
graphing it. Maybe you can find something easy to focus on and set it under a lamp on a table. 
Pull up a comfortable chair and let’s go. Remember, any variance in lighting during this process 
will skew the results. Follow these steps:
1. Set your camera to ISO 400.
2. Set your camera to aperture priority (A or Av).
3. Set your lens aperture to f/5.6.
4. Focus on your subject.
5. Look to see what shutter speed your camera has chosen and remember it (or write it down). 
Your LCD monitor, control panel, or viewfinder will display the shutter speed and f-stop and 
look something like this: 30 F5.6. If the shutter speed number is displayed as 15, 30, or 125, 
that simply means 1/15s, 1/30s, or 1/125s.
6. Realize that the f/5.6 aperture number you manually selected told the camera that you want 
to use that aperture size for your next picture. Since you selected aperture priority, the camera 
knows that it must select a shutter speed for you (semiautomation is nice). The shutter speed 
setting the camera chose to work with f/5.6 will give you a good exposure.
7. Examine the shutter speed and aperture relationship chart in figure 4.17. The bold header line 
at the top represents the f-stops or aperture settings. Below that are shutter speed settings in 
black. The numbers in the f/5.6 column are the available shutter speeds, which range from 15 
to 500 (1/15s to 1/500s).

 8. In the f/5.6 column on the chart, one of the shutter speeds below the f-stop number should 
be similar to the shutter speed your camera selected. I have no idea which one your camera 
selected, so I’ll use 30 (1/30s). If your camera chose a shutter speed that is off the chart 
(slower than 1/15s or faster than 1/500s) or between numbers, that’s OK; just remember 
the actual number your camera selected. Recall that most cameras can use shutter speeds 
between the main numbers (in 1/3 stops). The chart shows only the main one-stop 
numbers.
 9. Now start with your finger on 30 under the f/5.6 column (or whatever number is closest to 
the shutter speed your camera chose) and slide it to the left while staying in the same hori-
zontal row until it is under the f/4 column. If your finger was on 30 before, it should now be 
on 60. What does this mean? Simply that f/5.6 at 1/30s is exactly the same exposure as f/4 
at 1/60s. If you slide your finger all the way to the left until it is under the f/1.4 column, you 
will see that f/1.4 at 1/500s is the same exposure as your original f/5.6 at 1/30s.
10. Try setting your aperture to any number in the top row, record the setting, and then change 
it to the next f-number in the top row (to either the left or right) and see if the shutter speed 
setting in the same horizontal row is double or half the original number (one stop differ-
ence) when you focus on your subject.
Exactly what does this chart do? It helps you 
choose alternate shutter speed and aperture 
settings—with the same exposure—for those 
times when you don’t agree with your camera’s 
choice of shutter speed and aperture. For ex-
ample, if your camera chose 30 (1/30s) when you 
selected f/5.6, then you change the aperture to 
f/4, the camera will choose a new shutter speed 
of 60 (1/60s), as long as the ambient light did 
not change.
Why does this chart work? Because aperture 
and shutter speed have a direct relationship, in 
that they both control the exposure. One does 
it by controlling how much light gets to the sen-
sor and the other by how long light stays on the 
sensor.
This is a difficult concept for most people to 
understand, but just like learning to ride a bike, 
if you stick with it you will soon understand the 
aperture and shutter speed relationship, and it 
will be with you forever. Next, we’ll look deeper 
into that relationship.
Review: Without looking back in the book, 
which setting controls how much light reaches 
the imaging sensor, and which setting controls 
how long light shines on the sensor? If you are 
not sure, please review until you are!
Exactly How Does the Shutter Speed Relate 
to the Aperture?
Use the chart in figure 4.18 and your camera’s 
settings to validate what you next read. The 
following aperture and shutter speed combina-
tions have exactly the same exposure results. 
Assuming that the camera’s light meter chose 
f/5.6 at 1/125s as a starting exposure, you will 
see on the chart that the following exposure 
combinations are exactly the same:
 
f f/2.8 at 1/500s (500)
 
f f/4 at 1/250s (250)
 
f f/8 at 1/60s (60)
 
f f/11 at 1/30s (30)
How is it possible that these combinations re-
sult in exactly the same exposure? Using the 
camera’s suggested exposure of f/5.6 at 1/125s, 
what would happen to the light if you used f/5.6 

90
CH APTER 4
TAKIN G  CO N TROL  OF  EXPOSU RE
at 1/250s instead? The aperture is the same, so 
how much light coming in didn’t change. When 
you changed the shutter speed from 1/125s to 
1/250s, how long light reached the sensor was 
cut in half! So you lost one stop, or half of the 
light coming in to the camera. That’s a problem! 
The exposure has been cut in half! That’s called 
underexposure, and it means the image will be 
too dark. You must correct the underexposure. 
Here is a progression that corrects the problem 
(check it against the chart in figure 4.18 until 
you are sure you understand it):
 
f f/5.6 at 1/125s: Good exposure (the camera’s 
suggested starting point)
 
f f/5.6 at 1/250s: Half the time for light to come 
in, so the image will be underexposed by one 
stop
 
f f/4 at 1/250s: Increase the aperture size to 
double the amount of light (one stop in-
crease) and return to a good exposure
Let’s look at this progression a different way:
 
f The camera suggested a good exposure of 
f/5.6 at 1/125s.
 
f You cut the shutter speed in half by adjust-
ing it to 1/250s, but you did not change the 
aperture. This lets light in for half the needed 
time. The image will be underexposed.
 
f You increased the aperture to f/4, which 
doubled the size of the hole and let in twice 
as much light. Twice as much light for half 
the time brings you back to a good exposure. 
The camera is now set to f/4 at 1/250s.
Compare the good exposure in our example, 
f/5.6 at 1/125s, to the following equivalent 
exposures:
 
f f/4 at 1/250s: Doubles the light volume for 
half the time
 
f f/8 at 1/60s: Halves the light volume for 
double the time
In summary, the shutter speed/aperture rela-
tionship is as follows:
 
f If you stop down the aperture by one stop, 
which cuts the light in half, you need to let 
the light come in twice as long (longer shut-
ter speed) to compensate for it.
 
f Inversely, if you cut the shutter speed time 
in half, which doubles the time the light 
flows in, you need to let in half as much light 
(smaller aperture) to compensate for it.
Stated even more simply, if you cut one in half, 
double the other; if you double one, cut the 
other in half.
If you take time to step through these com-
parisons and think about them carefully, you’ll 
come away with the basic knowledge you need 
to control the aperture and shutter speed for 
daily use. Use the chart in figure 4.18 until you 
are comfortable with what is happening. If you 
still don’t quite understand the relationship, 
show the chart to the nearest pro photographer 
and ask for help. If you can’t find one, contact 
me at the link shown at www.Photography 
Writer.com and I’ll do my best to help you. 
As I said earlier, it is a complex subject, but it 
suddenly makes sense when you learn it.
If you feel frisky and want to try full manual 
exposures, move on to the next chapter, but 
make sure you understand the relationship be-
tween aperture, shutter speed, and ISO sensitiv-
ity. If not, then review this and the last chapter 
until you feel comfortable with the concepts 
they discuss or get help from a knowledgeable 
photographer.
Why Do I Need to Make All These Adjustments?
Good question! The answer depends on what 
you want the image to look like. If your camera 
suggests an aperture of f/8 and you are tak-
ing a portrait of a person, you may not want 
all the depth of field that aperture provides. 
You may want a blurred background, so maybe 

91
CO N CLUSIO NS
you would rather use an aperture of f/4 in-
stead. That’s two more stops of light coming 
in, so you’ll need to adjust the shutter speed to 
subtract two stops of light to maintain a good 
exposure. Opening up the aperture by two stops 
(more light) and speeding up the shutter speed 
by two stops (less time) gives you an equivalent 
good exposure.
On the other hand, you may be shooting an 
air show and want to use 1/1000s shutter speed. 
However, your camera may suggest that you 
use 1/250s. You do not agree because you need 
a faster shutter speed to help stop a plane in 
midair. So you set the shutter speed to 1/1000s 
instead—two stops less of light—and open the 
aperture two stops to compensate for it. In other 
words, raising the shutter speed by two stops 
(less time) and opening the aperture by two 
stops (more light) gives you an equivalent good 
exposure.
If you want to blur a waterfall and your 
camera suggests a shutter speed of 1/60s, but 
you want to shoot at a shutter speed that is two 
stops slower to blur the water, you will slow the 
shutter speed down by two stops to 1/15s (more 
time) and close the aperture by two stops (less 
light) for an equivalent exposure.
If all you want to do is take nice pictures, you 
could leave the camera on full auto and you’ll 
get nice average shots, like you get with a point-
and-shoot. However, your camera is much more 
powerful, so use that power and become a more 
accomplished photographer—in control of the 
situation instead of just guessing.
When you control the aperture and depth 
of field, you can place the zone of good focus 
(depth of field) where you want it to be. When 
you use the shutter speed to control motion, you 
can stop or blur action at will. That’s why you 
need to make all these adjustments! It puts you 
in control of your camera and your photography.
Conclusions
As I’ve said several times, I use semiautoma-
tion most of the time. I rarely set my camera to 
full auto, but I do often set it to semiauto. As a 
nature and people photographer, I mostly use 
aperture priority mode (A or Av). This lets me 
choose my aperture manually, and the camera 
will choose an appropriate shutter speed. If I 
am shooting action, I switch to shutter priority 
mode (S or Tv). This lets me manually set the 
shutter speed, and the camera provides the ap-
erture automatically.
This approach allows me to shoot quickly 
without worrying too much about exposure. 
When I feel creative, I use full manual mode and 
set the aperture and shutter speed manually. 
However, I don’t do that often, and I don’t sug-
gest you do, either. Unless you are an absolute 
fanatic about doing it all yourself, why waste 
time fiddling with camera controls? It is better 
to use automation where it helps you. Do you 
use autofocus most of the time? I do, and this is 
no different!
You must decide if you want to approach 
photography as if it were 1905, when camera 
automation had not yet been invented. You will 
learn about photography faster if you do it that 
way because you will be forced to sink or swim. 
I’m not trying to discourage you from turning 
off autofocus, manually focusing your lenses, 
and ignoring automation for the shutter speed 
and aperture. If you really want to go that route, 
your camera is ready and willing to relinquish 
all control to you.
On the other hand, if what you seek is the 
ability to take great pictures, and you are less 
concerned about doing it manually, use semiau-
tomation to make things easier on yourself. I’ll 
even go so far as to say you should use full auto-
mation, setting your camera to point-and-shoot 
mode, when you are at a party and just want 
to get some nice snaps of your friends. Use the 
technology; it does a good job.

I know you are different from most photog-
raphers. You are interested in really learning 
how to use your camera and becoming an ac-
complished DSLR or ILC photographer. I encour-
age you to continue along that path, gradually 
learning all the principles and techniques along 
the way.
However, I also believe you should continue 
to enjoy photography and your camera. Don’t 
take it too seriously all the time. Have some fun! 
Use the silly controls for manipulating images 
in the camera. Use the fisheye effect on your 
friends’ faces, if your camera has it. Use the color 
tinting controls to make some black-and-white, 
cyanotype, and sepia-toned images. Use the 
color outline filter to turn some images into 
crayon drawings. Pump up the saturation on 
some autumn leaf scenic images to make other-
worldly colors. Life is too short not to have fun 
along the way.
Always remember: your camera is not the 
artist, you are! The camera is just a tool to let 
you create. It is your artist’s brush, and the 
world is your canvas. Go make some art!

A car has a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal, 
and a brake pedal. It has a turn signal lever, a 
headlight switch, and something to turn on the 
windshield wipers. Most cars also have a radio, 
a heater, and an air conditioner. Some have a 
manual transmission, and others have an auto-
matic transmission.
When you get into a new car you have never 
driven before, certain controls are immediately 
apparent and others are in unfamiliar places or 
operate differently from previous cars you have 
driven. However, knowledge from earlier cars 
can be applied to the new car.
Cameras are similar. Most have controls you 
are immediately familiar with, and other con-
trols may either be buried in menus or you are 
not sure how to operate them. Most cameras 
have manual and automatic controls. In a sense, 
when you get a new camera, you are learning 
to drive it, to control it. Your knowledge from 
previous cameras often helps you learn the new 
camera.
However, today’s cameras often have hun-
dreds of settings and dozens of controls. It can 
be difficult to wrap your brain around all of 
them at once. It is a good idea to learn the most 
important settings and controls first. All the 
others can wait until you have a degree of mas-
tery over the items that control exposure.
There are many good books on the market 
that explain cameras in great detail, such as my 
Mastering the Nikon DSLR series (published by 
Rocky Nook, www.RockyNook.com). Whatever 
brand of camera you choose will have its own 
user’s manual, and there will be several other 
books available that do a better job of explain-
ing how to operate the camera. Usually the 
manual included with the camera is relatively 
useless for most people. They are too technical 
and sparse to help people understand why and 
when to use a certain setting. Most manuals 
cover only how to use a function, and that is 
simply not enough information for most people. 
This chapter should help you understand some 
of the basic controls you need to use in order to 
do excellent photography. However, I suggest 
that you also acquire a good book that explores 
all the settings on your particular camera.
Let’s carefully examine the most important 
controls for an enthusiast photographer. This 
chapter assumes that you are interested in 
learning to use the semiautomatic and manual 
controls on your camera. Many DSLRs and ILCs 
offer certain modes for the point-and-shoot 
crowd because, not surprisingly, many point-
and-shooters want the higher quality a bigger 
imaging sensor provides.
We will ignore point-and-shoot modes like 
Portrait, Sports, Child, Landscape, Nighttime, Pet, 
and Party (plus many others). Instead, this book 
will focus on the most important controls and 
modes for an enthusiast, which are the main ex-
posure modes: aperture priority (A or Av), shutter 
priority (S or Tv), and manual (M). We will also 
discuss the auto exposure mode since there are 
certain times when it is appropriate.
Let’s now examine how an enthusiast can 
best control a camera for superior photographic 
results.

Selecting a Light Meter Type
A camera’s light meter is a very important con-
trol. It gives you a starting point for getting a 
good exposure. You can use it and the camera’s 
histogram (discussed in chapter 7) to make sure 
the exposure is exactly the way you want it to 
be.
Figure 5.1: Light meter chip in a Nikon camera
There are generally five types of light meters 
available in today’s cameras:
 
f Multizone meter
 
f Center-weighted meter
 
f Spot meter
 
f Averaging meter
 
f Partial meter
Each of these light meters works differently 
and can give different exposure results. Let’s 
examine each of them so you can decide which 
is most appropriate for your style of shooting. 
Figure 5.1 shows the light meter chip inside my 
Nikon camera.
Multizone Meter
Multizone metering is an interesting concept. 
The camera divides the scene in front of the 
lens into various zones and then it examines 
each zone to determine its importance and light 
value.
Figure 5.2 shows a rough approximation of 
a multizone meter. The number of zones vary 
among camera manufacturers. Some have only 
a few zones, and others have thousands of 
zones. 
How does multizone metering work? By 
using complex mathematical formulas, your 
camera stores characteristics for many thou-
sands of images. These characteristics are used 
along with proprietary camera software and 
complex evaluative computations to analyze 
the image that appears in your viewfinder or on 
your monitor. The meter is then set to provide 
accurate exposures for the greatest majority of 
your images.
A simple example of this is when the horizon 
runs through the middle of an image. The sky 
above is bright, and the earth below is much 
dimmer. The metering system evaluates this 
image and compares it to hundreds of similar 
images in the camera’s database, then it auto-
matically selects and inputs a meter setting for 
you.
The multizone meter examines four criti-
cal areas of each picture. It compares the levels 
of brightness in various parts of the scene to 
determine the total range of exposure values. 
It then notices the color of the subject and sur-
roundings. If you are using a lens with a chip 
that communicates with the camera, it also

scene and meters for each division

97
SELEC TIN G  A  LIG H T  M ETER  T YPE
determines how far away your lens is focused 
so the camera can calculate the distance to your 
subject. Finally, it looks at the compositional ele-
ments of the subject.
When it has all that information, it compares 
your image to tens of thousands of image char-
acteristics in the camera’s built-in image data-
base, makes complex evaluations, and comes up 
with an exposure value that is usually right on 
the money, even in complex lighting situations.
Camera brands have different names, which 
may be trademarked, for their multizone meters. 
The following list includes a few names used by 
camera manufacturers to describe their multi-
zone meter:
 
f Matrix Metering
 
f Evaluative Metering
 
f Honeycomb Metering
 
f Segment Metering
 
f Multizone Metering
 
f Automatic MultiPattern Metering
 
f ESP (Electro Selective Pattern Metering)
Check your camera user’s manual to see if you 
can find a reference to one of these meter types 
or one that sounds similar and implies multiple 
zones. Cameras are usually set to multizone 
metering at the factory. It is a very effective and 
accurate way to meter a scene.
Center-Weighted Meter
Center-weighted metering is a throwback to the 
good old days. Many of us were raised on classic 
center-weighted meters and feel comfortable 
with how they work.
The center-weighted meter is a simple con-
cept, really. Whatever part of your subject is in 
the center of your viewfinder or LCD influences 
the meter more than the edges of the frame. 
Depending on the camera brand, the weighting 
can be 60/40, 75/25, or 80/20. If your camera 
uses 75/25 metering for its center-weighted 
meter, the circle in the center gets 75 percent 
importance, and the surrounding parts of the 
scene get 25 percent importance. The size of the 
circle that determines most of the exposure can 
be varied from 5 to 15 percent on many cameras. 
Figure 5.3 shows a visual approximation of a 
center-weighted metering circle (red area). 
If you point your camera so the circle in the cen-
ter of the frame covers your subject, it will get 
the best exposure, and the rest of the scene will 
get less importance. Unfortunately, most cam-
eras do not display the circle that has the most 
influence over the exposure. Without some sort 
of visual indicator, you simply have to guess 
where the circle ends and the surrounding areas 
begin.
This old-style meter is loved by many who 
will vigorously defend their use of it. However, 
for most of us the center-weighted meter is not 
extremely useful. If you find that the multizone 
meter works well for you, then you can safely 
ignore the center-weighted meter. I suggest you 
experiment with it to satisfy your own curios-
ity. Just realize that the multizone meter has so 
much more technology that it is often better. 
The multizone meter takes things like color 
Figure 5.3: Center-weighted metering circle in the center of a view-
finder or live view monitor

98
CH APTER 5

and subject distance into account, whereas the 
center-weighted meter cannot.
Normally the circle for the center-weighted 
meter cannot be moved around on the view-
finder or monitor. In the majority of cameras it 
is in a fixed position, which I suppose is why it 
is called a center-weighted meter. Whatever is 
placed in the center of the viewfinder or moni-
tor gets the best exposure.
Placing your subject in the center of the 
frame often leads to a static-looking composi-
tion that is not pleasing. It is much better to 
place your subject a third of the way into the 
frame and leave some space next to it (this 
is called the rule of thirds). Using the center-
weighted meter forces you to place your subject 
in the center of the frame if you want it to get 
the best exposure. Not good, in my opinion!
Spot Meter
A spot meter is a specialty meter designed to 
let you get a light meter value for a very small 
portion of the scene. No zones are involved, and 
the meter ignores everything except the small 
portion of the scene under the spot. Figure 5.4 
shows an approximate spot size in a viewfinder. 
Not much of the scene is used, is it?
You might wonder how you can possibly 
use a spot meter with it being so tiny. Wouldn’t 
that little spot be hard to position correctly on 
the subject? Fortunately, the spot can be moved 
around within the viewfinder or monitor. Cam-
eras have a thumb control on back that lets you 
move things around on the screen (sometimes 
you must unlock the control).
Most cameras allow you to move an autofo-
cus point to a specific area of the viewfinder or 
monitor so you can focus on a specific area of 
the subject (check your camera user’s manual 
to find out how to do this). Usually the spot 
meter invisibly surrounds the autofocus point, 
which you can move around on the screen or 
viewfinder.
You can move the autofocus point to a per-
son’s eye, for instance, and also spot meter a 
small portion of the person’s face at the same 
time. The spot meter evaluates only 2 to 6 per-
cent of the area surrounding the autofocus 
point, depending on the camera brand. That is a 
tiny spot, which is why it is called a spot meter.
You can use the spot meter on a certain small 
area of the subject to make sure that area gets 
an accurate exposure, no matter what happens 
to the rest of the scene. In situations where 
the light is very bright and there are also dark 
shadows, the camera will not be able to capture 
all that light and dark at the same time. You 
can use the spot meter to get an accurate light 
meter reading from the most important part of 
your subject, which is an easy way to get an ac-
curate exposure of the subject itself.
Averaging Meter
An averaging meter takes the light values from 
the entire scene and averages them for the ex-
posure. This is basically the exact opposite of a 
multizone meter. It could be called a one-zone 
meter (figure 5.5). It doesn’t matter where the 
subject is in your scene because the meter sim-
ply averages all the light values it sees.
Figure 5.4: A spot meter evaluates only a very small portion of the 
scene

99
SELEC TIN G  A  LIG H T  M ETER  T YPE
An averaging meter—also called a reflected-
light meter—tries to make all the light reflected 
by the scene average out to a middle gray value 
(12 to 18 percent gray). Since the meter is seeking 
an average, it often overexposes (too light) a 
dark subject and underexposes (too dark) a 
bright subject. In other words, an averaging me-
ter does not like light and dark values. It would 
rather have a nice medium gray value. If you 
take a closeup picture of a dark black or bright 
white subject, it will be rendered as a medium 
gray subject instead. 
A spot meter is designed to use a very tiny 
spot to get a light meter reading, and an averag-
ing meter uses a wide area—the entire frame—
to get the exposure. Averaging meters should 
only be used in situations like landscapes.
Guess what type of exposure your camera 
will give you with the averaging meter? An av-
erage exposure. Since you are an above-average 
photographer, do you really want to use an aver-
aging meter? Not likely!
Partial Meter
Partial metering is like a combination of center-
weighted and spot metering. A spot meter 
evaluates only the values from a very small por-
tion of the scene (2 to 6 percent), and a partial 
meter makes the spot much bigger, from 10 to 
15 percent of the scene. It acts like the big spot in 
the middle of the center-weighted meter, except 
in partial metering the camera ignores every-
thing outside the big spot. A center-weighted 
meter gives 60 to 80 percent priority to the big 
spot, but a partial meter, like a spot meter, gives 
100 percent priority to the spot.
This type of meter is best used when very 
bright areas outside the partial meter’s spot 
would ruin the exposure. If you are shooting a 
sunset with the sun in the frame and want to 
meter the light values in the sky near the sun 
but don’t want to include the overwhelmingly 
bright sun in the exposure calculations, the 
partial meter should work well. It ignores every-
thing outside the spot.
Author’s Recommendation
Most enthusiasts use the multizone meter for 
general shooting. I use my multizone meter 
about 98 percent of the time. I rarely use the 
other meter types, except for the spot meter 
under special circumstances, such as when I 
am concerned about exposing correctly for a 
very important and specific part of the scene. 
I can meter only that part of the scene, and the 
camera’s metering system will ignore the rest of 
the scene. For example, when I use an external 
flash unit in certain dark environments, such as 
shooting a wedding in an interior room, I often 
use the spot meter on the bride’s face, instead of 
using the multizone meter to meter the entire 
scene.
Another use of the spot meter is to determine 
a good average exposure. You can meter various 
parts of the scene with the spot meter and then 
see how many stops difference there are among 
the areas. Since a camera’s imaging sensor can 
record a light range of around five to nine stops 
(in RAW mode, discussed in chapter 6), you can

tell from the multiple readings whether the 
camera can record the scene in one picture or 
if HDR (high dynamic range) imaging will be 
required. Some excellent references for learning 
how to do HDR imaging (HDRI) have been pub-
lished by Rocky Nook (www.rockynook.com) such 
as Jack Howard’s Practical HDRI, 2nd Edition, and 
Christian Bloch’s The HDRI Handbook.
In a sense, using the spot meter like this is 
similar to what the multizone meter does. So 
why not just use the multizone meter in the first 
place?
I’ve found that even modern multizone 
meters can be influenced by the dark areas sur-
rounding a subject and may tend to overexpose 
the subject. When I use the spot meter on a 
subject’s face, I am telling the camera what the 
most important part of the scene is, and it obedi-
ently meters that small part of the scene. I would 
much rather have an underexposed wall behind 
the bride than a blown out bright spot where the 
bride’s face used to be.
I am overstating the case a bit because mul-
tizone meters are pretty accurate, even in dark-
area flash situations. However, if your camera 
gives you a problem in an extreme contrast 
scene, you should know how to overcome it. You 
are an enthusiast, after all, and should know 
such things!
Why So Many Scene Modes?
Many camera users are not enthusiasts. A cam-
era is merely a device used to get a picture any 
way possible as long as the picture looks reason-
ably nice. Some camera users are not concerned 
with how a camera operates but still want the 
best of pictures. They may have used low-end 
point-and-shoot cameras and were unhappy 
with the noisy images from the tiny image sen-
sors. Then they switch to a DSLR or ILC, yet they 
still want to use the new camera as a point-and-
shoot device.
Camera manufacturers want to sell cameras; 
so new DSLRs and ILCs often have many scene 
modes. With these special modes, shooters who 
are unconcerned about the photographic pro-
cess and have no interest in the difference be-
tween a shutter and an aperture can still make 
nice images, with higher quality than a regular 
point-and-shoot model. The point is that scene 
modes are made for point-and-shooters, not true 
enthusiasts.
Figure 5.6: Point-and-shoot scene modes on a mode 
dial and a monitor
The scene modes are found either on a mode 
dial on top the camera or in menus on the moni-
tor (figure 5.6). As mentioned earlier, the scene 
modes have names like Portrait, Sports, Child, 
Landscape, Beach, Fireworks, Nighttime, Pet, and 
Party.
Should an Enthusiast Use Scene Modes?
If you feel inclined to use a scene mode while 
you are learning to use your new camera, go 
right ahead. However, know them for what they 
really are: modes for people who have no idea 
how exposure works and really don’t care.
By selecting a scene mode you are telling 
the camera what type of scene it should op-
timize itself for and that you do not want the 
responsibility for creating a good exposure. The 
camera then kicks into overdrive, using all its 
available internal software resources to give 
you a good picture. In some modes it will turn 
off the popup flash, in others it will force you to 
use it. It will control the aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO sensitivity according to what it thinks is 

101
W H AT  A B O U T  AU TO  EXPOSU RE  M O DE?
best for that scene mode. It will change things 
like sharpening, contrast, hue, and dark detail 
enhancement to help an amateur get a better 
picture.
Basically, when you use a scene mode you are 
turning the photographic process over to soft-
ware algorithms inside the camera. Those algo-
rithms have been optimized over the years and 
do a good to average job in most situations.
A scene mode gives an inexperienced shooter 
a good picture most of the time, without the 
user knowing or caring how or why. Does that 
describe you? Will you use scene modes? That 
might be fine in the beginning; however, as 
you learn how to control your camera, you will 
quickly turn away from automatic modes and 
make images yourself.
What about Auto Exposure Mode?
Auto exposure mode is an intelligent point-and-
shoot mode that I sometimes use. Although I 
turn up my nose at scene modes, I do use auto 
mode. What’s the difference?
In a sense, the auto exposure mode on your 
camera’s mode dial or in a menu on the monitor 
turns the camera into a point-and-shoot model. 
You will need to examine your camera manual 
carefully to determine which mode is the auto 
exposure mode. Camera brands have different 
ways of indicating this mode. Some have the 
word “Auto,” others have a green camera or 
green rectangle, and others simply have an A 
setting.
What makes auto exposure mode different 
from the scene modes? Auto exposure mode is 
a generic mode designed to let the camera intel-
ligently sense what is going on in front of the 
lens and get a good picture. The camera makes 
all the exposure decisions, as with a scene mode, 
except it is a one-mode-for-all-scenes solution.
Note: Do not confuse auto exposure mode 
with aperture priority mode (A or Av), discussed 
in the next section. Canon sometimes desig-
nates auto exposure mode with an A, some-
times with the word “Auto,” and sometimes 
with a green rectangle. On the same camera, 
aperture priority mode will be indicated by “Av.” 
Search your camera manual for auto exposure 
mode and see how to use it on your camera. It 
can be confusing because camera manufactur-
ers are not consistent.
When Is Auto Exposure Mode Appropriate?
When I am at a party and simply want excellent 
pictures I often switch to auto exposure mode, 
put a small external flash unit on my camera, 
and blast away. The intelligent camera and flash 
does all the work as I walk around having a 
good time with my friends and family. It turns 
my camera into a point-and-shoot model.
I am not ashamed of using auto exposure 
mode in certain circumstances because I have 
taken the time to understand how my camera 
works. I’ve mastered things like shutter speed 
and aperture settings, and now I just want to 
take some nice pictures. I am not ashamed to 
use the technology built into my powerful cam-
era. But when I shoot a wedding, graduation, or 
other event, I don’t use auto exposure mode. For 
those times when the camera is there for fun, 
auto exposure mode works very well, but not so 
much for commercial shooting.
However, let me qualify that. If I were an in-
experienced photographer who had been asked 
to shoot a wedding and I was unsure of myself, 
I wouldn’t hesitate to switch to auto exposure 
mode. The camera is capable of making good 
images, even if the photographer is not—yet. 
Use the technology when you need to; that’s 
why it is there. I wouldn’t fiddle around with 
scene modes, though. To me that is going too far. 
However, auto exposure mode is a one-size-fits-
all solution that can help you in emergencies.
If I couldn’t get my regular experienced part-
ner to shoot an event with me on short notice, 

102
CH APTER 5
C A MER A M O DES A N D CO NTROLS
I wouldn’t hesitate to hand one of my cameras 
to a semienthusiast photographer friend, with 
it set to auto exposure mode, and ask for help 
with shooting the event. Today’s cameras will 
perform.
What Are Some Drawbacks to 
Auto Exposure Mode?
There are some gotchas with auto exposure 
mode since the camera will control the ISO sen-
sitivity and sometimes take it to higher levels. 
One of them is image noise. In auto exposure 
mode the camera has full control of all three ex-
posure controls (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO 
sensitivity). It can raise and lower the ISO sensi-
tivity, plus it can change shutter speed and ap-
erture, as it needs to for a good exposure. If you 
have your ISO set to auto, the camera will keep 
the ISO sensitivity under 800 until an aperture 
and shutter speed combination will not result 
in a good exposure. Then it will increase the ISO 
sensitivity to get the shot.
A higher ISO sensitivity can add digital noise 
to the image, decreasing its quality and lessen-
ing the image sharpness, due to internal noise 
reduction that blurs the image. The camera will 
capture an image when you press the shutter-
release button; however, that image may have 
some problems due to high ISO settings.
Also, in auto exposure mode you lose control 
of the flash. The camera decides when it has 
enough light, or not enough light, and will fire 
the flash accordingly. If you happen to be shoot-
ing a group shot with a bright background, you 
may want the flash to light the group properly, 
but the camera may see the bright background 
and refuse to fire the flash, even though it 
is turned on. You’ll get a silhouetted group 
with no facial detail and a perfectly exposed 
background.
Or you may prefer to shoot an ambient light 
(no flash) closeup shot of a bride’s beautiful 
rings, but the camera fires the flash. You remove 
the external flash unit from the camera’s ac-
cessory shoe on top, but now the popup flash 
fires. No ambient light shot for you! The camera 
figures you don’t know what you are doing 
since you have it set to auto exposure mode, so 
it wants to protect your images.
The point of all this is simple. Use the amaz-
ing technology of your camera when you really 
need it. Otherwise, don’t! You lose creative con-
trol when you use any fully automatic modes. 
You allow software algorithms written by a 
programmer somewhere to make assumptions. 
That programmer may not even be a photog-
rapher. In fact, the programmer may even use 
a stinky little point-and-shoot model and not 
even care when there is noise in his or her 
pictures.
Wouldn’t you rather control the final out-
come of the image? Don’t settle for auto expo-
sure mode. Use it while you are learning to use 
your camera, when you are shooting images for 
fun, or if you’re in a dire emergency. Otherwise, 
keep control of the camera and create your own 
style of pictures. Don’t let your photography be 
controlled by a camera software programmer’s 
style!
Exploring Semiautomation for 
More Control
My first SLR camera was a Nikon FM back in 
1980, which I remember with fondness be-
cause that was when I first got serious about 
photography. It’s hard for me to imagine that 
so many years have passed since I last used 
my FM. Things were simpler back then. When 
I say simple, I mean that the FM had a basic 
center-weighted light meter, manual focus, and 
manual shutter speed and aperture settings. 
I had to decide how to create the image in all 
aspects. It was a camera with only one mode: 
M, or manual.

103
EXPLO RIN G SEMIAU TO M ATIO N FO R M O RE CO NTROL
Later I bought a Nikon FE and was amazed to 
use its A-aperture priority auto mode. I could set 
the aperture manually and the camera would 
adjust the shutter speed for me. Luxury! The 
FE had two modes: M-manual and A-aperture 
priority.
A few more years went by, and I bought a 
Nikon F4 that was loaded with features and 
was much more complex. It had four modes, 
including the two I was used to (M and A) and 
two new modes, S-shutter priority auto and P-
programmed auto. I had to learn even more! The 
F4 was my first P, S, A, M camera.
Today’s cameras are amazingly complex and 
flexible compared to cameras from only a few 
years ago. Let’s examine how we can use that 
flexibility to our benefit. Most enthusiast cam-
eras today have four advanced shooting modes, 
depending on the camera brand: P, S, A, M; or P, 
Tv, Av, M. Those letters represent the progres-
sion of primary shooting modes that allow you 
to control the shutter speed and aperture your-
self. Let’s examine each in detail.
P: Programmed Auto Mode
Digital cameras inherited controls from the film 
days. The programmed auto (P) mode is one of 
them. Back in the good old days, P mode was 
similar to the auto exposure mode we discussed 
in the last section, except it lets you control the 
flash and ISO sensitivity—unlike auto exposure 
mode.
P mode is designed for those times when 
you just want to shoot pictures and not think 
much about camera settings. The camera takes 
care of the shutter speed and aperture for you 
and uses your selected exposure meter type to 
create the best pictures it can without human 
intervention.
Many cameras allow you to override the 
aperture in P mode if you need more or less 
depth of field. Check your user’s manual to see 
if you can override the aperture. Otherwise, the 
camera controls both the shutter speed and the 
aperture for you.
P mode can handle a wide variety of situa-
tions well, but I wouldn’t depend on it for my 
important shooting. Similar to auto exposure 
mode, it can be great at a party where I want 
some nice snapshots. I don’t have to think about 
the camera, and I can just enjoy the party. P 
mode to me is P for party. It’s a good mode to 
use when you want to let the camera control 
the aperture and shutter speed while you con-
trol the flash and ISO sensitivity.
In my opinion, P mode is a bit out of date, 
similar to the center-weighted and averaging 
light meters. It is there for photographers who 
have been shooting for many years and are 
accustomed to it. For a new shooter, P mode 
doesn’t offer enough benefits to consider it for 
regular use, especially for enthusiasts who want 
to learn how to control their camera.
S or Tv: Shutter Priority Mode
Shutter priority (S or Tv) mode is a semiauto-
mated mode for action images. With shutter 
priority mode, you control the shutter speed and 
the camera automatically adjusts the aperture 
to maintain a correct exposure. This allows en-
thusiasts to decide what shutter speed is best 
for the action, so they can control the look of 
motion in their images.
You can use a slow shutter speed to allow 
motion to blur the picture (figure 5.7), or you can 
use a fast shutter speed to freeze the action (fig-
ure 5.8). You also control the ISO sensitivity and 
when to use flash in shutter priority mode.
Being a semiautomatic mode, shutter priority 
is very convenient for people who must shoot 
quickly. While the camera automatically adjusts 
the aperture to maintain a good exposure, you 
can concentrate on the most important thing to 
an action shooter—the shutter speed.
Many professional sports shooters use shut-
ter priority mode. The photographers with big 

104
CH APTER 5
C A MER A M O DES A N D CO NTROLS
lenses at games and races must shoot hundreds 
of pictures. They have little time to worry about 
exposure since they have to control motion, 
so they let the camera worry about exposure 
(camera-controlled aperture size) while they 
manually vary the shutter speed according to 
their needs.
If you find yourself shooting a lot of action 
shots, this may be a good mode for you to use 
regularly.
A or Av: Aperture Priority Mode
For portrait, landscape, and nature shooters, 
aperture priority (A or Av) is often the mode of 
choice. This semiautomatic mode works oppo-
site of shutter priority mode. Aperture priority 
mode allows you to manually control the aper-
ture while the camera adjusts the shutter speed 
to maintain a good exposure. You also control 
the ISO sensitivity and when to use flash.
If you are shooting a portrait of a person, you 
may want a very shallow depth of field (zone of 
Figure 5.7: Shutter priority mode allows you to blur motion
Figure 5.8: Shutter priority mode allows you to freeze 
motion
 
Figure 5.9: Aperture priority mode allows you to use shallow 
depth of field
Figure 5.10: Aperture priority mode allows you to use deep 
depth of field

105
EXPLO RIN G SEMIAU TO M ATIO N FO R M O RE CO NTROL
sharp focus) so that only the person is in focus 
and the background is blurred; therefore, you 
use a big aperture (figure 5.9). If you are shoot-
ing a beautiful landscape, you may want every-
thing from near to far to be in good focus, so you 
use a small aperture to increase the depth of 
field (figure 5.10).
For most photographers, aperture priority is 
the number one shooting mode. The vast major-
ity of us shoot action only from time to time but 
need to control depth of field much more often.
Aperture priority mode allows you to use the 
power of your camera while maintaining cre-
ative control over the aperture. If you don’t envi-
sion yourself shooting a lot of action, you may 
want to seriously consider leaving your camera 
set on aperture priority mode. It will allow you 
to get beautiful images by controlling the ap-
erture while the camera maintains the shutter 
speed for you.
M: Manual Mode
Manual (M) mode takes a big step backward 
to days of old. It gives you manual control of 
your camera’s shutter speed, aperture, and ISO 
sensitivity so you can make all the exposure de-
cisions, with suggestions from the light meter. 
You also decide when to use flash.
Some people tell new photographers to for-
get about all the other modes and immediately 
switch the camera to manual mode. To me, 
though, that is the same attitude as tossing 
someone in the water and letting them sink or 
swim.
Although manual mode is truly the most 
creative way to use a camera, it is also the most 
time consuming. If you have the time and incli-
nation to think about each shot and adjust the 
shutter speed and aperture manually, you will 
have greater control over the look of the image. I 
suggest that you use manual mode from time to 
time so you will know how to use it. It lets you 
do a more contemplative form of photography. 
If you fully understand how the shutter speed 
and aperture affect the image, this mode basi-
cally turns off camera assistance, and you are in 
full control of the exposure.
As shown in figure 5.11, to use manual mode 
you will have to learn how to use the graduated 
exposure scale (also called an analog exposure 
display in some manuals) to see how the expo-
sure is affected when you change the aperture 
or shutter speed.
Figure 5.11: Manual mode uses a graduated 
exposure scale (with a correct exposure) to 
help you adjust the aperture and shutter speed 
accurately
When you are metering your subject, an indica-
tor will appear underneath the analog exposure 
display and extend from the zero in the center 
toward the plus side to indicate overexposure, 
or toward the minus side to indicate underex-
posure. You can gauge the amount of over- or 
underexposure by the number of dots and lines 
the bar passes as it heads toward one side or the 
other. The goal in manual mode is to make the 
bar disappear or rest at zero on the exposure 
scale.
Figure 5.11 shows a graduated exposure 
scale that indicates a good exposure. Figure 5.12 
shows the scale with one stop of overexpo-
sure, and figure 5.13 shows it with one stop of 
underexposure.
Adjust the shutter speed or aperture to get 
the look you want, which will under- or over-
expose the image according to the graduated 

106
CH APTER 5
C A MER A M O DES A N D CO NTROLS
exposure scale. You must then adjust the other 
control until the exposure is back to zero.
Figure 5.12: Graduated exposure scale 
with one stop overexposure
Figure 5.13: Graduated exposure scale 
with one stop underexposure
Let’s say you selected a shutter speed of 1/500s 
to freeze some action, and that caused the light 
meter to indicate one stop of underexposure 
(figure 5.13). You selected the shutter speed to 
control motion, so now you must bring the ex-
posure back to zero by changing the aperture to 
offset the underexposure caused by the shutter 
speed adjustment. Because of the faster shutter 
speed, the camera will let light in for a shorter 
time, so now you must compensate by letting 
more light come in through a bigger aperture.
Conversely, let’s say you choose a big aperture 
to blur the background for a nice portrait of 
your partner. Since you opened up the aperture 
to make a larger hole, more light will come in 
to the camera. Now you must use the shutter 
speed to limit the amount of time light can 
come in to maintain a good exposure. When the 
graduated scale indicates that the exposure is 
back to zero, you are ready to shoot.
Basically, when you choose one of the con-
trols for a special effect (motion control or depth 
of field), you must offset the exposure change 
with the opposite control. If you change the 
shutter speed, adjust the aperture to compen-
sate. If you change the aperture, adjust the shut-
ter speed to compensate. As long as you keep 
the graduated exposure scale at zero, you will 
make a good exposure. Afterward, check the his-
togram—see chapter 7 to learn how—to see if 
the exposure needs further adjustment.
In manual mode, you can slightly under- or 
overexpose the image to fine-tune it, if you’d 
like. Graduated exposure scales in most cam-
eras have dots or bars that divide each stop into 
1/3 stops. You can tweak the exposure by vali-
dating it with the histogram and reshooting.
Do these last few paragraphs sound familiar? 
They should, because we discussed these same 
issues in chapter 4. Now we are directly apply-
ing the concepts to manual exposure and how 
the light meter works in manual mode.
Conclusions
You have to decide what type of photographer 
you are. If you are a slow, contemplative pho-
tographer who likes to take a lot of time on 
each image, you may enjoy using manual mode. 
Most photographers use it from time to time, 
just to exercise their knowledge or to turn off 
the camera’s assistance when they are shooting 
in difficult light. However, the majority of us 
are better off using one of the semiautomated 
modes, such as aperture priority or shutter 
priority.
If you are a photographer who shoots a lot of 
action (motion control), you will definitely ben-
efit from learning how to use shutter priority 
mode. If you are a shooter who needs to control 

107
CO N CLUSIO NS
depth of field (sharp focus area), you will need 
to use aperture priority mode.
The other modes—such as auto exposure 
mode, programmed auto (P) mode, and the 
scene modes—are there for fun or if you need to 
hand your complex camera to a friend or family 
member who doesn’t know as much as you do.
If you use the semiautomated aperture and 
shutter priority modes most of the time, you 
will have excellent camera control to satisfy 
your photographic eye. When you feel fanatical 
and want to do it all yourself, switch the cam-
era to manual mode, turn off autofocus, set the 
camera to black-and-white mode, and pretend 
you’ve traveled back in time to 1955.
Your camera has so many modes that you 
can afford to be choosy. Select the best mode for 
your current situation—whether it’s fully auto-
matic, semiautomatic, or manual. Because you 
are an enthusiast and have taken time to learn 
all these modes, you have the choice when you 
need it.
In the next chapter, we will discuss image 
formats, which is called image quality in many 
camera menus. Your camera offers more than 
one image format and you will need each for 
various types of photography. Let’s see which is 
best for your style of taking pictures.

Today’s digital cameras have the ability to take 
pictures and store them on memory cards, and 
later on computers, in various image formats. 
There are three formats available in some cam-
eras and only two in others. Additionally, there 
are often various levels of image compression—
squeezing the image into a smaller size—within 
the formats, which saves space.
Image formats vary in their ability to store 
levels of color, which is called bit depth. In this 
chapter we will examine the various image 
formats, their names and sizes, and their pros 
and cons. The formats available in your camera 
are usually accessible from a menu item called 
image quality, or something similar. Many 
cameras also give you external controls to allow 
rapid format changes. Check your user’s manual 
and read about your camera’s image quality set-
tings so you can see what formats your camera 
uses.
Image Quality
Image quality is simply the types of images (file 
formats) your camera can create, along with the 
amount of image compression that reduces the 
size of the file. When you take a picture, it goes 
through camera processing and then is stored 
on your camera’s memory card. You can transfer 
it to your computer later.
An image file—similar to any file that can 
be stored on a computer—has a file name that 
specifies what type of file it is. Image files end 
in various three-letter extensions, such as .jpg 
(JPEG) or .tif (TIFF). An example of a file name 
for an image is DSC_1234.jpg.
There are three image formats available in 
many cameras:
 
f JPEG
 
f TIFF
 
f RAW (the name varies among camera 
brands)
Some cameras use only two formats: JPEG and 
RAW. Unless you are using a Panasonic camera, 
you will not see an actual file format or image 
quality called RAW. The word “RAW” simply 
indicates a camera’s best-possible image qual-
ity format. A RAW image is not yet an image; it 
is a potential image that allows you to change 
settings after the fact. Many professionals and 
enthusiasts shoot in RAW format for maximum 
image quality. RAW images require you to con-
vert the files to a final format (such as JPEG) so 
that you—not the camera—make the final deci-
sions about the appearance of the image.
All of the camera’s settings are permanently 
applied to a JPEG or TIFF image before it is writ-
ten to the camera’s memory card, but a RAW 
image file is merely raw data from the imaging 
sensor that stores the camera settings tempo-
rarily. The camera settings can be changed later 
in your computer without harming the image.
Unlike JPEG or TIFF formats, the camera set-
tings are not permanently applied to the im-
age data in a RAW file. A RAW file is written to 
the camera’s memory card with virtually no

processing by the camera. We’ll talk more about 
RAW images in an upcoming section.
Let’s discuss each image quality file format 
and explore its benefits and problems. You may 
want to use different formats at different times, 
so it is a good idea to learn about each format 
your camera uses.
JPEG Format
JPEG, which stands for Joint Photographic Ex-
perts Group, is an extremely popular image 
quality setting. Most cameras default to this set-
ting from the factory since the resulting images 
are immediately usable by virtually all image 
display devices. When you take a picture in JPEG 
format, no further processing in the computer is 
required unless you want to change the appear-
ance of the image.
The JPEG format is used by photographers 
who want excellent image quality but have 
little time for, or interest in, post-processing 
(changing how the image looks) or converting 
their images to another format. They want to 
use their images immediately when they come 
out of the camera, with no major adjustments.
The JPEG format applies your chosen camera 
settings to the image when it is taken. The im-
age comes out of the camera ready to use, as 
long as you have exposed it properly and have 
configured all the other settings appropriately 
for the image. If the camera settings and expo-
sure were not applied correctly, a JPEG image is 
hard to salvage. Why?
JPEG is a lossy format: it throws away image 
data because it compresses the data each time 
the file is modified and resaved. You cannot 
change and save a JPEG file in your computer 
more than a time or two before recompression 
Figure 6.1: 
A JPEG image with 
no changes (upper 
left) and the same 
image modified 
and saved multiple 
times

111
IM AGE Q UALIT Y
losses degrade the image. A JPEG file is smaller 
than a RAW file or a TIFF file because a JPEG file 
is compressed by the camera. If you open the 
image file in your computer, make changes, and 
then resave the file, the image is compressed 
again, with more loss of image quality each 
time you repeat the process.
After you change and save a JPEG file mul-
tiple times, all that extra compression simply 
ruins the file and leaves ugly artifacts (blocky-
looking spots) in the image (figure 6.1). If you are 
committed to shooting JPEG files, you must be 
very accurate in how you expose the image be-
cause adjusting it and saving it again degrades 
the picture.
However, since no post-processing is re-
quired, the JPEG format allows you to use the 
image more quickly. A person who shoots a 
large quantity of images, such as a journalist 
or someone who doesn’t have time to convert 
RAW images, usually uses JPEG format. That de-
scribes many photographers. Nature or portrait 
photographers might want to use RAW format 
since they have more time for post-processing 
images and wringing the last drop of quality 
out of them.
JPEG Compression
Your camera offers multiple JPEG modes so you 
can set the compression level for your JPEG im-
ages. Each mode provides a different level of 
lossy image compression. Higher levels of com-
pression are more lossy.
Camera manufacturers call their JPEG 
compression modes by different names. They 
are usually available in three levels that cor-
respond to large, medium, and small file sizes. 
Nikon uses the names Fine, Normal, and Basic 
for the three sizes, and Canon calls their modes 
Superfine, Fine, and Normal. Check your camera 
manual for a menu item named something 
like JPEG compression to see what names your 
camera uses. JPEG file names end with .jpg (e.g., 
DSC_1234.jpg).
I cannot tell what name your camera uses 
for JPEG compression, so I will use the generic 
names Large, Medium, and Small. Normally the 
compression ratios for these three file types are 
as follows:
 
f JPEG Large: Compression approximately 1:4
 
f JPEG Medium: Compression approximately 
1:8
 
f JPEG Small: Compression approximately 1:16
This means that if your camera produces 
25 megabytes (MB) of raw image data, a JPEG 
file will be compressed to approximately these 
sizes (geek alert):
 
f A JPEG Large file with a 1:4 compression ratio 
will be 1/4 the size of the raw image data 
(25 MB × 0.25 = 6.25 MB).
 
f A JPEG Medium file with a 1:8 compression 
ratio will be 1/8 the size of the raw image 
data (25 MB × 0.125 = 3.1 MB).
 
f A JPEG Large file with a 1:16 compression ra-
tio will be 1/16 the size of the raw image data 
(25 MB × 0.0625 = 1.6 MB).
As you can see, JPEG is a useful format for stor-
ing a lot of images. Just remember this fact: 
when a JPEG compression operation takes place 
on the file, the camera will average the colors 
and contrast and throw away a large amount of 
color data (because it is a lossy format). The fin-
est color gradations are eliminated from the file, 
and all the color is crammed into a maximum of 
256 levels for each of the three color channels—
red, green, and blue (RGB). See the upcoming 
section called “Channel and Bit Depth Tutorial” 
for what this means.
The human eye compensates for small color 
changes quite well, so the JPEG compression 
algorithm works very well. A useful thing about 
JPEG is that you can vary the file size of the 
image, via compression, without affecting the 
quality too much in the initial capture.

The positives of JPEG format are as follows:
 
f Allows the maximum number of images on a 
memory card and computer hard drive
 
f Allows the fastest transfer from the camera 
memory buffer to the memory card in the 
camera
 
f Compatible with everything and everybody 
in imaging
 
f Uses the printing industry standard of 8 bits 
(256 color levels per RGB channel)
 
f Produces high-quality, first-use images
 
f No special software is needed to use 
the image right out of the camera (no 
post-processing)
 
f Immediate use on websites with minimal 
processing
 
f Easy to e-mail and transmit via other meth-
ods on the Internet
The negatives of JPEG format are as follows:
 
f Lossy format
 
f Multiple changes and resaving can degrade 
image quality
TIFF Format
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)  is a file format 
that does not require post-processing for im-
mediate use, yet it can later be modified and 
resaved in a computer without data loss. Many 
cameras do not support the TIFF format because 
the files are rather large and therefore slow to 
process and transfer, and they take up a lot of 
space on memory cards and computer hard 
drives.
TIFF is not a lossy format because the camera 
does not compress the file before saving it to the 
memory card. Later, in the computer, you can 
modify and save a TIFF file over and over with-
out compressing it and throwing away data. 
TIFF is a well-known format that is usable by 
most image processing software.
Some people use TIFF mode for their initial 
shooting (if their camera supports it). You could 
use TIFF mode if you do not want the lossy com-
pression of a JPEG and if you want to adjust the 
images later in your computer without fear of 
quality loss.
Most cameras that support TIFF format cre-
ate 8-bit TIFF files. Since many cameras shoot 
natively in 12 or 14 bit, there is some initial data 
loss when saving to the TIFF format because the 
12- or 14-bit images are converted to 8-bit TIFF 
files (see the upcoming section called “Channel 
and Bit Depth Tutorial”).
After shooting in TIFF format and saving an 
image file to your computer, you can modify 
it over and over without additional losses. The 
primary problem with TIFF files is that they are 
huge and will slow down your camera while it 
saves the files. TIFF file names end with .tif (e.g., 
DSC_1234.tif).
The positives of TIFF format are as follows: 
 
f Very high image quality
 
f Excellent compatibility with the publishing 
industry
 
f Lossless format; uses no compression and 
loses no more data than the initial camera 
conversion from 12 or 14 bits to 8 bits
 
f Images can be modified and resaved an end-
less number of times without losing image 
data
 
f Does not require software post-processing 
during or after download from the camera, so 
the image is immediately usable
The negatives of TIFF format are as follows: 
 
f Files are very large; requires large and expen-
sive memory cards and hard drives
 
f In-camera image processing is slower; limits 
the number of pictures you can take in rapid 
succession
 
f Generally too large to e-mail and transmit 
via other methods on the Internet

RAW Format
RAW format is a proprietary format that your 
camera uses. A RAW file is simply raw camera 
data from your camera’s imaging sensor, along 
with information on how your camera was con-
figured when you took the picture. It is not yet 
an image and must be converted to some other 
format during post-processing.
Different camera brands have different 
names for their RAW files. Some manufactur-
ers have multiple RAW file formats. Plus, there 
is one generic format. The following is a list of 
RAW format file extensions by camera brand:
 
f Canon: CRW, CR2
 
f Fuji: RAF
 
f Leica: RAW, RWL
 
f Minolta: MRW
 
f Nikon: NEF, NRW
 
f Olympus: ORF
 
f Panasonic: RAW, RW2
 
f Pentax: PEF, PTX
 
f Samsung: SRW
 
f Sigma (Foveon sensor): X3F
 
f Sony: SRF, ARW, SR2
There is also an open-standard RAW image for-
mat that was developed by Adobe, called DNG, 
which stands for digital negative. You can save 
the image file from any camera into the DNG 
format, in case you are worried that your manu-
facturer will not support its proprietary RAW 
format for the long term, or you would simply 
rather store your images in a non-proprietary 
format. There is a good article at this website 
about the DNG format: http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Digital_Negative.
With Canon cameras, the RAW file names 
end with .crw (e.g., DSC_1234.crw). With Nikon 
cameras, the RAW file names end with .nef 
(DSC_1234.nef). Each camera manufacturer has 
its own proprietary name (or multiple names). 
Only Panasonic and Leica RAW files end with 
.raw.
A RAW File Is Not an Image, Yet!
Now, let’s talk about RAW quality. I use the RAW 
format about 98 percent of the time. I think of 
a RAW file the way I thought of my slides and 
negatives a few years ago. It’s my original image 
that must be saved and protected.
It is important that you understand some-
thing very unusual about RAW files. They are 
not really images—yet. A RAW file is composed 
of black-and-white sensor data and camera set-
ting information markers. The RAW file is saved 
in a form that must be converted to another file 
type to be used in print or on the web.
When you take a picture in RAW format, the 
camera records the image data from the sensor 
and stores markers for how you have set your 
camera picture controls for things like color, 
sharpening, contrast, saturation, etc., but it does 
not apply this information to the image in a 
permanent way. Later, in your computer post-
processing software, the image will appear on-
screen with these settings temporarily applied, 
just so you can see how the image would look 
with no changes made. However, it is simply 
a temporary interpretation of data. You must 
post-process the file—making any changes you 
find necessary to the look of the image—and 
then save the picture to a final format, such as 
JPEG, before it is a usable image.
For example, if you don’t like the white bal-
ance you selected when you took the picture, 
simply apply a new white balance and the im-
age will appear as if you had used that setting 
when you took the picture. If you initially shot 
the image using high color saturation settings 
and now want to use more subdued colors, all 
you have to do is apply the new color settings 
during post-processing, before the final conver-
sion to another image format, and it will be as if 
you used those settings when you first took the 
picture.
This is quite powerful! At the time of capture, 
virtually no camera settings are applied to a 
RAW file in a permanent way. That means you 

114
CH APTER 6
U N DERSTA N DIN G  IM AGE  FO R M ATS
can apply completely different settings to the 
image in your computer software and it will ap-
pear as if you had used those settings when you 
first took the picture. This gives you a lot of flex-
ibility later. After you post-process a file, you can 
convert it to JPEG format, which sets the image 
markers permanently, or you can convert it to 
TIFF format, which sets the markers but allows 
you to modify the image later without suffering 
compression losses.
RAW format is generally used by photogra-
phers who are concerned with maximum image 
quality and who have time to convert the im-
ages in a computer later.
The positives of RAW format are as follows:
 
f Allows the manipulation of image data to 
achieve the highest-quality image
 
f All original detail stays with the image for 
future processing
 
f The camera does not manipulate image data; 
it is untouched and pure
 
f Allows you to convert files with the more 
powerful processor of a computer
 
f Gives you much more control over the fi-
nal look of the image; you make the final 
decisions
 
f The 12-bit or 14-bit format provides maxi-
mum color information
The negatives of RAW format are as follows:
 
f Not often compatible with the publishing 
industry, except after conversion to another 
format
 
f Requires post-processing with manufacturer-
provided proprietary software or third-party 
software
 
f Larger file sizes require larger storage media
 
f No standard file format; all formats are pro-
prietary (except for the open DNG format)
 
f Industry standard for home and commercial 
printing is 8 bit, not 12 or 14 bit
RAW Mode Compression
Some cameras offer multiple compression 
modes for RAW images, so check your camera 
manual! If your camera offers RAW compres-
sion, you will have to weigh the benefits. A RAW 
file can be large because it contains so much 
information in its uncompressed form.
My camera offers lossless and visually loss-
less compression modes. The lossless mode 
provides 20–40 percent file size reduction with 
no loss of quality—in other words, the compres-
sion is fully reversible, like a ZIP file. The visually 
lossless mode has even higher compression that 
ranges from 40–55 percent file size reduction. 
It does have a little loss of image data, although 
the manufacturer claims that the compression 
losses cannot be seen. My camera also has an 
uncompressed RAW mode, which I rarely use 
because the files are too large, like TIFFs.
I use the lossless RAW compression mode 
because I see no particular need to store files 
larger than they have to be, especially since 
there is no data loss in the image. If your cam-
era has a true lossless RAW compression mode, 
I would seriously consider using it. Any other 
RAW compression modes that cause data loss 
are completely uninteresting to me.
Unfortunately, some lower-end DSLRs and 
ILCs force a lossy compression mode on your 
RAW images, whether you want it or not. This is 
one of those irritating things that convinces me 
to buy cameras in the semipro range so I have 
choices.
RAW Image Conversion Software
Your camera will come with free manufacturer-
supplied RAW conversion software. There are 
several aftermarket RAW conversion applica-
tions available, such as Bibble,  RawShooter, 
Capture One, and ACDSee Pro . Most of these 
programs are available for Windows and Mac. 
Here are links to these aftermarket companies:

f ACDSee Pro: www.acdsee.com
Additionally, you can use Adobe Photoshop or 
Lightroom for conversions from RAW to other 
file formats. Before you shoot in RAW  format, it’s 
a good idea to install your conversion software 
of choice so you’ll be able to view, adjust, and 
save the images to another format when you 
are done shooting. You may not be able to view 
RAW files directly on your computer unless you 
have RAW conversion software installed.
Viewing RAW Files as Thumbnails on Your 
Computer
When you try to view a RAW file on your com-
puter, you may not be able to see thumbnail 
(small) pictures in your computer file manage-
ment software (such as Windows Explorer or 
Mac OS X Finder) unless you have a proper 
codec1 installed. When you install the free RAW 
conversion software from your camera manu-
facturer, it may install the proper codec. Install 
your conversion software, and then investigate 
whether or not you can see small thumbnail im-
ages in the computer’s file browser. If not, you 
may need to take extra steps.
Some computer operating systems provide 
a downloadable patch or codec that lets you 
see RAW files as small thumbnails in its file 
management software. As this book is being 
written, I can find codecs in Google searches for 
Windows 7,  Vista, XP, Linux, and Mac OS X . In 
your favorite search engine, use this text string 
to search for available codecs: “download RAW 
viewer codec”. You can often find a free one, but 
1 
A codec is a device or computer program capable of 
encoding a data stream or signal for transmission, 
storage or encryption, or decoding it for playback or 
editing.
be careful that you don’t go to a website promis-
ing the moon and delivering malware instead.
There are reliable third-party companies, 
such as Ardfry Imaging LLC (www.ardfry.com), 
that offer various 32- and 64-bit RAW codecs for 
a small fee. I bought the Ardfry version for my 
computer. If you’re running 64-bit Windows 
Vista or 64-bit Windows 7, you may want to 
check out Ardfry’s website or do a little research 
on the Internet to see what else is available 
for viewing RAW files as thumbnails on your 
computer.

MORE INFORMATION ON RAW 
FORMATS
If you want to do a little research on RAW 
formats, there are a lot of good articles on 
the Internet. This Wikipedia article is a good 
place to start: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Raw_image_format.
Learn about shooting in RAW format and 
use it often. Unless you are pressed for time 
or have little interest in post-processing 
images on a computer, you will see many 
benefits from using RAW. You can recover 
from mistakes much more easily when 
shooting RAW files, so it is a safety factor 
for photographers who must get the image 
at all costs.
Combined RAW + JPEG Shooting 
(Two Images at Once)
Many cameras give you the best of both worlds 
by letting you shoot in RAW and JPEG formats 
at the same time. It takes more memory card 
space than just shooting in one format, but it 
gives you both formats for every shot. Check 
your camera manual to see if your camera offers 
this dual-mode shooting capability. If it does, 
you can have a JPEG for immediate use and a 
RAW file for storage purposes (and later post-
processing into very high-quality images).

Channel and Bit Depth Tutorial 
What does all this talk about bits mean? Why 
would I set my camera to use 14-bit depth in-
stead of 12-bit depth in RAW mode? This short 
tutorial explains bit depth and how it affects 
color storage in an image.
First, it’s important to understand that an 
image from your camera has three color chan-
nels—red, green, and blue (RGB). Most current 
cameras give you the choice of shooting in 12- or 
14-bit mode. If you are shooting in 12-bit mode, 
your camera will record up to 4,096 colors for 
each channel—there will be up to 4,096 dif-
ferent reds; 4,096 different greens; and 4,096 
different blues. That’s lots of color! In fact, there 
are almost 69 billion colors. If you set your cam-
era to 14-bit mode, it  can store 16,384 different 
colors in each channel. Wow! That’s quite a lot 
more color—almost 4.4 trillion shades.
Is that important? It can be, since the more 
color information you have, the better the color 
in the image—if it has a lot of color. I always use 
the 14-bit mode. That allows for smoother color 
changes when there is a large range of color in 
an image. I like that!
Of course, if you save an image as an 8-bit 
JPEG or TIFF, most of those colors are com-
pressed, or thrown away. Shooting a JPEG image 
in-camera (as opposed to a RAW image) means 
that the camera converts the image in a 12- or 
14-bit RGB file to an 8-bit file. An 8-bit file can 
hold 256 different colors per RGB channel—
more than 16 million colors.
There’s a big difference between the number 
of colors in a RAW file and the number in a JPEG 
file. That’s why I always shoot in RAW; later I 
can make full use of all those potential extra col-
ors to create a different look for the same image.
If you shoot in RAW format and later save 
your image as a 16-bit TIFF file on your com-
puter, you can store all the colors you originally 
captured. A 16-bit file can contain 65,536 differ-
ent colors in each of the RGB channels. Many 
people save their files as 16-bit TIFFs when they 
post-process RAW files, especially if they are 
worried about the long-term viability of their 
camera’s proprietary RAW format.
TIFF gives us a known and safe industry-
standard format that will fully contain all image 
color information from a RAW file. Unfortu-
nately, TIFF files are huge. Many people are look-
ing into the Adobe DNG format as an alternate 
RAW format in hopes that it will remain viable 
for the long term.
If your camera manufacturer stands behind 
its proprietary RAW format and keeps on sup-
porting it, you’ll be fine. If not, many aftermar-
ket software vendors should step up and sup-
port the older RAW formats.
 
■
SPEED ISSUES: RAW MODE 12-BIT VERSUS 14-BIT SHOOTING
If your camera offers both 12- and 14-bit RAW shooting modes, check to see if there are any 
speed penalties for shooting in the higher 14-bit mode. Since there is a lot more color informa-
tion available in 14-bit mode, your images can have finer gradations of color. However, some 
cameras slow down in 14-bit mode because they have to process a lot more color information. 
Test your camera in both modes before you shoot a high-speed event like an air show or car race. 
Otherwise, the camera may slow down enough to cause you to miss some shots. To me, the 
speed loss is not important because I am a nature shooter and want the greater image quality 
that 14-bit mode potentially provides. However, some photographers are very sensitive to cam-
era speed and will need to pay attention to this issue.

Conclusions
Which image format   do I prefer? Why, RAW, of 
course! However, it does require a bit of com-
mitment to shoot in this format. The camera is 
simply an image-capturing device, and you are 
the image manipulator. You decide the final for-
mat, compression ratio, size, color balance, etc. 
In RAW mode you capture the best image your 
camera can produce. It is not modified by the 
camera software and is ready for your personal 
touch. No in-camera processing allowed!
If you get nothing else from this chapter, 
remember this: if your camera processes an 
image in any way, it modifies or throws away 
image data. There is a finite amount of data for 
each image that can be stored on your camera’s 
memory card and later on your computer. With 
JPEG, your camera optimizes the image accord-
ing to the assumptions recorded in its memory. 
Data is thrown away permanently, in varying 
amounts.
If you want to keep all of the image data that 
is recorded in your images, you must store your 
originals in RAW format. Otherwise, you will 
never again be able to access that original data 
to change how it looks. A RAW file is the closest 
thing to a film negative or a transparency that 
your digital camera can make. That’s important 
if you would like to modify the image later. If 
you are concerned with maximum quality, you 
should probably shoot and store your images in 
RAW format. Later, when you have the urge to 
make another masterpiece out of the original 
RAW image file, you’ll have all of your original 
data intact for the highest-quality image.
If you’re concerned that the RAW format 
may change too much over time to be read-
able by future generations, you might want to 
convert your images to TIFF or JPEG files. TIFF 
is best if you want to modify them later. I often 
save a TIFF version of my best files in case RAW 
changes too much in the future, but interest-
ingly I can still read the RAW format from my 
2002-era Nikon D100 in Nikon’s current RAW 
conversion software. Why not do a little more 
research on this subject and decide which you 
like best?
My Recommendation : I shoot in RAW format 
for my most important work and JPEG fine for 
the rest. Some people find that JPEG fine is suffi-
cient for everything they shoot. Those individu-
als generally do not like working with files on 
a computer or do not have time for it. RAW files 
are not usable images and must be converted 
to another format. However, RAW provides the 
highest possible quality your camera can cre-
ate—if you have the time and inclination to 
post-process the images yourself. You will use 
both RAW and JPEG, I’m sure. The format you 
use most often will be controlled by time con-
straints and your digital workflow.
In digital photography we must use new 
technology and learn many new terms and 
acronyms. However, by investing a little time 
to understand these things we become better 
digital photographers. In the next chapter, we 
will learn about three important digital tech-
nologies: the histogram, color space, and white 
balance.
The histogram is a tool you can use to 
validate the exposure for each of your images 
immediately after you shoot it. It is a digital 
readout that shows you the RGB channels in 
a graphical format that can protect you from 
missing good shots. I sincerely recommend that 
you learn to use the histogram.
Color space helps you match your camera 
to software and image display devices so that 
the colors will be consistent. It also affects how 
much color gamut (range of color) your camera 
can capture.
White balance is a way for you to match the 
camera to the light in which you are taking 
pictures. Otherwise, you may have odd tints in 
your pictures and not know why.
Learn to use these three tools and you will be 
far ahead of most digital photographers. A true 
enthusiast!


119
Histogram, color space, and white balance are 
three digital camera technologies that many 
new photographers do not fully understand. 
When I got my first DSLR back in 2002, I remem-
ber how confusing these three things were.
If you remember shooting with film, you did 
not have to worry about the histogram because 
there isn’t one in a film camera. A histogram is 
a digital readout of the exposure; since shooting 
with film is not a digital process, there is no way 
to create a histogram. The other two technolo-
gies—color space and white balance—were 
controlled by whatever film you selected. Each 
film had a somewhat different color capacity 
and rendered color in its own way. Photogra-
phers had a few favorite films that they used 
for different purposes. Films like Kodachrome, 
Velvia, Plus-X, Tri-X, and Agfachrome have (or 
had) strong followings, and each rendered the 
world in a different way. The easy way to con-
trol things like color saturation and contrast was 
to use a film designed for a specific look. Many 
photographers used filters on their lenses to 
modify the color temperature (the look of warm 
redness or cool blueness) of an image. A popular 
filter was an 81A warming filter, which caused 
the image to appear warmer (have less blue).
In the digital world, you have much more 
creative control of how an image looks. Instead 
of working within a certain film’s way of doing 
things, you can use camera settings (color space 
and white balance) to change how the camera 
renders the color in the picture—on an image 
by image basis, if you want.
Additionally, with a histogram, you can judge 
the correctness of an image exposure after 
the fact. The digital readout of the histogram 
lets you determine whether the exposure is 
too light, too dark, just right, or has way more 
light range than the camera can record. If the 
histogram readout shows that the image is too 
dark or too light, you can shoot it again and cor-
rect it. If there is too much light range for the 
camera to capture, you can learn to use HDR 
(high dynamic range) imaging. HDR allows you 
to combine multiple images into one, where 
each individual image has a different exposure 
and captures a certain range of light. When the 
images are combined, the range of light in the 
combined picture is much broader than one im-
age can normally show.
This chapter is divided into three sections:
 
f Section One: Histogram
 
f Section Two: Color Space
 
f Section Three: White Balance
The histogram, color space, and white balance 
settings give you much better control over the 
final image. Let’s look at each of them in detail.
Section One: Histogram
Back in the good old film days we didn’t have 
a histogram, so we had to depend on our ex-
perience and our light meter to achieve a good 
exposure. Since we could not see the exposure 
until after we left the scene and developed the 
Chapter 7
Histogram, Color Space, and White Balance

HISTO G R A M,  COLO R  SPACE,  A N D  W HITE  BAL A N CE
film, we measured our success by the number 
of correctly exposed images we were able to 
create. With the exposure meter and histogram 
combination in our digital cameras, our good 
exposure success rate is much higher than ever 
before.
The histogram can be as important, or even 
more so, than the exposure meter. The exposure 
meter sets the camera up for the exposure, and 
the histogram allows you to visually verify that 
the exposure is a good one. Together they give 
you the most accurate exposures you have ever 
made—if you use them.
If your exposure meter stopped working, you 
could still get excellent exposures using only 
the histogram. In fact, I gauge my efforts more 
by how the histogram looks than anything 
else. The exposure meter and histogram work 
together to make sure you get excellent results 
from your photographic efforts.
Figure 7.1 shows two types of histograms 
from my Nikon. The first screen shows a series 
of histograms to the right of the small picture of 
my grandson and me. On top is a white-colored 
luminance (brightness) histogram followed by 
individual red, green, and blue (RGB) channel 
histograms. In the second screen, the luminance 
histogram appears to the right of the small pic-
ture of my cars in the snow.
Figure 7.1: Two histogram screens
I have no way of knowing whether your camera 
offers only a single luminance histogram or RGB 
histograms too. What is the difference between 
the luminance and RGB histograms? Let’s exam-
ine both types and see.
RGB Histograms
RGB histograms show each of the three color 
channels that a camera uses. Remember, the 
camera combines the red, green, and blue colors 
from its color channels to make the final color 
in the picture. The red, green, and blue colors are 
blended together to provide color in up to tril-
lions of shades to accurately represent the colors 
your eyes see. Therefore, the RGB histograms are 
simply representations of how well your camera 
exposed each color that it later combined into 
the final image.
Luminance Histogram
How does the luminance histogram differ from 
the RGB histograms? The luminance histogram 
is a representation of the perceived brightness 
(luminosity) from the combination of the red, 
green, and blue channels. In other words, the 
luminance histogram tries to accurately reflect 
the light you see by weighting its color values 
in a particular way. Since the human eye sees 
green most easily, the luminance histogram is 
heavily weighted toward green.
Notice in the first image of figure 7.1 how 
the luminance histogram at the top (the white 
one) looks very similar to the green channel 
histogram below it. Red and blue are also repre-
sented in the luminance histogram but in lesser 
quantities (59 percent green + 30 percent red 
+ 11 percent blue = luminance). The luminance 
histogram measures the perceived brightness in 
256 levels (0–255).
The luminance histogram is a more accurate 
way of looking at the color levels in real images. 
Since it more accurately reflects the way our 
eyes actually see color brightness, it may be the 
best histogram for you to use. Now, let’s discuss 
the use of a histogram in detail.

Understanding a Histogram
Finding and using the histogram in your camera 
will guarantee a much higher percentage of 
well-exposed images. It is well worth spending 
time to understand it. I’ll cover this feature with 
enough detail to give you a working knowledge 
of how to use the histogram to make better pic-
tures. If you are deeply interested in histograms, 
there is a lot of research material available on 
the Internet. Although this overview is brief, it 
will present enough knowledge to improve your 
technique immediately.
I will concentrate on the luminance histo-
gram in this chapter. It is the best histogram for 
most photographers to use since it accurately 
reflects the way we see light. From this point 
forward, when you see the word “histogram,” 
realize that I am talking about the luminance 
histogram.
What Is the Basis for a Histogram?
When you take a picture, whether in JPEG, 
TIFF, or RAW mode (see chapter 6), the camera 
presents the luminance histogram based on its 
approximation of a JPEG image. In other words, 
the histogram is what the camera or computer 
would show for an 8-bit JPEG image (256 color 
levels per RGB channel).
When you take a JPEG picture, the camera 
crams all the light values of the RGB channels 
into 256 levels. The same thing happens when 
you take a picture in 8-bit TIFF mode. All the 
light values are reduced to 256 levels. When you 
shoot a RAW image, there are significantly more 
than 256 color values available. However, the 
camera still shows you a JPEG histogram when 
you are viewing a RAW image on the camera 
monitor. Most 12- or 14-bit RAW images can hold 
from 4,096 to 16,384 color levels per channel. 
However, all that color is represented by a histo-
gram that displays 256 color levels per channel.
In a way, this is a safety factor for RAW shoot-
ers. A RAW image has additional capacity to 
record light values within the brightest parts 
of the image (called highlight headroom). The 
camera does not show you the histogram based 
on the total capacity of the RAW image. It uses 
a JPEG image as the basis for the histogram. 
For 8-bit JPEG and TIFF shooters, the histogram 
gives you exactly what you see and nothing 
more.
Therefore, if you shoot mostly in JPEG or TIFF, 
be careful that the histogram is exactly right or 
you may have badly exposed images. For RAW 
shooters, the histogram underrepresents the 
actual highlight headroom you have available in 
the image; however, if you shoot for an accurate 
histogram anyway, you will have less noisy im-
ages, even in RAW format, because the limited 
exposure range of the JPEG-based histogram fits 
well within the headroom of a RAW image, re-
quiring less noise-inducing image manipulation 
later. A RAW shooter has more room to correct 
exposure errors since a greater range is avail-
able in the image than the histogram shows. As 
a RAW shooter, I always check the histogram for 
my best images.
Color of Luminance Histogram
Most cameras display the luminance histogram 
as a single-colored histogram. Many computer 
programs show the luminance histogram in 
color. Since most cameras show only a single 
color for the luminance histogram (often white 
or yellow), I will use a single color for the histo-
grams in this chapter.

Photoshop

If your camera presents the luminance histo-
gram in multiple colors, all the better. Don’t 
get a colored luminance histogram confused 
with individual RGB histograms. A colored lu-
minance histogram will not show a single RGB 
color channel; instead, it will mix all of the color 
channels together in one overlaid histogram 
(figure 7.2).
Light Range
Your camera sensor can record only a certain 
range of light values—about five to nine usable 
EV steps (stops). Unfortunately, many of the 
higher-contrast subjects we shoot can contain 
more than 12 stops of light values. This is quite a 
bit more than is possible to capture in a single 
exposure. It is important to understand how 
your camera records light so you can better con-
trol how the image is captured.        
Look at figure 7.3 closely. The gray rectan-
gular area represents an in-camera histogram. 
Examine it carefully! Think about it for a minute 
before reading on.
The histogram is a graph that represents the 
maximum range of light values your camera 
can capture in a JPEG image with 256 steps 
(0 represents pure black, and 255 represents 
pure white). The peaks between the edges of the 
histogram window represent the color values in 
the image. The values from just above 0 and just 
below 255 contain detail.
The histogram looks like a mountain peak, or 
a series of peaks, and the more there is of a par-
ticular color, the taller the peak. In some cases 
the graph will be rounder on top, and in other 
cases it will be flatter.
The left side of the histogram represents the 
maximum dark values that your camera can 
record. The right side represents the maximum 
brightness values your camera can capture. On 
either end of the histogram the light values con-
tain no detail. They are either completely black 
or completely white.
The height of the histogram (top of moun-
tain peaks) represents the amount of individual 
colors. You cannot easily control this value in-
camera, other than increasing the saturation of 
the colors, so it is for your information only.
We are mostly concerned with the left- and 
right-side values of the histogram since we have 
much greater control over those areas (dark ver-
sus light).
Simply put, the histogram’s left and right 
sides are related to the darkness and lightness 
of the image, and the top and bottom of the 
histogram (valleys and peaks) pertain to the 
amount of color information.
The left (dark) and right (light) directions 
are very important for your picture taking. If 
the image is too dark, the histogram will show 
that by clipping off the light values on the left; 
or if the image is too light, the right side will be 
clipped (or blown out). This will become easier 
to understand as we look at well-exposed and 
poorly exposed images. Check out the histogram

and overexposed

basic tutorial in figure 7.4, and then we’ll look at 
things in more detail.
When you see the three histograms next to 
each other, does it make more sense? See how 
the underexposed histogram is all the way to 
the left of the histogram window and is clipped 
midpeak? Then note how both edges of the 
well-exposed histogram just touch the edges of 
the histogram window. Finally, notice how the 
overexposed histogram is crammed and clipped 
on the right. Now let’s look at some histogram 
detail.
Histogram Shape
Figure 7.5 is well exposed with no serious prob-
lems. The entire light range of this particular 
image fits within the histogram window, which 
means that it’s not too light or too dark and 
will take very little or no adjustment to view or 
print. The image contains no more than four or 
five stops (EV steps) of light range. To finalize 
the image, I might increase the brightness in the 
trees a little, but otherwise it is a sound image 
with potential for immediate usage.
Compare the histogram in figure 7.6 to the 
histogram in figure 7.5. See how the histogram 
in figure 7.5 is not crammed against the dark 
value side (left of histogram window), as seen 
in the underexposed histogram in figure 7.6? In 
other words, the dark values are not clipped off 
on the left. This means that the camera recorded 
all the dark values in this image, with no loss of 
shadow detail.
Then look at the right (brightness) side of the 
histogram in figure 7.5 and note that it is not 
completely against the right side, although it is 
quite close. The image contains all the available 
light values. Everything in between is exposed 
quite well, with full detail. A histogram does 
not have to cover the entire window for the 
exposure to be good. When there is a very lim-
ited range of light, the histogram may be rather 
narrow.
The image in figure 7.5 is relatively bland, 
with smooth tone gradations, so it makes a nice 
smooth mountain-peak shaped histogram. This 
will not occur every time, since most images 
contain quite a bit more color information. Each 
prominent color will be represented by its own 
peak on the histogram. The most prominent col-
ors will have higher peaks, and the less promi-
nent colors will have lower or no peaks.
As we progress into images with more color 
or light information, we see that the histograms 
look quite different.

clipping

Look at the image in figure 7.6. This is an 
image that exceeds the range of the camera’s 
digital sensor. Notice that, overall, this image is 
dark and looks underexposed. The histogram is 
crammed to the left and is effectively clipped off. 
There are no gradual climbs like on a mountain 
range, from valley to peak and back to valley. 
Instead, the image intersects the left side in mid-
peak. It is clipped. This is an underexposed im-
age, and the histogram reflects that well.
The most important thing to understand 
when you see a histogram like the one in fig-
ure 7.6, with part of the peak clipped off on the 
left, is that some part of the image is significantly 
underexposed.
Now look at the image in figure 7.7. A larger 
aperture was used and more light was allowed 
in. We can now see much more detail. However, 
the range of light is too great for the imaging 
sensor, so it is clipped off on the highlight side 
(right). The dark values are not clipped; instead, 
the graph extends to the left edge but stops 
there.
The image in figure 7.7 shows more detail 
but is not professional looking and will win no 
awards. The range of light is simply too great to 
be recorded fully. Many of the details are overly 
light, which is indicated by the clipping on the 
right side. The most important thing to remem-
ber here is that when you see a histogram that 
is crammed all the way to the right and clipped, 
some part of the image is significantly too light. A 
portion of the image in figure 7.7 is recorded as 
pure white and is permanently gone, or blown 
out.
It is important that you try to center the his-
togram without clipping either edge. This is not 
always possible, as shown in figure 7.7, because 
the light range is often too great for the camera 
to record; therefore, the histogram can’t contain 
it. If you center the histogram, your images will 
be better exposed. If you take a picture and the 
histogram is shifted to the far left or right, you 
can reshoot the photograph and expose it more 
toward the other direction.
If there is too much light to center the his-
togram, you must decide which part of the im-
age is more important, the light or dark values, 
and expose for those values. Or you can use 
HDR imaging to shoot multiple images with 
different exposures and combine them in 
post-processing.
How Does the Eye React to Light Values?
The camera, with its imaging sensor and glass 
lenses, is only a weak imitation of our marvel-
ously designed eye and brain combination. 
There are very few situations in which our eyes 
cannot adjust to the available light range. There-
fore, as photographers, we are always seeking 
ways to record even half of what our eyes can 
see.
Since our eyes tend to know that shadows are 
black, and we expect that, it is usually better to 
expose for the highlights. If you see dark shad-
ows, that seems normal. We are simply not used 
to seeing light so bright that all detail is lost. An 
image exposed for the dark values—when there 
is too much light—may look very weird because 
most highlight detail is blown out.
Figure 7.7: Image with normal histogram shape and brightness 
or highlight clipping

125
SEC TIO N  O NE:  HISTO G R A M
Your eyes can see at least twice as much 
light range as your digital sensor can. The only 
time you will ever see light values so bright that 
detail is lost is when you are looking directly 
at an overwhelmingly bright light. Therefore, 
in a worst-case scenario, expose the image so 
the right side of the histogram just touches the 
right side of the window, and the image will 
look more normal.
Since the beginning of photography, we have 
always fought with only being able to record a 
limited range of light. However, with the digital 
camera and its histogram, we can now see a 
visual representation of the light values, and we 
can immediately approve the image, reshoot it 
with emphasis on lighter or darker values, or see 
that we must use a graduated neutral density 
filter (a filter that is dark on top and lighter to-
ward the bottom). In worst-case scenarios with 
stationary subjects, multiple-exposure HDR im-
age combinations can be used to capture all the 
light.
Computer Adjustment of Images
Looking at the image in figure 7.8, taken in mid-
day overhead sunshine, we see an example of 
a range of light that is too great to be captured 
by a digital sensor but is exposed in such a way 
that we can get a usable photo later.
Notice in the histogram at the top right of 
figure 7.8 how the dark values are clipped on the 
left, meaning dark detail is lost. However, look 
to the right side of the histogram and notice 
how the light values are not clipped. The camera 
recorded all the light values but lost some dark 
values.
Since our eyes see this as normal, this image 
looks OK. If we were standing there looking at 
the cabin, we would be able to see much more 
detail in the front porch area. But the camera 
just can’t record that much light range. If we 
want to get a bit more detail in the shadows 
than this image seems to contain, we can do it. 
Normally a camera does not give us enough 
control to add light values on the fly, so we use 
the histogram to get the best possible exposure 
and then adjust the image later in the computer. 
We need a way to take all this light and com-
press it into a more usable range.
In-Computer Image Post-Processing
We are now entering the realm of post-process-
ing (in-computer image manipulation). Look at 
the image in figure 7.9. This is the same image 
Figure 7.8: Correctly exposed picture, but with dark shadows, 
and the image histogram
Figure 7.9: Post-processed cabin picture and its histogram 
(in-computer manipulation)

126
CH APTER 7
HISTO G R A M,  COLO R  SPACE,  A N D  W HITE  BAL A N CE
as shown in figure 7.8, but it has been adjusted 
in Photoshop to cram more image detail into 
the histogram by compressing the midrange 
values. Notice that the entire histogram seems 
to be farther right, toward the light side. Also 
notice that the midrange peaks are basically 
gone. We removed a good bit of the midrange, 
but since there was already a lot of midrange 
available, the image did not suffer greatly.
How this computer post-processing is ac-
complished is outside the scope of this book, 
but it is not very hard. Buy a program such as 
Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Lightroom, 
or another fine graphics program designed for 
photographers. Your digital camera and com-
puter are a powerful imaging combination—a 
digital darkroom—where you are in control 
from start to finish, from clicking the shutter to 
printing the image.
Retreating from philosophy, let’s continue 
with our histogram exploration. The image in 
figure 7.9 looks more natural to us because it is 
closer to what our eyes can see. Notice in fig-
ure 7.9 how the histogram edge is just touching 
the highlight side of the histogram window. A 
small amount of light went to pure white, and 
you can see the very slightly blown out area on 
the peak of the cabin’s roof. Sometimes a very 
small amount of clipping does not seriously 
harm the image.
The photographer must be the judge. The 
greater apparent detail in this image is the re-
sult of compressing the midrange of the light 
values a bit in the computer. If you compress or 
make the midrange light values smaller, that 
will tend to pull the dark values toward the light 
side and the light values toward the dark side. 
Therefore, you will have more apparent detail in 
your image.
It is like cutting a section out of the middle 
of a garden hose. If you pull both of the cut 
ends together, the two outside ends will move 
toward the middle and the hose will be shorter 
overall. If you compress or remove the midrange 
of the histogram’s light values, both ends of the 
graph will move toward the middle. If one end 
of the graph is beyond the edge of the histo-
gram window (clipped), it will be less so when 
the midrange is compressed.
We are simply trying to make the histogram 
fit into the frame of its window. If we have to 
cut out some of the middle to bring both ends 
into the window, well, there is usually plenty 
in the middle to cut out, so the image rarely 
suffers.
Remember, this is done outside of the camera 
in a computer. You can’t really compress values 
from within the camera, but you need to be 
aware that it can be done in a computer so that 
you can expose accordingly with your histo-
gram. Then you will be prepared for later post-
processing of the image.
In most cases your images will benefit if you 
shoot in RAW mode. In a sense, a RAW digital 
image contains an adjustable range of light 
(more highlight headroom). With a RAW image 
you can use controls in your computer post-
processing software to select from the range of 
light from within the big RAW image file. Many 
photographers shoot in RAW mode most of 
the time and later convert their images to JPEG 
for usage. RAW mode simply gives you more 
control.
The manipulation of image light levels in 
computer post-processing is a detailed study 
in itself. It is part of having a digital darkroom. 
Learn to use your computer to tweak your im-
ages and you will produce superior image re-
sults. Even more importantly, learn to use your 
histogram to capture a nice image in the first 
place!
Your histogram is simply a graph that allows 
you to see how well your image is exposed. If 
there was too much light for the camera to cap-
ture, you can see that at a glance. If the histo-
gram is too far left, the image may be too dark; 
if it’s too far right, the image may be too light. If 
it’s clipped off on both ends, there is too much 

127
SEC TIO N  T W O: COLO R  SPACE
light for the camera to capture. Learn to use the 
histogram well and your images are bound to 
improve!
Use the Light Meter and Histogram Together
Your camera light meter should be used only to 
get the initial exposure. Then you can look at 
the histogram to see if the light range in the im-
age is contained within the limited range of the 
sensor. If it is clipped off to the right or the left, 
you may want to add or subtract light with your 
camera’s exposure compensation button or use 
HDR imaging.
Examine the light range in your histogram. 
Let your light meter get the exposure close and 
then fine-tune it with the histogram. Using both 
as a team will guarantee better exposures, espe-
cially if you are shooting in RAW mode.
Blown-Out Highlight Blink Mode
There is a special mode in many cameras for 
when there are blown-out highlights. It is called 
something like the highlight blink mode. Check 
your camera manual to see if your camera has 
this mode. It will cause the image to blink from 
white to black in the blown-out highlight areas. 
The area that blinks is a rough representation of 
a histogram with the highlight values clipped, 
and it is quite useful for quick reference. Using 
your camera’s light meter, histogram, and high-
light blink mode together is a very powerful 
way to control your exposures. With these three 
tools, you will have a very fine degree of control 
over image exposure.
Section Two: Color Space
Color spaces are an interesting and important 
part of digital photography. They help your im-
ages fit into a much broader range of imaging 
devices. Software, printers, monitors, and other 
devices recognize which color space is attached 
to your image and use it, along with other color 
profiles, to help balance the image to the cor-
rect output colors for the device in use. In other 
words, color spaces help match your image’s 
color to different display devices (monitors, 
printers, etc.) so they will display correctly.
The two color spaces available in most of 
today’s cameras have different ranges of color. 
The most common color spaces for DSLR and ILC 
cameras are sRGB and Adobe RGB.
Camera and Eye Compared
The range of color that a typical human can see 
is defined by a master color space used by the 
graphics industry, called CIELAB (figure 7.10). 
Most other color spaces are a subset of that 
master space.
For instance, the Adobe RGB color space cov-
ers about 50 percent of the CIELAB color space, 
and the sRGB color space covers only 35 per-
cent. That means your camera, when it is set to 
Adobe RGB, can capture about 50 percent of the 
colors your eyes can see. When it is set to sRGB, 
the camera can capture only about 35 percent 
of the colors you can see. Therefore, the color 
gamut (range of color) seen by a digital camera 
is only part of the color range the human eye 
can see. Remember the word gamut. You’ll see 
it often when you read about color range in 
cameras. Basically, the word is used to describe 
a particular range of colors. Adobe RGB has a 
wider color gamut. That means Adobe RGB gives 
your images access to significantly higher levels 
of color, especially cyan (light blue) and green.

128
CH APTER 7
HISTO G R A M,  COLO R  SPACE,  A N D  W HITE  BAL A N CE
Your camera allows you to access the color 
space setting in one of its menus. Refer to 
your camera manual to find this setting and 
select the most appropriate one for your style 
of shooting. In figure 7.11 you can see the color 
space selection for my Nikon. Your camera will 
have something similar.
Which Color Space Should I Choose?
Adobe RGB uses colors from a broader selection 
of the total color range—it has a wider gamut. 
So if you are taking images that might later be 
printed, Adobe RGB is often the best color space 
to use.
After a JPEG file is created—in a camera or a 
computer—the color gamut of both Adobe RGB 
and sRGB is compressed into the same number 
of color levels. A JPEG has only 256 levels for 
each of its color channels (red, green, and blue). 
However, since the Adobe RGB color space takes 
its colors from a wider spectrum, you will have a 
better representation of reality when there are 
many colors in your image.
If you shoot in RAW format often, you may 
want to consider using Adobe RGB to store the 
maximum number of colors in your image files 
for later use. Remember that a RAW image file 
can contain 4,096 levels of color per RGB chan-
nel in 12-bit mode and 16,385 levels in 14-bit 
mode, instead of 256 levels in an 8-bit JPEG file. 
Using Adobe RGB makes a lot of sense in RAW 
mode because of its capacity to contain more 
colors in a base storage medium.
There are some drawbacks to using Adobe 
RGB, though. The sRGB color space is widely 
used in home and superstore print and display 
devices. Even many commercial labs print in 
sRGB because so many point-and-shoot pho-
tographers bring their pictures to them in that 
format. If you try to print directly to some inkjet 
printers using the Adobe RGB color space, the 
colors may not be as brilliant as with sRGB.
If you aren’t going to post-process your im-
ages and plan to print them directly from your 
camera, you may want to use sRGB. If you shoot 
only JPEGs for computer display or Internet 
usage , it might be better to stay with sRGB for 
everyday shooting.

If you are a RAW shooter and regularly post-
process your images, you should consider using 
Adobe RGB. You will have a wider gamut of 
colors to work with, and you can make your im-
ages the best they can be. Later you can convert 
your carefully crafted digital images to print 
with a good color profile and get great results 
from inkjet printers and other printing devices. 
Here is a rough way to look at it:
 
f Many JPEG shooters use sRGB.
 
f Many RAW shooters use Adobe RGB.
This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but many peo-
ple use these settings according to their style 
of shooting. I use Adobe RGB most of the time 
since I shoot a lot of nature with a wide range 
of color. I want the most accurate color my cam-
era can give me. Adobe RGB has a wider range 
(gamut) of colors, so it can be more accurate 
when my subject also has a wide range of colors. 
However, if you are shooting JPEG snapshots, 
there is no need to worry about this. Leave the 
camera set to sRGB and have fun.
 
■
WHICH COLOR SPACE IS BEST FOR THE 
COMMERCIAL PRINTING INDUSTRY?
An important consideration for photog-
raphers who will be sending their work 
to companies that do serious commercial 
printing—such as book and magazine 
publishers—is that Adobe RGB maps very 
well to the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, 
and black) offset printing process. If you are 
shooting commercial work, you may want 
to seriously consider using Adobe RGB. Pho-
tographers are nearly always required to 
shoot in Adobe RGB for submission to stock 
photo agencies.
Section Three: White Balance
Back in the good old days photographers bought 
special rolls of film or used filters to meet the 
challenges of color casts that come from indoor 
lighting, overcast days, or special situations. 
Each type of light you shoot under has a particu-
lar Kelvin color temperature (tint). Your camera 
needs to know something about the color of the 
light your are shooting under so it can balance 
itself and keep white truly white and keep other 
colors accurate.
You can manually balance your camera’s 
colors with its white balance controls, or let the 
auto white balance system do it for you. For-
tunately, auto white balance does a great job 
for general shooting. However, discerning pho-
tographers learn how to use the white balance 
controls so they can achieve color consistency 
in special situations, such as when shooting a 
series of product shots where the color must re-
main consistent.
How Does White Balance Work?
Normally you will use white balance to adjust 
the camera so that whites are truly white and 
other colors are accurate under whatever light 
source you are shooting. You can also use the 
white balance controls to deliberately introduce 
color tints into your image for interesting spe-
cial effects (figure 7.12).
White balance color temperatures are exactly 
backwards from the Kelvin scale we learned in 
school for star temperatures. Remember that 
a red giant star is cool, and a blue-white star is 
hot. White balance color temperatures are back-
wards because the white balance system adds 
color to make up for a lack of a particular color 
in the light that is shining on your subject.
For instance, under fluorescent light, there is 
not enough blue light, which makes your sub-
ject appear greenish yellow. When blue is added, 
the image is balanced to a more normal 

130
CH APTER 7
HISTO G R A M,  COLO R  SPACE,  A N D  W HITE  BAL A N CE
appearance. White balance in cameras adds col-
ors to balance the camera for the current light 
source.
Another example is when you shoot on a 
cloudy, overcast day. The cool ambient light 
could cause the image to look bluish if left 
unadjusted. The auto white balance control in 
your camera sees the cool color temperature 
and adds some red to warm the colors a bit. 
A normal camera white balance on an overcast 
day might be about 6000 K (Kelvin), which will 
warm up the cool bluish look. We’ll discuss color 
temperature shortly.
Just remember, we use the real Kelvin tem-
perature range in reverse, and in photography 
reddish colors are warm and bluish colors are 
cool. Even though this is backwards from what 
we were taught in school, it fits our situation 
better. Just don’t let your astronomer friends 
convince you otherwise. To photographers, blue 
seems cool and red seems warm. Doesn’t cold 
snow look bluish white? Isn’t a beautiful sunset 
nice and warm?
Let’s examine how color temperature affects 
your images and then see how to adjust the 
camera to achieve those effects.
Color Temperature
The white balance for many cameras can range 
from a very cool 2500 K to a very warm 10000 K 
(some cameras have less range).
Figure 7.13 shows the same landscape picture 
with three color temperature settings. Notice 
how the image in the center (5000 K) is about 
right for normal sunlight, and the image on the 
left (2500 K) has a cool bluish cast and the one 
on the right (10000 K) has a warmer reddish 
cast.
The same adjustments we made with film 
and filters in the good old days can now be 
achieved with the white balance settings built 
into your camera. It should have several white 
balance settings with names like cloudy, shade, 
and fluorescent (and others, as shown in an up-
coming list).
To make a warmer-than-normal image, 
simply select the cloudy white balance setting 
while shooting in normal daylight. This sets the 
camera white balance to about 6000 K, which 
makes nice warm-looking images. If you really 
want to warm up the image, choose the white 
balance setting called shade, which sets the 
camera to about 8000 K. On the other hand, 
if you want to make the image appear cool or 
bluish, try using the fluorescent (4200 K) or in-
candescent (3000 K) settings in normal daylight.
Remember, the color temperature shifts 
from cool values to warm values. Your camera 
can capture images with various manual white 
balance settings. Some cameras can be set to 
any color temperature from 2500 K (very cool 
or bluish) to 10000 K (very warm or reddish) or 
any major value in between.
In the film days we had to carry different 
film emulsions or filters to deal with the color 
temperature ranges of light. Your digital camera 
has very easy-to-use color temperature controls 
and a full range of color temperatures.
Each camera has a certain way of setting 
white balance manually. When you use the 
manual controls and take your camera out of 
Figure 7.12: Image with different white balance settings

auto white balance mode, you have control 
over the way the camera will record the current 
color temperature of the ambient light. You can 
introduce color tints by deliberately setting the 
wrong white balance.
Figure 7.14 is a picture of a person taken in di-
rect sunlight with the camera set to fluorescent 
white balance. Since the camera added blue to 
the picture to adjust for a shortage of blue in flu-
orescent light, your picture will have too much 
blue because there is plenty of blue in sunlight.
Manual white balance settings are usually 
needed only when you must have consistent 
color from image to image or when you want 
to create special effects; otherwise, auto white 
balance will do fine for most people. Check your 
camera manual to learn how to manually adjust 
white balance.
You can choose preprogrammed white bal-
ance settings on most cameras. The names and 
number of white balance settings vary from 
camera to camera. Each of the white balance 
settings are designed for use under the type of 
light for which the setting is named. The set-
tings generally include the following:
 
f Auto: With this setting the camera will de-
cide what the correct white balance is for the 
scene it sees through the lens. It will adjust

the white balance for each picture you take, 
so you may not have consistent color. That is 
not a bad thing for most photography since 
the white balance will vary by only a few de-
grees Kelvin between each shot. Most people 
simply leave their cameras set to auto white 
balance.
 
f Incandescent: This type of lighting is gradu-
ally being phased out. The old standard in-
candescent light bulb gets hot and uses too 
much energy. Most people don’t realize that 
the light output of an incandescent bulb is 
rather orange, or warm. If you are shooting 
under incandescent light, your images may 
be objectionably warm, with orange skin 
tones and whites that are not white. Test 
your camera’s auto white balance ability un-
der incandescent light by shooting a picture 
of someone reading a book under an old-style 
light bulb. Look at the picture on your com-
puter and see if the pages of the book look 
reddish or orange. If not, your camera does a 
good job with incandescent light. If the pages 
look orange, you can manually set the camera 
to the incandescent white balance setting 
and take another shot. You should see a big 
improvement.
 
f Fluorescent: As mentioned earlier, fluores-
cent light has a deficit of blue, so your sub-
jects will come out looking greenish. If you 
take pictures of people under fluorescent 
light and they look a sickly green or yellow, 
set your camera to the fluorescent white 
balance setting and shoot again. The camera 
will add blue and the image will look more 
normal. Some cameras offer several fluores-
cent white balance settings because there are 
several types of fluorescent light.
 
f Sunlight: When you are shooting outside 
under direct sunlight, the color is somewhat 
neutral and tends to be warm. Using this set-
ting will balance your camera for shooting 
under direct sunlight.
 
f Flash: When you use a flash unit, whether 
it’s a popup unit built into your camera or an 
external unit mounted on your camera, you 
can set the white balance to flash and the 
camera will record consistent color for most 
flash units.
 
f Cloudy: On a cloudy or overcast day the light 
has a blue tint that can make images seem 
cool. When you set the camera to cloudy 
white balance, it adds red (warmth) to the 
image so it looks more natural. You can also 
use the cloudy setting (and many people do) 
when you want to warm up any of your im-
ages. Most people prefer the look of warm 
images. Some people even leave their white 
balance set to cloudy all the time. Usually 
those photographers grew up shooting day-
light film and using an 81A warming filter on 
their lenses all the time. I don’t recommend 
setting your camera to the cloudy white bal-
ance setting all the time because, in some 
instances, the extra-warm images will not 
look as good. For instance, if you are shooting 
pictures of people in evening sunset light, the 
ambient light is already very warm looking. If 
you add more warmth by setting the camera 
to cloudy white balance, your subjects’ skin 
may have a too-warm, reddish-orange look. 
Some photographers do not agree with me, 
but I don’t believe that one settings works for 
every picture, so I don’t leave my camera set 
to cloudy all the time. Experiment with the 
cloudy white balance setting under various 
light sources and see what you like.
 
f Shade or shady: Light in the shade is very 
blue, primarily because the warm light of the 
sun is not shining on the subject. If you set 
the camera to shady white balance, it will 
add a lot of warmth to the image.
 
f Kelvin or K: Not all cameras have this setting. 
It allows you to choose a specific Kelvin color 
temperature for your images. Most cameras 
that have this setting will let you choose 
from temperatures as cool as 2500 K to as 
warm as 10000 K.

133

f Measure or PRE: This setting has different 
names on various cameras. You can manu-
ally measure white balance with a gray card 
or white card and the camera will use that 
white balance setting for accurate color 
under that one light source. Manual white 
balance readings can be used anytime you 
think the camera is not handling the color 
consistently in auto white balance, and yet 
you are unsure what white balance setting 
to use (e.g., fluorescent, cloudy, or shade). For 
instance, are you sure a fluorescent bulb is 
cool white, or is it daylight, or maybe warm 
white? If you cannot accurately identify the 
color temperature of a particular light source, 
you can simply measure or read the light by 
letting it shine on a gray card or white card 
(available in camera stores or online) and 
then have your camera read the color tem-
perature from the light reflected off the card. 
Since the gray card or white card is a known 
color, the camera can balance itself so the 
gray or white is the correct color under the 
light source you are using. It will color bal-
ance the pictures so they do not have an odd 
tint. Figure 7.15 shows a gray card set like the 
one I use. I got mine from Michael Tapes at 
the following website: http://michaeltapes-
design.com/whibal.html
Figure 7.15: WhiBal gray card kit with various sizes
You don’t need to be overly concerned about 
adjusting your white balance often; however, 
when the circumstances require it, you should 
know how to manually white balance your 
camera. At the very least you need to under-
stand what the camera is doing when it is using 
auto white balance and learn to recognize when 
an image has bad white balance (tint in the 
picture).
 
■
WHITE BALANCE FUNDAMENTALS
Understanding white balance in a funda-
mental way is simply realizing that light has 
a range of colors that go from cool to warm. 
We can adjust our cameras to use the 
available light in an accurate and neutral, 
balanced way that compensates for the 
actual light source, or we can intentionally 
allow a color cast in our images by unbal-
ancing the settings.
If you decide to turn pro you will need a good 
understanding of white balance and should 
learn to do manual white balance readings from 
a gray card or white card. Check your camera 
manual to see if your camera requires either 
gray or white. Most use either, but some may 
accept only one color.
In any case, all enthusiast photographers 
should at least buy a cheap paper gray card, 
read their camera manual to find out how to 
manually set the white balance, and retain that 
knowledge for later use.
White Balance and RAW Mode
Should you worry about white balance settings 
if you shoot in RAW mode? After all, you can 
modify a RAW file after the fact.
The quick answer is no, but that may not be 
the best answer. When you take a picture us-
ing RAW mode, data is written to the memory 
card with no white balance, sharpening, or color 

134
CH APTER 7
HISTO G R A M,  COLO R  SPACE,  A N D  W HITE  BAL A N CE
saturation information applied. Instead, the in-
formation about the picture’s settings are stored 
as markers along with the raw black-and-white 
sensor data. Color information is permanently 
applied to the image when you post-process it 
and save it to another format, like JPEG or TIFF.
When you open the image in a RAW conver-
sion program, the camera settings are applied 
to the data in a temporary way so you can view 
the image on your computer screen. If you do 
not like the color balance, or any other setting 
you used in-camera, you can simply change it in 
the conversion software and the image looks as 
if you used the new setting when you took the 
picture.
Does that mean I am not concerned about 
my white balance settings since I shoot RAW 
most of the time? No. The human brain can 
quickly adjust to the colors in an image and 
perceive them as normal, even when they are 
not. This is one of the dangers of not using the 
correct white balance. Since an unbalanced im-
age on your computer screen is not compared to 
another correctly balanced image side by side, 
there is some danger that your brain may accept 
the slightly incorrect camera settings as normal 
and your image will be saved with a color cast.
As a rule of thumb, if you use your white bal-
ance correctly at all times, you will consistently 
produce better images. You will do less post-pro-
cessing if the white balance is correct in the first 
place. As RAW shooters, we already have a lot of 
post-processing work to do. Why add white bal-
ance corrections to the workflow? It is just more 
work, if you ask me!
Additionally, you might decide to switch to 
JPEG mode in the middle of a shoot, and if you 
are not accustomed to using your white balance 
controls, you’ll be in trouble. When you shoot 
JPEGs, your camera will apply the white balance 
information directly to the image and save it on 
your memory card—permanently. Be safe; al-
ways use good white balance technique!
White Balance Ambient Light Reading Tip
When you measure ambient light with a gray 
card or white card, keep in mind that your cam-
era does not need to focus on the card. In white 
balance ambient light reading mode—or what-
ever your camera calls this mode—it will not 
focus anyway since it is only trying to read color 
temperature values, not take a picture.
The important thing is to put your lens close 
enough to the card to prevent it from seeing 
anything other than the card. The correct dis-
tance for most lenses is three or four inches 
(about 75 to 100 mm) away from the card.
Be careful that your lens does not cast a 
shadow onto the card in a way that lets your 
camera see some of the shadow. This will make 
the measurement less accurate. Also, be sure 
that your source light does not produce glare on 
the card. This is not a common problem because 
most gray cards have a matte surface; however, 
it can still happen. You may want to hold the 
card at a slight angle to the source light if the 
light is particularly bright and might cause 
glare.
Finally, when the light is dim, use the white 
side of the card (if your camera supports white) 
since it has more reflectivity. This may prevent 
a bad reading in low light. The gray card may be 
more accurate for color balancing, but it might 
be a little dark for a good measurement in dim 
light. If you are shooting in normal light and 
your camera supports it, a gray card is best for 
color balancing. You might want to experiment 
in normal light with your camera to see which 
you prefer.
With these simple ideas and some practice, 
you can become a histogram, color space, and 
white balance expert. Pay extra attention to the 
histogram and learn to use it well. It will mark 
you as a true digital photographer.

Afterword
Although there is a lot more for you to learn 
over the years as you become more advanced 
in photography, the principles offered in this 
book provide a base to build upon—a good, 
solid foundation to learn more advanced things. 
Make sure you are comfortable with everything 
in this book before you move on to other sub-
jects. Talk with other photographers, ask ques-
tions, and read blogs, articles, and more books.
I am available to help you and will be writ-
ing additional books on more advanced photo-
graphic subjects. If you have a question or want 
to know more about my books, daily blog, or 
streaming Kindle blog, drop by my website at 
www.PhotographyWriter.com. There is a contact 
link on my website, and I hope you’ll use it. I 
want to stay in touch with my readers. Thank 
you for sticking with me all the way through 
this book. I hope it has helped you have a better 
understanding of some of the basic principles 
of photography. Remember, you are an enthusi-
ast—one of the chosen few. You are what drives 
the photography of the world.
Keep on capturing time...
