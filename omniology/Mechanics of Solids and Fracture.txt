Preface
PREFACE
The level of knowledge content given in this book is designed for the students who have 
completed elementary mechanics of solids for stresses and strains associated with various 
geometries including simple trusses, beams, shafts, columns, etc. At the successful completion 
of understanding the content provided, the students will be able to reach a stage where 
they can do self-directed learning at any further advanced level in the area of mechanics of 
solids. The emphasis is given on the fundamental concepts for students to quickly follow 
through for an advanced level if required in the future. Fracture mechanics is included in 
this book with necessary preliminary steps for those who might have had difficulties with 
the subject in the past.
The essence of mechanics of solids is lies in stress-strain analysis ultimately for the fail-safe 
design of structural components. It is important to keep in mind that such analysis would 
be useless without various criteria for yielding, failure, fracture, and fatigue. Materials 
behaviour is more complex than some students might think. Materials fail sometimes at 
higher or lower stress than the stress calculated. Some materials are more sensitive in failure 
to stress concentration than some other materials. They fail sometimes in a ductile manner 
and some other times in a brittle manner. The ductility of a material is not only a material 
property but also is affected by its geometry and loading condition. One approach would 
be applicable to some particular cases while the other approach is more appropriate for 
some other cases.
Engineering practitioners will be able to find this book useful as well for the fail-safe design, 
and for a way of thinking in making engineering decisions. 
This book owes to the Lecture Notes developed for many years in the past. I would like to 
thank Ms Carol Walkins of the Univerity of Newcastle, Callaghan, for typing in earlier years. 
I am grateful to Mr Kam Choong Lee of PSB Academy in Singapore for the feedback on 
Lecture Notes before I transformed that into this textbook, and for further proofreading of 
the manuscript. Also, thanks go to Ms Haleh Allameh Haery of the University of Newcastle, 
Callaghan, for assisting with some graphic material, invaluable feedback and proofreading.

STRESS AT A POINT
The stress components on a cubical element may be useful for describing fundamental relations 
with reference to the coordinate system. The cubical element is one of building blocks constituting 
the elastic body. Figure 1.1 (a) shows a body subjected to normal uniform stress distribution. 
The body is assumed to consist of infinite number of cubical elements. Figure 1.1 (b) shows 
one of cubes, representing a point in the body, in which nine stress components are used to 
describe a stress state in terms of location, magnitude and direction:

The first subscript of each stress component indicates plane and the second direction. The 
nine stress components can be reduced to six components because some of stress components 
are equal. This can be found by taking the summation of the moments (SM) about z-axis, 
y-axis and x-axis:
6Mz=0  for z- axis,
Wxy('y 'z) 'x = Wyx  ('x'z) 'y  
(1.1)
and therefore Wxy=Wyx.
Similarly for x and y axes, Wyz =Wzy  and Wzx = Wxz..  Consequently, the state of stress at a point can 
be now described by six components: Vx, Vy, Vz,Wxy, Wxz, Wyz.

Figure 1.2 Stress components on a tetrahedron.
When a body subjected to external forces, a range of different planes may considered for 
stress analysis. The planes where no shearing stresses but normal stresses exist are called 
the principal planes. The normal stress on each principal plane is referred to as the principal 
stress. Figure 1.2 shows the principal stress on area JKL as a result of choosing the coordinate 
system in a particular orientation and for a particular position. 
Let cosT1  = l, cosT3  = m and cosT3  = n. The areas on the tetrahedron are found in relation 
with A or area JKL:
Area K0L = Al (or = A cosT1) 
Area K0J = Am
Area J0L = An.
The principal stress (s) in Figure 1.2 may be related with the stress components by taking 
the summation of the forces in x, y and z directions:
6Fx=0, 
(V - Vx)Al - WyxAm - WzxAn = 0 

As seen in Equation (1.2e), I1, I2  and I3  are not functions of direction cosines. They are 
independent of the coordinate system location and therefore they are called the invariants.

STRESSES ON OBLIQUE PLANE
Any other planes than the principal planes may be called the oblique planes in which always 
shear stress exists when subjected to external forces [Figure 1.3 (a)]. The total stress (S) on 
the oblique plane can be resolved into three components (Sx,  Sy , and Sz ) [Figure 1.3 (b)] and
S2= Sx2 +Sy2+Sz2 

Vn = Sx l + Sym + Szn

Therefore, the shear stress is found as a function of principle (normal) stresses (V1, V2,,  
and V3)):
W2 = (V1-V2)2 l2 m2 + (V1-V3)2 l2 n2 + (V2-V3)2 m2 n2 .

Figure 1.5 Rubber modified epoxy showing cavities on fracture 
surface. The arrow indicates fracture propagation direction and 
the bar represents 10 μm. [After Kim and Ma, 1996] 1
In general, the deformation of an element consists of volume and shape changes. The volume 
change is a result of proportional change in element edge lengths. In contrast, the shape 
change is a result of disproportional change in element edge lengths as well as element 
corner angle change. The former is associated with volumetric modulus (K ) and hydrostatic 
stress (or mean stress) while the latter is associated with shear modulus (G ) and shear 
stress. For example, the hydrostatic stress creates cavities during deformation as shown in  
Figure 1.5 or increases the brittleness while shear stress contributes to the material flow. 
The total stress for deformation consists of hydrostatic stress and stress deviator i.e.
Total stress = Hydrostatic (or mean) stress (Vm) + Stress deviator.
The hydrostatic stress or mean stress is defined as

STRESS AND STRAIN
tensile loading (V1) with V2=V3=0.  If V3  varies from zero to -50MPa (compressive stress), the 
principal shear stresses (W1  and W2) increase and becomes a state of stress where hydrostatic 
stress is zero as given in Figure 1.7 (b), resulting in more chances for material flow or 
high ductility than that of the case in Figure 1.7 (a) because of the increase in shear 
stress. Figure 1.7 (c) is the limiting case where the three circles reduces to a point where 
V1=V2=V3=50MPa  and the three principle shear stresses are zero. In this case, no material 
ductility is possible in the absence of stress deviator. Therefore, it is theoretically possible to 
have a stress state where the hydrostatic stress component exists without the stress deviator. 
Examples for the state of stress where relatively large principal shear stresses are involved are 
found in various processes in metal forming (e.g. wire drawing through a die) involving 
lateral compressive stresses and a longitudinal tensile stress. Also, some localized deformation 
of reinforcing particles on fracture surfaces of advanced materials is caused by such a state 
of stress involving large shear stresses as shown in Figure 1.8.
Figure 1.8 Fracture surface of hollow microsphere reinforced epoxy 
under plane strain in the vicinity of initial crack tip. Each hollow-
microsphere experienced a tensile stress in the direction perpendicular 
to the fracture surface and simultaneously lateral compressive 
stresses. The crack propagation direction is from top to bottom. The 
scale bar represents 100 μm. [After Kim, 2007] 2

STRAIN AT A POINT
As previously discussed, the deformation is due to the volume and shape change. We need 
to define the displacement components. When a point P moves to P' in coordinates x, y, z 
as shown in Figure 1.9, respective u, v and w are called displacement components. To find 
a general form of strain, let us consider first the length change using an element subjected 
to a load in the x-direction as shown in Figure 1.10. When the load is applied, the solid 
line becomes the dashed line. Accordingly, A moves to A'  and B moves to B'  and the x 
direction normal strain of the infinitesimal segment is given by

For further displacement derivatives, let us consider a shape change using an element in the

The elastic stress (σ) is linearly related to elastic strain (ε) by means of the modulus of 
elasticity (E) for the isotropic materials:

This relation is known as the Hooke’s law.

Figure 2.1 Deformation of an element subjected to a tensile force. 
A tensile force in the x direction causes an extension of the element in the same direction. 
Simultaneously it also causes a contraction in the y and z directions (see Figure 2.1). The 
ratio of the transverse strain to the strain in the longitudinal direction is known to be 
constant and called the Poisson’s ratio, denoted by the symbol v.

The proportional constant G is the modulus of elasticity in shear, or the modulus of rigidity. 
Values of G are usually determined from a torsion test.
Another elastic constant is the bulk modulus or the volumetric modulus of elasticity (K ). The 
bulk modulus is the ratio of the hydrostatic stress or the hydrostatic pressure to the volume 
strain that it produces

where i and j are free indexes, k  is a dummy index, and Gij  is the Kronecker delta i.e.
Gij = 1 if  i = j
Gij = 0 if  i z j. 
The free index assumes a specified integer that determines all dummy index values. The 
dummy index takes on all the values of its range. Upon expansion, Equation (2.14) gives 
three equations for normal stress and six equations for shear stress using indexes for a range 
of x, y and z. Equation (2.14) may be expanded in a matrix form:

PLANE STRESS AND PLANE STRAIN
Plane stress or plane strain is a state of stress/strain (Figure 2.2). An example is given for 
plane stress in Figure 2.2 (a), in which two of the faces of the cubic element are free of 
any stress. Another example is given for plane strain in Figure 2.2 (b), which occurs to the 
situations where the deformations take place within parallel planes. In practice, the plane 
strain often occurs internally within a structural component in which stress distribution is 
non-uniform when stress raisers such as rivet hole and notch are present whereas the plane 
stress occurs on its surfaces. 
For a case of plane stress (V3  = 0 or Vz  = 0), Equation (2.3) becomes

Now, we started with 36 elastic constants as given in Equation (2.37), but as a result of 
analysis, these can be reduced to 21 independent elastic constants.

ELASTIC PROPERTIES DEPENDANT ON ORIENTATION
The elastic properties such as elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio may be characterised by a 
set of planes of symmetry in a particular orientation. Each plane of symmetry is defined as 
a plane to which elastic properties are symmetric. A material having an infinite number of 
sets of such planes in any orientation is called an isotropic material and otherwise is called 
an anisotropic material.

One of the important classes of engineering materials is one that has three mutually 
perpendicular orientations for respective three sets of planes of symmetry. Materials in such a 
class are called the orthotropic materials (see Figure 2.4). Examples for orthotropic materials 
include unidirectional fibre reinforced laminates and highly textured cold rolled metal 
sheets. For orthotropic materials, constants Sij in Equation (2.37) and Cij  in Equation (2.38) 
reduces to

respectively. Thus, the stress-strain relations for an orthotropic material are given by
H11 = C11V11 + C12V22 + C13V33 
H22= C12V11 + C22V22 + C23V33 
H33= C13V11 + C23V22 + C33V33 
J23 = C44 V23

or 
Hx = C11Vx + C12Vy + C13Vz 
Hy= C12Vx + C22Vy + C23Vz 
Hz= C13Vx + C23Vy + C33Vz 
Jyz = C44 Wyz   
Jxz = C55 Wxz 
Jxy = C66 Wxy 
 
(2.41b)
The constants in Equation (2.41) can be related to elastic moduli and Poisson’s ratios or 
directly determined by conducting the tests. For example, stress components for a uni-axial 
tensile test in the x-direction are given by: Vx z 0, Vy = 0, and Vz = 0. From Equation (2.41), 
Hx = C11Vx = 
x
E
1 Vx,       Hy= C12Vx,
Hz= C13Vx.

Another class of materials are transversely isotropic. When two of three sets of symmetry 
planes for the orthotropic properties become an infinite number of sets, the properties are 
called transversely isotropic. Figure 2.5 illustrates an example for a transversely isotropic material 
using a unidirectional fibre reinforced composite. Therefore, Ex=Ez, Gyz=Gxy, and Qyz =Qxy. .

The plates are meant to be subjected to the bending loads. Some examples for the use of 
plates include pressure vessel end caps and piton heads. An analysis can be conducted for 
the axi-symmetric loading with the benefit of the circular geometry. The analysis is based 
on the linear stress distribution across the thickness. For a circular plate (Figure 3.1), x in

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

At r = 0, the slope (θ) at the centre is zero and therefore C2 = 0  if the slope (θ ) is not to 
approach infinity near the centre of the plate.
Again, if the centre of the circular plate is taken as the origin of the coordinate system, 
deflection y = 0 at r = 0 and therefore C3=0
To determine C1, we consider that the bending moment (Mr) is zero at any free support 
(r = R0). From

To determine the integration constants in Equations (3.24) and (3.25) for a case where a 
circular plate with edges freely supported is subjected to a load (F ) round a circle as given 
in Figure 3.13, the boundary conditions may be considered with:

There will be two sets of integration constants because of the discontinuity between two 
parts. For the inner part of the circular plate, r < R1, p = F = 0. From Equation (3.25), the 
deflection (y) is found to be

(3.42b)
If the centre of the circular plate is taken as the origin of the coordinate system, deflection 
y = 0 at r = 0 and therefore C3=0. For non-infinite slope at the centre, C2 =0.
Thus, the deflection (y) for the inner part of the circular plate (r < R1),

and

Now, four constants (
1
C ,
1
Cc ,
2
Cc , and 
3
Cc) need to be determined and we need to find four 
simultaneous equations. Inner and outer plate parts are common at r = R1 for deflection  
(y) and slope (θ). Accordingly, equating Equation (3.43a) to Equation (3.43b), and Equation 
(3.43b) to Equation (3.44b), two of the four simultaneous equations are found:

FUNDAMENTALS FOR THEORY 
OF ELASTICITY
In the elementary mechanics of solids, assumptions are used for simplification before 
arriving at solutions. For example, a linear stress distribution is assumed for a beam or a 
shaft. In the theory of elasticity, however, the stress distribution is to be found by satisfying 
the equilibrium equations, compatibility equations, and boundary conditions without such 
assumptions. It is a mathematical process.

Figure 4.1 (a) A body subjected to external forces. (b) One of the elements where stress varies from 
one face to another.
For the stress variation within a elastic body [Figure 4.1(a)], let us consider one of the stress 
elements given in Figure 4.1(b). To find the equilibrium equations, we need to consider the 
forces acting on the element. The forces are found by multiplying the stress on any face by 
the surface area. Also, we need to consider a body force though the centroid of the element 
and having components X, Y, Z per unit volume. Taking the summation of forces in the x, 
y, z directions results in the following differential equations of equilibrium:

where W is called the potential function. The body forces are to deal with gravitational forces, 
magnetic forces and/or inertia forces. The force of one body acting on another by a direct 
contact is the surface force. It may be noted that the equilibrium Equations (4.1–4.3) do not 
provide a relationship between the stresses and the external loads, although they give the 
rate of change of the stresses at any point in the body. One of the requirements to establish 
such a relationship is that the deformation continuity of each element must be preserved. 
This means that the displacement in components must be continuous and single-valued 
functions. Certain relationships between the strain components must be satisfied to meet 
the requirement. These relationships are called the equations of compatibility. The relationship 
between the stresses and the external loads is required to also satisfy the boundary conditions.
To derive the equations of compatibility, let us consider the strain-displacement relations 
previously given in Equation (1.18):

with respect to y and Equation (b) twice with respect to x and Equation (d) once with 
respect to x and then once with respect to y results in the following compatibility equation,

AIRY’S STRESS FUNCTION
As discussed, to find equations for stress distribution on a solid body, any candidate equations 
are required to satisfy the boundary conditions, equilibrium equations and compatibility 
equations. This procedure can be simplified using the Airy’s stress function (F) which is 
defined by the following three equations:

The three equations above containing the Airy stress function (F) satisfy the equilibrium 
equations for two dimensional cases. Thus, the procedure for finding equations for stress 
distribution involves finding the Airy stress function (F) and satisfying the compatibility 
equations. The compatibility equations and Airy stress function (F) will be further discussed 
in relation with plane stress and plane strain.

When there are no body forces, the same biharmonic equation as that for plane stress is 
obtained as
4) = 0.  
(4.24d)
Therefore, to find the equation for a stress distribution, we need to find an Airy’s stress 
function with the biharmonic equation satisfied.
The following is an example for using the Airy stress function to find equations for stress 
distribution. A case is given in Figure 4.2, in which the pressure p varies along the bar. The 
stress function Φ = By3  may be considered for it (B is a constant). It is found that The stress 
function satisfies the biharmonic equation (

FUNDAMENTALS FOR Theory of elasticity
Equation (4.27e) may be practically useful in conjunction with photo-elastic stress analysis 
for finding stress values.
Photoelasticity has been used as an experimental method for finding stress distributions on 
various geometries. It is based on a material property called birefringence (double refraction) 
which reacts to stresses. In practice, there are two types of patterns on the model for stress 
analysis may be used –isoclinic and isochromatic. As shown in Figure 4.3(a), an isochromatic 
is the locus of the points, along which the difference between major and minor principal 
stresses is constant while an isoclinic is a locus of points at which the principle stresses are 
all in the same direction.The loci appear on the photoelastic model in a form of lines called 
fringes – isoclinics appear in black and isochromatics in other colours as shown in Figure 4.3(b).

When a ray of plane polarized light pass through a photo-elastic material model, it resolves 
along the two principal stress directions and each of these components experiences different 
refractive indices as they travel at different velocities within the model. When the light 
comes through the analyzer (Figure 4.4), the phase difference or relative retardation (R) in 
wave lengths between the two resolved rays is given by3

Figure 4.4 A photoelasticity arrangement to view a fringe pattern on the model. The fringe pattern 
viewed is due to the plane polarized light. Each fringe is a locus of isochromatic points at which the 
difference between two principal stresses or the maximum shear stress is constant.
When a material of birefringence is stressed, fringes are created. Fringes for stress may be 
similar to contour lines on a map where a close spacing between contour lines indicates a 
high slope and vice versa. Each fringe line is a locus of points of constant difference between 
the major (σ1 ) and minor (σ2 ) principal stresses and can be used for stress calculation using

In practice, the variables in Equation (4.28d) can be measured from the photo-elastic 
experiment and then stress at any point can be calculated according to Equation (4.27e).
Further, the stress distribution for a three- dimensional model or real component can be 
obtained using the same theory if reflective surface and photo-elastic coating are used as 
shown in Figure 4.6.

the radial compressive stresses are offset and, as a result, no stress exists on the circumferential 
surface and the circle is equivalent to a finite disk as shown in Figure 4.12. Therefore, the 
stress distribution within the disk can be calculated by superimposing the two equal tensile 
radial stresses on the previous stress distribution in the circle.

horizontal diametral section of the circular disk subjected to a force P [Figure 4.14(a)]. The

LINEAR ELASTIC STRESS FIELD IN CRACKED BODIES

LINEAR ELASTIC STRESS FIELD IN 
CRACKED BODIES
Most engineering materials contain small cracks or defects produced during service or 
manufacturing. When an engineering component is fractured, new surfaces are created. They are 
caused by the rupture of atomic bonds due to high local stresses. The phenomenon of fracture 
may be approached at different scales. As the crack size decreases, smaller scale analyses would 
be required. At a small scale for some cases, the phenomena of interest may be considered 
within distances of the order of 10-7 cm so that the problem is studied using the concepts of 
uncertainty. However, as the crack size increases, the material behaviour based on continuum 
mechanics may be more appropriate. The complex nature of cracking behaviour prohibits a 
unified approach of the problem, and the existing theories deal with the subject from either 
the microscopic or the macroscopic point of view. In this chapter, the linear elastic stress 
analysis for cracked bodies will be introduced as part of the continuum mechanics. 
Mode I  
 
Mode II  
 
Mode III 
Figure 5.1 The three modes of cracking.
When we consider a two-dimensional crack extending through the thickness of a flat plate, 
three different cracking modes need to be defined by the loading position and direction. 
These three basic modes are illustrated in Figure 5.1, which presents three types of relative 
displacements of the crack upper and lower surfaces. Mode I, mode II and mode III are 
also called opening mode, shearing mode and tearing mode respectively. Some practical loading 
examples of testing for such modes are given in Figure 5.2.

The stress intensity factors (K I, KII and KIII) given above are for an infinity body. Obviously, 
the finite size of the cracked body is expected to have an influence upon crack tip stress field. 
Accordingly, the expressions for the stress intensity factor have to be modified to account 
for this effect. A more general expression for the stress intensity factor may take the form:
K
Y
a
 V S  
(5.15)
where Y is a factor which accounts for geometric effect and Y  1 for an infinite plate.

(5.18)
Equation (5.18) descirbes that the stress intensity factor decreases for increasing crack size 
at a constant P. It is therefore possible that a crack can be arrested after some growth when 
its stress intensity factor falls below a critical value (K Ic). 
The superposition principle can be used to calculate the stress intensity factor if the same 
stress field equations are applicable for mode I cases or mode II cases or mode III cases. 
However, it is not permitted for a combination of different fracture modes because of 
different stress fields.
As an example for the calculation of a stress intensity factor, let us consider the case of a 
crack with an internal pressure. Figure 5.5(a) shows a plate without a crack under uni-axial 
tension and hence the stress intensity factor KIa  0. The stress distribution in Figure 5.5(a) 
may be equivalent to a case given in Figure 5.5(b) where a crack with a length of 2a  is 
made at the centre of the plate and an external stresses (σ) are applied to the crack edges.

Further examples for the determination of stress intensity factor will follow. For cracks 
emanating from a loaded rivet hole (Figure 5.6), it can now be derived using the superposition 
principle. The hole is assumed to be small with respect to the crack. The case given in 
Figure 5.6(a) is broken up into components (b), (d) and (e). The components (b) and 
(d) can be obtained first with satisfied equilibrium conditions, and then component (e) 
is found to take away the stress (σ) and force (P) used for the equilibrium in (b) and (d) 
respectively. Accordingly, the stress intensity factor (

Crazing is a phenomenon which occurs in polymers when crack-like discontinuities are 
formed, in which fibrils connect the two faces of the crack. The restraining of the faces

To calculate the craze zone size (

model given in Figure 5.9, we need to find a condition for it. It can be supposed that 
the crazes grow as the load increases but cease to grow at a stage where no further craze 
stress increases i.e. the craze stress and length remain constant at V c. Therefore, the critical 
condition is found to be

The relationship between applied stress and craze length at the critical condition is shown 
in Figure 5.10 for both approximated and true values. There is very rapid change in a  for 
s greater than about 0.8sc. Dugdale7 conducted an experiment and found that there is a

LINEAR ELASTIC STRESS FIELD IN CRACKED BODIES

SEMI-ELLIPTICAL CRACK
The semi-elliptical crack resembles a surface crack occurring in practice (Figure 5.11). 
A three-dimensional geometry is useful involving crack depth (a), crack length (2c) and 
thickness of plate (B ) to model a semi-elliptical part-through crack. An empirical stress 
intensity factor9 subjected to a remote stress (σ) is given by

(5.34)
where Me, is called an elastic magnification factor on stress intensity, and Q is an elastic 
shape factor for an elliptical crack. Me and Q are functions of a/B and a/c; plots of the 
factor M
Q
e
 are given in Figure 5.11(b). It is found that long, shallow cracks have high 
M
Q
e
 values increasing with a/B whereas short, deep cracks have essentially constant low

Q
e
 values. Equation (5.34) may be useful in the design of pressure vessels. 
5.6	
‘LEAK-BEFORE-BURST’ CRITERION
The safety may be one of the most important factors for consideration in the pressure 
vessel design. There are two different possibilities in pressure vessel failure process. When 
the fracture toughness of a material chosen is sufficiently high and the growing surface 
crack reaches the other external surface, the pressure vessel starts to leak before it bursts 
(Figure 5.12 (a)). However, if the fracture toughness is low and the growing crack reaches 
its critical value (KIC)  before it leaks, the pressure vessel would burst. 
We may consider crack geometry and fracture toughness for ‘leak before burst’ design. One 
of the conditions to be satisfied for design is 
a > B
as given in Figure 5.12 (b). Another condition is that fracture toughness should be 
sufficiently high. We can find a ‘leak before burst’ criterion from Equation (5.34) satisfying 
the conditions:

Consider an infinite plate (for plane stress) with fixed ends containing a crack size (a) as shown 
in Figure 5.13.Two different stages are shown – before and after crack length increment

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

FRACTURE CRITERIA FOR MIXED MODE LOADING
In mechanics of solids, various criteria are used for yielding, failure, and fracture. The 
fracture criteria to be introduced here are those involving the stress intensity factor for 
mode I and mode II.

The stress fields under mode I and mode II loading can be characterised by stress intensity 
factors

under mixed mode loading, fracture must be assumed to occur when a certain combination 
of the two stress intensity factors reaches a critical value.
One of the fracture criteria is based on an energy balance principle. According to the energy 
conservation, the total energy release rate (Gt)  is the sum of individual contributions for 
I – II mixed mode loading and assumed to be a constant:

This is depicted in Figure 5.14. However, Equation (5.42) is problematic if KIc z KIIc. In 
practice, unfortunately KIc z KIIc  is the case, indicating the energy consumption for creating 
fracture surfaces under mode I loading is different from that under mode II loading. Also, it 
is usually observed that crack extension under mode II loading takes place at an angle with 
respect to the original crack direction. The fracture condition is then empirically modified 
to satisfy the condition KIc z KIIc:

Another criterion proposed by Erdogan and Sih10 is based on the postulation that crack 
growth occurs in a direction perpendicular to the maximum principal stress to derive the 
fracture condition under mixed loading.

x- directions respectively at infinity. We need to find stresses for mode I and mode II to use 
the fracture criterion under mixed mode loading. To this end, we need to find the stress

ONE-DIMENSIONAL PLASTIC ZONE SIZE ESTIMATION
The elastic stress field around the crack tip is very high so that a cracked body is usually 
accompanied by plastic deformation and non-linear effects. There are, however, cases where 
the extent of plastic deformation and the non-linear effects are very small compared to the 
crack size. In such cases, the linear elastic theory is still validly used to address the problem 
of stress distribution in the cracked body. The elastic stress field solutions discussed in the 
previous chapter show a stress singularity exists at the tip of a crack i.e. the stress approaches 
infinity. However, the stress in the vicinity of a crack tip, in reality, is limited to a yield 
stress when subjected to loading, and deform plastically. A simplistic estimate of the size 
of the plastic zone can be made, whether in plane strain or in plane stress. Let us consider 
first a plane stress case for a one-dimensional horizontal extent of plastic zone, which occurs 
on the surface of a plate.

One can realise that the stress (V y) cannot increases in a real material beyond the yield 
stress (Vys)). Accordingly, the corresponding distance from the crack tip (
pr ) to the yield stress 
(Vys)) may be used as a simplistic estimate for the plastic zone size. Substituting θ = 0, Vy =Vys  
and

Figure 6.2 Modified one-dimensional plastic zone size
In this calculation, though, the hatched area in Figure 6.1 is ignored. If we compensate 
for the loss of the hatched area, the actual plastic zone size must be larger than 
pr  [see 
Equation (6.1a)]. Such shortcomings may be reduced if the material immediately ahead of 
the plastic zone (
pr ) is allowed to carry some more stress by introducing an effective crack 
size (aeff)11 which is longer than the physical crack length (a ). To this end, the crack tip 
position can be shifted for calculation. Then, the effective crack size becomes aeff = a+G  where 
d is the length contributed by the hatched area as shown in Figure 6.2. Accordingly, the 
plastic zone is calculated by adding l and d together. The distance l is found by replacing 
a  with a +d in calculation using Equation (5.11b):

Similarly, the Tresca yield (or maximum shear stress) criterion may be employed for the two-

shown non-dimensionally in Figure 6.3(b). The difference is seen between Von Mises and 
Tresca plastic zone shapes and sizes. The Tresca plastic zone size appears slightly larger than 
Von Mises plastic zone size.

THREE DIMENSIONAL SHAPE OF PLASTIC ZONE 
The three dimensional plastic zone around a crack tip may be theoretically estimated when 
the plane strain condition exists for a thick plate. The plane stress condition is, also, applicable 
depending on how far the location of interest is away from the plate surface. The plane stress 
exists at the surface of the plate if the surface is free from stresses (V

z

0). In contrast, 
plane strain prevails in the interior of the plate because the stress V3  gradually increases from zero 
at the surface towards the middle of the plate. The three dimensional plastic zone is illustrated 
schematically in Figure 6.6 using the previous calculations based on the Von Mises yield criterion.

Figure 6.7 shows a cross section schematically of the three dimensional plastic zone shown 
in Figure 6.6. The plastic deformation at the surface takes place more freely than that in 
the interior because of plane stress condition. Concurrently, the plastic deformation in the 
interior is much more constrained than that at the surface because of plane strain condition 
(Hz  = 0). Therefore, more hydrostatic component than deviatoric stress component prevails 
internally, resulting in the smaller plastic zone and more brittleness. Such different stress 
conditions may be shown using the Mohr’s circles and stress elements under mode I loading 
in Figure 6.8. For q ≈ 0, the stresses V y, V x and V z near the crack tip correspond to 
the principal stresses V1, V2  and V3  respectively according to Equation (6.5). In the case of 
plane stress, the maximum shear stress (W max) occurs at planes inclined at angles of 45° to 
the directions of V2 , and V3  as shown on the stress element in the figure. In the case of 
plane strain, V1 and V2  have the same magnitude as that in plane stress but

is acting in the z-direction. The Mohr’s circles represent such a difference between plane

Such maximum shear stress planes manifest themselves in a form of slip bands as depicted 
graphically in Figure 6.9. The 45° slip bands appear internally at the cross section 
perpendicular to the specimen surface in the case of plane stress while they appear also, in 
the case of plane strain, internally on the cross section but parallel with the specimen surface. 
In the plane strain case, the 45° slip bands constantly varies as a function of θ because the 
principal stress directions for V1 and V2  varies although the principal stress direction for V3 
is always in the z direction. Figure 6.10 shows sketches of experimental slip bands with 
plastic deformation on the specimen surface in plane stress.

Figure 6.11 Compact tension specimen after fracture: 
(a) depression along the crack; and (b) flat fracture surface 
in the middle section and slant fracture along the edges. 
Also, the plane stress and plane strain deformations affect the failure mode as shown in 
Figure 6.11. The slant regions so called ‘shear lips’ are formed on the specimen surfaces along 
the edges and the flat fracture surfaces are created in the middle section [Figure 6.11(b)]. 
The shear lips coincide with the 45° shear planes indicating that their formation is associated 
with the ductile failure mode. However, the flat fracture surfaces do not coincide with the 
shear planes but appear to be caused directly by the maximum principal stress involving

PLASTIC DEFORMATION AROUND A CRACK TIP
6.4	
PLASTIC CONSTRAINT FACTOR
The yielding behaviour in the vicinity of a crack tip is affected by plane thickness. For 
instance, the plane strain plastic zone is significantly smaller than the plane stress plastic 
zone. Such a difference is caused by different constraints. A plastic constraint factor (p.c.f.) 
may be introduced for quantification defined as

2n=0.67) for plane strain when q = 0 and n = 1/3. The maximum stress in plane strain 
appears as high as three times the uni-axial yield stress. 
A comparison of approximate stress distribution between plane stress and plane strain based 
on the calculations is shown in Figure 6.12. In the case of plane strain, the stress continues

THE THICKNESS EFFECT
As discussed, the failure mode (e.g. ductile mode) is affected by plastic deformation and 
hence by the thickness of specimen. Therefore, the fracture behaviour is ultimately affected 
by the specimen thickness until it reaches a point where the plane stress condition is 
negligibly small. The transition from plane stress dominant deformation to plane strain 
dominant deformation is graphically illustrated in Figure 6.13. Figure 6.13(a) shows a 
thin specimen with plastic zone shape and size according to the Von Mises yield criterion. 
As the thickness (B) increases, the proportion of plastic deformation governed by plane 
stress is maintained until it reaches a stage where the plastic deformation occurs with plane 
stress slip planes as shown in Figure 6.13(b). Eventually, the thickness reaches another stage 
[Figure 6.13(c)] where the plastic deformation occurs with slip planes generated by both 
plane stress and plane strain. 
The maximum depth (

stress; (b) at the transition; and (c) plain strain deformation in addition to that of plane 
stress. The plastic zone shape in ‘(a)’ is based on the Von Mises yield criterion.13
The dependence of K1c  on thickness is illustrated given in Figure 6.14. (The critical stress 
intensity for cracking is usually denoted by Kc, but the notation K1c  will be adopted here 
to indicate mode I cracking for both plane stress and plane strain.) The figure shows also 
cross sections for shear lips and flat fracture surface regions corresponding to K1c . The curve 
suggests that, beyond a certain thickness (Bs), a state of plane strain prevails and toughness 
reaches the plane strain toughness value (K1c ) practically independent of thickness for B> Bs. 
It also suggests there is an optimum thickness B0  where the toughness reaches its highest 
level. In the transitional region between B0  and Bs, the toughness has intermediate values. 
For thicknesses below B0 , it is possible that there is not much material available for the 
plastic flow before the fracture, resulting in low values of K1c  as the thickness decreases.

THICKNESS OF ADHESIVE LAYER
The adhesion between different components is important for the integrity of engineering 
structure made of composites. The thickness of adhesive layer significantly affects the 
fracture toughness (GIc) of adhesively jointed section although, for highly brittle adhesives, 
this parameter may be not as much significant. Figure 6.15 shows the fracture toughness 
as a function of adhesive layer thickness for both toughened and un-toughened epoxies.

layer for joints consisting of steel bonded with a rubber-toughened or un-toughened epoxy. 
[After Kinloch and Shaw, 1981]14
A relatively complex behaviour with toughened adhesives arises from the plastic deformation 
in the vicinity of the crack tip, which is highly constrained with high modulus and high 
yield strength substrates such as steel or aluminium alloy. The constraint of adhesive joint 
may be higher than that of an adhesive without substrates. It may restrict the full volume 
development of the plastic zone in the adhesive layer ahead of the crack tip (Figure 6.16). 
Since the toughness is largely derived from the energy required for forming the plastic 
zone, the adhesive fracture energy (GIc) steadily increases as the adhesive layer thickness (ha) 
increases up to a certain value. The maximum toughness, GIc(max)  occurs when the adhesive 
layer thickness and the plastic-zone height (
h
pr ), are similar to each other (Figure 6.15). 
Accordingly, the following equation based on plastic zone size calculation [see Equation (6.6)] 
would provide a good guidance for the adhesive thickness (ham) at GIc(max):

EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF KIC
The experimental determination of plane strain fracture toughness (K1c ) is based on the 
theories discussed up to now to obtain reproducible values of K1c  under the conditions of 
maximum constraint. The plastic zone size in the vicinity of a crack tip must be very small 
relative to the specimen dimensions. The procedure for measuring K1c  has been standardised 
by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) to meet the requirements. In 
this section, the salient points of the ASTM standard test method will be introduced.

6.7.2	 PRE-CRACK
The pre-crack of test specimen is made of mechanical and fatigue cracks as shown in Figure 6.19. 
The mechanical crack is first machined for a chevron starter notch and then a fatigue crack 
follows. There is an advantage of using the chevron notch in that it forces crack initiation 
into the centre so that a reasonable symmetric crack front is obtained before testing. If the 
initial machined notch front is straight, the subsequent fatigue crack tends to initiate from a 
corner. The prepared crack front may be not straight so that an average of three crack lengths 
is used. One of the crack lengths is measured in the centre of the crack front, and the other 
two lengths are measured in the midway between the centre and the end of the crack front, 
giving

. The reason for using the fatigue crack is that the crack tip radius should 
be sufficiently small. The effect of the notch radius (r) on the stress intensity factor (K1c) is 
shown in Figure 6.20. The stress intensity factor (K1c) decreases with decreasing notch radius 
(r) until a transitional point is reached, and then a plateau value is found. The fatigue 
loading should satisfy some requirements to achieve such a small radius of crack tip and 
consistent results. The maximum stress intensity factor during fatigue cycling should not 
exceed 60% of K1c.

6.7.3	 INTERPRETATION OF TEST RECORD AND CALCULATION OF KIC
The procedure for conducting the test is straightforward. A typical instrumentation for 
measurement requires a clip gauge to produce a load-displacement curve. A typical record 
of load-displacement for metallic materials would look like one of the three curves shown 
in Figure 6.21. Type I represents nonlinear behaviour involving a large plastic deformation, 
type III dominantly linear response and type II reflects the phenomenon of ‘pop-in’. From 
the output record, three values PQ, P5  and Pmax  are extracted – PQ  is the load for calculation 
of the fracture toughness [see Equations (6.20) and (6.21)], P5  is the limit of allowable 
plastic or non-linear deformation, and Pmax  is the maximum load. To identify the three 
different loads, a secant line 0P5  is drawn through the origin with a slope equal to 0.95 of 
the slope of the tangent to the initial linear part of the record. The load P5  corresponds to 
the intersection of the secant with the test record. The load PQ  is then determined as follows. 
If the load at every point on the record between the initial tangent line and a secant line 
0P5  is lower than PQ  as in Type I, then PQ  = P5 . If, however, there is a load higher than 
P5  between the initial tangent line and a secant line 0P5 , then PQ  is equal to this higher 
load as in Types II and III. Furthermore, the test is not valid if Pmax/PQ  is greater than 1.10, 
where Pmax  is the maximum load the specimen was able to resist. When a test is invalid, 
it is necessary to use a larger specimen to determine K1c.

Crack growth based on the energy BALANCE

CRACK GROWTH BASED ON THE 
ENERGY BALANCE
The theories of crack growth based on the energy conservation for fracture will be introduced 
in this chapter. They not only complement various methods based on the linear stress 
analysis for the fracture toughness determination but also are capable of dealing with non-
linear materials behaviour. Also, the equivalence of the energy conservation approach to 
that based on the linear stress analysis will be found. The energy principles, thus, provides 
further benefits for understanding the fracture behaviour of materials. 
7.1	
ENERGY CONSERVATION DURING CRACK GROWTH
The fracture process is associated with the energy conservation. The energy is supplied to 
the structural system by the externally applied load, and is simultaneously consumed when 
the rupture of atomic bonds of a material takes place for a new crack surface formation, 
for elastic and plastic deformations, and for kinetic behaviour. Let us consider a cracking 
body creating a cracked area A [= thickness (B) × crack length (a)]. According to the law 
of conservation of energy, we have,

where W

K are the rates 
of change for the strain energy and kinetic energy of the body respectively, and *
.  is the 
energy per unit time for increasing the crack area. (A dot over a letter denotes differentiation 
with respect to time.) 
The strain energy L can be broken up into two parts i.e. one for elastic work and the other 
for plastic work,

(7.2)
where /e is the elastic strain energy and /p the plastic strain energy.
If the crack grows slowly in a stable manner, the kinetic term K is negligible and can be omitted. 
Since all the changes with respect to time are caused by change in crack size, we find that

Equation (7.4) describes the energy balance during the crack growth. In other words, the 
work rate supplied to the cracking body by the applied load is balanced with the rate of 
the elastic strain work, the rate of plastic strain work, and the energy consumption rate for 
crack surface creation. From Equation (7.4), the potential energy (3) in the system may 
be defined as

Equation (7.8) describes the energy release rate when the energy stored in material is 
released for crack growth. Hence, the symbol G is usually referred to as the elastic strain 
energy release rate. In the case of constant loading, the work performed by the constant load 
is approximately twice the increase of elastic strain energy

Crack growth based on the energy BALANCE
The elastic strain energy (

around a crack tip. Let us consider a line crack of length 2a  in an infinite plate subjected 
to a uniform stress (s), perpendicular to the crack (Figure 7.1). The change in elastic strain 
energy ('/) due to the crack length increment ('a) is found:

for plane strain. One of conclusions drawn by Griffith (1921) is as follows:
“The breaking load of thin plate of glass having in it a sufficiently long straight crack normal 
to the applied stress, is inversely proportional to the square root of the length of the crack. 
The maximum tensile stress in the corners of the crack is more than ten times as great as 
the tensile strength of the material, as measured in an ordinary test.”

GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE ENERGY RELEASE RATE
The graphical representation of the energy balance for crack growth is useful for interpretation 
of experimental results for finding the energy release rate. The load-displacement response of 
cracked plate as can be obtained from a testing machine will be discussed for three different 
cases: (a) constant displacement, (b) constant load, and (c) generalised case of changing 
both the load and the displacement.

7.3.1	 CONSTANT DISPLACEMENT CASE
The load-displacement response of a cracked plate is represented in Figure 7.2. Two different 
crack lengths ((a1 and a2) are shown for a2 > (a1. The straight line OA is a linear response 
of the cracked plate with a crack length of and the other straight line OB is that with a 
crack length of a2. It is noted that the cracked plate with a shorter crack is stiffer than that 
with a longer crack. The magnitudes of strain energy stored at point A and point B are 
represented by area OAC and area OBC respectively. If the crack length changes from (a1 
to a2, the load drops from point A to point B and hence the strain energy in the cracked 
plate is reduced by a magnitude represented by area OAB. Therefore, the elastic energy 
release rate (G) equivalent to Equation (7.8) is graphically obtained as:

Crack growth based on the energy BALANCE
7.3.2	 CONSTANT LOAD CASE
The load-displacement response of a cracked plate is represented in Figure 7.3. Two different 
crack lengths ((a1 and a2) are again shown for a2 > (a1. The straight line 0A is a linear response 
of the cracked plate with a crack length of (a1 and the other straight line 0B is that with 
a crack length of a2 as before. The strain energy stored in the cracked plate at point A is 
represented by area 0AC. If the crack length changes from (a1 to a2, the displacement (u) 
increases from point A to point B. At this point, the total energy supplied by the load (P) 
is represented by area 0ABD and the strain energy stored in the cracked plate is represented 
by area 0BD. Thus, the strain energy released from the cracked plate due to the crack length 
change is represented by 
area 0BD – area 0AC
Also, the total energy lost from the total energy supplied due to the crack length change is 
represented by area 0AB. However, 
area 0AB ≈ area 0BD – area 0AC
because area ABE diminishes as the crack length change 'a  approaches zero. Therefore, 
the elastic energy release rate (G) equivalent to Equation (7.9) is graphically obtained as:

7.3.3	 GENERALIZED CASE
The previous two cases are the limiting ones and the crack growths cannot be produced 
directly by the load (P) without assistance. The different crack lengths ((ai)) in the generalised 
case shown in Figure 7.4 are, however, directly produced by the applied load. The crack 
length a1  is the initial crack length and a1 <a2 <a3<a4< a5. As the crack length increases 
during quasi static crack growth, the stiffness of a cracked plate decreases but displacement 
(u) increases. Therefore, the elastic energy release rate (G) equivalent to Equation (7.8) or 
(7.9) is graphically obtained as

In an experimental determination of G, the locations of different crack lengths are recorded

the radial stiffness lines.
7.3.4	 G – A REPRESENTATION

V1, G linearly increases with increasing crack length and reaches a critical point for fracture 
(G= Gc). At a lower stresses ((V2  and V3), though, longer crack lengths are required to reach 
the same critical point for fracture (G= Gc).

Figure 7.8 DCB Specimen
If the compliance (u/P) is theoretically known, a single specimen instead of multiple specimens 
may be sufficient for the fracture toughness determination. For example, the compliance 
of a double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen shown in Figure 7.8 is determined using the 
deflection formula for a cantilever beam. The theoretical compliance is given by

NON-LINEAR ELASTIC BEHAVIOUR
The non-linear elastic behaviour may be analyzed using the same energy principles. The 
symbol J is commonly used for non-linear rate of change of potential energy with respect 
to crack area to be distinguished from G (strain energy release rate) for linear behaviour. 
When quasi-static fracture occurs, J or G has the critical value JC  or GC  which exactly 
matches the specific work of fracture given by R. Accordingly,

CRACK GROWTH RESISTANCE CURVE (R-CURVE)
It is possible that, as the crack grows under loading, much more energy is consumed in 
the plastic deformation under plane stress than under plain strain condition. Also, such a 
plastic deformation takes place as the crack grows. The crack resistance (R) curve is useful for 
describing the crack growth involving a relatively large plastic deformation. The theoretical 
basis is found from Equation (7.5) and R is defined as

straight if a geometry factor is considered.) The slope increases as the applied stress (σ) 
increases. As the stress increases from zero, the available G increases from point A to point 
B without the crack growth. The point B represents the minimum fracture toughness of 
the material before any subsequent increase in R along the R-curve. Cracking can thus 
commence at point B stably. We may compare the set of radial lines of slopes represented

GEOMETRIC STABILITY FACTORS IN ELASTIC FRACTURE
The cracking stability is also dependent on the testing machine type because the testing 
machine itself stores the strain energy and/or the energy balance is not exactly maintained 
unless a special control circuitry is used for controlling a crosshead. In practice, there are two 
typical types of testing machines viz displacement controlled machines and load controlled 
machines (Figure 7.13). The increment of the crosshead (du) in a displacement controlled 
machine is always positive because it does not reverse the loading direction during testing. In 
a load controlled machine, on the other hand, the increment of load (dP) is always positive.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

for stability in a displacement controlled testing machine. If R is constant in this condition, 
GSF becomes zero and accordingly the stability condition becomes 0 > -4/A. Therefore, 
the DCB specimen satisfies the stability condition. If a test specimen does not satisfy the 
stability condition, instability of cracking is expected. Sometimes it may be possible that 
test specimens with satisfied stability conditions have instabilities if the crack front is blunt. 
Also, the GSF can be calculated using a stress intensity factor relation with G (

Crack growth based on the energy BALANCE
The testing machine stiffness effect is illustrated in load (P)-displacement (u) diagram given 
in Figure 7.14. Two G-loci are shown: one for infinitely stiff testing and the other for 
displacement controlled testing machine with a finite compliance. Points A and B indicate 
the transition between crack lengths for stability in infinitely stiff testing machine and 
displacement controlled testing machine respectively. They also indicate the minimum crack 
displacements. Point B lies on a longer crack length with a lower load for transition than 
point A. It is noted that, for a constant load, the energy stored in a testing machine with 
a finite compliance is larger than that with infinitely stiff testing machine.
7.10	 ESSENTIAL WORK OF ENERGY
Resistance to tear is one of important mechanical properties of flexible materials such as thin 
polymer sheets, rubbers, etc. The trousers test under mode III loading has drawn attention 
for material evaluation since Rivlin and Thomas18 considered trouser tear criterion for rubbers. 
Joe and Kim19 analysed the load–displacement records to determine the critical J-integral 
(or just J) value and crack resistance (R). The determination of the critical J value, however, 
requires the detection of the crack initiation which is not an easy task for highly deformable 
materials. Alternatively, the resistance to tear may be evaluated using the essential work of 
fracture (EWF) approach which was first developed for mode I fracture of ductile metals20. The 
EWF approach was further developed by Mai and Cotterell21 for elasto-plastic fracture of thin 
metal sheets under mode III loading using trouser specimens with various widths, taking into 
account the work done in plastic bending and unbending of the trousers. Muscat-Fenech and 
Atkins22 expanded this Mai and Cotterell’s work for a wide range of specimen dimensions and 
geometric change. For tearing of polymer sheets, however, the work for plastic bending and 
un-bending of the trousers is negligible due to their low stiffness, and deformation reflected 
in the model for metals cannot be translated into that for the tearing of thin polymer sheets.

Wong et al.24 proposed a two-zone model for deformation and tearing behaviour of thin 
polymer sheets under mode III loading. In the first zone, which is called zone A in their paper 
and is adjoining the initial crack tip, the outer plastic zone height lineally increases with the 
torn ligament and thus the zone is of triangular shape. At the end of zone A, the deformation 
enters zone B. The height of the zone B remains constant with further increase of torn ligament 
length. The zone A, though, did not consider plastic deformation caused by loading prior to 
tearing (which is referred to as initial plastic zone in the paper). The two-zone model hence 
would lead to overestimation of EWF if tearing is the case where increasing height of the 
initial plastic zone does not coincide with that of subsequently following zone B. In the light 
of the deficiency, Kim and Karger-Kocsis developed a three-zone model for tear fracture under 
mode III loading to include the initial plastic deformation and analysis based on the EWF 
approach for prediction of overall tear resistance. In tearing of thin ductile polymeric sheets, 
mode III fracture mode is expected at the beginning of loading but the mode tends to be 
mode I later so that tearing becomes virtually mixed mode. In this section, the three-zone 
model for tear fracture under mode III loading will be introduced.

Crack growth based on the energy BALANCE
As schematically indicated for a specimen with sufficiently long ligament in Figure 7.15 (if 
the ligament is not long enough, only partial deformation occurs), generally two different 
types of deformation appear along the torn ligament after tearing. One is plastic deformation 
and the other characterized by whitening. The whitening, accompanied by a weak change 
of transparency, is found in some polymers and is of non-plastic deformation as seen in a 
polarized image along the torn ligament – note photo-elastic fringe pattern does not appear 
in plastic deformation. Also it did not cause any visible change in the surface texture of 
the specimens. This indicates that its deformation energy would be small compared to the 
plastic deformation which requires relatively large deformation energy as expected. 
Therefore, the whitened zone is not included in the model formulation despite its considerable 
size. The plastic zone is found to have three distinctive zones as detailed in Figure 7.15. The 
three zones will be referred to as: zone I (initial), zone V (v-shape) and zone S (saturation). 
Zone I is initially formed as loading increases prior to the crack propagation. After zone I 
fully developed, the following events took place sequentially to form zone V: (a) change of 
specimen configuration as a result of further lining up of the trouser legs with increasing 
load; (b) change in the fracture mode from mode III to mode I to include more mode I 
component due to rotation of the area around the crack tip; and (c) gradual increase in 
duration of straining applied to the plastic zone around the crack tip as a result of increase 
in plastic deformation size as the tear progresses at an almost constant speed (e.g. material 
at l = Lv  is subjected longer straining time than that at l = Li  because material at l = Lv  
is strained and plastically deformed more ahead in time before the crack tip arrives at it 
than material at l = Li ). Thus, the zone V is the result of an evolutionary process before 
it saturates. The height (h) of zone V continues to extend as the crack propagates until it 
reaches zone S where the plastic deformation is stabilized and thus the height (h) becomes 
constant. Based on the deformation described above, the following analysis is given. The 
total work of fracture (Wf ) for a pre-cracked test specimen can be generally divided into 
two components:
Wf = We + Wp 
(7.43)
where We  is the energy for yielding and tearing of the inner fracture process zone, which 
is referred to as the essential work, and Wp is the work for the outer plastic deformation 
zone which is geometry dependant, non-essential work.

For 0 < li < Li, 
the total work of fracture (Wif ) for a specimen with a ligament length of li  is given for 
zone I as
Wf = Wif = Wie + Wip = wielit + wipAit 
(7.44a)

is the thickness and Ai  is the outer plastic deformation zone area given by

(7.44b)
This equation considers the fact that the profile of the initial plastic zone is inclined 
approximately 45° to the tear path. Although different materials might have different angles, 
it appears reasonable for approximation. Thus,

7.11	 IMPACT FRACTURE TOUGHNESS
Structural materials used for functioning components are very likely subjected to impact 
loading. Accordingly, impact strength is often the deciding factor in materials selection 
for such an application. The impact test methods in general may fall into two categories 
according to the relative amounts of energy between striker and specimen viz: (a) limiting 
energy methods, in which the striker energy is adjusted until a set damage to specimen is 
found; and (b) excess energy methods, in which the kinetic energy of the striker is always 
greater than the energy required to break the specimens. The falling weight test falls into the 
first category, and the Charpy, Izod and tensile impact tests typically fall into the second. 
The conventional test methods have the advantages of being easily and rapidly performed. 
However, their results are dependent on the notch size. The problem of specimen geometry 
dependence can be approached in different ways based on the fracture mechanics. One of 
the ways is to obtain force (P) – displacement (u) curves from a single specimen test with 
instrumented striker. The other way is to make variations in notch depth with a sharp 
radius for multiple specimens. 
In the Charpy test (Figure 7.17), a bar specimen is placed on horizontal supports attached 
to up right pillars for central striking. The impact energy is an amount lost from the kinetic 
energy of striker for breaking a specimen. The energy measurement in the Izod test is based 
on the same principle as for the Charpy test. The difference between two tests is that the 
lower half of a specimen in the Izod test is clamped for cantilever loading. The clamping, 
though, generates the complex stress field around a notch tip, making it difficult for analysis. 
In this section, a theory and method based on fracture mechanics for the Charpy impact 
test will be introduced.

The impact specimen breaks and flies away after being struck by the striker, involving kinetic 
energy of specimen. The impact energy (/E)  measured is hence the sum of elastic strain 
energy (/e) and kinetic energy of specimen (Ks), i.e.
/E =/e + Ks.

FATIGUE
Fatigue is the most common cause of service failure in mechanical components and 
structures. It is a type of damage caused by cracking and deformation. The fatigue failure 
takes place when subjected to cyclic loading. The stress at the failure is much lower than 
the static strength. The theories with fatigue have largely been founded on the empiricism 
with phenomenological analysis since Wohler curve26 was introduced in 1870. There are two 
approaches for the fatigue problems viz the stress-life (S-N) curve approach to treat multiple 
cracks collectively and the stress intensity factor approach to treat cracking individually.

STRESS-LIFE (S-N) CURVE APPROACH FOR 
UN-NOTCHED SPECIMEN
The fatigue life is measured in a laboratory using parameters such as stress range (∆σ), mean 
stress (σmean), minimum stress ((σmin)), and maximum stress ((σmax)) as shown in Figure 8.1. The 
test results on unnotched specimens consist of a series of data points obtained from multiple 
specimens at different stresses. The data points represent a range of different values of (σmax) 
or ∆σ corresponding to respective numbers of loading cycles to failure (N) forming a curve 
known as the S-N curve (Figure 8.2). If the S-N curve has a plateau value at a low stress, 
the stress is called the fatigue limit or endurance limit. Below the fatigue limit if exists, it 
is considered that the material would last for an infinite number of cycles without failure.
The S-N curve can be affected by various factors such as material surface roughness, applied 
mean stress, residual stresses, specimen size, loading method (e.g. bending, tension-tension), 
and temperature. If a S-N curve is used for the life prediction or design of notched 
components, the notch sensitivity should be taken into account.

When a material experiences no change at all in fatigue limit due to the presence of a notch, 
Kf =1 and q = 0  (insensitive, which is good) for any different values of Kt. On the other 
hand, when a material has its full theoretical effect, Kf = Kt  and q = 1  (sensitive). It should 
be noted, however, that q is not a material constant but is dependant on the geometry of 
specimen and notch, and the loading type.

FATIGUE DAMAGE AND LIFE PREDICTION
Mechanical properties of materials such as fibre reinforced plastics are susceptible to fatigue 
damage so that their resultant stiffness decreases under cyclic loading. In this situation, the 
fatigue modulus may be useful to quantify such damage. The fatigue modulus27 is defined as

where Vmax  is the maximum applied stress and H(N) is the resultant fatigue strain at Nth 
cycle (see Figure 8.4). 
Figure 8.5 shows examples of fatigue moduli measured for a glass reinforced composite in 
comparison with stiffness. Figure 8.5 (a) shows one at a maximum stress of 436 MPa and 
failed at 926 cycles; and Figure 8.5 (b) at a stress of 266 MPa and failed at 5.66 × 105 
cycles to failure. It is seen that low applied stress tends to produce more variation in the 
fatigue modulus than high stress does.

Fatigue damage may be defined as any permanent change due to fatigue loading. The damage 
(D) is a function of a number of parameters at least, N, Ds, R and f :
D = f (N, 'V, R, f) 
(8.6a)
where N is the number of loading cycles, Ds is the applied stress range, R is the stress ratio 
and f is the loading frequency.

EFFECT OF MEAN STRESS ON FATIGUE
The fatigue life (N) generally increases as the mean stress (σmean) or stress ratio (R) increases 
at a constant stress amplitude ((σa)). Also, we know that a material breaks when the maximum 
stress (σmax)  reaches the ultimate strength (σu). (Assume σu  is equal to yield stress.) It is 
useful to use a σa - σmean  plane for a relation between the variables. On the σa - σmean  plane 
(Figure 8.7), it is easily found that there are two limiting cases in which two breaking 
points A and B are at σa =0  for σmean= σu  and at σmean= 0  for σa = σu . If we connect the two 
points, a straight line (which is a locus of breaking points at the 1st cycle) is found for a 
constant life at the same maximum stress but at different stress ratios. The same principle 
for a constant life may be applied to different stress amplitudes at R=-1. Then, another point 
C at a lower stress may be found from an experiment for another constant fatigue life line 
CB but for a longer fatigue life. The point B is used for all other stress levels because it 
is a known condition for any stress ratios. If a fatigue limit is available from a S-N curve 
for R=-1, the fatigue limit line DB may be found. As a result, it is possible from a single 
S-N curve to predict a series of different values of σmean and (σa) for different stress ratios for 
each constant fatigue life. On the other hand, the dash-dot line in Figure 8.7 represents 
a constant stress ratio for different fatigue lives for a given stress ratio (R), and its slope is

FATIGUE
If the ultimate strength (σu) is not equal to the yield stress (σys), another straight line CD 
(which is a locus of yield points at the 1st cycle) is found in addition to the line of breaking 
points AB as shown in Figure 8.8. As a result, two parallel lines can be drawn. Accordingly, 
the intersects on line CD with other possible constant fatigue life lines provide the yield 
limits as the stress ratio (R) increases on a constant fatigue life line.

CUMULATIVE DAMAGE

where Ni  is the number of cycles of operation at a stress and Nfi  is the fatigue life at 
each corresponding stress. Equation (8.18) has been known as the cumulative damage rule 
or Palmgren30-Miner31 rule, which may be used for the calculation of the total fatigue 
life. However, deviations from the rule are possible for some materials in the absence of 
fundamental theoretical framework. The fatigue life estimation for random cyclic loading 
due to variation of mean stress ((σmean)) and stress range (∆σ) may be attempted using the 
rule in conjunction with Goodman model.
Example) Figure 8.9 represents the stress fluctuation pattern taking place every 15 seconds 
on an alloy component. A S-N curve with a fatigue limit of 120 MPa obtained experimentally 
at R=-1 is given in Figure 8.10. The alloy component has an ultimate strength (σu) of 500 
MPa. Estimate the fatigue life using the cumulative damage rule and Goodman’s model. 
Assume that ultimate strength is equal to yield strength. Ignore the notch sensitivity.

Solution) The fatigue life estimation may be conducted according to the following procedure: 
a)	locate the ultimate strength ((σu)) of 500 MPa on σmean  axis in Figure 8.11;
b)	find values of stress amplitude (σa) and mean stress (σmean ) individually from 
Figure 8.9 as listed in Table 8.1;
c)	plot data points on σmean – σa  plane to find stress amplitude at R=-1 as shown 
in Figure 8.11 and then to use the S-N curve (Figure 8.10) for finding 
corresponding number of cycles (Nfi ) and

SINGLE CRACK APPROACH FOR FATIGUE
The S-N curve approach in fatigue does not account for the details of a crack although it is 
useful to deal with a case where the failure is caused by the multiple cracks. A single crack 
approach provides another aspect of fundamental understanding of the fatigue phenomenon 
by modelling the fatigue crack initiation and propagation processes. The fatigue initiation 
may be analysed at a smaller scale while the fatigue crack propagation at a larger scale. When 
a component is subjected to cyclic loading, energy is consumed in the neighbourhood of 
inherent small defects, which grow and coalesce, for forming a crack to be large enough to 
be analysed by the principles of continuum mechanics. The crack propagation leading to 
the catastrophic failure is more predictable than the initiation of a fatigue crack.

FATIGUE
Figure 8.12 illustrates some characteristic crack lengths (a ) dependant on number of 
loading cycles (N ). There are relative four different crack lengths. The smallest crack length 
(ai)) represents the one that is big enough for fracture mechanics to apply but too small to 
be detected by the non-destructive inspection technology until it grows to al. The crack 
length further grows to reach the limit of useful life ((au)) before the catastrophic failure 
takes place (af). 
Fatigue crack propagation data at a stress ratio (R= Kmin/Kmax = σmin/σmax)  are obtained from 
experiments on pre-cracked specimens subjected to cyclic loading, and the change in crack 
length (a ) is recorded as a function of loading cycles (N ). The crack growth rates (da/dN ) 
are then numerically calculated for corresponding stress intensity factor ranges (∆K ) from 
the raw data. The experimental results are usually plotted in a log (DK ) versus log (da/dN ) 
diagram. The load is usually sinusoidal with constant amplitude and frequency (Figure 8.13). 
A typical plot of a log (DK ) – log (da/dN ) curve is shown in Figure 8.14. Three characteristic 
Stages may be identified. In Stage I, da/dN diminishes rapidly to a vanishingly small level, 
and for some materials there might be a threshold of the stress intensity factor range ('Kth), 
below which no crack propagation takes place. In Stage II, a linear log (DK ) – log (da/dN) 
relation is usually found. As da/dN further increases, it reaches Stage III in which the crack 
growth rate (da/dN ) curve rapidly rises and the maximum stress intensity factor (Kmax) in the 
fatigue cycle becomes equal to the critical stress intensity factor (Kc) leading to catastrophic 
failure. Experimental results indicate that the fatigue crack growth rate curve depends on the 
stress ratio (R ), and is shifted towards higher da/dN values as R increases. The Stage I has 
been known to be sensitive to variations of mean stress, microstructure and environment 
as expected at low stress intensity factor values and extremely slow crack growths. Stage II 
is not as sensitive as Stage III to mean stress and specimen thickness because of relatively 
small plastic zone sizes at low stress intensity factors compared to those in Stage III. Also, 
it represents a wide range of DK.

linear relationship between log (DK ) and log (da/dN ) and is used to determine the constants 
C and m for the effects of mean stress, frequency, and temperature variation. Equation 
(8.19) does not, however, describe the crack growth rates in Stages I and III. At high DK 
values in Stage III, as Kmax approaches the critical level Kc, the crack growth rate approaches 
infinity. Stages II and III can be represented by a modification of the Paris Equation, i.e.

TEMPERATURE AND FREQUENCY EFFECTS ON FATIGUE 
CRACK GROWTH
Materials such as polymers are readily influenced by temperature variation. The fatigue 
crack growth rate (da/dN ) generally increases with increasing temperature although some 
materials display a different response. Arrhenius33 proposed an expression to account for 
the influence of temperature on the rate (k ) of inversion of sucrose:

temperature but also by the stress intensity in the vicinity of a crack. We see that the higher 
activation energy (∆H ) the slower crack growth – ∆H is an energy barrier – but the higher 
stress intensity factor the faster crack growth is expected. Accordingly, an apparent activation

OVERLOAD RETARDATION AND CRACK CLOSURE
The fatigue crack propagation discussed so far has been concerned with constant amplitude 
loads. It is one of types. Another type is of variable amplitude loads. In the case of constant 
amplitude loads, the crack growth is more predictable. In other words, a higher fatigue 
crack growth rate is expected when subjected to higher amplitude of stress intensity factor. 
However, when a single overload is applied as shown in Figure 8.16, the crack length 
does not increase as same rate as expected. Surprisingly, its rate is, in fact, lower than it 
would have been under constant amplitude loading. This effect is shown schematically in 
Figure 8.16. The crack retardation takes place when a tensile overload follows a constant 
amplitude cyclic load. An explanation of the crack retardation phenomenon may be obtained 
by examining the stress distribution in the wake of the plastic zone formation ahead of the 
crack tip. The plastic deformation creates a compressive residual stress field reducing mode 
I stress intensity factor for any subsequent lower load. The compressive residual stress tends 
to close the crack. The overload leaves a larger plastic zone size than the subsequent regular 
constant amplitude load. The reduction of mode I stress intensity factor depends on the 
difference between the overload and the regular constant amplitude load. Accordingly, the 
crack propagates after overloading at a decreased rate into the zone of residual compressive 
stresses. Once it passes through the plastic zone created by the overload, its expected growth 
rate is recovered as the residual stress diminishes.

FATIGUE
The crack closure and plastic zone formation can be detected on the force-displacement 
(P-u) diagram as Elber39 suggested. Since the non-linearity of a linear elastic material on 
a force-displacement diagram can only be caused by two reasons – change of geometric 
configuration, and material plasticity, as illustrated in Figure 8.17. When an elastic body 
with a closed crack is under loading, it displays a linear behaviour until the closed-crack 
starts to open at point A. As the crack opens, the crack length increases, causing the change 
in geometrical configuration. Accordingly, non-linearity continues from point A until point 
B at which the crack is fully open. The linearity remains from point B to point C at which 
the plastic deformation sufficiently large to change the linear behaviour again. 
A retardation factor40 may be defined using plastic zones in the wake of overloading. Let 
us consider a crack-tip plastic zone of length (rpo) (Figure 8.18) at a crack length (a0)  by 
an overload of stress (σo)  given by

The crack growth rate (da/dN ) is re-plotted as a function of effective stress intensity factor 
range (∆Keff ) in Figure 8.20(b) according to Equation (8.29b). It appears that a single 
curve fits the data from a wide range of stress ratios.

VARIABLE AMPLITUDE LOADING
The prediction of the fatigue crack growth under a variable amplitude loading by simply 
summing up the individual fatigue lives from respective constant amplitude loads in the 
loading history may lead to conservative values due to the overload effect. However, the 
Paris equation may be applicable if we find an appropriate distribution function of ∆K for 
a small block of loads. Barsom42 demonstrated that the root-mean-square value of the stress 
intensity factor 'Krms is useful, which is given by

8.10	 FATIGUE NEAR THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT METHODS
The fatigue threshold stress intensity factor range (∆Kth)  is the one that corresponds to zero 
crack growth although it can be defined by an arbitrary crack growth rate for practicality. 
Most fatigue data do not show a clear ∆Kth. In designing structural components subjected to 
cyclic loading it is important to determine the fatigue threshold stress intensity factor (∆Kth) , 
below which a crack does not grow. However, important as it is, a ‘true’ ∆Kth is difficult 
to measure since this requires very long testing times. Usually, near-threshold fatigue crack 
growth rates of less than 10-10 m/cycle are determined and then used to estimate ∆Kth. Even 
so, obtaining the near-threshold crack, growth data is a tedious time-consuming procedure. 
Also, the threshold data vary depending on the experimental technique so that a thorough 
understanding of various techniques is important for all users of threshold data.

FATIGUE
The method desired should be able to reduce DK as quickly as possible without load history 
effects to reach a very low crack growth rate (da/dN ), but if DK is reduced abruptly it causes 
the retardation in fatigue crack growth resulting in a higher value than true near-∆Kth. Load 
shedding can be conducted either manually or continuously by computerised automated 
control. The automated technique is preferred to avoid the intensive manual labour for 
processing raw data from measurements of crack length positions with corresponding loads. 
Also, a load-shedding schedule is required to efficiently minimise the load retardation effects. 
In this section, various methods employing load-shedding schedule will be introduced.
8.10.1	CONTINUOUS K-DECREASING METHODS
A continuous K-decreasing method was proposed by Saxena et al43 and recommended by 
ASTM E24 Committee with

A limit on C assumes that there is a gradual decrease in DK so that the rate of the fractional 
change of the estimated plastic zone size  
rp  remains constant with increase in a and 
that there is no overload effect on crack growth if the decrease is sufficiently gradual. The 
acceptable values of C depend on test conditions. If K-increasing and K-decreasing fatigue 
data agree with each other, then the chosen value of C is permitted. This means that C can 
only be selected from separate experiments if it is not already established for the particular 
material to be tested. Accordingly, this method requires very long testing times.

Figure 8.22 Load shedding using a damping coefficient. [After Bailon et al, 1981]
The basic principle of this method is to approach ∆Kth  by steps of load shedding according 
to Equation (8.32a) until crack arrests at ∆Ka  (subscript a  denotes arrest) which is larger 
than ∆Kth  due to overloading effects (Figure 8.22). The test is resumed with a new set of 
values for Q (half the previous magnitude) and ∆Pi  (and hence ∆Ki, which is half the sum 
of the original ∆Ki and the associate ∆Ka ). Values of ∆Ka , which are similar for the last two 
or three iterative steps indicate that ∆Kth  has been reached. As opposed to the ASTM method 
for which dK/da is maintained constant, this method uses decreasing dK/da gradients in 
the load shedding program. It was claimed that this method provides 50% better efficiency 
than the ASTM method. However, it also requires some preliminary tests to determine the 
best damping coefficient Q. 
8.10.3	CONDITIONAL LOADING BY ITERATION
The principle of the method, proposed by Kim et al45 is to search DK corresponding to a 
given da/dN by an iteration scheme conditionally. The condition is imposed on the crack 
growth rate. If the current crack growth rate (da/dN)c  is higher or lower than the initially 
set (da/dN)i, Kmax  is either decreased according to

where n is the number of iterations and Kmax(i)  is an initially set relatively high stress 
intensity factor range. The procedure follows as illustrated in Figure 8.23. Point A is at the 
first allocated Kmax (1)  and hence at the largest plastic zone size at a stress ratio (R ) so that 
(da/dN)c  is higher than (da/dN)i. Accordingly, Equation (8.33a) applies to get to point B with 
n=2 at which overloading effect is high due to the large drop of Kmax (1)  to Kmax (2)  and as a 
result, the condition (da/dN)c<(da/dN)i  is found at point C and Equation (8.33b) with n=3 
applies to get to point D for Kmax (3). If (da/dN)c>(da/dN)I  at point E and crack grows out of 
calculated plastic zone due to overload, Equation (8.33a) with n=4 applies to decrease the 
loading. Further, decrease in loading follows since (da/dN)c>(da/dN)I  with the same n=4 to 
reach point G. The same conditional loading continues for the subsequent points H, I, J 
and so on. The iteration is terminated when the following convergence criterion is satisfied,

At the end of the iterative procedure the current and previous plastic zone sizes become 
essentially the same, being defined by a low tolerance (say 2%) set in the computer 
program. Also, to avoid overloading effects, the crack growth may be allowed to advance 
twice as long as the plastic zone created by the previous DK only when (da/dN)c>(da/dN)i.

A variation of the method can be made if we keep Kmax  constant for measuring a ∆K 
corresponding to a da/dN. The same algorithm can be used by replacing Kmax  with ∆K in 
Equation (8.33a) and (8.33b). Since there is no overloading effect when Kmax  is constant, 
near- 'Kth  can be obtained more quickly than any other method. However, it is difficult 
to obtain near-'Kth  for low stress ratios because it is not possible to obtain near- 'Kth  at 
a particular stress ratio nominated.

8.11	 INTERPRETATION OF FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH IN P – U AND 
R – A DIAGRAMS
The incorporation of the threshold 'Kth  on a force (P)- displacement (u) diagram may be 
useful for understanding from a different perspective. As shown in Figure 8.26 (a) and (b) 
for stress ratios, R =0 and R > 0 respectively, three different Stages are indicated. Stage I is 
the area of near-threshold fatigue growth. The crack growth in Stage II is governed under 
the Paris equation, and Stage III includes near- and catastrophic failure, as also described 
in Figure 8.14. On loading from point 0 to B, fatigue crack starts to grow, which is well 
below the static fracture point C. As the fatigue crack further grows, stiffness decreases and 
reaches point D at which catastrophic fracture takes place. When the loading is not high 
enough, however, for crack growth, the threshold at point A and along the line AE can 
be identified for specimens with different crack lengths. Threshold-Kmax  can be converted 
into G (energy release rate) and a Gth  locus of magnitude

FATIGUE
8.12	 SHORT CRACK BEHAVIOUR IN NEAR-THRESHOLD FATIGUE
The short crack is referred to as the one that is comparable with microscopic features such 
as grain size and small defects. An example of short surface crack behaviour is given in 
Figure 8.28. Its crack growth rate does not vary monotonically but fluctuate, displaying 
peaks and valleys, which is sensitive to grain boundaries. The short cracks are also sensitive 
to the orientation of the grain. Thus, the crack growth would smoothly increase if all grains 
are favourably oriented, or zigzag otherwise, with partial or complete arrest in some cases. 
Such behaviour is illustrated in comparison with a long crack in Figure 8.29. Also, it is 
obvious that the crack growth rates of short cracks are higher than that of the long crack. 
The anomalous behaviour of the small cracks does not obey the same propagation laws 
which we apply to the long cracks. The stress intensity factor range (DK) is not as much 
useful for the fail-safe design if the crack is smaller than some critical length, typically 1 
mm in metallic or polymeric materials.

pr  is proportional to the crack length (a ). In other words, as the crack length decreases, the 
compressive residual stress created by the plastic deformation decreases and hence the crack 
closure diminishes. Some supporting evidence is given in Figure 8.30. Near-threshold stress 
intensity for small and large cracks are shown in the figure for difference between effective 
'Kth  and apparent 'Kth  due to diminished crack closure effect.

Scatter is an essential feature of short-crack data because individual small cracks behave 
differently. The analysis based on continuum mechanics for long cracks is hardly applicable 
to the anomalous behaviour of the short cracks. Then, an important question arises as to 
how we conduct the fail-safe design against small cracks. The important steps may be to 
a)	define the difference between short and long cracks, 
b)	find common variables between short and long cracks, and 
c)	apply the relevant theories for short and/or long cracks. 
We know that the behaviour of small cracks is reflected in a S-N curve with scattered 
data points and the long crack is still validly treated within the framework of continuum 
mechanics. We also know that the common variables are applied stress and crack length 
(a), allowing us to display two different equations based on the two different approaches 
together on a σ-a  plane. The stress intensity factor for threshold ('Kth ) with a corresponding 
applied stress range ('Kσ th ) is given by

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

This equation is plotted on logarithmic scales in Figure 8.31 with the fatigue limit (∆σ0). 
The fatigue limit is independent of the crack length.

Figure 8.31 Kitagawa plot48 of threshold stress range ∆σ0  as a function of crack length and 
fatigue limit (∆σ0).
The limitations of the stress intensity factor approach are clear in the figure. As the crack 
length approaches zero, ∆σth  approaches ∞ with a slope of 0.5 according to Equation (8.34b). 
However, we know that if the crack length is zero, for a perfectly polished specimen, the 
threshold stress for fatigue is not infinity, but is equal to the fatigue limit (∆σ0 ). Therefore, 
the crack length at which two lines intersect with each other becomes the demarcation point 
between short and long cracks. The representation shown in Figure 8.31 is often called a 
‘Kitagawa’ plot after one of its originators. The plot also explains that the small cracks grow 
at applied DK values lower than 'Kth  measured for long cracks.
In practice, the experimental data for near-threshold takes the form shown in Figure 8.32. 
The measured threshold data points deviate from Equation (8.34) for the long crack and 
eventually merge with the fatigue limit. The curved region on the figure is lower than the 
fatigue limit or the long crack threshold stress. It may be useful to describe the characteristics 
of two different crack lengths in addition to the demarcation point ((a0)) although those are 
not explicitly definitive due to the smooth transition:

a)	 a1  is the length at which the fatigue behaviour deviates from the fatigue limit. 
As such, it is the longest crack length at which the fatigue limit is still a material 
property. Therefore, if inherent crack lengths of a material are longer than a1 , 
its fatigue limit may be lowered and hence is no longer the material property. 
Accordingly, it is possible that some materials would not have a fatigue limit if 
they contain relatively long cracks produced during manufacturing.
b)	a2  is the length at which its behaviour deviates from that of long-crack for the 
transitional behaviour.
Such a transitional behaviour can be described by adding a constant length ((a0)) to the 
crack length (a), i.e.

As the crack length decreases, according to this equation, the constant length ((a0)) constitutes 
an increasing fraction of (a0 +a)  until at very short lengths. An example is given in 
Figure 8.33(a) for (a0) =2 and ∆Kth = 20. The curve and fatigue limit are dependent on the 
choice of (a0) value. If we choose a shorter length (a0) =1, the curve displays a higher fatigue 
limit as shown in Figure 8.33(b). Equation (8.35) may be useful for an initial estimation 
using only near threshold-Kmax . The value of (a0), however, does not a physical basis for 
understanding the transitional behaviour.
