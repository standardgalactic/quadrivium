How would you troubleshoot a problem if the server goes down with no network in the middle of the night? 
This is situational question so what is the best approach and what steps I would take to troubleshoot 
First the server is physically accessible then I will go to the server and connect using a 
keyboard/mouse and a monitor and try to login through console.  If the server is not accessible 
then I will try to reach the server through iDRAC if Dell or iLO if HP server.  These console access 
allow you to access the server even the OS is down.  Also if the server is in a remote location then 
most likely there are datacenter technicians who have access to the server and I will ask them to 
connect to the server using keyboard/mouse and monitor and walk me through exactly what they 
see on the screen. 
 
207. 
How did you handle a difficult situation when you couldn't figure out what to do to fix a problem and user is 
angry? 
There might be situations when you have people breathing over your neck and get angry if they 
server is down.  The first thing I would do is not to panic and stay calm.  Then I will ask the user to 
please give me sometime so I can look into the issue and provide status update in an hour or so.  I 
will tell the user/customer that you are in good hands I will do everything to bring the system back 
online asap.  Then I will start troubleshooting the issue and if needed I will setup a conference call 
with my team members to see if they can find something too.  I will also reach out to for the vendor 
support e.g. Redhat and ask them to open up a case and look into the issue asap.  I will make sure 
I provide continuous status every hour to my users and customers.  Once the issue is resolved then 
I would let the user know that I will definitely dig deep into the issue and find out what caused the 
issue and most likely will provide root cause analysis for it. 
 

208.
