David Pearl is the author of The Art of Steely Dan (Cherry Lane) and Color Your Chords 
(Cherry Lane), a survey of the harmonic styles of 25 top jazz, blues, and rock pianists. He 
recently completed The Jazz Piano Collection (Amsco Publications), twenty-two jazz stan-
dards arranged for solo piano, and The Art of Billy Strayhorn (Cherry Lane), an in-depth 
exploration of fi ve songs by one of jazz’s greatest composers. His other books include 
jazz transcriptions of the artists Grover Washington, Jr., Dave Douglas, and Roland Hanna, 
and arrangements of jazz, classical pieces, and opera arias for piano. A freelance pianist,

oped and recorded a series of piano lessons for the new online music education Web site 
WorkshopLive. Born in Denver, Colorado, he graduated from the Lamont School of Music at 
the University of Denver.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Mark Phillips and Susan Poliniak at Cherry Lane Music for giving me the opportu-
nity to write about, arrange, edit, and engrave music over the years. To Mark, who recom-
mended me to Wiley for this book: More Mondel’s chocolate is coming your way.
To Lindsay Lefevere, enthusiastic and supportive acquisitions editor: Thanks for getting me 
started.
Thanks to Tim Gallan, project editor, for guiding me along this path with his easy-going style.
To Sarah Faulkner, master copy editor, a promise: In the future, my future-tense propensity 
will be a thing of the past.
Thanks to my son Leon for being my crash-test Dummy, and for making sure my ‘Take Me 
Out to the Ballgame’ arrangement passes ballpark muster. (But hold the relish.) 
Thanks to my wife, Rubi, the real piano sensei in our family, who agreed to play through 
every exercise, generously shared her wisdom, gently pointed out problems, and waited for 
me to complete the fi ve stages of grief before I could see she was, as usual, right.
Thanks to Roxlyn Moret, yogi and hands-on healer, for her careful suggestions for Chapter 1.
Special thanks to David Genova for reviewing this book and making so many important sug-
gestions. You motivated me to tackle the big issues and improve the book all in one move.
Dedication
To my mother, father, and sister, who fi lled our home with Bach, Brubeck, and The Beatles.

Introduction
P
iano Exercises For Dummies is for people who love playing the piano and want to 
improve the way they play. I include more than 150 exercises, tips, and explanations to 
help you gain a greater understanding of your mental and physical approach to the piano. 
When you combine these exercises with a deeper understanding of how the piano works as 
an instrument, you can improve the quality of the music you make.
There is a certain paradox in linking exercise with playing the piano: Goals of building 
muscle strength and developing endurance through repetitive drills, and a “no pain, no gain” 
mindset don’t apply to music making. The awareness that mindless repetition of exercises 
devoid of musical content and context can be harmful is really the motivating force behind 
this book. Simply put, you can neither improve nor enjoy playing the piano if you’re bored, 
uncomfortable, or in pain. My goal is to encourage you, the reader, to become more mentally 
and physically engaged as you play. To that end, I include exercises that are fun and have 
plenty of variation in style, key, and tempo, so that your active participation will lead you to 
useful discoveries about the way you play the piano.
About This Book
As you glance through the chapter titles either in the table of contents or as you flip through 
the book, you’ll see that you can easily identify the technical skills each chapter addresses. 
Feel free to go right to a section that attracts your attention. You can pick and choose exer-
cises that address your needs — play some scales, work on your trills, or practice a contrary 
motion exercise — without playing any of the preceding exercises or reading any of the pre-
ceding chapters. As long as you keep in mind the basic approach of feeling comfortable at 
the piano and keeping mentally engaged while you exercise, you can set this book on your 
piano at any time and start anywhere you like.
I organize the chapters to follow a typical daily warm-up, starting with individual finger and 
hand exercises and moving into exercises that involve more of your body and integrate a 
wide variety of movement at the piano. As an excellent way to use this book, I suggest you 
pick a few exercises from each chapter as you go through the book, and create an exercise 
menu that works best for your day.
In most cases, each exercise fits on a single page and directly addresses a specific technical 
skill; the accompanying text helps explain and explore the technical problem at hand. I com-
posed, arranged, or adapted all the material with the objective of keeping it varied yet con-
sistent, and I engraved all the exercises with the goal of displaying all the notes, fingerings, 
and articulations as clearly as possible. The exercises avoid mechanical repetition, and I aim 
to keep things interesting by presenting the material in a variety of melodic, harmonic, and 
rhythmic settings.
In addition to the techniques most piano exercise books commonly address (finger 
independence, major and minor scales, chords, octaves, and arpeggios), this book has 
several special features and additions:
 
 Warming up away from the piano, with a section on posture, hand position, and com-
fortable movement at the keyboard
 
 Using the damper pedal
 
 Playing ornaments, rolled chords, glissandos, and tremolos

2
Piano Exercises For Dummies  
 
 Blues scales, diminished (or octatonic) scales, and chromatic scales
 
 Left-hand accompaniment patterns
 
 Chord progression exercises
 
 Rhythm exercises
 
 Performance pieces at the end of every chapter
 
 Ten extra dance pieces
I encourage you to try different exercises and vary your routine. Use this book to help you 
stay engaged and involved in your development.
Conventions Used in This Book
These conventions won’t seem unfamiliar to you if you’re used to reading music:
 
 Hands-alone and hands-together: When you see “practice this hands-alone,” it means 
to practice the right- and left-hand parts separately. “Play hands-together” means to 
play with both hands together.
 
 Finger numbers: Finger numbers apply to your fingers in the traditional way — in 
other words, your thumb is your first (finger one), your index finger is your second 
(finger two), and so on.
 
 Fingering: For the right hand, fingerings are placed above the staff, directly above the 
notes; for the left hand, fingerings are placed below the staff, directly below the notes.
 
 Key signatures: Nearly all the exercises in this book have a simple key signature. Each 
chapter has a mix of exercises with no flats or sharps and those with one or two sharps 
or flats.
 
 Time signatures: I try to keep a variety of time signatures in rotation throughout the 
book, but they’re all the types you commonly hear and see, including 4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 6/8, 
and 12/8.
 
 Performance piece: Each chapter ends with a performance piece. This is usually a rec-
ognizable song or piece adapted from our treasure-filled musical heritage. You can per-
form these pieces for others or simply enjoy them as your own reward for making it 
through the chapter.
 
 Metronome markings: All performance pieces and some exercises show a met-
ronome marking at the top of the music. These are my suggested tempos; always 
play at a tempo that feels comfortable for you.
What You’re Not to Read
If you just want to mine this book for fun and challenging exercises, you’re welcome to skip 
the text and play to your heart’s content. The various tips, reminders, and technical advice 
flagged with a friendly For Dummies icon aren’t essential to understanding what the exercises 
are for, so you can skip over them to get to the exercises, but I hope they’ll make things even 
more interesting and fun!

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
I made the following assumptions about you when I was writing this book:
 
 You picked up this book thinking that you’d sure like to have something new and inter-
esting to play when you warm up.
 
 You want to work on your piano skills.
 
 You may be feeling that familiar tug on your conscience that says, “I’d really like to 
improve my piano playing so I could play music I’ve always wanted to play,” or “I sure 
would love to play the piano more, if I could only find the time.”
 
 You don’t get inspired to do any of the above when you pick up an exercise book and 
see pages and pages of interminable sixteenth notes.
 
 You know how to read notes on the treble and bass staff and count rhythms at a basic 
level.
 
 You may have started taking lessons or have taken some piano lessons in the past.
 
 You may have already read Piano For Dummies by Blake Neely (Wiley) and are ready 
for more music.
 
 You have access to a piano.
If you’re a piano teacher, I assume that you wish you could find something fun and useful for 
your students to play for warming up and teaching technique. If so, I feel your pain and offer 
you this book.
If any of my assumptions are true, this book is for you.
How This Book Is Organized
Piano Exercises For Dummies is organized so that you quickly find and play the exercises that 
fit your needs, desires, or moods. The chapters are grouped into the following five parts, pro-
gressing along a typical warm-up sequence.
Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers
This part starts with simple exercises you can do away from the piano to get physically and 
mentally limber and loose. You review proper posture at the piano to make sure you’re as 
comfortable as possible when you play. In the next two chapters, you exercise the individual 
fingers of each hand and then work your fingers in different groups and combinations. You 
focus on finger movement, articulation, and play exercises in a variety of five-finger hand 
positions.
Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and 
Speedy Hand
In this part you take a look at the different ways you move your hand when you play the 
piano: Shifting hand positions, using your fingers together as a single unit, and playing 
chords. You practice finger crossovers and pass-unders, which are essential to shifting hand 
positions and playing smooth scales and melodic lines, and you learn a comfortable 
approach to playing chords.

Piano Exercises For Dummies  
Part III: Including Your Arms and Body
You work on techniques involving a greater range of arm movement in this part. You play a 
variety of scales up and down a two-octave range, and play exercises with your hands in par-
allel and contrary motion. A chapter devoted to the use of the damper pedal allows you to 
examine and improve how you use the pedal while you play. And you work on making jumps 
across the keyboard, developing a method to make accurate jumps of shorter and longer 
distances.
Part IV: Integration and Independence
Many of the previous techniques are integrated in more challenging exercises in this part. 
You get arpeggio exercises combined with hand position changes; finger crossovers com-
bined with arm crossovers; and scales and chords in a variety of rhythmic settings. Rhythm, 
in fact, is a big feature of this part. You can improve your ability to read and play more diffi-
cult rhythms through exercises that challenge you to think ahead, stay engaged with the 
page, and guide your hands successfully through tricky passages.
You work on chord progressions and cadences, with exercises in a variety of harmonic 
styles. Ornaments and other fancy techniques are also covered in this part. You play grace 
notes, trills, and other impressive decorations, and get definitions and explanations to match 
each ornament.
Part V: The Part of Tens
A favorite feature of any For Dummies book, the Part of Tens gives you super-special, no-
extra-charge, added bonus information and material. I start off by presenting ten one-page 
dances to play and satisfy your growing desire to put your newfound abilities to the test. And 
I give you a list of valuable exercise and étude collections by the greatest composers of piano 
music so that you can expand your technical horizons.
The CD
All this, and a CD, too?!? You bet. The CD that comes with Piano Exercises For Dummies is 
filled with tracks of me, your humble author, playing many exercises, all performance pieces, 
and the ten dances (from The Part of Tens). Listen to the CD to hear an example of how the 
exercises sound, study the way a certain rhythm should be played, enjoy my interpretation 
of the performance pieces, and inspire you to do your own thing.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll find the following four icons in the left-hand margins throughout this book:
 
I use this icon to pass along valuable information that may solve a technical problem or 
simply make playing a certain passage easier.

5
 Introduction
 
I use this icon when I want to remind you of the basics: be comfortable, think first, take a 
break, and so on.
 
I use this icon to give you technical information and trivia that you may have missed or for-
gotten while absorbing the hundreds of other details in music lessons when you were a kid.
 
I use this icon to alert you to a potential problem so that you can avoid injury, pain, or dis-
comfort; stay mentally tuned-in; and watch for an important detail in the music notation.
Where to Go from Here
Not sure where to begin? Chapter 1 is always a good option. Or maybe you want to jump 
around. Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you start the exercises:
 
 You can custom-make your own daily workout to suit your needs.
 
 The exercises can be effective at a variety of speeds. Adjust the tempo to match your 
comfort level as well as test your control.
 
 If you find some exercises too difficult, play them hands-alone at first.
 
 For a challenge, transpose an easy exercise up a step, or try to play an exercise 
written in G in the key of C.

Waking Up 
Your Fingers

In this part . . .
B
efore you begin blazing trails over the eighty-eights, 
make sure your mind and body are simpatico. In this 
part, you take a little time to warm up your body, monitor 
any discomfort, release any muscle tension and do a few 
relaxation and stretching exercises. When you go to the 
piano, you check out your posture and your body support 
so you can approach playing the piano in the most com-
fortable way possible.
As you start in on the exercises, you focus on the move-
ment of each individual finger and how you direct the 
movement with greater mental participation. As you 
develop a better awareness of movement at the piano you 
give yourself the best chance of supporting and control-
ling your fingers when you play.

Chapter 1
Getting Ready to Practice
In This Chapter
▶ Warming up your body
▶ Relaxing and stretching
▶ Checking your posture at the piano
▶ Moving at the piano
T
ake a few minutes to warm up and relax your body before you start to practice. Many 
musicians find that stretches, yoga, the Alexander Technique, and exercise in general 
help the physical component of playing music by heightening awareness of their bodies and 
the way they move. After a few stretches and warm-ups, you can bring a relaxed awareness 
to the piano when you practice.
The warm-ups in this chapter are designed to loosen and relax the areas piano players use 
the most: the fingers, hands, wrists, arms, shoulders, neck, back, and hips.
Warming Up Away from the Instrument
Why warm up away from the piano? Here are two reasons:
 
 To stretch and release muscles throughout your body from standing positions and 
floor positions
 
 To develop a routine of feeling loose and comfortable when you go to the piano
Plus, because you can do these warm-ups anywhere and anytime, you can start before you 
get to your piano.
Releasing tension and releasing your muscles
The basic pattern of tension and release is fundamental to music making, both in the physi-
cal process of playing and in the music itself. Playing the piano involves a wide range of 
movement, from pressing down a key with your fingertip to using your entire upper body in 
playing scales, arpeggios, and chords. Add in pedaling and you’re using your whole body. All 
this movement requires muscle flexion, extension, and rotation; and movement is enhanced 
by a fluid, relaxed approach that’s unhindered by excess tension in your body. And because 
piano playing requires so much mental participation along with this physical movement, it’s 
easy to overlook the buildup of tension: gripping in the neck, forearms, and jaw; hunching in 
the shoulders; and locking the joints in the fingers.

10
Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers  
 
These common manifestations of physical tension can easily become incorporated into 
your playing through the necessary repetition of practicing. So developing a pattern of 
releasing your muscles as you play and building this pattern into your playing are very 
important. Doing this also becomes a way to unify the physical and mental components of 
music making, because staying comfortable while you play requires constant monitoring for 
areas of discomfort.
Breathing in an unending circle
Breathing is the model for fluid motion. Think of breathing in an unending circle — the end 
of an inhalation is the beginning of an exhalation. When you play the piano you want to think 
of the music, your body, and your mind as part of this constant, fluid motion.
To create the smoothest, most luxurious breathing cycle you can imagine, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your shoulders and arms relaxed at your side as you develop this 
slow cycle of inhalation and exhalation.
 
2. Inhale through your nose slowly and evenly, deeply filling your lungs over a 
smooth arc of time.
 
3. Turn the inhalation into an exhalation without holding your breath, like a 
swimmer reverses direction in a pool, always in motion.
 
4. Exhale fully, without pushing, and let go of all the air until you’re ready to 
begin another inhalation.
 
5. As you develop this slow cycle, let all your muscles relax and let go in the 
same rhythm.
Allow the breath to widen your upper body, back, shoulders, and neck so that you feel as if 
you’re loosening and lengthening throughout your body.
Massaging, stretching, and contracting 
your hands
Give all your joints, muscles, and bones in one hand a gentle massage with the other hand 
(see Figure 1-1). Squeeze, rub, stretch — do whatever feels soothing. Start with your wrist 
bones and work toward the fingertips, thoroughly massaging the top, sides, and bottom of 
your hand, and then switch to the other hand.
Follow these steps for an effective hand stretch:
 
1. Spread your fingers into a comfortably wide span, palms down.
 
2. Contract your hand, bringing your thumb all the way under your pinky so you 
make an “X” with the thumb and pinky under the other fingers, as shown in 
Figure 1-2.
 
3. Spread your fingers into a wide span again.
 
4. Contract your hand, making the “X” with your pinky under your thumb, 
releasing all the way back along the finger joints to the wrist.
 
5. Repeat this exercise a few times, and then try it with your thumb crossing 
under and then over your fourth, third, and second fingers.

Continue your warm-up by contracting your hand:
 
1. Make a tight fist and wrap your thumb across the outside of fingers two 
through five (see Figure 1-3).
 
2. Expand all your fingers, with space between each finger in a comfortable 
stretch.
 
3. Close your fist again, this time with the thumb tucked inside fingers two 
through five.
 
4. Repeat with both hands, alternating the thumb position.

Warming up your wrists
Give your wrists a warm-up by following these steps:
 
1. Hold your hands in front of you, palms facing away, as if to signal “stop” with 
both hands (see Figure 1-4).
 
2. With a loose wrist, slowly circle your hands both clockwise and 
counterclockwise.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Hold your 
hands out 
and slowly 
move them 
in circles.
 
 
3. Bring your hands together in front of you like you’re praying, palm-to-palm, 
finger-to-finger, and extend your elbows out to the side.
 
4. Slowly rotate your wrists so that your fingers point toward you, and then away 
from you, and finally down to the ground, as shown in Figure 1-5.
 
5. Repeat a few times as you loosen your wrists.

Swinging and twisting your arms
Try this exercise and then enjoy the looseness you feel throughout your arms:
 
1. Swing your forearms up from your elbows to the side to touch your thumb to 
your shoulder (see Figure 1-6a).
 
2. Let your forearms swing down gently, the momentum extending your arms out 
behind you but without reaching back (see Figure 1-6b).

To continue stretching your arms, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand facing a wall, at an arm’s length away.
 
2. Reach both arms straight to the wall, at eye level, and put your hands on the 
wall, fingers pointing up, feeling your entire palm and all fingers firmly 
against the wall (see Figure 1-7).
 
3. Extend your arms to their fullest extension by taking tiny steps backward.
 
4. Relax and let your arms rest at your side.
 
5. Repeat this stretch, but with the fingers of both hands pointing in toward each 
other, and then pointing out to the side, and then pointing down to the floor.

Finish your arm stretches with this exercise:
 
1. Stand perpendicular to a wall with your right side closest to the wall, at arm’s 
length.
 
2. Reach your right arm straight out to the wall and put your hand flat against 
the wall, fingers pointing up.
 
3. Slowly and gently look left as you extend your right arm into the wall (see 
Figure 1-8).
 
4. Use your left hand to massage the tight areas around your right shoulder and 
clavicle.
 
5. Repeat on the other side.

Stretching your shoulders and neck
To stretch your shoulders and neck, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand with your head in a neutral position and your hands at your sides.
 
2. Hunch your shoulders (see Figure 1-9) straight up to chin level, and then 
release down.
 
3. Circle your shoulders front to back, and back to front as you hunch and 
release.
 
Figure 1-9: 
Hunch and 
release your 
shoulders.
 
Work on this shoulder and neck warm-up next:
 
1. Reach your right hand up and behind your right shoulder to touch the shoul-
der blade on your right side.
 
2. Bring your left hand behind your back at the waistline, and reach up to touch 
your right hand.
 
 If you can’t reach, try dangling a strap, belt, or some other suitable extension so 
your left hand can grab on (see Figure 1-10).
 
3. Repeat these steps with your hands reversed.
To continue your shoulder and neck stretches, follow these steps:
 
1. Grab the top of your head with your right hand and touch the top of your left 
shoulder with your left hand.
 
2. As shown in Figure 1-11, use your right hand to gently guide your head down 
to the right, toward your right shoulder.
 
3. At the same time, gently pull down on your left shoulder with your left hand, 
giving your neck muscles a nice stretch.
 
4. Repeat the stretch on the opposite side.

 Chapter 1: Getting Ready to Practice
Working on your back
The following exercise will stretch your back:
 
1. Stand with your feet just a few inches apart, fold your arms in front of you, 
and cup each elbow with the opposite hand.
 
2. Looking down to the floor, bend your knees and squat down, and let your 
elbows reach toward the floor in front of your feet.
 
3. Lower your head forward so you’re looking at your knees and your back is 
nicely rounded (see Figure 1-12).
 
4. Slowly rise up, still holding your elbows and bringing your arms up above 
your head to reach, lengthen, stretch, and widen your back.
 
Figure 1-12: 
Round your 
back before 
reaching up 
to stretch.
 
 
If you want to do more back stretches, I recommend two yoga poses that are excellent for 
your back: Cat Pose and Child’s Pose. For more on these and other poses, check out Yoga 
For Dummies, by Georg Feuerstein, Larry Payne, and Lilias Folan (Wiley).
Stretching your hamstrings
Sitting can be a lot of work! Tight hamstrings can make it difficult for you to sit at the piano 
because the tight muscles pull down on the back of the pelvis, which means you have to do a 
lot of work to get your upper body balanced on your sitting bones. (You’ll read more about 
this in the next section.) So stretch those hamstrings, too, by following these steps:
 
1. Keep your legs and back straight as you stand and bend at the waist.
 
2. Reach with your arms to the floor to stretch your hamstrings.
 
 If you can’t reach the floor, reach down to a piano bench or low table placed in 
front of you (see Figure 1-13).

Perfecting Practice with Proper Posture
Start with a common-sense approach to your posture: Aim to situate yourself comfortably in 
a stable, balanced position so you can play and read music, with room to move freely. The 
trouble is, piano players can get so caught up in the complication of notes, clefs, fingering, 
rhythms, and dynamics that they often forget about their bodies. So a reminder to monitor 
your comfort level and make appropriate adjustments is always a good thing.
Sitting at the piano: Height and angle
If you’re too close to the piano, you cramp up your arms and scrunch your shoulders. If 
you’re too far away, you overreach, putting stress on those parts (the neck, upper arm, and 
pelvic support) that have to work to support your overextended parts. You want to feel com-
fortably loose, with enough room to move freely and enough support to feel light and long in 
the upper body and head. You should be able to move easily in either direction of the key-
board, just enough to follow and support your arms when they venture away from the 
middle to the high or low registers.
Check that your bench or chair is the right height. A common way to measure this is by 
seeing that your elbows are even with the height of the keyboard when you’re sitting at the 
piano with your hands in playing position. You should see a slight arc from the elbow to the 
top of your wrist and back down your hand to the keyboard. You have a big advantage if you 
use an adjustable bench or chair (available on the Web at places like www.cpsimports.com 
and www.pianobench.com). The benches that come with most pianos aren’t a comfortable 
height for many people. If you don’t want to buy an adjustable chair or bench, a typical 
kitchen chair is a good alternative.
Good posture is all about support. Think about building support from the ground up:
 
1. With the floor and the bench or chair providing your support base, align your 
body so your torso, shoulders, neck, and head are fully supported from 
underneath.

19
 Chapter 1: Getting Ready to Practice
 
2. With both feet on the floor, and with your knees directly above your feet, sit 
evenly on your sitting bones so you feel a strong, stable support for your 
upper body.
 
3. Don’t let your weight fall back; bring the back of your pelvis (your hip bones 
on the sides and sacrum in the back) up above the sitting bones, and continue 
this line of support up through your spine to the top of your head.
 
 Your spine has four curves; it takes careful awareness and support in both the 
front and back to balance and feel centered throughout your upper body.
 
4. Keep your head supported above your spine; don’t let it drop or lean in any 
direction.
 
 If you’re hunching, slouching, or leaning, you’re going to have to use your mus-
cles and energy to compensate for the imbalance.
 
5. Release your shoulders if they’re holding any tension, and let your arms hang 
to the side.
 
6. As you breathe in, feel the full length of your upper body from the sitting 
bones to the top of your head.
 
7. Breathe out and feel a relaxed, stable balance throughout your body.
Getting a handle on proper hand position
Your hands should feel supported by your shoulders and arms, balanced and relaxed so 
they can move as easily as possible. Your wrist should be high enough that your fingers 
make a slightly curved shape with the fingertips on the keys, but not so high that you restrict 
movement. You should see a rounded shape created by the soft, relaxed undersides of your 
fingers and palm, similar to the shape of your hand draped around the fist of the other hand, 
as shown in Figure 1-14.
 
Figure 1-14: 
Drape one 
hand around 
the fist of 
your other 
hand.
 

20
Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers  
As you move up and down the keyboard, try to keep this shape and feeling, with a minimum 
of twisting at the wrist.
Hands on the fallboard: Counting out loud 
and bouncing
Close the fallboard over the piano keys, and place your hands in playing position, as I 
describe in the previous section. With your fingertips touching the top of the fallboard, 
count out a steady, moderate, four-beat pattern of eighth notes, “one, and, two, and, three, 
and, four, and . . .” (see Figure 1-15). With a smooth motion, lightly bounce your wrists down 
on the beats and back up on the “ands” between the beats.

eighth-
notes.

You’re creating a model for playing the piano in tempo; remember this model when you play 
the exercises in this book and any other music. You’re counting and moving with the beat, 
your wrists are free and loose, and your fingers are in a nice, rounded shape. Incorporate 
this model into your fluid motion cycle, reading music and playing the piano in the motion of 
tempo and the musical phrase. The combination of reading music, counting, and playing on 
the keyboard in a steady, continuous tempo may sound complex, but it’s easier and more 
musical when you incorporate all the elements into one activity.
Hands on the fallboard: Hand arches and 
finger drops
The next exercise gives you practice switching comfortably from a contracted, arched hand 
position to an open hand position with your fingers loosely extended. To do the exercise, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Let your hands rest, palms down, on top of the fallboard.
 
2. Raise your wrists as you touch your fingertips together in a point, fingers 
extended and still touching the wood (see Figure 1-16).
 
3. Spread your fingers and let your wrists drop easily until your palms are on the 
fallboard again.
 
4. Repeat several times.

Hands on the fallboard: Rotation in and out, 
movement up and down the keyboard
The next exercise gives you an example of how small forearm rotation should feel. You use 
this motion when playing broken-chord figures like the Alberti bass pattern in Chapter 11. To 
do a rotation exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. Start with your hands in playing position, fingertips on the wood, wrists fairly 
high (see Figure 1-17).
 
2. Rotate your wrist slowly to the left, and then to the right, feeling the weight 
transfer across your entire hand, through your wrist, knuckles, and fingertips.

play the scales in Chapter 7 — try this exercise:
 
1. Start with your hands in playing position, fingertips on the wood.
 
2. Move your hands, forearms, and elbows evenly out to the sides and back in, 
keeping them all on the same plane, as if they were riding on a lateral-moving 
elevator (see Figure 1-18).

Hands on the keyboard: Sound and movement 
on the keys
After completing the exercises in the previous sections, lift the fallboard to see those 88 keys 
eagerly awaiting your tingling fingers. You have to be willing to make some unusual music for 
this exercise, but give it a try: Playing and missing any notes that happen along the way, do 
the wrist bounces, hand arches and finger drops, wrist rotations, and lateral-movement exer-
cises on the keys. Just try to maintain the position, support, ease of movement, and relaxed 
feeling you develop throughout this chapter.
Overcoming other posture pitfalls
Be on the lookout for signs of tension: Hunching or muscle grabbing in the shoulders and arms; 
facial tics (biting or grimacing, clenching in the jaw); and stiffness in the neck or fingers. These 
points of tension may be indirectly caused by inadequate support, but you can ease them by 
including them in the larger cycle of tension and release — your fluid motion cycle.
When you release tension, you clear a path for your mind to guide the search for solutions to 
your technical problems. Technical problems don’t get solved by playing a passage over and 
over, hoping to get it right one time, but by engaging your mind to consider changes and 
adjustments, examine the results, and lead your body toward new solutions.
 
Be careful when the instrument may be part of the problem. For example, you may be sit-
ting too low or high on a bench or chair that you can’t adjust; a piano action may require 
extra work; a piano may produce inadequate tone; or you may have an electronic piano 
without weighted action . You may want to limit practice time and take more frequent 
breaks if you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation!
 
If you use an electronic keyboard and/or a digital piano, be especially careful not to injure 
yourself while playing. Turning down the volume to a very low level to avoid disturbing 
family, friends, and neighbors can lead you to compensate by over-pounding so you can 
hear yourself play. Instead, use headphones or earbuds with the volume adjusted to a level 
similar to what you experience in normal piano playing.

Chapter 2
Isolating and Exercising Your Fingers
In This Chapter
▶ Supporting and controlling each individual finger
▶ Exercising in groups of two-, three-, and four-finger combinations
▶ Playing a performance piece with a melodic line in each hand
H
ave you ever wished you had complete control of all your fingers when you play the 
piano, and complete control over dynamics and speed? If you have, join the club. But 
take a look at your hand, and then at the keyboard. It’s not a natural fit, to say the least. All 
your fingers are a different length, and each finger has a different set of muscles and a differ-
ent way to make the keys on the piano go down. Your fingers get exercise every day when 
you write, beckon, grasp, shake, wave, twiddle, and point. (Not to mention your repeat ren-
ditions of “Itsy-Bitsy Spider” for the kids.) But when you put your hands on the keyboard, 
your fingers need some extra help to make the music you want to make.
Developing control and agility starts with isolating each finger so you can learn how each 
one moves as you strike a key. And if you’re a little wary, not to worry: By giving your brain 
information on each finger, you allow it to figure out how to move the fingers the way you 
want them to move. The secret is that you can get around your limitations with a little 
brainpower.
Finger strength comes with freedom of movement. When you tense, or hold, your muscles, 
you restrict your movement. So you want your fingers to feel comfortable. But they also need 
support. After you develop firm joints in the fingers and give each finger the support of your 
hand, wrist, arm, and on through the body, the strength will come from the movement itself. 
(You can read more about hand position in Chapter 1.)
The exercises in this chapter are combined so you can exercise your fingers in groups of 
twos, threes, and fours. Exercises for the left hand come first so you don’t neglect it. Each 
exercise challenges your control by starting with eighth-note patterns and changing to triplet 
and then sixteenth-note patterns.
By the end of the chapter you’ll be warmed-up for the performance piece, “Come Back to 
Sorrento,” arranged in the style of a two-part invention.
Two-Finger Exercises for the Left Hand
When doing these exercises, don’t start out too fast. Even though you begin with eighth-
notes, you have to stay in the same tempo when you get to the triplets and sixteenth notes. 
Adjust the tempo until you’re comfortable playing the sixteenths and start from there.
Exaggerate the articulations and dynamics as you practice and improve. The more you can 
emphasize the difference in note length and volume, the more you’re in control.

24
Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers  
 
Play the two-note slurs in the last two measures with an easy, down-up motion starting in 
the wrist. Keep your hand shape nice and round throughout, especially for the outside fin-
gers, four and five.
 
Don’t cheat the beat! Make sure you give quarter notes their full value. It’s tempting to cut 
the beat short so you can get on to playing more notes. Better to count the full beat while 
feeling a relaxed and fluid motion in your hand.

Three-Finger Exercises for the Right Hand
Because you use your right hand to play melodies most of the time, it’s important to practice 
playing melodically. These exercises give you a chance to work on singing with your fingers. 
Shape the melodic phrases as if you were singing them by adding some of your own fine-
tuned dynamics. For example, increase the volume on a steadily rising phrase and decrease 
the volume on a descending phrase.
Fingers one, two, and three (right hand)
 
When you find your thumb on a black key, look to see that you’re touching the edge of the 
key and aren’t sliding in more than you need to. Angle your thumb down from your nicely 
arched hand.

Four-Finger Exercises for the Left Hand
As you try these exercise patterns across your hand, you may hear that the notes played 
with fingers four and five sound softer than those played with fingers two and three. Keep 
your hand shape nice and round throughout these exercises, especially for the outside fin-
gers, four and five. Make sure you don’t collapse in the finger joints closest to your fingertips 
or the wrists when you play notes with these fingers.
You can increase the loudness of each note by increasing your attack speed — a faster speed 
of attack will get a louder sound. By making sure fingers four and five have good shape and 
support, you make it easier to match attack speeds in all your fingers.

Performance Piece: “Come Back to Sorrento”
In this arrangement, the melody of the song starts in the left hand and moves to the right 
hand when the key changes from A minor to A major. This gives you an opportunity to make 
dynamic contrasts between the melody in one hand and the countermelody in the other, as 
well as gradations within each part. Try bringing the melody out front by playing it a little 
louder, or by playing the countermelody a little softer.

Music for Five Fingers
In This Chapter
▶ Developing stronger articulation skills
▶ Exercising with five-finger scales
▶ Exercising hands-together
▶ Playing your own Paganini variation
I
n this chapter you exercise all the fingers together on each hand, first separately and 
then together. The exercises will help you develop the control you need to balance and 
shape melodic lines in each hand.
In the first two sections, you work on developing a greater command of articulation — playing 
legato lines more smoothly and playing staccato phrases with clean, crisp precision. You 
focus on exactly how to move to get the most expression with the least amount of work. 
Then you start to exercise in a variety of five-finger hand positions: major scale, minor scale, 
extended whole-tone scale, and contracted chromatic scale positions. After you work both 
hands separately, you play exercises with your hands together.
Have you heard of the Italian violinist Niccolo Paganini, who blazed a path to stardom with 
his speed and dexterity? He wrote a violin piece that other composers have used as a theme 
for their own virtuosic flights. At the end of this chapter, it’s your turn to burn up the keys 
with a variation all your own. The performance piece combines the articulations and five-
finger-position scale runs from the exercises in an arrangement of Paganini’s famous theme.
 
Niccolo Paganini (1782–1840), violin virtuoso, was known for a level of technical skill not 
seen on the concert stage at the time. He wrote music to feature his wizardry, including his 
Caprice No. 24, which has a theme that many other composers have used as a take-off point 
for their own variations. The best known of these are Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Liszt. 
Composer Witold Lutoslawski (1913–1994) also wrote variations on this theme, to be played 
by two pianists on two pianos!

36
Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers 
Smooth Articulation: Playing Legato
The goal of playing legato is to play all the notes inside a legato slur smoothly and evenly, 
without any break in the melodic line as you play note to note. To practice this, go for an 
overlap from one note to the next, finger-to-finger. Play the first note, and then overlap by 
releasing the key just after the next note sounds. You can exaggerate this at first, so you can 
hear both notes sounding at the same time; then minimize the overlap to the point where 
you’re satisfied with a smooth legato transition from one note to the next. Listen to the over-
all phrase, and make slight changes in loudness within the phrase to give it a nice shape.

 Chapter 3: Music for Five Fingers
Short Articulation: Playing Staccato
Your goal here is to make every staccato eighth note the same length, and that length should 
be short! One way to do this is to create the same amount of “space” between each staccato 
note. Listen for the space between the notes as much as you listen to the notes themselves. 
You’ll find that by keeping a firm joint on each finger, you can quickly lift your hand straight 
up off the keyboard as you release each note. As you play faster passages and faster tempos, 
you can minimize this move until the key release is only at the fingertip.

Developing Right-Hand Finger Independence 
with Five-Finger Position Scales
Time to work by playing notes within a five-note hand position, changing positions as you 
change phrases. These exercises are good for testing your speed and control. Try playing 
these faster and slower to find out where you lose control. Is it one finger in particular? At a 
certain tempo? After you find your limits, practice within them and expand them step-by-step.
 
These exercises begin with two eighth-note pickups. When you start a phrase with a pickup, 
think of the pickup notes as moving toward the downbeat, with a bit of emphasis on the 
downbeat itself.

Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers 
Doubling the Fun: Putting 
the Hands Together
Right-hand and left-hand parts share the same rhythm in these exercises so you can match 
the articulation and dynamics as closely as possible. If you notice that one hand sounds 
weaker than the other, practice hands separately with the stronger hand first, and follow 
right after with the weaker hand so it can “copy” the stronger one.

Part I: Waking Up Your Fingers 
Performance Piece: Paganini Variation 
for Ten Fingers
In this piece, your hands move from one five-finger position to another. Spend some time 
plotting out when the positions change and how far the moves will be. This way, your mind 
is engaged and in control, directing your hands from position to position. As you become 
more familiar with the moves, you can increase your speed.

Par t II
Developing a Strong, 
Supple, and Speedy Hand

 In this part . . .
You start to move your hand over more and more key-
board territory and build your chord playing skills. 
Traversing the keyboard means working on fundamental 
finger moves: crossing a finger over and passing a finger 
under another finger to shift hand positions. The chord 
work in this part starts with practice moving two fingers 
together as a single unit, playing two notes at the same 
time. Then you move on to three-note chord exercises that 
take you through a series of steps to ensure comfortable, 
solid chord playing while releasing any muscle tension.

Chapter 4
Passing Under and Crossing Over
In This Chapter
▶ Working on the mechanics of getting around the keyboard
▶ Smoothing your traversing technique
▶ Extending the scale beyond five-finger position
▶ Playing a performance piece with scale runs
O
ne of the biggest challenges in developing a good technique is smoothing out the tran-
sitions as you move your hands up and down the keyboard. Imagine playing fluid 
lines, shifting hand positions seamlessly, and covering the keyboard territory with flexible 
fingering. You often hear people say, “They make it look easy,” when they watch great piano 
players. That’s because great piano players have figured out how to make it easy for 
themselves.
Before Bach’s time, keyboard players avoided using their thumbs, which must have resulted 
in some really awkward fingerwork, I’d say. Adding the thumb means you can play more 
notes within one hand position, but the problem remains that the thumb has a very different 
size, shape, and angle when compared with the other fingers. If you run out of fingers when 
the melodic line continues up or down, you have to move your hand position, and do it with-
out breaking the musical line. The two best options are to pass the thumb under or cross the 
other fingers over.
The keyboard terrain sets up different scenarios for these transitions, with possibilities avail-
able in the various white and black key combinations. Because the thumb is shorter, the easi-
est way to cross over it or pass it under is with a black-white combination, because you can 
use the key height and location to your advantage. With one of your long fingers on a black 
key you naturally elevate your hand, like a bridge, for your thumb to pass under. With your 
thumb on a white key, it’s easier to cross a long finger over if it’s reaching for a black key. It’s 
more difficult to pass or cross from white key to white key because you have less room to 
pass under and farther to cross over. These more difficult transitions can cause you to twist 
your hand position, flare out your elbow, tuck in your elbow, or otherwise contort yourself 
as you move up or down the keyboard, and the extra movement can get in the way of playing 
smoothly and comfortably.
The answer is to keep your hand quiet, and keep your arm perpendicular to the keyboard as 
you move out to the extremes or into the middle. This will make your scale runs sound 
smooth and feel more comfortable. But making these traverses seamless does take practice. 
The exercises in this chapter give you practice crossing over and passing under with differ-
ent finger combinations, using a variety of scales. You also discover how to make these tran-
sitions more comfortable.

48
Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
The performance piece at the end of the chapter showcases your smooth scale runs. It’s an 
arrangement of an aria from the opera La Cenerentola (Cinderella) by Rossini.
One Under Two, Two Over One
You first want to find a hand shape that eases the transition from one hand position to the 
next. Start by making a rounded “O” shape with fingers one and two. It helps to keep the two 
fingertips relatively close together and the top of your hand raised high but still flat. Now feel 
your fingertips on each key as you play the exercise. Make sure you’re not flattening your 
thumb or hitting the key with the side of your thumb. Similarly, watch that you’re not overex-
tending your second finger; you want to come down on the key with the center of your fin-
gertip. You may find it easier to straighten your second finger a bit as it crosses over your 
thumb to play a black key and curve it a bit when it plays a white key. You can apply this to 
your third and fourth finger in the following exercises.

 Chapter 4: Passing Under and Crossing Over
One Under Three, Three Over One
Work on smoothing out your hand movements with this exercise. Keep your hand position 
quiet, and watch for any unnecessary twisting. Moving sideways smoothly, make sure you 
don’t collapse your wrist when you pass your thumb under. You can hear when this hap-
pens, because the notes you play with the thumb stand out with a “thunk.”
 
If you play a note unintentionally louder or softer than others, or too early or late, you may 
have lost control of the attack speed and timing. You can control the volume of a note if you 
think ahead to plan a hand shape that allows control of the attack speed. You can control 
your timing by guiding your fingers to perform a smooth movement.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
One Under Four, Four Over One
This finger combination is more challenging because you need to contract your hand fully 
for the position shift and still make it sound smooth and effortless. Watch your fingers once 
as they make the shift: Is your thumb or fourth finger aiming too far? Often you can cut down 
on the movement by making sure the crossing/passing finger hits the nearest spot on the key 
to strike it comfortably. Try watching your fingers carefully to see whether you’re 
overreaching.
 
Remember to relax! When you’re contracting your hand or reaching over and under, make 
sure you’re not locking up, or holding, in any of your joints — especially the thumb. Feel an 
easy, fluid motion as you move.

 Chapter 4: Passing Under and Crossing Over
Performance Piece: Aria from La Cenerentola
The charming character of this aria is well suited to polishing your graceful scale runs and 
light, staccato touch. Try singling out the sixteenth-note scale runs to practice the cross-
overs and pass-unders before you play the piece. Make as much contrast as you can between 
the staccato and legato, and remember that the rests can be as important as the notes.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 

Chapter 5
Playing Intervals
In This Chapter
▶ Playing two notes at the same time
▶ Focusing on finger placement and timing
▶ Exercising finger combinations with greater control
▶ Playing a piece with intervals in both hands
P
laying piano can be like having a choir at your fingertips. You have a ten-member 
group, some are shorter and some are taller, some like to show off and some prefer to 
blend in, and one or two really don’t take well to being singled out. As the conductor of the 
fingertip chorale, you have control over how each “voice” in your choir responds to your 
direction. You can bring up the bass, hush the choir while the soprano has a solo, or lift up 
every voice for the full-out finale.
This chapter gives you some exercises to gain command over each finger combination so 
that when you’re playing two notes together you have the strength and control to balance 
and blend. These interval exercises also let you scrutinize the many combinations of fingers, 
intervals, and positions on the keyboard to get to know how each finger responds. Special 
attention is given to strengthening those fingers that need it the most, but we try not to 
embarrass those fingers in front of the others!
When you’re done with these exercises you can bring the same approach to playing chords 
in the next chapter. You’ll be adjusting the balance of things, fine-tuning your touch as you 
play.
Playing Seconds with Different 
Finger Combinations
Seconds are any interval combination on adjacent keys, white or black. Because of the key-
board layout, that means a variety of hand and finger positions to work on.
Each of the finger combination exercises in this section includes a study for the right hand 
and the left hand separately. Play through these exercises a few times slowly at first — con-
centrating on each hand — listening carefully to adjust the balance and timing of each finger 
combination. Curve your fingers and keep the finger joints firm to play the seconds evenly. 
Then gradually increase your speed each time you play the exercise. As you increase your 
speed and accuracy, play this section as a series, starting with the right and left hand in the 
first finger combination, moving on to the right and left hand in the next finger combination, 
and so on.
 
As you play the seconds with each finger combination, imagine the two fingers moving 
together as one unit. In the first combination, for example, finger two and finger three 
move together to strike each interval in a synchronized motion.

56
Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
Finger combination: Two and three
Start with two of your most agile fingers, your second and third fingers. Adjust your attack 
and your timing to play the seconds evenly while changing hand positions.

Playing Thirds with Different Finger 
Combinations
These exercises improve your agility as you maneuver both major and minor thirds. The dif-
ferent finger combinations keep all your fingers nimble so you can use all five fingers more 
confidently.
Finger combination: One and three
Take a look at your hand position as you get ready to play. Make sure you have a nice, high 
arch to your hand, and let your fingers hang down and your fingertips lightly touch the keys.

Here’s your “Mt. Everest” exercise for the thirds. Keep your wrists up high, and lift your fin-
gers up like spider legs, bringing them down evenly in twos. And not too fast on this one — 
taking it slow and developing control are fine; stay relaxed and melt into the keys.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
Playing Fourths with Different Finger 
Combinations
Practicing fourths is really good for finger independence. The different finger combinations 
keep your muscle coordination sharp.
Finger combinations: One and four, 
two and five
This one is especially good for the fourth finger. Work on keeping it curved, and prepare it 
directly above the key that it’s going to strike. If you feel like giving yourself a challenge, try 
to play both hands at the same time!

You’re stretching out into a wider hand position here. Check that you’re maintaining a good 
shape in your fifth finger, that it’s not flat as it reaches to play its note. You can give your 
pinky some help by letting go of the fourth interval and moving your hand out, keeping the 
arched shape, toward the pinky.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
Playing Fifths, Sixths, and Sevenths
As you exercise these larger intervals, you also get good preparation for chord playing, 
which is covered in Chapter 6. Your hand is open wider and you’re moving your hand across 
the keyboard while maintaining a nice, rounded hand shape. The overall goal here is to 
watch for unnecessary twisting from side to side.
Exercise in fifths
 
12/8 time is counted as 12 eighth notes to a measure, with each eighth note getting one 
count. Each measure can have a rhythmic pattern of four strong beats, on one, four, seven, 
and ten, with three eighth notes inside each strong beat.
You may not think about it so much, but your shortest fingers are the pinky and the thumb, 
and they’re so important in piano playing. Keep both five and one pointing down into the 
keys — don’t collapse the high-arch shape you’ve been working on! And keep your wrist 
loose and supple so you’re not holding any tension there.

This familiar old ballpark favorite is arranged with — you guessed it — different interval 
combinations in each hand. Play each interval pair by using a single, confident hand move, 
with the same gusto you have when you sing out the tune from the bleachers.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 

Chapter 6
Playing Chords Without Tension
In This Chapter
▶ Playing chords solidly and releasing tension
▶ Improving chord voicing
▶ Practicing with chord progressions
▶ Combining chords with melody
▶ Playing a performance piece with chords in both hands
C
hord playing is one of the greatest pleasures — and biggest advantages — of playing 
the piano. The piano sounds best when you make the most of its full harmonic 
potential.
To get your piano to really sing out, you need flexibility in the wrist to increase your attack 
speed when you play chords. To balance, or voice, the chord notes, you need control in your 
fingers to vary the quality of your touch. Naturally, you want to dig into the big chords and 
get your hands around the really fat harmonies, but keeping stiff fingers and awkward hand 
positions is tiring and can potentially cause some physical problems. Avoiding these prob-
lems and improving your chord voicing are the benefits of learning how to relieve the ten-
sion in your fingers, hands, and arms.
This chapter helps you learn to play chords with a relaxed approach, gain a better chord 
technique, and improve your sound. You can use the exercises to develop fluid motion and 
release muscle tension as part of a cycle to practice with each chord. The exercises start 
with single chords, move into a variety of chord progressions, and then combine melody 
with chords. You finish up with a performance piece that lets you set the room resonating 
with vibrant chords.
Chord Relaxation
The most important thing to do is make sure you don’t hold tension in your hands, arms, and 
body when you play chords. You do need a certain amount of muscle tone and firmness in 
the finger joints to play nice, solid chords, but you also want to build in the habit of releasing 
tension while you play. As you exercise, monitor your body for any area in which you may be 
holding tension — your arms, shoulders, neck, or even your face (in the form of a grimace or 
facial tic). Your aim is to breathe through your body as you play and to establish a cyclical 
pattern of tension and release.

72
Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
A simple two-chord progression
Start with this simple two-chord progression, and put the following steps into a cycle for 
each chord:
  
5
3
1
5
4
2
1
1
3
5
1
2
4

1. With your hands held slightly above the notes in the chord, imagine the shape 
of the chord in your mind and feel (but don’t play yet!) that shape in your 
fingers.
 
2. Allow your arm weight to drop onto the keyboard as you comfortably play the 
chord and hold the shape in your fingers.
 
3. With a loose, flexible feeling in your wrists, let the weight travel and be 
absorbed in your wrists with a light bounce.
 
4. Keeping the chord notes held down, let the wrist float back up and release the 
notes under your fingers as you lift up from the keyboard, releasing any 
muscle tension in your fingers, hands, arms, and shoulders.
During the rest between the two chords, release any tension throughout your arms and 
torso, and prepare for the next chord shape as in Step 1.
A longer progression
Now try practicing the cycle in a longer progression. Don’t hold any stiffness — after playing 
a chord, let your wrist relax and absorb the weight you’ve put into the keys. Instead of chan-
neling the weight to your fingertips and holding it there as you press down the keys, let it 
travel to your wrists where the weight is absorbed and released with a slight bounce. You 
need to maintain just enough muscle tone and shape in your hands and fingers to hold down 
each chord note.

 Chapter 6: Playing Chords Without Tension
Finding the places to release muscle tension depends on the type of chordal passage you’re 
playing. During a rest you have an obvious spot to relax your hands and release your mus-
cles. On long-held chords you can release tension while holding down the notes, and you can 
find quick “breaths” as you release staccato chords. You’ll have plenty of examples to prac-
tice these releases in the following exercises.
Voicing Chords
Every time you strike a chord you get to be a sound engineer — you can set your own EQ (or 
equalizer) levels with each chord. Maybe you want to hear more bass, more top note, or 
bring out the notes in the middle for the fullest sound possible. Most of the time you want 
the top note to sing out the strongest, with support from the bottom note next and the inner 
chord notes balanced next. When you play chords you continually fine-tune your voicing to 
highlight melodic movement that takes place within a chordal setting.
You can custom-balance each chord tone with subtle differences in your attack speed. You 
achieve this with variations in the quality of touch for each finger. The piano is designed to 
transmit and, in effect, amplify these nuances from the key to the hammer to the strings and 
into sound. Any number of variations in your touch affect the attack speed of each chord 
tone. Experiment with voicing in the next exercise, bringing out the moving voice, which 
changes from the top, to the middle, to the bottom note of the chord.
 
When you want to bring out a certain note within a chord, try using a gentle touch on the 
other chord notes. A gentle touch should slow the attack speed, bringing down their volume.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
Chord Repetition
Tension and fatigue often come with playing passages of repeated chords. The challenge is 
to find a way to stay in a fluid cycle that allows some muscle release while keeping enough 
shape and tone to maintain a full, even sound.
Pulsing rhythms
This first exercise in repeated chords gives you practice with both short and long articula-
tion. Keep your wrist high and loosely relaxed for the faster eighth-note chords, making 
room for a light bounce off the keyboard as you release the keys. Relax into the keys on the 
long quarter-note chords.

 Chapter 6: Playing Chords Without Tension
Changing dynamics
Now practice this same method while changing the dynamic range. Make sure you’re playing 
all the chord notes when you play very softly — don’t let your hands or fingers go slack. 
Increase the volume with a quicker attack speed rather than by hitting the keys harder.
 
Your fingers and wrist can move more quickly if they’re not locked in tension. Keep enough 
tone in your wrist for the faster chord repetition, and then release any muscle tension on 
the long chords.

Simple Progressions, Adding 
Small Arm Motions
As you play chords in longer progressions, you’ll get a better overall musical shape if you 
physically help shape the dynamics and phrasing. You can allow the melodic movement of 
the chords and the phrasing, indicated by the slur, to lead your hands and arms with a 
small, circular motion. Match your movement to the rhythmic motion and dynamic shape of 
the music.

 Chapter 6: Playing Chords Without Tension
Chord and Melody Combination Exercises
The next exercises give you practice with some of the most common ways chords are com-
bined with melody. Practice the cycle of tension and release with each exercise.
Chord and melody combo #1
The melody to the African American spiritual “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” provides a nice set-
ting for gospel-style chords. The hands trade off with the melody and three-part chordal 
background. Bring out the melody and balance the chords to shade its natural shape.

Part II: Developing a Strong, Supple, and Speedy Hand 
Chord and melody combo #2
The simple melody of the folk song “All the Pretty Little Horses” offers a good opportunity to 
practice constantly shifting harmonies. Practice balancing the softer left-hand chords under 
the melody, and use the rhythmic pattern in the left hand to practice your cycle of release.

Chord and melody combo #3
In the theme to the slow movement of Beethoven’s seventh symphony, harmony and melody 
are equally important. Let both hands shape the dynamics and phrasing, and add to the 
melodic and harmonic movement of the theme.

Bring a ringing, resonant sound to your performance by playing the chords with an even and 
quick attack. Coordinate your cycle of tension and release with the rhythmic pattern of the 
chords, making light wrist bounces on beats one and four of each measure.

Par t III
Including Your 
Arms and Body

In this part . . .
You get more of your body in on the warm-up. You 
expand the movement of your hands and arms with 
scales of all kinds, up and down two octaves, hands-
together, in parallel and contrary motion. Fingerings for 
every scale help make them easy to master. You bring 
your foot into the picture with pedaling exercises, and 
you get a total mind/body experience when you practice 
keyboard jumps both small and big, short and long.

Chapter 7
Extending Your Scales
In This Chapter
▶ Practicing major, harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales
▶ Working on chromatic, diminished, and blues scales
▶ Establishing solid fingering for all scales
▶ Varying your practice methods for greater command
▶ Playing a performance piece to showcase your scales
You’ve come to the chapter of scales, the heart of piano exercises. If you love them, 
you’ll find lots to keep you happy here, and maybe some new scales to challenge your 
fingers. If you don’t love them, well, hopefully you’ll like them a little more after you try a 
few of them in a new presentation. You can make a selection of scales that fit your daily 
workout goals, or pick different scales on different days for variety.
In this chapter, you sharpen your crossover and pass-under skills as you extend single-note 
runs into two-octave scales with your hands together. If you need to review passing under 
and crossing over, see Chapter 4.
You can get a good workout here, with scales and fingering for all 12 major, harmonic minor, 
and melodic minor scales, plus diminished, chromatic, and blues scales. It’s paradise if you 
seek speed and accuracy and if you love patterns. There’s nothing like the feeling of flying up 
and down the keyboard as your scale-fingering starts clicking and you begin to feel a light-
ness in your touch.
How does scale practice connect with playing good music? Find out when you play the per-
formance piece, one of Mozart’s variations on the tune “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,” at the 
end of the chapter.
The 12 Major, Harmonic Minor, 
and Melodic Minor Scales
The major and minor scales are the backbone of piano technique. And for good reason, 
because so much of the music we love is based on these scales. So these scales tend to loom 
large; many pianists even envision doom and horror at the thought of practicing scales up 
and down the keyboard for hours at a time. You can take a more practical, just-the-facts 
approach with the scales in this section.
Each scale is just two octaves up and down, and they’re grouped so that you can play the 
major, harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales starting on the same note before moving 
on to the next key. You follow the circle of fifths, which adds one sharp to the key signature 
as you go from the key of C through the key of F#, and then subtracts one flat from the key 
signature as you go from the key of D% through the key of F. Follow the fingerings carefully, 
and feel free to play them slowly or hands-alone as you get started.

C major, C harmonic minor, C melodic minor

Part III: Including Your Arms and Body 
The Three Diminished Scales
The diminished, or octatonic, scale is unique and fun to practice because of its symmetrical 
pattern. The eight-note scale follows a whole-step/half-step/whole-step/half-step pattern, 
which means you can think of every other note as the root of a diminished scale consisting 
of the same eight notes. If that sounds confusing, just play one and you’ll see. It also means 
you have only three diminished scales to learn. Here they are:

The Chromatic Scale
After you’re comfortable with the fingering for the chromatic scale, try playing a two-octave 
scale starting on a different note, or in a different octave.
 
Play all the black keys with your third finger. Use your thumb to play all white keys except C and 
F in your right hand, and E and B in your left hand. Play these keys with your second finger.
Start on C for this exercise.

Part III: Including Your Arms and Body 
 
Because of their unusual groups of intervals, blues scales are excellent for improving your 
crossover and pass-under technique.

 Chapter 7: Extending Your Scales
Gaining Greater Command of Scales
One of the best ways to practice scales is to vary the articulation and rhythm as you prac-
tice. You can gain greater command and improve finger flexibility with variations that take 
you out of the usual routine. Playing scales the same way, day after day, can get you practic-
ing on autopilot, tuning out while your fingers go through the motions. To reinvigorate your 
scales, and reinforce fingering, change it up a bit by varying the articulation and rhythmic 
groupings. Stay with four-note patterns for all the scales so the pattern comes out evenly. 
Here are some suggested exercises — try some on your own, too.

 Chapter 7: Extending Your Scales
Performance Piece: Variation VII 
from “Variations on ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, 
Little Star’”
This piece answers the question, “Why do I have to practice scales?!?” Mozart applied the 
fundamentals of music in undeniably musical ways, using them to give balance, character, 
and proportion to even the smallest of forms, like this variation.
  
W. A. Mozart

Part III: Including Your Arms and Body 

Chapter 8
Parallel and Contrary 
Motion
In This Chapter
▶ Exercising with hands in parallel and contrary motion
▶ Improving finger and hand independence
▶ Playing a performance piece with combined motion
M
oving on from where the previous chapter left off, this chapter shows you how to 
continue practicing single-note lines in each hand, now with melodies that move in 
parallel and contrary motion. These exercises increase your hand and finger independence 
and improve your coordination.
The ultimate goal here is to integrate or combine multiple kinds of movement into one 
action. You may feel coordination-challenged when you try to rub your belly while patting 
your head, but that’s mainly because you’ve never integrated the movements. Instead, imag-
ine walking while turning your head to watch a car go by, or stirring a pot while talking on 
the phone. These actions are integrated, so you don’t think about doing two things at once. 
The key to these parallel and contrary motion exercises is to integrate the multiple move-
ments into a single feeling. You’re teaching your body to feel a combination of movements as 
one, and adapting mentally to imagine the whole rather than all the parts.
Put it all together in the performance piece at the end of the chapter, a parallel/contrary 
motion jamboree on the folk tune “Turkey in the Straw.”
Parallel Movement at the Octave
These exercises are similar to scales but with more melodic flexibility in the movement of 
the lines. Normal scale fingering applies most of the time, but the music takes you away from 
these patterns. The key to good fingering is finding the most comfortable solution to fit the 
music.

Parallel Movement at the Interval
Now your hands are moving on a parallel track, either a sixth or a tenth apart, instead of an 
octave apart. Try focusing on one hand at a time until you start to feel the integration kicking 
in. Even if you miss a few notes, focus your attention on one hand while the other rides along 
in parallel motion. Your goal is to visualize both hands moving together, the notes and move-
ment clear in your mind’s eye.

Contrary Motion Away from the Center
Contrary motion can be easier than parallel because the hands are playing symmetrical 
fingering patterns. Still, keeping your eyes up on the notes on the page can be a challenge. 
Develop a habit of reading the music bottom to top, your left hand before the right. Dare to 
keep your eyes on the music, visualize the synchronized movement, and trust your hands 
to find their place on the keyboard.
 
If sharing a key with both thumbs is awkward, let one rest on top of the other for the 
shared note.

Combination Movement Exercise
Don’t let the sixteenth notes scare you away from this exercise. It combines all the different 
types of movement covered in the chapter and provides a good fingering and coordination 
challenge. Make sure to look ahead to see what’s coming in the next measure, and let ’er rip!
 
You’ll be most successful if you can visualize all the moves before you play them. Your fin-
gers don’t know where to go until you direct them with a clear image of the moves they 
need to make.

Footwork: Using the Damper 
Pedal
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the basics of pedaling
▶ Practicing pedaling with chords and melody lines
▶ Enhancing your playing with fancy pedaling
▶ Performance piece: “Simple Gifts,” featuring you, your fingers, and your foot
T
his chapter is all about your right foot, and what it can do together with your hands to 
make your music more musical. I tell you how to use the sustain pedal to get a range of 
different sounds, blend tones, and bring off tricks that you can’t do without it.
 
The piano is essentially a percussion instrument, meaning that it produces a pitch that has 
a quick attack when you strike a key and the hammer strikes the strings. If you hold this key 
down, the pitch has a slow decay, because you’re keeping the damper inside the piano off 
the string, allowing it to vibrate freely. But after you release the key, the damper returns to 
stop the string from vibrating, stopping the sound. Sustaining the sound is possible with the 
sustain pedal, which keeps the damper off the strings for you.
By using the pedal in a careful way, you gain a greater range of expression. It can help you to 
“sing” a melody, connect music in phrases, and create greater resonance and atmospheric 
illusions. Overuse of the pedal can have some big drawbacks — unintentional mixing of har-
monies, blurring notes, and obscuring any articulation that should be clear. Your careful and 
attentive listening helps avoid these problems.
This chapter gives you practice pedaling for a variety of purposes and helps you avoid over-
using the pedal. You can show off your pedaling technique with an arrangement of the 
Shaker melody “Simple Gifts,” the performance piece at the end of the chapter.
Pedaling Chords
The two most common pedaling indications are shown in the following figure. Press the 
pedal down at the “Ped.” sign, and release (pedal up) at the asterisk or at the bracket ending 
the line. These indications are always shown below the bass staff.

112
Part III: Including Your Arms and Body 
  
or
The notch in the line in the following figure indicates where to change the pedal, quickly 
clearing any sustained sound (pedal up) and resetting the sustain (pedal down). Changing 
the pedal requires careful attention to clearing the harmony cleanly and completely.
  
Good pedaling is all a matter of timing and listening. Your goal is to train your ear to listen 
for a smooth transition and a clean change from note to note and chord to chord. You don’t 
want to time your pedaling to match your hands, releasing and then pressing the pedal down 
as your fingers move from one chord to another; if you do, you’ll hear a gap between chords. 
This is because you’re lifting both the keys and the pedal together, so the dampers stop the 
sound when your fingers leave the keys. You need the sustain pedal down at this time. You 
have to wait to change the pedal so it happens simultaneously with playing the next chord, 
with only enough overlap to create a smooth connection between chords and a clean reset-
ting of the pedal. You want a seamless transition — no gap — as if you were simply singing 
one note to another. After you change the pedal and the previous chord clears, you can 
release the keys and let the pedal do its job.
Check out the way your foot is positioned. Your heel should stay on the floor, and your toes 
can rest on the pedal. Some pedals require more weight and pressure, and foot size and 
power are all different. You can use your longer toes plus some of the ball of your foot to 
press down the pedal, but as always go for comfort and ease. Your ankle is the hinge that 
allows your foot to move with the least amount of movement and effort.

113
 Chapter 9: Footwork: Using the Damper Pedal
 
Pedaling shouldn’t affect your general posture, so if you find that you have to shift around 
or adjust your balance to accommodate pedaling, you may not have started from a good 
position. See Chapter 1 for more on posture.
The first two exercises use the same chord progression to practice the pedaling basics.
Broken-chord pedaling
In this exercise, you change pedal on a single note.

Pedaling Changes on a Single Line
Although changing the pedal with the change of harmony is a general rule, you’ll want to 
change it more frequently when you’re also playing a melodic line. 
Uniform pedal changes
When you have a slow, meandering melody, you may change the pedal before the harmony 
changes so the melody doesn’t get too blurry. Try it with this bluesy melody.

Varied pedal changes
You can enhance your legato phrasing by pedaling even more frequently along the melodic 
line. This is especially useful in melodic lines with a wide range that call for a singer’s phras-
ing. The pedal can smooth over wide jumps and the places you have to lift your hand to 
change position. Try it with the melody to Stephen Foster’s “Jeanie with the Light Brown 
Hair.”

Pedaling for Effect
Use the sustain pedal for atmospheric effect (sustaining notes in a line for a blurred effect) or 
to help sustain a note or chord over several measures. 
Blurred lines and long sustains
In this exercise, the pedal helps sustain the long notes in one hand while smoothing the 
melodic movement in the other hand. Combined with a soft dynamic, this technique helps 
create a misty, mysterious effect.

Sustaining as the hands leave the keyboard
You can use the pedal to give notes their full value when you have to move your hands to a 
new position on the keyboard. This can also be a plus musically, because you can exaggerate 
the rhythms and the differences between the long and short articulations.

Performance Piece: “Simple Gifts”
The pedal helps give a bell-like quality to the half-note octaves in the right hand at the begin-
ning and in the left hand from the middle to the end of this performance piece. Notice how 
the pedal is up when the melody is in the left hand, where it may muddy the line, and down 
when the melody is in the upper register of the right hand, where the mild blurring adds a 
nice effect. During the last three measures, you keep the pedal down to layer the G-major 
chord over the full range of the piano.

Jumping Across the Keyboard
In This Chapter
▶ Jumping from note to note and chord to chord
▶ Discovering new accuracy skills
▶ Exercising with left-hand accompaniment patterns
▶ Playing a ragtime-style performance piece featuring hand jumps
C
overing the full territory of the 88 keys is certainly one of the enticing attributes of the 
piano. Jumping registers, from low to high or high to low, is a potent tool that few 
other instruments can match. The exercises in this chapter give you practice jumping from 
one note to another and from chord to chord, over both smaller and larger intervals. This 
practice will help your accuracy as you move across the keyboard, help develop your “feel” 
for where your hands go, and improve your sense of distance as your hands work from 
small jumps over shorter intervals to big jumps over three octaves.
This chapter also gives you lots of practice with the most common left-hand patterns — a 
variety of bass-note-to-chord accompaniments essential to playing waltzes, rags, marches, 
and many other dance rhythms.
The exercises warm you up for the lively performance piece at the end of the chapter. The 
piece is a ragtime-style number that keeps both hands jumping.
Jumping and Landing Accuracy Skills
The key to making good, accurate jumps is the same whether the jump is big or small: 
Maintain a comfortable, balanced hand position as you jump from the starting hand posi-
tion across the keyboard to your landing destination. Jumping with an overextended pinky 
and your hand outstretched like the descent of a giant hawk upon its prey is very common. 
Instead, the image you want to keep in mind is of a frog jumping from lily pad to lily pad. 
Though a frog may extend its legs to jump high in the air (you don’t need to do that part), it 
starts and lands with its body centered over the lily pad, contracting to the same closed, 
restful shape. Your hands are two frogs. As they jump from one position to another, they 
should look the same before and after the jump. You can practice this skill with every 
exercise.

Part III: Including Your Arms and Body 
Note-to-note jumps
In this first exercise, you simply try jumping from note to note.
 
Visualize each jump before you make the move. Include the relaxed, frog-like shape of your 
hand, the arc it traces as it jumps, and the specific finger landing on its target key.

Note-to-chord jumps
Same principle — visualize and jump to an easy, relaxed position on the chord notes, and 
don’t overextend your fingers or move with your hand stuck in an awkward hand position.

Part III: Including Your Arms and Body 
Chord-to-chord jumps
Make sure your forearms aren’t overly tense and contracted; you want just enough muscle 
flexion to keep your position stable. Your hands should also have enough flexion to hold 
their position as they come down into the keys without collapsing in the joints. Allow some 
flexibility in your wrists to absorb the weight as you play the chords. (See Chapter 6 for more 
on playing chords.)

Mastering More Complicated Jumps
The next two exercises increase the challenge level with greater hand independence, varied 
articulation, and faster hand position changes.
Accents on the downbeat
Here, your frogs get a springboard from the upbeat (on beat four) to the downbeat (on beat 
one). Practice with a light upbeat and a well-accented downbeat.

Jumping with Both Hands Together
After you practice jumps with one hand, you can synchronize jumps in both hands — first 
matching movements in parallel motion and then mirroring the jumps in contrary motion. 
Take your time, and make sure you’re playing all the notes with an equally solid touch.

Left-Hand Accompaniment 
Patterns (With Pedal)
Jumps are an especially common feature of left-hand accompaniments. Setting a steady 
rhythm and laying down the harmonic foundation are often the jobs of your left hand, while 
your right hand handles the melodic duties. You can exercise this vital function in the next 
four exercises. First, try it with the help of the sustain pedal for smoother accompaniment 
patterns.
Bass-note-to-chord pattern in 4/4
You’ll find this left-hand pattern when you play marches and dance rhythms like the foxtrot. 
Lifting the pedal on the upbeats makes the rhythm distinctive.

 Chapter 10: Jumping Across the Keyboard
Left-Hand Accompaniment Patterns 
(Without Pedal)
Without the sustain pedal, your left-hand part is more exposed. So practicing without the 
pedal is good for keeping an even rhythm, matching articulation, and smooth movement. If 
you hesitate, lurch to a chord, or miss a bass note, you’ll hear it!
Ragtime and stride pattern
Here’s an accompaniment pattern typical of a ragtime or basic stride piano style.
 
Moving quickly off the bass note and rushing up to the chord is tempting, but this action 
usually cuts the bass note short. Stay on the bass note a little longer than you think you 
should to give the rhythm and harmony a solid foundation.

Performance Piece: “Lily Pad Rag”
The unique combination of a syncopated right-hand melody set over a steady 4-beat left-
hand pattern gives ragtime its bouncy allure. As you work on “Lily Pad Rag,” develop a clear 
mental picture of when and where a melody note coincides with the left hand and when it is 
played between beats and held over, at the syncopation. Give extra emphasis to these synco-
pated notes.

Integration and 
Independence 

In this part . . .
You put it all together with fun and flair. If you’re look-
ing for greater challenges, you can find them in this 
part. And even if you’re not there’s plenty to gain what-
ever your level.
You integrate many of the moves presented in previous 
sections, putting them together in a variety of melodic and 
harmonic settings. You practice arpeggio and octave exer-
cises and independent hand moves like passing a melody 
from hand to hand, crossing a hand over a hand, and play-
ing at the extreme registers of the keyboard. You practice 
chord progressions and cadences in Chapter 14, and 
ornaments in Chapter 15, with examples and explanations 
that make it fun and easy. Chapter 16 is filled with rhythm 
exercises that challenge you to stay mentally ahead of your 
hands so you can conduct and coordinate all your moves.

Chapter 11
Playing Arpeggios
In This Chapter
▶ Improving finger accuracy and independence in open hand positions
▶ Practicing three- and four-note chord arpeggios
▶ Exercising practical broken-chord patterns
▶ “Harp Heaven”: A performance piece filled with arpeggios
P
laying broken-chord patterns, or arpeggios, on the piano is very satisfying. In addition 
to the beauty and speed they can give your playing, they lend a bit of the style from 
the guitar and harp. These string instruments play broken chords and arpeggios naturally 
as their strings are strummed and swept. In fact, “arpeggio” comes from the Italian word for 
harp, arpa.
 
When you play the notes of a chord individually, you’re playing a broken chord, or 
arpeggio.
Practicing arpeggio patterns is excellent for improving several different technical areas:
 
 Your accuracy making short interval jumps from finger to finger
 
 Your crossover and pass-under technique as you practice multi-octave arpeggios
 
 Your finger control and independence with a mix of arpeggio patterns
Now that you’re itching to get going, on to the exercises. When you get to the end of the 
chapter, you can display your dazzling speed in the arpeggio-driven performance piece, 
“Harp Heaven.”
Finger Jumps
In this section, you make a sequence of interval jumps from finger to finger. Your hand shape 
is open, with a wider span compared to five-finger position. The interval jumps are the same 
moves you make when you play arpeggios, but the exercises give you practice with each 
interval separately, starting with thirds and then on to fourths and fifths.
The fingerings in each exercise will guide your hand position changes, so take some time to 
map out the hand positions as you go through them.

The Arpeggiator
The exercises in this section give you a workout with arpeggios on major, minor, diminished, 
and seventh chords. You get simple up-down patterns as well as nonsequential and inverted 
chord patterns.
 
Practice hands-alone to really focus on the individual arpeggios. For a challenge, practice 
these arpeggios with both staccato and legato articulation.

Broken Chords (And How to Fix Them)
Broken-chord patterns are so common in accompaniment figures that you rarely notice 
they’re simple arpeggios. This section gives you four patterns that are found in a wide range 
of styles.
Alberti bass exercise
The Alberti bass, named after the 18th-century Italian composer Domenico Alberti, is 
common in classical-style accompaniments. You’ll find it in all kinds of piano music by 
Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. The pattern is a simple re-ordering of the chord notes in an 
arpeggio. This next piece, adapted from Karl Czerny’s setting of a Scotch Air, features the 
Alberti bass throughout the left-hand part. You might find it natural, and indeed comfortable, 
to rotate your forearm gently from the outside (pinky-side) to the inside (thumb side) as you 
play this pattern.

 Chapter 11: Playing Arpeggios
Guitar-style broken chord exercise
Playing guitar-style arpeggio patterns often involves spreading the chord out over both 
hands to capture the wide range common in guitar chord voicing. The next song is a folk-
style arrangement of the classic “Careless Love,” with the right hand in a dual role playing 
the melody and completing the arpeggio pattern started in the left hand.

Part IV: Integration and Independence 
Blues-style broken chord exercise
Although you’ll easily recognize the blues pattern in this piece, it’s fun to realize it’s simply 
an arpeggio set in a triplet rhythm. Try the pattern with the melody to W.C. Handy’s “St. 
Louis Blues.”

 Chapter 11: Playing Arpeggios
Octave and extended broken chord exercise
For a big, full piano sound, you can extend the arpeggio up to the octave and beyond in your 
accompaniment. The following extended pattern is a great exercise for the left hand. Try to 
keep the arpeggio smooth and even as you manage the crossovers and pass-unders in this 
version of “House of the Rising Sun.”
 
Try the alternate fingerings (in parentheses) to see if the hand positions are more comfort-
able for your hand.

Performance Piece: “Harp Heaven”
You’ll be able to play these arpeggios both fast and lightly if you anticipate the change in har-
mony from measure to measure. Get the feel of the chord progression by practicing each 
chord shape in both your hands before you play.

Chapter 12
Alternating Hands
In This Chapter
▶ Trying fancy moves across the keyboard
▶ Making use of hand-to-hand scales and arpeggios
▶ Crossing hands
▶ Attempting strange and extreme keyboard positions
T
he alternating-hand techniques covered in this chapter are not only fun to play, but also 
useful in all kinds of keyboard music, from Scarlatti to Ravel, Blues to Broadway, Liszt 
to Liberace. Pianists typically love to show off, and what better way than an impressive dis-
play of handoffs and crossovers?
A handoff is achieved by passing a melodic line from one hand to the other. Typically your 
left hand will hand off an ascending line to your right hand, and vice versa.
 
A hand crossover, not to be confused with a finger crossover (see Chapter 4), is employed 
when you find it handy (and impressive) to cross one hand over the other to grab a note or 
a chord or two.
Even if showing off isn’t your thing, the exercises here help bring both hands to an equal 
level, because they’re collaborating on the main musical part instead of one supporting the 
other.
Hand-to-Hand Scale Handoffs
As you hand off the scale from hand to hand, you want a smooth transition. Try to fool your 
ears; the handoff should be so smooth that you can’t tell where one hand takes over from the 
other. And you should hear no noticeable change in dynamic or articulation.
 
Some of these techniques look complicated written on the grand staff! Unless marked with a 
“R.H.” or “L.H.” your right hand will play the notes on the top staff and your left hand will 
play the notes on the bottom staff.

Scale handoff exercise #1
 
Prepare the hand position for both hands before you begin each phrase. Playing a smooth 
scale in one hand is easier if the other hand is waiting quietly in position to take over.

Hand-to-Hand Arpeggio Handoffs
The same hand preparation from the previous section applies to the chord arpeggios: If you 
anticipate your hand positions before you move, your arpeggios will sound much better.
Aim for a smooth line throughout the arpeggio. Just like the exercises in legato phrasing, a 
bit of an overlap can really help connect the notes and bridge any gaps. (See Chapter 3 for 
more on legato phrasing.)

Crossing Over
As you incorporate more and more of your body, remember to check your posture and com-
fort at the keyboard. In these exercises, give yourself room for both hands to cross over 
comfortably, with enough distance between you and the keyboard so you’re not squeezed in.
 
You may have to adjust the height of each wrist, with a high arch in the crossing hand and a 
lower wrist position for the hand underneath.

One Hand on Top
The next two exercises give you some practice with top/bottom hand positions. They’re fun 
and provide a visual treat, yet they can be tricky and challenge your hand independence.
Your hands should be in a nestled position, with some air space in between to allow indepen-
dent movement. Play these gently, with a lightly rocking rhythm.

Extreme Keyboard Positions
When you’re moving to and from these extreme registers, you have a lot more movement to 
coordinate. Keep in mind that your weight support should come from your lower body — 
your sitting bones and legs — leaving your arms and hands free to move. Be aware of the 
weight shifting when you move left and right, and use the exercise to examine whether 
you’re shifting your weight easily and smoothly from your left-side sitting bone and leg to 
your right-side sitting bone and leg.

Full Keyboard Exercises
These exercises move over four and five octaves, working with triad arpeggios, block-chord 
triads, and an exercise with seventh chords in arpeggio and block-chord combinations. Start 
off slowly and increase your speed as you improve.
Full keyboard arpeggios
 
Try this exercise “air piano” style: Practice your hand movements on this exercise with 
your hands touching, but not playing, the keys. You’ll usually find where you’re over- or 
undershooting your movement.

Chord “Drumming”
A good approach to chord drumming is to tap the rhythms (gently) on the closed piano lid 
until you develop an easy, rhythmic groove. Or be creative and use a different surface: Drum 
on your lap, two pots turned upside down like bongos, or even the tense muscles of some-
one’s back. Try this exercise with hands in motion.

Stretching Out with Octaves 
and Broken Octaves
In This Chapter
▶ Using an open hand position to span the octave
▶ Gaining precision with octave jumps
▶ Breaking it up with broken octave exercises
▶ Practicing octave chords
▶ Getting an octave workout with Schumann’s “Papillons”
Y
es, octaves are hard. They’re hard for everybody, and to a certain extent everybody has 
to figure out how their own unique hands best meet the challenge. But give this chapter 
a try; you’ll find some new exercises designed to help you examine and improve your octave 
technique, and you may also find some tips here to make playing octaves easier.
Octave practice is similar to chord playing (see Chapter 6) because you use your entire hand 
as a single unit, in contrast to finger independence exercises. Good octave technique com-
bines an open (but not overextended) hand position with a confident, comfortable arm drop. 
Most of your attention is focused on the position of your pinky and thumb, the fingers that 
do most of the note playing. But you also look at how the rest of your hand helps out. The 
height of your wrist, the angle of the inside fingers, and your depth into the keyboard are all 
factors in improving octave technique. As you go through the exercises in this chapter, you 
apply octave position to scales, jumps, broken octaves, and chords.
 
Because every hand is a different size and shape, you need to be on the lookout for tension 
and overstretching. Take breaks to relieve tightness and fatigue.
Opening Up to the Octave
There is no single, best way for you to play octaves; what works for one can be different for 
others and is based on the size and shape of your hands and fingers. So the best way to start 
is to observe your hand and fingers while playing octaves. Examine the movement of your 
hand, the overall hand shape, the position of your fingers playing the octaves, and the posi-
tion of the fingers that aren’t playing any keys. If you have small hands, you may not be able 
to play octaves from a high arch position of the wrist. If you have long fingers, you may need 
to keep your second, third, and fourth fingers relatively straight so they don’t get in the way. 
Closely examine the thumb and pinky joints to see whether they are collapsed or whether 
you can modify their angle for more control. Look to maximize your advantages and mini-
mize your disadvantages.

166
Part IV: Integration and Independence  
Octave scale exercise
This exercise begins with your hand in an easy, open fifth position. As you expand the intervals 
out to a sixth, seventh, and then to the octave, maintain a consistent shape, control, and touch. 
In other words, copy the feeling (firm in the pinky and thumb joints, more relaxed and rounded 
in the rest of the hand) as you expand the interval out to the octave. Try playing toward the 
outside edge of the keyboard; you may find it easier on white-key passages like this.

Octave interval exercise
For this exercise, try to keep the octave shape as you move across the keyboard over a vari-
ety of close intervals. Keep the open shape, but don’t tense your muscles into a locked grip.
 
If your hands are big enough, use your fourth finger on the upper note to facilitate passages. 
This position creates smoother horizontal movement, especially with the fourth finger on a 
black key.

Octave Jumps
For octave jumps, develop a light bouncing action, using the release of the keys as a cue to 
release tension in your hand. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
 Focus on your fifth finger — that’s where most of the misses happen. You’ll need a bit 
more firmness in your pinky, with the thumb more relaxed and not grabbing.
 
 When you land into the octaves, aim down into the keys, pointing with your first and 
fifth fingers. This requires opening your hand into a bigger arch for accuracy.
 
 If your wrist drops down after you play the octave, make sure it returns to a nice 
high position while your fingers hold down the notes.
 
Don’t worry about playing wrong notes. Your main goals are developing a clear mental 
image of where and how you’re moving and practicing a comfortable, confident hand move. 
You’ll play more right notes as you realize these goals.

Broken Octaves
Give your hands a bit of a break by alternating the octave practicing with some broken 
octaves. First, prepare your hand in a comfortable, open octave position over both notes.
Exercise with wrist rotation
Using a gentle wrist rotation and transferring weight from your pinky to your thumb, and 
thumb to pinky, you can provide a tension-relief rhythm in your hand.

Exercise with hand contraction and expansion
Now exaggerate the weight transfer when you cross your second finger over your first, focus-
ing on a firm attack with your second finger. Allow your fifth finger to leave its note during 
this move. Your hand contracts to cross over, and expands back out to the octave position.

Octave Chords
As you add inner notes to the octave, you want to observe your hands again. Make sure that 
your knuckles aren’t collapsed and that your wrist isn’t stuck in an extreme angle — either 
too high or too low. Go for an even, comfortable position and a fluid movement playing these 
octave chords. You want to feel your fingertips reach into the keys, so keep an active con-
nection with your fingertips as you move your hand from position to position. It’s a tricky 
combination you’re after: overall, a firm hand shape, but not so locked in a grip that you pre-
vent the supple movement of individual parts.

Chapter 14
Chord Progressions and Cadences
In This Chapter
▶ Trying triad and seventh chord patterns
▶ Checking out chord cadences, turnarounds, and sequences
▶ Carrying out chord progression exercises
▶ Performance piece: A four-part Bach chorale
T
he fun and fascination of playing chord progressions comes in exploring their dual ver-
tical and horizontal function. The vertical role is in each chord itself — how it’s con-
structed from bottom to top. The horizontal role is in the way chords progress from one to 
another; how every good progression is a unique flow of harmonies.
The movement of chords is similar to the movement of voices in vocal music like chorales 
and hymns. A typical four-part chorale is divided into parts for the four different vocal 
ranges: soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. While each part sings its own melody line, harmonic 
movement is created when the parts are combined. And, generally speaking, the smoother 
the melodic movement of each part, the smoother the harmonic movement will be. This 
applies to playing chord progressions on the piano, too.
Getting some practice with chord progressions allows you to improve your facility with 
chords and to focus on balancing the horizontal movement of each chord note with the verti-
cal structure of each chord.
The best thing about practicing chord progressions is developing the ability to recognize the 
chords you’re playing and their function within the musical phrase. This recognition of 
chord function can improve your interpretation of the music you play because harmonic 
function is fundamental to expressing a musical idea. And after chord sequences, cadences, 
and other patterns become familiar to you, they’ll become easier to play.
Triad Progressions
These exercises work with three-note chords in both hands, getting your fingers nimble and 
giving your eyes and ears practice recognizing common chord movement.

176
Part IV: Integration and Independence  
Diatonic triad progressions
First practice some progressions using triads built on the diatonic scale, and their inver-
sions. Building chords on each note of the diatonic scale makes three types of triad: major, 
minor, and diminished.
These C-major diatonic triads move scale-wise, keeping two, and then one common chord 
tone with each change of chord. Practice hands-alone if playing the chords in both hands is 
difficult.
 
The alternate fingerings (in parentheses) might be a better fit for your hands. Try them, and 
feel free to use them in the following exercises.

Chromatic triad progressions
Next you can include nondiatonic triads (triads with notes outside the diatonic scale) and 
then triads built on the A harmonic minor scale. This exercise has a greater variety of triads: 
major, minor, diminished, augmented, and suspended. Maneuvering through a more chro-
matic progression is more of a challenge.

Seventh Chord Progressions
Chords can have many functions, but the standout function of a dominant seventh chord is 
leading to a harmonic resolution on a major or minor triad. This function is easy to hear, 
because in the context of a progression, the tension caused by the notes in a dominant sev-
enth chord tells you that the chord is, to put it simply, unresolved.
In these next two exercises you get some chord-resolution practice with dominant seventh 
and minor seventh chords.
Seventh chord progressions exercise #1
This exercise has dominant sevenths that resolve to the six major and minor triads in the 
diatonic scale: the I, ii, iii, IV, V, and vi chords.
 
If you like repeating a sequence exercise like this one over and over, watch that you don’t 
tune out and let your fingers go on autopilot. To keep your mind engaged, play the eight-
measure phrases in a random order to keep your thinking ahead of your playing.

Seventh chord progressions exercise #2
In the first half of this exercise, you cycle through all 12 dominant seventh chords by playing 
around the circle of fifths (see the Cheat Sheet and Chapter 7 for more on the circle of fifths). 
On the second half of the exercise, the chord sequence has minor seventh chords leading to 
dominant seventh chords in a descending pattern.

Chord Cadences and Familiar Patterns
This section shows you some chord patterns you find frequently in all types of music: 
cadences, turnarounds, and sequences.
Cadences
A cadence — when a chord progression comes to a close — is a short progression, usually 
two or three chords, which establishes the tonality and communicates a strong sense of res-
olution. Here are a variety of common cadences in C major and A minor.
  
Full cadence (major)
Full cadence (minor)
Plagal (“Amen”) cadence (major)
Plagal cadence (minor)
Half cadence (major)
Half cadence (minor)
Deceptive cadence
Extended cadence (major)
Extended cadence (minor)
Extended cadences with suspensions
 

181
 Chapter 14: Chord Progressions and Cadences
Turnarounds and sequences
Turnarounds get you, harmonically speaking, turned around so that you can go back to the 
home key. This usually means getting to the V chord, by any number of means, which will 
lead you back home to the I chord.
Chord sequences, a repeating pattern of chord changes, are a fundamental building block of 
chord progressions. Practice to get your fingers familiar with these patterns.

position. The first is in major key, the second in minor. Both extended progressions use dia-
tonic chords, nondiatonic chords, sequences, and cadences.

Chords in One Hand, Melody in the Other
In the next two exercises, the chord progression takes a back-seat role to the melodic pat-
tern. Yet recognizing the structure that the progression gives to the music can have a posi-
tive influence on the way you play. Both of these chord progressions will be familiar to you, 
but the melody is replaced by a melodic exercise. See whether you recognize the songs by 
just their chord progressions.
Chords with melody exercise #1
This chord progression in the right hand is from “We Wish You A Merry Christmas,” with a 
melodic pattern in the left hand.

In Bach’s chorale 93, “Awake, My Heart, and Sing” (adapted from 371 Harmonized Chorales 
and 69 Chorale Melodies, by Johann Sebastian Bach), you find a perfect balance of the 
melodic (horizontal) and the harmonic (vertical). You get to take a two-handed shot at play-

Chapter 15
Trilling Thrills and Other 
Fancy Ornaments
In This Chapter
▶ Playing ornaments: Grace notes, trills, mordents, and turns
▶ Other fancy embellishments: Repeated note, rolled chord, glissando, and tremolo exercises
▶ Performance piece: An ornament-filled aria from Rigoletto
O
rnaments are for decoration, and because of their role as embellishment, they’re more 
like the icing on the cake of music rather than the cake itself. Or they’re the cornice 
on the façade of a building rather than its foundation. But wherever you hear music, there 
they are: adorning the flute and fiddle melodies in folk music, adding deeper color to the 
blues, embellishing the delicate harpsichord sonatas of the baroque era, and giving sopra-
nos something to trill about at the opera. So they must be important.
But even if they’re essential, all the funny signs, abbreviations, and shrunken notes can be 
intimidating. There’s nothing like the feeling that you’re playing something the wrong way, 
with the ornament police waiting in the wings to cart you away for mordent offenses.
This chapter covers the most common ornaments, how they’re written, and how they’re 
played. You’ll play exercises for each ornament so they’ll be fresh in both your fingers and 
mind. The performance piece at the end of the chapter combines these decorative tech-
niques in a highly embellished version of an aria from Verdi’s opera, Rigoletto.
Grace Notes
Grace notes are a type of musical ornament written with small, “cue-size” notes. Here are 
three facts to remember about grace notes:
 
 Grace notes can lead stepwise up or down to the next note, jump up or down to 
another note, or appear in a group of two or more grace notes.
 
 They have no time value, so instead of counting them as you count other note values, 
you play them quickly (but not hurriedly) before the main note, which you give its full 
time value.
 
 Unless they’re accented, you should play them lightly and without emphasis.

 Chapter 15: Trilling Thrills and Other Fancy Ornaments
Trills
A trill can start on the written note and alternate with its upper neighbor, or it can start on 
the upper neighbor and alternate with the written note. It was more common to start on the 
upper neighbor in music of the Baroque and Classical eras (Bach, Mozart, and Haydn, for 
example). You can practice the trills in this exercise either way or both ways, if you like. 
Gaining control of the trilling fingers is the object, so in this exercise you alternate the trilling 
notes in a slower rhythm and speed up to the trill playing faster rhythms.
 
A common misconception is that all ornaments have to be played very fast. In fact, match-
ing the ornaments with the character and tempo of the music is a better way to go.

Mordents
A simple and delicate three-note decoration, a mordent evokes the style of baroque key-
board music. The two types of mordent are upper and lower. An upper mordent sign above a 
note tells you to ornament it by playing that note, and then its upper neighbor, and back to 
the main note in quick succession. When you see a lower mordent, which has the vertical 
line through the sign, above a note, ornament it by playing that note, and then its lower 
neighbor, and back to the main note in quick succession. In this exercise, a brief minuet by 
Haydn, the small staff shows you how to play each mordent.
 
If you see an accidental above or below an ornament sign, it applies to the neighboring note 
in the ornament rather than the main note.

Turns
You see the sign indicating a turn placed between two notes or over a note. Either way, it sig-
nals a four-note ornament starting on the upper neighbor, moving to the written note, and 
then to the lower neighbor, and back to the main note. The small staff in the next exercise 
shows you how to play the turns.

Repeated Notes
Rapid, repeated notes capture the spirit of guitar tremolos, trumpet fanfares, and especially 
drum rolls and other percussive effects.
Repeated notes are best played with two or more fingers in succession. The faster you want 
to play them, the more you need to switch fingers. After you get the hang of it, it’s much 
easier and the results are more effective. If you try a variety of finger combinations, you may 
find a new move that works best for you. Start by comparing the alternate fingerings shown 
in the first three measures.

R-R-R-Rolling Chords
The squiggly line to the left of a chord means to roll the chord, the notes sounding pyramid-
style, by playing each chord tone, individually and rapidly, from the lowest to the highest 
note, holding down each chord tone so that all the notes sound together when you get to the 
top note. Stay loose and flexible in your fingers and practice the subtle rotation from the left 
side of your hand to the right.
Rolling chords in the right hand
Time the roll so the top note of the right-hand chord is played on the beat, simultaneously 
with the bass note in the left hand.

The Glissando
Whether you’re of the Jerry Lee Lewis, the Liberace, or the Chico Marx school of glissando, 
finding an easy way to “gliss” depends on two things:
 
 Finding the right angle to hold your finger(s) to move comfortably up or down the key-
board and still make the keys go down fast enough to produce sound.
 
 Making contact with the keys at the side edge of the keytop rather than at the 
wooden side of the key, which might stop you (painfully) in your tracks.
For a glissando from the center of the keyboard going out with either hand, I recommend 
using the nails of the third and fourth fingers, paired close together and facing the direction 
they’re going, with your fingers curved to allow your wrist to stay flat.
For a glissando going into the center of the keyboard with either hand, I recommend using 
your thumb nail, again positioned so the nail faces the direction it’s moving, and keeping the 
rest of your hand shape as close to normal as possible, ready to resume the old (ho-hum) fin-
gers-on-keys style of playing.

The Tremolo
This exercise puts the tremolo where it’s at home, in a bluesy setting. Keep your hand shape 
firm, but not gripped, and rotate quickly, back and forth like you’re turning a doorknob or 
shaking a small can of paint, from the pinky side of your hand to the thumb side. The triple 
tremolo beams between note stems mean shake it, baby.

Performance Piece: “Caro Nome”
This opera aria, “Caro Nome,” is well suited to vocal ornamentation, but it’s refitted for the 
piano for this chapter’s performance piece. The simple and catchy melody is perfect for 
dressing up with mordents, trills, grace notes, rolled chords, and repeated notes, with a little 
room for some turns in the left hand.

Maximum Independence: Challenging 
Rhythms and Syncopations
In This Chapter
▶ Combining scale and arpeggio patterns
▶ Playing exercises with changing note values and time signatures
▶ Practicing syncopated rhythms and polyrhythms
▶ Performance piece: A Gershwin tune
T
he exercises in this chapter combine many of the technical elements from previous 
chapters to challenge your hand independence. By stretching your hand-eye synchron-
icity with more difficult rhythms, you get a warm-up that will leave you itching to face the 
greater technical challenges out there in the wide world of piano music.
In this chapter, you get practice combining scales and arpeggios with lots of rhythmic 
change-ups: sixteenth notes alternating with triplets; syncopated eighth notes; and contrast-
ing rhythmic patterns in each hand.
You also get some practice with meter changes, and even some polyrhythms, with one hand 
playing triplets while the other plays eighths.
These workouts all feature patterns to boost your hand independence by combining scales, 
arpeggios, and rhythms. You can practice them slowly or at speeds to take you to the top of 
your form.
 
Let your mind guide your fingers, not the other way around. A relaxed, comfortable approach 
in the physical sphere of playing opens a path for the mind to think, solve, and lead.

Exercises with Changing Note Values
 
When you’re playing music that changes frequently between eighth, sixteenth, and quarter 
notes, count sixteenth notes throughout. Doing so helps keep your tempo steady and your 
note values consistent.
Maintain a steady beat while playing these exercises, whether your tempo is slow or fast. 
Make sure you count every sixteenth note — especially those you don’t play on. If it helps 
you to establish a steady tempo, tap your foot lightly on the quarter-note beats.

Exercises with Changing Meters
 
When playing music that changes meters midstream, keep the underlying note value (eighth 
note or quarter note) the same, unless written otherwise.
Changing from 6/8 to 3/4
In this exercise, the eighth note stays the same in making the switch between 6/8 time and 
3/4 time. Because the time signature changes between an eighth-note count and a quarter-
note count, you switch from counting six eighth notes (“1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6”) to counting three 
beats of eighth notes (“1, and, 2, and, 3, and”), keeping the rate of the eighth notes constant.

Expanding and contracting meter changes
Here, all the time signatures are based on a quarter-note beat, but the number of beats 
expands and contracts. Count (yes, counting out loud is okay!) all the eighth notes through-
out. The long and short articulations help mark the downbeats and upbeats.

Syncopation Exercises
With rhythm playing an ever-dominant role in popular music, it’s a good idea to practice 
reading and playing syncopations, which are always harder to play than they sound. As you 
get more comfortable with the feel of syncopations, you can have more fun and let your 
music dance to the beat.
Syncopation exercise #1
Steady counting will keep you on track in this “follow the leader” exercise, as you syncopate 
eighth notes in first the right and then the left hand. Keep counting “one-and-two-and-three-
and-four-and” throughout to anchor the exercise with a steady pulse.

Syncopation exercise #2
If you like syncopation, no better place to find it than in montuno patterns played by the 
piano in Salsa. A montuno is a two-measure pattern, a syncopated rhythmic and harmonic 
building block that, through repetition, forms the foundation of various Salsa styles. 
Emphasize all the syncopations — it fits perfectly in the style of the music. Give all the held-
over eighths a bit of an accented push, and make sure you count the strong beat (either out 
loud or in your head) that’s syncopated to make sure you don’t clip off any of its value.

Exercises with Polyrhythms
Lucky that we are to have two hands that can play two melodies at the same time, piano 
players are sometimes asked to stretch their boundaries and play two opposing rhythms at 
the same time. One of the most common of these polyrhythms is playing two against three: 
for example, two subdivisions of a beat against three subdivisions. You often see an eighth-
note triplet in one hand and two eighth notes in the other, or a quarter-note triplet in one 
hand and two quarter notes in the other. You can do the math and figure out that you play 
the second note of the “two” group soon, technically speaking, after the second note of the 
“three” group, and closer to the second note than the third note. Practice each hand sepa-
rately until you get the feel for the pattern in each hand, and then start putting it together 
until the combined motion starts to feel comfortable and flow naturally.
Two in the right hand against three in the left
Start by playing the left-hand part by itself, setting a comfortable tempo and getting into a 
nice rhythmic groove. Then add the two eighths in the right hand, letting the left hand con-
tinue its pattern.

Three in the right hand against two in the left
For this exercise, switch the triplets to the right hand and the eighths to the left. This exer-
cise is actually easier to play faster; after you learn the moves you’ll find you can integrate 
them quickly.

Part IV: Integration and Independence  
Performance Piece: “I’ll Build 
a Stairway to Paradise”
This arrangement of George Gershwin’s “I’ll Build a Stairway to Paradise” features jazzy 
chords and syncopated rhythms. The lyrics to the song, written by B. G. DeSylva and Ira 
Gershwin, invite you to shake off your blues by learning how to dance, point the way to para-
dise by starting each day practicing, and show you the rewards of steady, step-by-step dedi-
cation. Exactly the approach needed to master the piano, I’d say. You’ll get there if you keep 
at it, “with a new step every day.”

Chapter 18
Ten Great Composers and 
Their Daily Workouts
In This Chapter
▶ Études and exercises by the biggies
S
o many composers, so little time. Both the famous and the not so famous have written 
enough piano exercises and études to fill your practice time, not to mention your book-
shelf, with only these. The most difficult are challenging for any pianist, and many are useful 
to pianists at all levels. Not surprisingly, the greatest composers wrote some very difficult 
exercise pieces, but even if you don’t get around to playing them, listening can be rewarding 
and instructive.
This chapter presents a selective list of some of the top collections by the top composers. If 
you have a local music store, thank your lucky stars and buy from that establishment. Most 
of my suggestions are available online at the biggest Web sites (like amazon.com and barnes
andnoble.com). Here are a few stores that specialize in music:
 
 Frank Music Company: www.frankmusiccompany.com
 
 Joseph Patelson Music House: www.patelson.com
 
 Music Espresso: www.musicespresso.com
 
 Burt & Company Music Supply: www.burtnco.com
Johannes Brahms (1833–1897)
Johannes Brahms’s Fifty-One Exercises are pure exercises, not at all performance pieces, yet 
they have the musicality, invention, and rigor that are the hallmarks of Brahms’s writing. 
They’re a real workout. (Published by G. Schirmer)
Frédéric Chopin (1810–1849)
Chopin wrote two books of Études, opus 10 and opus 25 (24 pieces in all), that cover the full range 
of technical possibility. More to the point, it’s all incredibly beautiful music. (Published by Henle)
Muzio Clementi (1752–1832)
Gradus ad Parnassum (The Art of Playing the Pianoforte) is three volumes of piano exercises, 
totaling 100 pieces, in a variety of forms and styles, ranging from intermediate to advanced 
level. (Published by Kalmus)

224
Part V: The Part of Tens  
Karl Czerny (1791–1857)
Karl Czerny is the king of piano exercises. He studied with Beethoven and taught Liszt — not a 
bad résumé. He wrote hundreds and for all levels, covering the scope of techniques used in his 
day. I recommend 40 Daily Exercises (published by G. Schirmer), and if you’re hungry for more 
exercises you can surely find something just for you in volumes such as Studies for Small 
Hands, The Art of Finger Dexterity, School of Velocity, Eight-Measure Exercises, Study Pieces for the 
Beginner, 24 Studies for the Left Hand, 100 Recreations, and The School of Legato and Staccato.
Claude Debussy (1862–1918)
Written near the end of Debussy’s life, 12 Études are equally beautiful and intricate studies that 
have titles like “For Thirds,” “For Repeated Notes,” and “For Octaves” (excuse my French transla-
tion), describing their technical focus. They’re divided into two volumes. (Published by Durand)
Enrique Granados (1867–1916)
Six Expressive Studies are intermediate-level estudios and are so expressive you won’t stop to 
think about all the exercise you’re getting. (Published by Masters Music Publications)
Franz Liszt (1811–1886)
Before there were long-haired rock stars, there was Franz Liszt, virtuoso concert pianist and 
composer of passionate piano music that’s quintessentially romantic. His Transcendental 
Études are transcendentally hard, but great to listen to. (Published by Edition Peters)
Edward MacDowell (1861–1908)
Edward MacDowell’s attractive character pieces in Twelve Studies are fun for practice or per-
formance. He also wrote Twelve Virtuoso Studies, which is more challenging but also attractive. 
(Published by G. Schirmer)
Carl Nielsen (1865–1931)
Piano Music for Young and Old has “24 short pieces in different keys” that do about as much as 
anyone would think possible with your hands in five-finger position. They’re varied styles and 
tempos, not too long and not too hard, just right all around. (Published by Wilhelm Hansen)
Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943)
In the same league with those of Chopin and Liszt, Rachmaninoff’s Études-Tableaux shows off a 
top-notch technique and is complex and highly expressive. (Published by Boosey & Hawkes)
