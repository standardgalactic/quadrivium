About the Authors
Eric Tyson is an acclaimed best-selling personal fi nance author, lecturer, 
and adviser. Through his work, he is dedicated to teaching people to manage 
their money better and to successfully direct their own investments.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale and an MBA at the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business. Despite these impediments to lucid 
reasoning, he came to his senses after working as a management consultant 
to businesses, deciding that life was too short to spend it working long hours 
and waiting in airports for the benefi t of larger companies.
An accomplished freelance personal fi nance writer, Eric is the author of 
numerous best-selling books including For Dummies books on personal 
fi nance, mutual funds, taxes (co-author), and home buying (co-author) and 
is a syndicated columnist. His work has been featured and quoted in hun-
dreds of U.S. national and local publications, including Newsweek, Kiplinger’s 
Personal Finance Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and on NBC’s Today 
Show, ABC, CNBC, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, National Public Radio, 
and Business Radio Network.
Tony Martin is a nationally recognized best-selling personal fi nance writer, 
speaker, and commentator. Tony’s focus is on giving Canadians the tools 
they need to make sense of the world of money and investing. Through his 
work, he is dedicated to teaching people how to manage their money better 
and to successfully choose and grow their own investments.
Tony is the co-author, along with Eric, of the national best-seller Personal 
Finance For Dummies For Canadians. For many years he has also written the 
popular and widely read column, “Me and My Money,” for the The Globe and 
Mail’s Report on Business. These columns were the focus of his book Me and 
My Money: Strategies of Real-life Investors.
A graduate in Commerce at Queen’s University, his work appears regularly 
in leading national publications, including The Globe and Mail, Canadian 
Business, Proﬁ t Magazine, and Reader’s Digest. Tony has produced television 
and radio programs about personal fi nance, and has also appeared on numer-
ous television and radio programs, including CBC, BNN, and TVOntario.

Introduction
T
he almost ten years since the first edition of this book was published 
have witnessed increased interest in and media coverage of the invest-
ment world. In that time, the Internet has established itself as a fixture within 
the home and office, along with all the investment-related stories, facts, 
figures, applications, and scams that reside there. You can’t flip through the 
channels on your television without running into a stock ticker at the bottom 
of your screen or a pitchman claiming that folks are just waiting to pay you to 
buy their property. And new books are published daily that claim to possess 
the secret to investing success. With all this attention, you may think that 
investing times have changed. But to a large degree, things haven’t changed 
all that much. Investments that were considered lousy years ago — products 
with high fees and commission — generally are still lousy today.
The best investment vehicles for building wealth — stocks, real estate, and 
small business — haven’t changed either. And you still need money to play 
in the investment world. Like the first edition of Investing For Canadians 
For Dummies, this third edition includes complete coverage of these wealth-
building investments as well as other common investments, such as bonds. 
Here are the biggest changes in this edition:
 
✓ Completely revised and updated: We’ve freshened up the data and 
examples in this book to provide you with the latest insights and 
analyses, including an explanation of the credit crisis that hit in 2008 
and the stock market collapse that followed. Wondering what all the fuss 
is about with gold, oil, and other commodities? Seeking a way to invest 
in stocks without exposing yourself to tremendous risk? Curious about 
what an exchange-traded fund or hedge fund is and whether you should 
invest? Weighing whether it’s too risky or difficult to invest in real 
estate? Wondering what the best ways are to invest globally? Having 
trouble making sense of various economic indicators and what they 
mean to your investment strategy? Confused about how tax law changes 
should affect your investment strategies? Wanting to invest in a Tax-Free 
Savings Account but don’t know why, where, or how? You can find the 
answers to these questions and many more in this edition.
 
✓ Investing resources: With the continued growth in Web sites, software, 
publications, media outlets, and many other information sources 
offering investing advice and information, you’re probably overwhelmed 
about how to choose among the numerous investing research tools and 
resources. Equally problematic is knowing whom you can trust and 
listen to — and whom you need to ignore. We explain how to evaluate 
the quality of current investment tools and resources, and we provide 
tips for whom to listen to and whom to tune out.

Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
How Savvy Investors Build Wealth
Through our many years speaking with many hundreds of individuals of 
modest and immodest economic means, we know that the time-tested ways 
they use to increase their wealth are by doing the following:
 
✓ Living within their means and systematically saving and investing 
money, ideally in a tax-favoured manner
 
✓ Buying and holding a diversified portfolio of stocks
 
✓ Building their own small business or career
 
✓ Investing in real estate
That kind of investing is what this book is all about. Equally, if not more, 
important, we help you understand and choose investments compatible with 
your personal and financial goals.
You don’t need a fancy university or graduate-school degree, and you don’t 
need a rich dad (or mom), biological or adopted! What you do need is 
a desire to read and practice the many simple yet powerful lessons and 
strategies in this book.
Seriously, investing intelligently isn’t rocket science. By all means, if you’re 
dealing with a complicated, atypical issue, get quality professional help. 
But educate yourself first. Hiring someone is dangerous if you yourself are 
financially challenged. If you do finally decide to hire someone, you’ll be 
much better prepared by educating yourself, and you’ll be more focused in 
your questions and better able to assess that person’s competence.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use the following conventions in this book to help you manoeuvre 
through topics:
 
✓ We italicize all new words and terms that are defined.
 
✓ We boldface keywords or the main parts of bulleted items.
 
✓ We use monofont for all Web addresses.
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with a certain reader in mind, and this book is no 
different:

3
 Introduction
 
✓ You may have some investments, but you’re looking to develop a 
full-scale investment plan.
 
✓ You’d like to strengthen your portfolio.
 
✓ You want to evaluate your investment adviser’s advice.
 
✓ You have a company-sponsored pension plan, and you’re looking to 
make some decisions.
If one or more of these descriptions sound familiar, you’ve come to the 
right place.
How This Book Is Organized
This book helps you fill in the gaps in your investment knowledge. It’s 
structured so that you can read it cover to cover or simply dive in to 
particular sections that most interest you. Here are the major parts.
Part I: Investing Fundamentals
Before you can confidently and intelligently choose investments, you need 
to be able to cut through the lingo and jargon to get to the heart of what 
investments are and are not, and how they differ from one another. In this 
part, we explain what rate of return you can reasonably expect to earn 
and how much risk you need to take to get it. This part also details how 
investments best fit your specific financial goals and situation.
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street
We know that you probably don’t want to trade in your day job for one where 
you’d wear a three-piece suit and need to know on which page of The Globe 
and Mail’s daily Report on Business section you can find yield curves. But 
you do need to understand what the financial markets are and how you can 
participate in them without suffering too many bumps and bruises. In this 
part, we explain what stocks and bonds are all about and how to best buy 
them and build your future fortune.
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate
We all need places to live, work, and shop, so it makes sense that real estate 
can be a profitable part of your investment portfolio. Intelligently buying and 

4
Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
managing real estate is harder than it looks, which is why this part covers 
lots of territory. We show you the best ways to invest in real estate and 
provide a crash course in mortgages, landlording, buying low, selling high, 
taxes, and more.
Part IV: Savouring Small Business
There’s nothing small about the potential profits you can make from small 
business. You can choose the small-business investment option that matches 
your skills and time. If you aspire to be the best boss you’ve ever had, here 
you can find the right ways to start your own business or buy someone 
else’s small business. Or maybe you’d like to try your hand at spotting 
up-and-comers but don’t want to be on the front lines — try investing in 
someone else’s small business.
Part V: Investing Resources
Flip through your cable television channels, crack open a magazine or 
newspaper, or surf the Web, and you quickly discover that you can’t 
escape investment advice. Surprisingly, each new guru you stumble upon 
contradicts the one who came before. Before you know it, although you’ve 
spent an avalanche of your valuable free time on all this investment stuff, 
you’re no closer to making an informed decision. In fact, if you’re like most 
people, you find yourself even more confused and paralyzed. Fear not! In this 
important part, we explain why many experts really aren’t experts and why 
most of them try to make the world of investing so mysterious. We highlight 
the best resources to use and the experts worth listening to.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
These shorter chapters build your investment knowledge further. You find 
advice about topics such as overcoming common psychological investment 
obstacles, tips for investing in a down market, and points to ponder when 
you sell an investment.
If you’re the kind of reader who jumps around from topic to topic instead 
of reading from cover to cover, you’ll be pleased that this book has 
a helpful index and that it highlights the pages where investing terms 
are defined.

Throughout this book, icons help guide you through the maze of suggestions, 
solutions, and cautions. We hope you find that the following images make 
your journey through investment strategies smoother.
 
In the shark-infested investing waters, you’ll find creatures that feast on 
novice waders, ready to take a bite out of a swimmer’s savings. This icon 
notes when and where the sharks may be circling.

L
ike a good map or aerial photograph, this part helps 
you see the big picture of the investment world. Here, 
we explain the different types of investments, which ones 
are good and bad for a variety of circumstances, what 
returns you can expect, and how to make wise investing 
decisions that fit with your overall financial situation.

I
n many parts of the world, life’s basic necessities — food, clothing, 
shelter, and taxes — gobble the entirety of people’s meagre earnings. 
Although some Canadians do struggle for basic necessities, the bigger 
problem for most Canadians is that they consider just about everything — 
eating out, driving new cars, hopping on an airplane for vacation — to be 
a necessity. We’ve taken it upon ourselves (using this book as our tool) to 
help you recognize that investing — that is, putting your money to work for 
you — is also a necessity. If you want to accomplish important personal and 
financial goals, such as owning a home, starting your own business, helping 
your kids through university (and spending more time with them when 
they’re young), retiring comfortably, and so on, you must know how to 
invest well.
It has been said, and too often quoted, that the only certainties in life are 
death and taxes. To these two certainties we add one more: being confused 
by and ignorant about investing. Because investing is a confounding activity, 
you may be tempted to look with envious eyes at those people in the world 
who appear to be savvy with money and investing. Remember that all of us 
start with the same level of financial knowledge — none! No one is born 
knowing this stuff! The only difference between those who know and those 
who don’t is that those who know have invested their time and energy 
acquiring knowledge about the investment world.
Getting Started with Investing
Before we discuss the major investing alternatives in the rest of this chapter, 
we want to start with something that’s quite basic, yet important. What 
exactly do we mean when we say “investing”? Simply stated, investing means 
you have money put away for future use.

10
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
There are thousands of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments. 
Unfortunately for the novice, and even for experts who are honest with you, 
knowing the name of the investment is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath 
each of these investments lurks a veritable mountain of details.
 
If you wanted to and had the ability, you could make a full-time endeavour out 
of analyzing economic trends and financial statements and talking to business 
employees, customers, suppliers, and so on. However, we don’t want to scare 
you away from investing just because some people do it on a full-time basis. 
Making wise investments need not take a lot of your time. If you know where 
to get high-quality information, and you purchase well-managed investments, 
you can leave the investment management to the best experts. Then you can 
do the work that you’re best at and have more free time for fun stuff.
An important part of making wise investments is knowing when you have 
enough information to do things well on your own versus when you should 
hire others to help you. For example, the foreign stock markets is generally 
more difficult to research and understand compared with domestic markets. 
Thus, hiring a good money manager, such as through a mutual fund, makes 
more sense when investing overseas than going to all the time, trouble, and 
expense of trying to pick your own individual stocks.
We’re here to give you the information you need to make your way through 
the complex investment world. In the rest of this chapter, we clear a path 
so that you can identify the major investments and understand what each is 
good for.
Building Wealth with Ownership 
Investments
 
If you want your money to grow, and you don’t mind a bit of a roller-coaster 
ride from time to time in your investment’s values, ownership investments 
are for you. Ownership investments are those where you own a piece of some 
company or other asset (such as stock, real estate, or a small business) that 
has the ability to generate revenue and, potentially, profits.
If you want to build wealth, observing how the world’s richest have built 
their wealth is enlightening. Not surprisingly, the champions of wealth 
around the globe gained their fortunes largely through owning a piece (or all) 
of a successful company that they (or others) have built. Take the case of 
Steve Jobs, co-founder and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Apple, of 
course, makes the iPod portable digital music player, computers, mobile 
communication devices (specifically, the iPhone), and software, among 
other products.

11
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
Every time we, or millions of other people, buy an Apple iPod, computer, or 
iPhone, Apple makes more money. As an owner of more than 5 million shares 
of stock, each of which was valued at around US$100 per share in late 2008 — 
after soaring to over US$200 — Jobs makes more money as increasing sales 
and profits drive up the stock’s price, which was less than US$10 per share as 
recently as 2004.
In addition to owning their own businesses, many well-to-do people have 
built their nest eggs by investing in real estate and the stock market. With 
softening housing prices in many regions in recent years, some folks newer 
to the real estate world incorrectly believe that real estate is a loser, not 
a long-term winner. Likewise, the stock market goes through down periods 
but does well over the long-term. (See Chapter 2 for the straight scoop on 
investment risks and returns.)
And of course, some people come into wealth the old-fashioned way — they 
inherit it. Even if your parents are among the rare wealthy ones and you 
expect them to pass on big bucks to you, you need to know how to invest 
money intelligently.
 
If you understand and are comfortable with the risks and take sensible steps 
to diversify (don’t put all your eggs in the same basket), ownership invest-
ments are the key to building wealth. To accomplish typical longer-term 
financial goals, such as retiring, the money you save and invest needs to grow 
at a healthy clip. If you dump all your money in bank accounts that pay little if 
any interest, you’re likely to fall short of your goals.
Not everyone needs to make his or her money grow, of course. Suppose that 
you inherit a significant sum and/or maintain a restrained standard of living 
and work your whole life simply because you enjoy doing so. In this situation, 
you may not need to take the risks involved with a potentially faster-growth 
investment. You may be more comfortable with safer investments, such as 
paying off your mortgage faster than necessary. Chapter 3 helps you think 
through such issues.
The stock market
Stocks are an example of an ownership investment because they represent 
shares of ownership in a company.
If you want to share in the growth and profits of companies like Apple, you 
can! You simply buy shares of their stock through a brokerage firm. However, 
just because Apple makes money in the future, there’s no guarantee that the 
value of its stock will increase.

12
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Some companies today sell their stock directly to investors, allowing you to 
bypass brokers. You can also invest in stocks via a stock mutual fund, where 
a fund manager decides which individual stocks to include in the fund. (We 
discuss the various methods for buying stock in Chapter 6.)
 
You don’t need a BA, MBA, MD, or PhD to make money in the stock market. If 
you can practice some simple lessons, such as making regular and systematic 
investments and investing in proven companies and funds while minimizing 
your investment expenses and taxes, you’ll be a winner.
However, we don’t believe that you can “beat the markets,” and you certainly 
can’t beat the best professional money managers at their own full-time 
game. This book shows you time-proven, non-gimmicky methods to make 
your money grow in the stock market as well as in other financial markets. 
(We explain how in Part II.)
Real estate
Another method that people of varying economic means use to build wealth 
is to invest in real estate. Owning and managing real estate is like running a 
small business. You need to satisfy customers (tenants), manage your costs, 
keep an eye on the competition, and so on. Some methods of real estate 
investing require more time than others, but many are proven ways to build 
wealth.
John, who works for a city government, and his wife, Linda, a computer 
analyst, have built several million dollars in investment real estate equity 
(the difference between the property’s market value and debts owed) over 
the past three decades. “Our parents owned rental property, and we could 
see what it could do for you by providing income and building wealth,” says 
John. Investing in real estate also appealed to John and Linda because they 
didn’t know anything about the stock market, so they wanted to stay away 
from it. The idea of leverage — making money with borrowed money — on 
real estate also appealed to them.
John and Linda bought their first property, a duplex, when their combined 
income was $20,000 per year. Every time they moved to a new home, they 
kept the prior one and converted it to a rental. Now in their 50s, John and 
Linda own seven pieces of investment real estate and are multimillionaires. 
“It’s like a second retirement, having thousands in monthly income from the 
real estate,” says John.
John readily admits that rental real estate has its hassles. “We haven’t 
enjoyed getting calls in the middle of the night, but now we have a property 
manager who can help with this when we’re not available. It’s also sometimes 
a pain finding new tenants,” he says.

13
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
Overall, John and Linda figure that they’ve been well rewarded for the time 
they spent and the money they invested. The income from John and Linda’s 
rental properties allows them to live in a nicer home.
 
Ultimately, to make your money grow much faster than inflation and taxes, 
you must absolutely, positively do at least one thing — take some risk. Any 
investment that has real growth potential also has shrinkage potential! You 
may not want to take the risk or have the stomach for it. Don’t despair: We 
discuss lower-risk investments in this book as well. You can find out about 
risks and returns in Chapter 2.
Small business
We know people who have hit investing home runs by owning or buying a 
business. Unlike the part-time nature of investing in the stock market, most 
people work at running their business full time, increasing their chances of 
doing something big financially with it. If you try to invest in individual 
stocks, by contrast, you’re likely to work at it part time, competing against 
professionals who invest practically around the clock. Even if you devote 
almost all of your time to managing your stock portfolio, you’re still a passive 
bystander in a business run by someone else. When you invest in your own 
small business, you’re the boss, for better or worse.
A decade ago, Calvin set out to develop a corporate publishing firm. Because 
he took the risk of starting his business and has been successful in slowly 
building it, today, in his 50s, he enjoys a net worth of more than $10 million 
and can retire if he wants. Even more important to many business owners — 
Who wants to invest like a millionaire?
Having a million dollars isn’t nearly as rare as it 
used to be. In fact, according to Investor Eco-
nomics, a firm that conducts research on 
wealth, in 2008 482,000 Canadian households 
had at least $1 million in wealth (excluding the 
value of any real estate they owned as well as 
any pensions). Nearly 70,000 households had 
$5 million or more in wealth. (Note that these 
figures come from before the major drop in the 
stock market in the fall of 2008!) Interestingly, 
one Investor Economics study found that 64 
percent of those households with wealth of at 
least $1 million used full-service brokers, and 
only one in four used the services of a financial 
planner.
As in past surveys, recent wealth surveys show 
that affluent investors achieved and built upon 
their wealth with ownership investments, such 
as their own small businesses, real estate, and 
stocks.

14
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
and the reason that financially successful entrepreneurs such as Calvin 
don’t call it quits after they’ve amassed a lot of cash — are the non-financial 
rewards of investing, including the challenge and fulfillment of operating a 
successful business.
Sandra has worked on her own as an interior designer for more than two 
decades. She previously worked in fashion as a model, and then as a retail 
store manager. Her first taste of interior design was redesigning rooms 
at a condominium project. “I knew when I did that first building and turned 
it into something wonderful and profitable that I loved doing this kind of 
work,” says Sandra. Today, Sandra’s firm specializes in the restoration of 
landmark hotels, and her work has been written up in numerous magazines. 
“The money is not of primary importance to me . . . my work is driven by a 
passion . . . but obviously it has to be profitable,” she says. Sandra has also 
experienced the fun and enjoyment of designing hotels in many parts of the 
world, including one in Japan.
Most small-business owners (ourselves included) quickly point out that the 
entrepreneurial life is not a walk through the rose garden (although it does 
have its share of thorns). Emotionally and financially, entrepreneurship is 
sometimes a roller coaster. In addition to the financial rewards, however, 
small-business owners can enjoy seeing the impact of their work and knowing 
that it makes a difference. Combined, Calvin and Sandra’s firms created 
dozens of new jobs.
Not everyone needs to be sparked by the desire to start her own company 
to profit from small business. You can share in the economic rewards 
of the entrepreneurial world through buying an existing business or investing 
in someone else’s budding enterprise. We talk more about evaluating and 
buying a business in Part IV of this book.
Generating Income from 
Lending Investments
The other major types of investment include those in which you lend your 
money. Suppose that, like most people, you keep some money in your local 
bank — most likely in a chequing account, but perhaps also in a savings 
account or guaranteed investment certificate (GIC). No matter what type of 
account you place your money in, you’re lending your money to the bank or 
credit union.

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
 
For how long and under what conditions you lend money to your bank depend 
on the specific bank and account that you use. With a GIC, you commit to 
lending your money to the bank for a specific length of time — perhaps six 
months or even a year. In return, the bank probably pays you a higher rate of 
interest than if you put your money in a bank account offering you immediate 
access to the money. (You may be able to demand termination of the GIC 
early; however, you’ll typically be penalized.)
As we discuss in more detail in Chapter 7, you can also invest your money 
in bonds — another type of lending investment. When you purchase a bond 
that has been issued by the government or a company, you agree to lend 
your money for a predetermined period of time and receive a particular rate 
of interest. A bond may pay you 6 percent interest over the next five years, 
for example.
An investor’s return from lending investments is typically limited to the 
original investment plus interest payments. If you lend your money to Rogers 
Communications — the cable and cell phone giant — through one of its 
The double whammy of inflation and taxes
Bank accounts and bonds that pay a decent 
return are reassuring to many investors. Earning 
a small amount of interest sure beats losing 
some or all of your money in a risky investment.
The problem is that money in a savings account, 
for example, that pays 3 percent isn’t actually 
yielding you 3 percent. It’s not that the bank is 
lying — it’s just that your investment bucket 
contains some not-so-obvious holes.
The first hole is taxes. When you earn interest, 
you must pay taxes on it (unless you invest the 
money in a tax-deferred retirement plan or a 
Tax-Free Savings Account). If you’re a moder-
ate-income earner, you end up losing about a 
third of your interest to taxes. Your 3 percent 
return is now down to 2 percent.
But the second hole in your investment bucket 
can be even bigger than taxes: inflation. 
Although a few products become cheaper over 
time (computers, for example), most goods and 
services increase in price. Inflation in Canada 
has recently been running at around 3 percent 
per year. Inflation depresses the purchasing 
power of your investment’s returns. If you sub-
tract the 3 percent “cost” of inflation from the 
remaining 2 percent after payment of taxes, 
we’re sorry to say that you lost 1 percent on 
your investment.
To recap: For every dollar you invested in the 
bank a year ago, despite the fact that the bank 
paid you your 3 pennies of interest, you’re left 
with only 99 cents in real purchasing power for 
every dollar you had a year ago. In other words, 
thanks to the inflation and tax holes in your 
investment bucket, you can buy less with your 
money now compared to what you could have 
a year ago, even though you’ve invested your 
money for a year.

16
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
bonds that matures, say, in ten years, and Rogers triples in size over the next 
decade, you won’t share in its growth. Rogers stockholders and — to a much 
lesser degree — employees reap the rewards of the company’s success, but 
as a bondholder, you don’t (you simply get interest and the face value of the 
bond back at maturity).
 
Many people keep too much of their money in lending investments, thus 
allowing others to reap the rewards of economic growth. Although lending 
investments appear safer because you know in advance what return you’ll 
receive, they aren’t that safe. The long-term risk of these seemingly safe 
money investments is that your money will grow too slowly to enable you to 
accomplish your personal financial goals. In the worst cases, the company 
or other institution to which you’re lending money can go under and stiff you 
for your loan.
Considering Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are any investments that you can quickly convert to cash 
without cost to you. With most chequing accounts, for example, you can 
write a cheque or withdraw cash by visiting a teller — either the live or the 
automated type.
Money market mutual funds are another type of cash equivalent. Investors, 
both large and small, invest hundreds of billions of dollars in money market 
mutual funds because the best money market funds produce higher yields 
than bank savings accounts. The yield advantage of a money market fund 
almost always widens when interest rates increase because banks move 
about as fast as molasses on a cold winter day to raise savings account rates.
Why shouldn’t you take advantage of an extra 1 or 2 percent yield? Many 
bank savers sacrifice this yield because they think that money market funds 
are risky — but they’re not. Money market mutual funds generally invest in 
ultrasafe things such as GICs, government-issued Treasury bills, and commer-
cial paper (short-term bonds) that the most creditworthy corporations issue.
Another reason people keep too much money in traditional bank accounts is 
that the local bank branch office makes the cash seem more accessible. 
Money market mutual funds and high-interest savings accounts, however, 
offer many quick ways to get your cash. You can generally call or write and 
request that your money be mailed or wired to you, or have it transferred to 
your bank account.
 
By all means, keep your chequing account at the local bank so that you can 
write smaller cheques to pay your cable television, phone, and utility bills. 
But with that done, move any extra money that’s dozing away in your 
bank savings account into a higher-yielding money market mutual fund or

high-interest savings account! Even if you have just a few thousand dollars, 
the extra yield more than pays for the cost of this book. (See Chapter 8 to 
find out more about money market funds.)
Steering Clear of Futures and Options
Suppose you think that the stock of Research in Motion (RIM) — maker of the 
BlackBerry — is a good investment. The direction that the management team 
is taking impresses you, and you like the products and services that the com-
pany offers. Profits seem to be on a positive trend; everything’s looking up.
You can go out and buy the stock — suppose that it’s currently trading at 
around $100 per share. If the price rises to $150 in the next six months, 
you’ve made yourself a 50 percent profit ($150 – $100 = $50) on your original 
$100 investment. (Of course, you have to pay some brokerage fees to buy and 
then sell the stock.)
But instead of buying the stock outright, you can buy what are known as call 
options on RIM. A call option gives you the right to buy shares of RIM under 
specified terms from the person who sells you the call option. You may be 
able to purchase a call option that allows you to exercise your right to buy 
RIM stock at, say, $120 per share in the next six months. For this privilege, 
you may pay $2 per share.
If RIM’s stock price skyrockets to, say, $150 in the next few months, the value 
of your options that allow you to buy the stock at $120 will be worth a lot — 
at least $30. You can then simply sell your options, which you bought for 
$2 in this example, at a huge profit — you’ve multiplied your money 15-fold!
 
Although this talk of fat profits sounds much more exciting than simply buying 
the stock directly and making far less money from a stock price increase, 
options have two big problems:
 
✓ If RIM’s stock price goes nowhere or rises only a little during the 
six-month period when you hold the call option, the option expires as 
worthless, and you lose all — that is, 100 percent — of your investment. 
In fact, in our example, if RIM’s stock trades at $120 or less at the time 
the option expires, the option is worthless.
 
✓ A call option represents a short-term gamble (in this example, over the 
next six months) on RIM’s stock price — not an investment in RIM. RIM 
could expand its business and profits greatly in the years and decades 
ahead, but the value of the call option hinges on the ups and downs 
of RIM’s stock price over a relatively short period of time. If the stock 
market happens to dip in the next six months, RIM may get pulled down 
as well, despite the company’s improving financial health.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Futures are similar to options in that both can be used as gambling instru-
ments. Futures deal mainly with the value of commodities such as heating oil, 
corn, wheat, gold, silver, and pork bellies. Futures have a delivery date that’s 
in the not-too-distant future. (Do you really want bushels of wheat delivered 
to your home? Or worse yet, pork bellies?) You can place a small down 
payment — around 10 percent — toward the purchase of futures, thereby 
greatly leveraging your “investment.” If prices fall, you need to put up more 
money to keep from having your position sold.
Our advice: Don’t gamble with futures and options.
 
The only real use that you may (if ever) have for these derivatives (so called 
because their value is “derived” from the price of other securities) is to hedge. 
Suppose that you hold a lot of a stock that has greatly appreciated, and you 
don’t want to sell now because of the tax bite. Perhaps you want to postpone 
selling the stock until next year because you plan on not working, and you 
can then benefit from the lower, long-term capital gains tax rate. You can 
buy what’s called a put option, which increases in value when a stock’s price 
falls (because the put option grants you the right to sell your stock to the 
purchaser of the put option at a preset stock price). Thus, if the stock price 
does fall, the rising put option value offsets some of your losses on the stock 
you still hold. Using put options allows you to postpone selling your stock 
without exposing yourself to the risk of a falling stock price.
Get rich with oil and gold?
During the global economic expansion of the 
2000s, oil and other commodities increased sig-
nificantly in value. The surge in oil prices cer-
tainly garnered plenty of headlines when it 
surged past US$100 per barrel. So too did the 
price of gold as it surged past US$1,000 in 2008, 
setting a new all-time high. These prices repre-
sented tremendous increases over the past 
decade, with the price of oil having increased 
more than 600 percent (from less than US$20 
per barrel) and gold more than tripling in value 
(from less than US$300 per ounce).
However, despite these seemingly major moves, 
when considering the increases in the cost of 
living, at US$100-plus per barrel, oil prices were 
just reaching the levels attained in late 1979! 
(To underscore just how volatile prices can be, 
oil went to over US$140 in July of 2008, and by 
the end of the year was trading at just US$40!) 
And when gold hit a new high in early 2008, it 
was still far, far from the inflation-adjusted 
levels it reached nearly three decades earlier. 
To reach those levels, gold would have to more 
than double from its current high levels to more 
than US$2,000 an ounce!
So although the price increases in gold and oil 
(as well as some other commodities) were 
dramatic during the past decade, over the past 
30 years, oil and gold increased in value less 
than the overall low rate of inflation. So, one 
would hardly have gotten rich investing in oil 
and gold over the long-term.

Passing Up Precious Metals
Over the millennia, gold and silver have served as mediums of exchange or 
currency because they have intrinsic value and can’t be debased the way 
that paper currencies can (by printing more money). These precious metals 
are used in jewellery and manufacturing.
As investments, gold and silver perform well during bouts of inflation. For 
example, from 1972 to 1980, when inflation zoomed into the double-digit 
range in Canada and the United States and stocks and bonds went into 
the tank, gold and silver prices skyrocketed more than 500 percent. With 
precious metals prices zooming skyward again in the 2000s, some have 
feared the return of inflation, but the surging prices seem to have been 
driven by the global economic boom, not inflation.
 
Over the long term, precious metals are lousy investments. They don’t pay 
any dividends, and their price increases at best may just keep up with, but 
not ahead of, increases in the cost of living. Although investing in precious 
metals is better than keeping cash in a piggy bank or stuffing it in a mattress, 
the investment returns aren’t nearly as good as bonds, stocks, and real estate. 
One way to earn better long-term returns than what investing in simple 
precious metals provides is to invest in a mutual fund of stocks of gold and 
precious metals companies (see Chapter 8 for more information).
Counting Out Collectibles
The term collectibles is a catchall category for antiques, art, autographs, 
hockey cards, clocks, coins, comic books, diamonds, dolls, gems, photo-
graphs, rare books, rugs, stamps, vintage wine, writing utensils, and a whole 
host of other items. Although connoisseurs of fine art, antiques, and vintage 
wine wouldn’t like the comparison of their pastime with buying old playing 
cards or chamber pots, the bottom line is that collectibles are all objects 
with little intrinsic value. Wine is just a bunch of old mushed-up grapes. A 
painting is simply a canvas and some paint that at retail would set you back a 
few bucks. Stamps are small pieces of paper, just a few square centimeters. 
Hockey cards — heck, when we were young, we used to stick these between 
our bike spokes!
We’re not trying to diminish contributions that artists and others make to 
our culture. And we know that some people place a high value on some of 
these collectibles. But true investments that can make your money grow, 
such as stocks, real estate, or a small business, are assets that can produce 
income and profits. Collectibles have little intrinsic value and are thus 
subject to the whims and speculations of buyers and sellers.

20
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
Here are some other major problems with collectibles:
 
✓ Markups are huge. The spread between the price that a dealer pays for 
an object and the price that the dealer sells the same exact object for 
is often around 100 percent. Sometimes the difference is even greater, 
particularly if a dealer is the second or third middleman in the chain 
of purchase. So at a minimum, your purchase must typically double in 
value just to get you back to even. And that may take 10 to 20 years 
or more!
 
✓ Lots of other costs add up. If the markups aren’t bad enough, with some 
collectibles you incur all sorts of other costs. If you buy more-expensive 
pieces, you may need to have them appraised. You may have to pay 
storage and insurance costs as well. And unlike the markup, you pay 
some of these fees year after year after year of ownership.
 
✓ You can get stuck with a pig in a poke. Sometimes, you may overpay 
even more for a collectible because you don’t realize some imperfection 
or inferiority of an item. Worse, you may buy a forgery. Even reputable 
dealers have been duped by forgeries.
 
✓ Your pride and joy can deteriorate over time. Damage from sunlight, 
humidity, temperatures that are too high or too low, and a whole host of 
vagaries can ruin the quality of your collectible. Insurance doesn’t cover 
this type of damage or negligence on your part.
 
✓ The returns stink. Even if you ignore the substantial costs of buying, 
holding, and selling, the average returns that investors earn from 
collectibles rarely keep ahead of inflation and are generally inferior to 
stock market, real estate, and small-business investing. Objective 
collectible return data are hard to come by. Never, ever trust “data” 
that dealers or the many collectible trade publications provide.
The best returns that collectible investors reap come from the ability to 
identify, years in advance, items that will become popular. Do you think you 
can do that? You may be the smartest person in the world, but you should 
know that most dealers can’t tell what’s going to rocket to popularity in the 
coming decades. Dealers make their profits the same way as other retailers, 
from the spread or markup on the merchandise that they sell. The public and 
collectors have fickle, quirky tastes that no one can predict. Did you know 
that Beanie Babies, Furbies, Pet Rocks, or Cabbage Patch Kids were going to 
be such hits?
You can find out enough about a specific type of collectible to become a 
better investor than the average person, but you’re going to have to be 
among the best — perhaps the top 10 percent of such collectors — to have 
a shot at earning decent returns. To get to this level of expertise, you need 
to invest hundreds if not thousands of hours reading, researching, and 
educating yourself about your specific type of collectible.

21
 Chapter 1: Exploring Your Investment Choices
Nothing is wrong with spending money on collectibles, but we don’t want you 
to fool yourself into thinking that they’re investments. You can sink lots of 
your money into these non-income-producing, poor-return “investments.” At 
their best as investments, collectibles give the wealthy a way to buy quality 
stuff that doesn’t depreciate.
 
If you must buy collectibles, here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Collect for your love of the collectible, your desire to enjoy it, or your 
interest in finding out about or mastering a subject, not because you 
expect high investment returns, because you probably won’t get them.
 
✓ Keep quality items that you and your family have purchased and hope 
will be worth something someday. Keeping these quality items is the 
simplest way to break into the collectible business. The complete sets 
of baseball cards Eric gathered as a youngster are now (30-plus years 
later) worth hundreds of dollars — in one case, $1,000!
 
✓ Buy from the source and cut out the middlemen whenever possible. In 
some cases, you may be able to buy from the artist. (Tony’s wife pur-
chases much of her pottery and paintings directly from the artists.)
 
✓ Check collectibles that are comparable to the one you have your eye 
on, shop around, and don’t be afraid to negotiate. An effective way to 
negotiate, after you decide what you like, is to make your offer to the 
dealer or artist by phone. Because the seller isn’t standing right next to 
you, you don’t feel pressure to decide immediately.
 
✓ Ask the dealer who thinks that the item is such a great investment for a 
written guarantee to buy back the item from you, if you opt to sell, for at 
least the same price you paid or higher within five years.
 
✓ Use a comprehensive resource to research, buy, sell, maintain, and 
improve your collectible, such as the books by Ralph and Terry Kovel or 
their Web site at www.kovels.com.

Weighing Risks and Returns

A
woman passes up eating a hamburger at a picnic because she heard 
that she could contract a deadly E. coli infection from eating improperly 
cooked meat. The next week, that same woman hops in the passenger seat of 
her friend’s car without buckling her seat belt.
A mother covers her young daughter in sunscreen and makes sure she’s 
wearing a wide-brimmed hat before going outside in the summertime. That 
same mother leaves the child — fully protected from the sun’s rays — to play 
unwatched with a relative’s dog that then bites the child.
We’re not trying to depress or frighten anyone. However, we are trying to make 
an important point about risk — something that we all deal with on a daily 
basis. Risk is in the eye of the beholder. Many of us base our perception of 
risk, in large part, on our experiences and what we’ve been exposed to. Many 
people fret about relatively small risks while overlooking much larger risks.
Sure, a risk of an E. coli infection from eating poorly cooked meat exists, so 
the woman who was leery of eating the hamburger at the picnic had a legiti-
mate concern. However, by getting into the friend’s car without doing up her 
seat belt, that same woman placed herself at far greater risk of dying than if 
she had eaten the hamburger. Annually in Canada, about 3,500 people die in 
automobile accidents, and not wearing a seat belt greatly increases the odds 
of serious or even fatal injuries should you crash.
Likewise, the odds of developing skin cancer are greater if you’re regularly 
exposed to the sun’s rays without protection, so it’s logical for the mother 
to clothe her child in protective clothing and regularly apply sunscreen. 
However, the mother completely overlooked the significant risk posed by 
allowing a small child to play with a dog.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Evaluating Risks
Everywhere you turn, risks exist; some are just more apparent than others. 
Many people misunderstand risks. With increased knowledge, you may 
be able to reduce or conquer some of your fears and make more sensible 
decisions about reducing risks. For example, some people who fear flying 
don’t understand that, statistically, flying is much safer than driving a car. 
You’re approximately 40 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle than in 
an airplane. But when a plane goes down, it’s big news because dozens and 
sometimes hundreds of people, who weren’t engaging in reckless behaviour, 
perish. Meanwhile, the media seem to pay less attention to the seven-plus 
people, on average, who die on the road in Canada every day.
This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t drive or fly, or that you shouldn’t drive 
to the airport. However, you may consider taking steps to reduce the signifi-
cant risks you expose yourself to in a car. For example, you can get a car with 
more safety features, or you may bypass riding with reckless taxi drivers 
whose cars lack seat belts.
Although some of us like to live life to its fullest and take “fun” risks (how else 
can you explain extreme skiers, parachutists, and bungee jumpers?), most 
people seek to minimize risk and maximize enjoyment in their lives. But 
most people also understand that they’d be a lot less happy living a life that 
sought to eliminate all risks, and they likely wouldn’t be able to anyway.
 
Likewise, if you attempt to avoid all the risks that investing involves, you 
won’t succeed, and you likely won’t be happy with your investment results 
and lifestyle. In the investment world, some people don’t go near stocks or any 
investment that they perceive to be volatile. As a result, such investors often 
end up with lousy long-term returns, and they expose themselves to some 
high risks that they overlooked, such as the risk of inflation and taxes eroding 
the purchasing power of their money.
You can’t live without taking risks. Risk-free activities or ways of living don’t 
exist. You can minimize, but never eliminate, risks. Some methods of risk 
reduction aren’t palatable because they reduce your quality of life. Risks are 
also composed of several factors. In the sections that follow, we discuss the 
various types of investment risks and methods that you can use to sensibly 
reduce these risks while not missing out on the upside that growth invest-
ments offer.
Market-value risk
Although the stock market can help you build wealth, most people recognize 
that it can also plunge quite a bit — 10, 20, or 30 percent or more in no time. 
Consider what happened in 2008. After peaking in October 2007, Canadian and 

25
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
U.S. stocks, as measured by the major indexes representing the value of large 
companies (for Canada, the TSX composite index, and for the United States, 
the S&P 500 index), dropped about 42 percent over the next 12 months.
In the fall of 2008, in fact, these stocks dropped over 30 percent in just over 
a single month! If you had invested $5,000 during this time period, your invest-
ment may have shrunk to $3,500 or less. Similarly, those who invested $50,000 
saw it shrink to $35,000 or less. Although that loss doesn’t feel good, it’s the 
reality of risk. Your investment can — and sometimes will — shrink in value.
The drop in 2008 echoed what happened at the beginning of the decade. After 
soaring to new highs in 2000 due to the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s, 
large-cap Canadian and U.S. stocks — again, using the TSX composite index 
for Canada and the S&P 500 index for the U.S. — dropped about 50 percent 
by 2002. Stocks on the NASDAQ, which is heavily weighted toward technology 
stocks, plunged more than 76 percent from 2000 through 2002.
A few years earlier, it took just a mere six weeks (from mid-July 1998 to early 
September 1998) for large-company Canadian and U.S. stocks to plummet 
by about 20 percent. In just under three months, a broad measurement of 
companies traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by almost 27 percent. 
During the same period, an index of smaller-company U.S. stocks plunged 33 
percent.
True, the stock market crash that occurred in the fall of 2008 was a hard, fast 
one (the market plunged 30 percent in a matter of weeks). But take a look at 
Tables 2-1 and 2-2, which show other massive plunges in the Canadian and 
U.S. stock markets, respectively, over the past several decades.

Real estate exhibits similar unruly, annoying tendencies. Although real estate 
(like stocks) has been a terrific long-term investment, various real estate mar-
kets get clobbered from time to time.
When the oil industry collapsed in Alberta in the early 1980s, real estate 
prices in the province dropped by 25 percent. And after a massive run-up 
in prices in the mid-1980s, house prices in the Toronto area plummeted 
by nearly 28 percent over the next few years. U.S. housing prices took a 25 
percent tumble from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. Later in the 1980s and 
early 1990s, the northeastern United States became mired in a severe reces-
sion, and real estate prices fell by 20-plus percent in many areas. After peak-
ing near 1990, many of the West Coast housing markets, especially those in 
California, experienced falling prices — dropping 20 percent or more in most 
areas by the mid-1990s. The Japanese real estate market crash also began 
around the time of the California market fall. Property prices in Japan col-
lapsed more than 60 percent.
Declining U.S. housing prices in the mid- to late 2000s garnered unprec-
edented attention. Some folks and pundits acted like this was the worst 
housing market ever. To date, it seems comparable to the decline of the early 
1990s. After hitting their peak in the summer of 2006, housing prices had 
fallen by almost 20 percent by the fall of 2008, with some areas seeing prices 
drop by 30 percent. Foreclosures increased in part due to buyers financing 
their home’s purchase with risky mortgages. (This became known as sub-
prime lending, hence the term “subprime crisis.”) We must note here that 
housing market conditions vary by area. For example, some portions of the 

27
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
U.S. Pacific Northwest and South actually appreciated during the mid- to late 
2000s, while other markets experienced declines.
After reading this section, you may want to keep all your money in the bank — 
after all, you know you won’t lose your money, and you won’t have to be a 
non-stop worrier. No one has ever lost 20, 40, 60, or 80 percent of a bank-held 
savings vehicle in a few years! But just letting your money sit around would 
be a mistake.
 
If you pass up the stock and real estate markets simply because of the poten-
tial market value risk, you miss out on a historic, time-tested method of build-
ing substantial wealth. Instead of seeing declines and market corrections as a 
horrible thing, view them as the markets having a sale. If you’re considering 
buying stocks or real estate, a decline in prices presents opportunities, but 
human emotions often scare us away from buying something that seemingly 
others are shunning.
Later in this chapter, we show you the generous returns that stocks and real 
estate as well as other investments have historically provided. The following 
sections suggest some simple things you can do to lower your investing risk 
and help prevent your portfolio from suffering a huge fall.
Diversify for a gentler ride
Individual stock markets may crash. However, the various stock markets 
around the world don’t always crash at the same time, as they did in 2008. 
For example, when the Canadian and U.S. stock markets collapsed in the fall 
of 1987, some overseas stock markets dropped far less or not at all. So if you 
had spread your money across the many different stock markets, your port-
folio wouldn’t have suffered nearly as much as it would have if you held all 
your stocks in North America.
 
You can invest outside of Canada to reduce your investment risk if you worry 
about the health of the Canadian economy, the government, and the dollar. 
Most large Canadian companies do business in the United States and over-
seas, so when you invest in larger Canadian company stocks, you get some 
international investment exposure. You can also invest in international com-
pany stocks, ideally via mutual funds (which we discuss in Chapter 8).
Of course, investing overseas can’t totally protect you. You can’t do much 
about a global economic catastrophe. If you worry about the risk of such a 
calamity, you should probably also worry about a huge meteor crashing into 
Earth. Maybe there’s a way to colonize outer space. . . .
 
Diversifying your investments can involve more than just your stock portfolio, 
however. You can also hold some real estate investments to diversify your 
investment portfolio. Many real estate markets actually appreciated in the 
early 2000s while North American stock markets were in the doghouse. 

28
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Conversely, while real estate in many regions began a multi-year slump in the 
mid-2000s, stocks performed well for the next few years leading up to the 2008 
crash.
Consider your time horizon
Investors who worry that the stock market may take a dive and take their 
money down with it should first consider the length of time that they plan 
to invest. In a one-year period in the stock and bond markets, anything can 
happen (as shown in Figure 2-1). History shows that about once in every 
three years that you invest in the stock and bond markets, you lose money. 
However, stock market investors have made money (sometimes substantial 
amounts) approximately two-thirds of the time over a one-year period. (Bond 
investors made money about two-thirds of the time, too, although they made 
a good deal less on average.)

 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Although the stock market is more volatile than the bond market in the short 
term, stock market investors have earned far better long-term returns than 
bond investors have. (See the “Stock returns” section, later in this chapter.) 
Why? Because stock investors bear risks that bond investors don’t bear, and 
it’s a reasonable expectation they will be compensated for it. Remember, 
however, that bonds generally outperform a boring old bank account.
 
History has shown that the risk of a stock or bond market fall becomes less of 
a concern the longer the period that you plan to invest. As Figure 2-2 shows, 
as the holding period during which you own stocks increases from 1 year to 3 
years to 5 years to 10 years, and then to 20 years, your likelihood of making a 
profit increases. In fact, over any 20-year time span, U.S. stock market inves-
tors have never lost money, even after you subtract for the effects of inflation.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
We’ve used U.S. data in Figure 2-2 above simply because several more 
decades of market data are available, giving us a better view of the mar-
ket’s long-term behaviour. However, the same essential point holds true for 
Canada. Since 1957, only one 5-year period has had a negative return. In other 
words, if you had invested in the broad market (meaning your returns were 
similar to the composite index) and held on for five years, in only one period 
would you have had less after five years than you started with. And if you 
had invested and stayed invested for ten years, you would always have come 
out ahead. To put it another way, starting in 1957, if you had invested in any 
year and held those investments for a minimum of ten years, you would have 
ended up with a profit, assuming your returns matched those of the index.
Most stock market investors we know are concerned about the risk of losing 
money. What Figure 2-2 clearly shows is that the key to minimizing the prob-
ability that you’ll lose money in stocks is to hold them for the longer term. 
Don’t invest in stocks unless you plan to hold them for at least five years — 
and preferably a decade or longer. Please see Part II of this book for more on 
using stocks as a long-term investment.
Pare down holdings in bloated markets
Perhaps you’ve heard the expression “Buy low, sell high.” Although we don’t 
believe that you can time the markets (that is, predict the most profitable 
time to buy and sell), spotting a greatly overpriced market isn’t too difficult. 
For example, in the first edition of this book, published in 2000, we warned 
readers about the grossly inflated prices of many Internet and technology 
stocks (see Chapter 5). Throughout this book, we explain some simple yet 
powerful methods you can use to measure whether a particular investment 
market is of fair value, of good value, or overpriced. You should avoid over-
priced investments for two important reasons:
 
✓ If and when these overpriced investments fall, they usually fall farther 
and faster than more fairly priced investments.
 
✓ You can always find other investments that offer higher potential 
returns.
 
Ideally, you want to avoid having a lot of your money in markets that appear 
to be overpriced (see Chapter 5 for how to spot pricey markets). Practically 
speaking, avoiding overpriced markets doesn’t mean that you should try to 
sell all your holdings in such markets with the vain hope of buying them back 
at a much lower price. However, you may benefit from the following strategies:
 
✓ Invest new money elsewhere. Focus investment of new money some-
where other than the overpriced market; put it into investments that 
offer you better values. Thus, without selling any of your seemingly 
expensive investments, they become a smaller portion of your total 
holdings. If you hold investments outside tax-sheltered retirement plans, 
focusing your money elsewhere also offers the benefit of allowing you to 
avoid incurring taxes from selling appreciated investments.

31
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
 
✓ If you have to sell, sell the expensive stuff. If you need to raise money 
to live on, such as for retirement or for a major purchase, sell the big-
ticket items. As long as the taxes aren’t too troublesome, it’s better to 
sell high and lock in your profits. Chapter 21 discusses issues to weigh 
when you contemplate selling an investment.
Individual investment risk
A downdraft can put an entire investment market on a roller-coaster ride, but 
healthy markets also have their share of individual losers. For example, from 
the early 1980s through the late 1990s, North American stock markets had 
one of the greatest periods of appreciation in history. You’d never know it, 
though, if you held one of the great losers of that period.
Consider a company now called Navistar, which has undergone enormous 
transformations in the past two decades. This company used to be called 
International Harvester and manufactured farm equipment, trucks, and con-
struction and other industrial equipment. Today, Navistar makes mostly 
trucks.
In late 1983, this company’s stock traded at more than US$140 per share. It 
then plunged more than 90 percent over the ensuing decade (as shown in 
Figure 2-3). Even with a rally in recent years, Navistar stock still trades at 
under US$50 per share (after dipping below US$10 per share). Lest you think 
that’s a big drop, this company’s stock traded as high as US$455 per share 
in the late 1970s! If a worker retired from this company in the late 1970s 
with $200,000 invested in the company stock, the retiree’s investment would 
be worth about $25,000 today! On the other hand, if the retiree had simply 
swapped his stock at retirement for a diversified portfolio of stocks, which I 
explain how to build in Part II, his $200,000 nest egg would’ve instead grown 
to more than $2,800,000!

Like most other markets, the Canadian stock market paled by comparison 
with the U.S. juggernaut in the 1990s, but this country has had its share of 
stocks that have plummeted in value. How about Dylex, which through its 
many brand name outlets, such as Suzy Shier, at one time took in one out of 
every ten dollars consumers spent in retail clothing outlets? The stock, which 
began the 1990s at $24, ended the decade languishing beneath the $10 mark, 
dwindling lower and lower until the company eventually went under in 2001.
And then, of course, there’s Nortel. In the late 1990s, many of the investors 
Tony profiled in his Globe and Mail column “Me and My Money” happily 
recounted how well they’d done by buying Nortel, making two, three, even 
ten times or more on their original investment. Nortel, or so we were told, 
just couldn’t keep up with the Internet-driven demand for its products. The 
stock peaked at over $120 in August 2000. And then, in a matter of months, 
the company’s cheerleaders were proven to be completely, hopelessly 
wrong. Nortel crumbled, and by October 2002 it had literally turned into 
a penny stock, trading at under a buck. Tony soon found that many of the 
investors he profiled in his column were calling Nortel one of their “worst 
moves,” and by the end of the decade, it was still in the basement!
Just as individual stock prices can plummet, so can individual real estate 
property prices. In California during the 1990s, for example, earthquakes 
rocked the prices of properties built on landfill. These quakes highlighted the 
dangers of building on poor soil. (Ultimately, many property owners in these 
areas were compensated for their losses by the U.S. government, as well as 
by some real estate agencies that didn’t disclose these known contaminants.)
 
Here are some simple steps you can take to lower the risk of individual 
investments that can upset your goals:
 
✓ Do your homework. When you purchase real estate, a whole host of 
inspections can save you from buying a money pit. With stocks, you can 
examine some measures of value and the company’s financial condition 
and business strategy to reduce your chances of buying into an over-
priced company or one on the verge of major problems. Parts II, III, and IV 
of this book give you more information on researching your investment.
 
✓ Diversify. Investors who seek growth invest in securities such as stocks. 
Placing significant amounts of your capital in one or a handful of securi-
ties is risky, particularly if the stocks are in the same industry or closely 
related industries. To reduce this risk, purchase stocks in a variety of 
industries and companies within each industry. (See Part II for details.)
 
✓ Hire someone to invest for you. The best mutual funds (see Chapter 8) 
offer low-cost, professional management and oversight, as well as diver-
sification. Stock mutual funds typically own 25 or more securities in a 
variety of companies in different industries. The best exchange-traded 
funds offer similar benefits at low cost. In Part III, we explain how you 
can invest in real estate in a similar way (that is, by leaving the driving 
to someone else).

33
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Purchasing-power risk
Increases in the cost of living (that is, inflation) can erode the value of your 
retirement resources and what you can buy with that money — also known 
as its purchasing power. When Ethel retired at the age of 60, she was pleased 
with her retirement income. She was receiving an $800-per-month pension 
and $1,200 per month from money that she had invested in long-term bonds. 
Her monthly expenditures amounted to about $1,500, so she was able to save 
a little money for an occasional trip.
Fast-forward 15 years. Ethel still receives $800 per month from her pension, 
but now she gets only $900 per month of investment income, which comes 
from some GICs (guaranteed investment certificates). Ethel bailed out of bonds 
after she lost sleep over the sometimes roller-coaster-like price movements 
in the bond market. Her monthly expenditures now amount to approximately 
$2,400, and she uses some of her investment principal (original investment). 
She’s terrified of outliving her money.
Ethel has reason to worry. She has 100 percent of her money invested with-
out protection against increases in the cost of living. Although her income 
felt comfortable in the beginning of her retirement, it doesn’t at age 75, and 
Ethel may easily live another 15 or more years.
Liquidity
The term liquidity refers to how long it takes and 
how much it costs to convert an investment into 
cash. The money in your wallet is considered 
perfectly liquid — it’s already cash.
Suppose that you invested money in a handful 
of stocks. Although you can’t easily sell these 
stocks on a Saturday night, you can sell most 
stocks quickly through a broker for a nominal 
fee any day that the financial markets are open 
(normal working days). You pay a higher per-
centage to sell your stocks if you use a high-
cost broker or if you have a small amount of 
stock to sell.
Real estate is generally much less liquid than 
stock. Preparing your property for sale takes 
time, and if you want to get fair market value for 
your property, finding a buyer may take weeks 
or months. Selling costs (agent commissions, 
fix-up expenses, and closing costs) can easily 
approach 10 percent of the home’s value.
A privately run small business is among the 
least liquid of the better growth investments 
that you can make. Selling such a business typi-
cally takes longer than selling most real estate.
So that you’re not forced to sell one of your 
investments that you intend to hold for long-
term purposes, keep an emergency reserve of 
three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a 
money market account or high-interest savings 
account. Also consider investing some money 
in bonds (see Chapter 8), which pay higher than 
money market yields without the high risk or 
volatility that comes with the stock market.

The erosion of the purchasing power of your investment dollar can, over 
longer time periods, be as bad as or worse than the effect of a major market 
crash. Table 2-3 shows the effective loss in purchasing power of your money 
at various rates of inflation and over differing time periods.

We often see skittish investors keep their money in bonds and money market 
accounts, thinking they are playing it safe. The risk in this strategy is that your 
money won’t grow enough over the years in order for you to accomplish your 
financial goals. In other words, the lower the return that you earn, the more 
you need to save to reach a particular financial goal.
A 40-year-old wanting to accumulate $500,000 by age 65 would need to save 
$722 per month if she earns a 6 percent average annual return, but needs to 
save only $377 per month if she earns 10 percent average return per year. 
Younger investors need to pay the most attention to the risk of generating 
low returns, but so should younger senior citizens. At the age of 65, seniors 
need to recognize that a portion of their assets may not be used for a decade 
or more from the present.
Career risk
 
Your ability to earn money is most likely your single biggest asset, or at least 
one of your biggest assets. Most people achieve what they do in the working 
world through education and hard work. By education, we’re not simply talk-
ing about what one learns in formal schooling. Education is a lifelong process. 
We’ve learned far more about business from our own front-line experiences 
and those of others than we’ve learned in educational settings. We also read 
a lot. (In Part V, we recommend books and other resources that we’ve found 
most useful.)

35
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
If you don’t continually invest in your education, you risk losing your com-
petitive edge. Your skills and perspectives can become dated and obsolete. 
Although that doesn’t mean you should work 80 hours a week and never 
do anything fun, it does mean that part of your “work” time should involve 
upgrading your skills.
The best organizations are those that recognize the need for continual knowl-
edge and invest in their workforce through training and career development. 
Just remember to look at your own career objectives, which may not be the 
same as your company’s.
Analyzing Returns
When you make investments, you have the potential to make money in a vari-
ety of ways. Each type of investment has its own mix of associated risks that 
you take when you part with your investment dollar, and, likewise, offers a 
Inflation ragin’ outta control
You think 6, 8, or 10 percent annual inflation 
rates are bad? How would you like to live in a 
country that experienced that rate of inflation in 
a day?! As we discuss in Chapter 4, too much 
money in circulation chasing after too few 
goods causes high rates of inflation.
A government that runs amok with the nation’s 
currency and money supply usually causes 
excessive rates of inflation — dubbed hyperin-
flation. Over the decades and centuries, hyper-
inflation has wreaked havoc in more than a few 
countries.
What happened in Germany in the late 1910s 
and early 1920s demonstrates how bad hyper-
inflation can get. Consider that during this time 
period, prices increased nearly one billionfold! 
What cost 1 reichsmark (the German currency 
in those days) at the beginning of this mess 
eventually cost nearly 1,000,000,000 reichs-
marks. People had to cart around so much 
currency that at times they needed wheelbar-
rows to haul it! Ultimately, this inflationary 
burden was too much for German society, cre-
ating a social climate that fuelled the rise of the 
Nazi party and Adolf Hitler.
During the 1990s, a number of countries, espe-
cially many that made up the former U.S.S.R. 
and others such as Brazil and Lithuania, got 
themselves into a hyperinflationary mess with 
inflation rates of several hundred percent per 
year. In the mid-1980s, Bolivia’s yearly infla-
tion rate exceeded 10,000 percent. In 2008, 
Zimbabwe’s annual inflation rate was 231 mil-
lion percent, and growing.
Governments often try to slap on price controls 
to prevent runaway inflation (Pierre Trudeau 
did this in Canada in the 1970s, as did Richard 
Nixon in the United States), but the under-
ground economy, known as the black market, 
usually prevails.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
different potential rate of return. In this section, we cover the returns you can 
expect with each of the common investing avenues, but first, we walk you 
through the different components of calculating the total return on an 
investment.
The components of total return
To figure out exactly how much money you’ve made (or lost) on your invest-
ment, you need to calculate the total return. To come up with this figure, you 
need to determine how much money you originally invested and then factor 
in the other components, such as interest, dividends, and appreciation (or 
depreciation).
If you’ve ever had money in a bank account that pays interest, you know that 
the bank pays you a small amount of interest when you allow it to keep your 
money. The bank then turns around and lends your money to some other 
person or organization at a much higher rate of interest. The rate of interest 
is also known as the yield. So if a bank tells you that its savings account pays 
2 percent interest, the bank may also say that the account yields 2 percent. 
Banks usually quote interest rates or yields on an annual basis. Interest that 
you receive is one component of the return you receive on your investment.
If a bank pays monthly interest, for example, the bank also likely quotes a 
compounded effective annual yield. After the first month’s interest is credited 
to your account, that interest starts earning interest as well. So the bank may 
say that the account pays 2 percent, which compounds to an effective annual 
yield of 2.04 percent.
When you lend your money directly to a company — which is what you do 
when you invest in a bond that a corporation issues — you also receive inter-
est. Bonds, as well as stocks (which are shares of ownership in a company), 
fluctuate in value after they’re issued.
When you invest in a company’s stock, you hope that the stock increases 
(appreciates) in value. Of course, a stock can also decline, or depreciate, in 
value. This change in market value is part of your return from a stock or 
bond investment:
Current investment value – Original investment
Original investment
= Appreciation or depreciation
For example, if one year ago you invested $10,000 in a stock (you bought 
1,000 shares at $10 per share), and the investment is now worth $11,000 
(each share is worth $11), your investment’s appreciation is

37
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
$11,000 – $10,000
$10,000
= 10%
Stocks can also pay dividends, which are the company’s sharing of some of its 
profits with you as a stockholder. Some companies, particularly those that are 
small or growing rapidly, choose to reinvest all of their profits back into the 
company. (Of course, some companies don’t turn a profit, so there’s nothing 
to pay out!) You need to factor these dividends into your return as well.
Suppose that in the previous example, in addition to your stock appreciating 
$1,000 to $11,000, it paid you a dividend of $100 ($1 per share). Here’s how 
you calculate your total return:
(Current investment value – Original investment) + Dividends
Original investment
= Total return
Or, to apply it to the example:
($11,000 – $10,000) + $100
$10,000
= 11%
After-tax returns
Although you may be happy that your stock has given you an 11 percent 
return on your invested dollars, remember: Unless you held your investment 
in a tax-sheltered retirement plan or Tax-Free Savings Account, you owe 
taxes on your return. Specifically, the dividends and investment appreciation 
that you realize upon selling are taxed, although often at relatively low rates. 
The tax rates on so-called long-term capital gains and stock dividends are 
lower than the tax rates on other income. In Chapter 3, we discuss the differ-
ent tax rates that affect your investments and explain how to make tax-wise 
investment decisions that fit with your overall personal financial situation 
and goals.
(If you’re talking about savings accounts, money market accounts, or bonds, 
you owe the Canada Revenue Agency taxes on the interest.)
Often, people make investing decisions without considering the tax conse-
quences of their moves. This is a big mistake. What good is making money if 
the government takes away a substantial portion of it?
If you’re in a moderate tax bracket, taxes on your investments probably run 
in the neighbourhood of 30 percent. So if your investment returned 7 percent 
before taxes, you’re left with a return of 4.9 percent after taxes.

38
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Psychological returns
Profits and tax avoidance can powerfully motivate your investment selections. 
However, as with other life decisions, you need to consider more than the 
bottom line. Some people want to have fun with their investments. Of course, 
they don’t want to lose money or sacrifice a lot of potential returns — less 
expensive ways to have fun do exist!
Psychological rewards compel some investors to choose particular invest-
ment vehicles such as individual stocks, real estate, or a small business. 
Why? Because compared with other investments, such as managed mutual 
funds, they see these investments as more tangible and . . . well, more fun.
 
Be honest with yourself about why you choose the investments that you do. 
Allowing your ego to get in the way can be dangerous. Do you invest in indi-
vidual stocks because you really believe that you will do better than the best 
full-time professional money managers? Chances are high that you won’t. (See 
Chapter 6 for the details.) Do you like investing in real estate more because of 
the gratification from driving by and showing off your properties to others 
than because of the investment rewards? Such questions are worth consider-
ing as you contemplate what investments you want to make.
Savings, high-interest, and money 
market account returns
You need to keep your extra cash that awaits investment (or an emergency) 
in a safe place, preferably one that doesn’t get hammered by the sea of 
changes in the financial markets. By default and for convenience, many 
people keep their extra cash in a bank savings account. Banks also offer the 
backing of the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal Crown cor-
poration that protects certain holdings at each bank up to $100,000. (Credit 
unions in some provinces have unlimited deposit guarantees.) However, 
most banks and credit unions pay a low interest rate on their savings 
accounts.
 
A far better place to keep your liquid savings are the growing number of high-
interest savings accounts offered by companies such as President’s Choice 
Financial, ING Direct, and even some mutual fund companies. These accounts 
typically offer rates anywhere from 4 to 40 — yes, 40 — times the rate on 
savings accounts.

39
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Another good choice is to keep your liquid savings in a money market mutual 
fund. These are the safest types of mutual funds around; for all intents and 
purposes, they equal a bank savings account’s safety. However, the best 
money market funds pay higher yields than most bank savings accounts. 
Unlike a bank, money market mutual funds tell you how much they deduct 
for the service of managing your money. See Chapter 8 for more on money 
market funds.
If you don’t need immediate access to your money, consider using Treasury 
bills (T-bills) or guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), which are usually 
issued for terms of anywhere from three months to five years. Your money 
will surely earn more in one of these vehicles than in a bank savings account. 
The drawback to GICs and T-bills is that you incur a penalty (with GICs) or a 
transaction fee (with T-bills) if you withdraw your investment before the term 
expires (see Chapter 7).
Bond returns
When you buy a bond, you lend your money to the issuer of that bond (bor-
rower), which is generally the federal government, a provincial government, 
or a corporation, for a specific period of time. When you buy a bond, you 
expect to earn a higher yield than you can with a money market or savings 
account. You’re taking more risk, after all. Companies can and do go bank-
rupt, in which case you may lose some or all of your investment.
Generally, you can expect to earn a higher yield when you buy bonds that
 
✓ Are issued for a longer term: The bond issuer is tying up your money at 
a fixed rate for a longer period of time.
 
✓ Have lower credit quality: The bond issuer may not be able to repay 
the principal.
Wharton School of Business professor Jeremy Siegel has tracked the perfor-
mance of U.S. bonds and stocks all the way back to 1802. Although you may 
say that what happened in the 19th century has little relevance to the financial 
markets and economy of today, the decades since the Great Depression, which 
most other return data track, are a relatively small slice of time. Figure 2-4 
presents the data, so if you’d like to give more emphasis to the recent 
numbers, you may.

Note that although the rate of inflation has increased since the Great 
Depression, bond returns have not increased over the decades. Long-term 
bonds maintain slightly higher returns in recent years than short-term bonds. 
The bottom line: Bond investors typically earn about 4 to 5 percent per year.
Stock returns
Investors expect — indeed, they demand — a fair return on investment. And 
if one investment doesn’t offer a high enough rate of return, investors can 
choose to move their money into other investments that they believe will 
perform better. Instead of buying a diversified basket of stocks and holding, 
some investors frequently buy and sell, hoping to cash in on the latest hot 
investment. This tactic seldom works in the long run.
 
Unfortunately, some of these investors use a rearview mirror when they pur-
chase their stocks, chasing after investments that have recently performed 
strongly on the assumption (and the hope) that those investments will con-
tinue to earn strong returns. But chasing after the strongest performing invest-
ments can be dangerous if you catch the stock at its peak, ready to begin a 
downward spiral. You may have heard that the goal of investing is to buy low 
and sell high. Chasing high-flying investments can lead you to buy high, with 
the prospect of having to sell low if the stock runs out of steam. Even though 
stocks as a whole have proved to be a good long-term investment, picking 
individual stocks is a risky endeavour. See Chapters 5 and 6 for advice on 
making sound stock investment decisions.

41
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
 
A tremendous amount of data exists regarding stock market returns. In fact, in 
the U.S. markets, data going back more than two centuries documents the fact 
that stocks have been a terrific long-term investment. The long-term returns 
from stocks that investors have enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, have been 
remarkably constant from one generation to the next.
Going all the way back to 1802, the U.S. stock market has produced an annual 
return of 8.3 percent, while inflation has grown at 1.4 percent per year. Thus, 
after subtracting for inflation, stocks have appreciated about 6.9 percent 
faster annually than the rate of inflation. The U.S. stock market returns have 
consistently and substantially beaten the rate of inflation over the years (see 
Figure 2-5).

Stocks don’t exist only in Canada and the United States, of course (see Figure 2-6).
More than a few investors seem to forget this fact, especially during periods 
when North American stock markets sizzle like they did during the late 1990s. 
As we discuss in the earlier section “Diversify for a gentler ride,” one advan-
tage of buying and holding overseas stocks is that they don’t always fall when 
Canadian and U.S. stocks drop. In other words, overseas stocks help diversify 
your portfolio.

In addition to enabling investors to diversify, investing overseas has proved 
to be profitable. The investment banking firm Morgan Stanley tracks the per-
formance of stocks in both economically established countries and so-called 
emerging economies. As the name suggests, countries with emerging econo-
mies (for example, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, 
and Taiwan) are “behind” economically but show high rates of growth and 
progress. Faster-growing countries tend to have fast-rising and more volatile 
stock prices.
Real estate returns
 
Like investing in the stock market, real estate has proved to be lucrative over 
the years. Whenever there’s a big real estate downturn, folks question this his-
toric fact (see Chapter 11 for more details). However, just as stock prices have 
down periods, so too do real estate markets.
The fact that real estate offers solid long-term returns makes sense because 
ultimately, growth in the economy, in jobs, and in population fuels the 
demand for real estate.

 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Consider what has happened to the Canadian population over the past two 
centuries. In 1867 a mere 3.5 million people lived within our borders. In 1900 
that figure grew to over 5 million, and by 1929 it had doubled to over 10 mil-
lion. Today it’s over 33 million. All these people need a place to live, and as 
long as jobs exist, the income from them largely fuels the demand for hous-
ing. Businesses and people have an understandable tendency to cluster in 
major cities and suburban towns. Although some people commute, most 
people and businesses locate near airports and major highways. Thus, real 
estate prices in and near major metropolises and suburbs generally appreci-
ate the most. Consider the areas of the world that have the most expensive 
real estate prices: London, Paris, Tokyo, Moscow, Singapore, New York, and 
Hong Kong. Here at home, our most expensive cities are Vancouver and 
Toronto. What these areas have in common are lots of businesses and people 
and limited land.
Contrast these areas with the many rural parts of the country where the 
price of real estate is relatively low because of the abundant supply of build-
able land and the relatively lower demand for housing.
Small-business returns
As we discuss in Part IV of this book, you have several choices for tapping 
into the exciting potential of the small-business world. If you have the drive 
and determination, you can start your own small business. Or perhaps you 
have what it takes to buy an existing small business. If you obtain the nec-
essary capital and skills to assess opportunities and risk, you can invest in 
someone else’s small business.
What potential returns can you get from small business? Small-business 
owners like us who do something they really enjoy will tell you that the non-
financial returns can be huge! The financial rewards can be handsome as well.
Every year, Forbes magazine publishes a list of the world’s wealthiest individuals. 
Perusing this list shows that most of these people built their wealth through 
a significant ownership stake from starting a small business that became 
large. These individuals achieved extraordinarily high effective returns (often 
in excess of hundreds of percent per year) on the amounts they invested to 
get their companies off the ground.
You may also achieve potentially high returns from buying and improving an 
existing small business. As we discuss in Part IV, such small-business invest-
ment returns may be a good deal lower than the returns you may gain from 
starting a business from scratch.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Unlike the stock market, where plenty of historic rate-of-return data exists, 
data on the success, or lack thereof, that investors have had with investing 
in small, private companies is harder to come by. Smart venture capitalist 
firms operate a fun and lucrative business: They identify and invest money in 
smaller start-up companies that they hope will grow rapidly and eventually 
go public. Venture capitalists allow outsiders to invest with them via limited 
partnerships. To gain entry, you generally need $1 million to invest. (We 
never said this was an equal-opportunity investment club!)
Are smaller-company stock returns higher?
Stocks are generally classified by the size of the 
company. Small company stocks aren’t stocks 
that physically small companies issue — they’re 
simply stocks issued by companies that haven’t 
reached the size of corporate behemoths like 
the big banks, Bombardier, and Barrick, or U.S. 
giants like IBM, AT&T, and Coca-Cola. The 
S&P/TSX SmallCap Index tracks the smallest 
companies that qualify for the TSX compound 
index, while the S&P/TSX Venture Composite 
Index measures the performance of the larger 
and more actively traded companies listed on 
the TSX Venture Exchange, where smaller or 
more speculative companies are listed. (In the 
United States, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index 
tracks the performance of 500 large-company 
stocks in the United States. The Russell 2000 
index tracks the performance of 2,000 smaller-
company U.S. stocks.
Small-company stocks have outperformed 
larger-company stocks during the past seven 
decades. Historically, small-company stocks 
have produced slightly higher compounded 
annual returns (1.9 percent) than large-company 
stocks. However, nearly all of this extra perfor-
mance occurred in just one high-performance 
time period, from the mid-1970s to the early 
1980s. If you eliminate this time period from the 
data, small-company stocks have had virtually 
identical returns to those of larger-company 
stocks.
Also, be aware that small-company stocks can 
get hammered in down markets. For example, 
during the Great Depression, small-company 
stocks plunged more than 85 percent between 
1929 and 1932, while the S&P 500 fell 64 percent. 
In 1937, small-company stocks plummeted 58 
percent; the S&P 500 fell 35 percent. And in 1969 
to 1970, small-company stocks fell 38 percent, 
while the S&P 500 fell just 5 percent. (In the bear 
market of the early 2000s, small-company stocks 
fell less than large-company stocks). During 
the steep market drop in the fall of 2008, small-
company stocks lost 53 percent while large-
company stocks lost just over 42 percent.

45
 Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Venture capitalists, also known as general partners, typically skim off 20 per-
cent of the profits and also charge limited partnership investors a hefty 2 to 
3 percent annual fee on the amount that they’ve invested. The return that’s 
left over for the limited partnership investors isn’t stupendous. According to 
Venture Economics, a U.S. firm that tracks limited partners’ returns, venture 
funds have averaged comparable annual returns to what stock market inves-
tors have earned on average over this same period. The general partners that 
run venture capital funds make more than the limited partners do.
You can attempt to do what the general partners do in venture capital firms 
and invest directly in small, private companies. You’re quite likely to be 
investing in much smaller and simpler companies. Earning venture capital-
ist returns isn’t easy to do. If you think that you’re up to the challenge, we 
explain the best ways to invest in small business in Chapter 15.
Considering Your Goals
How much do you need or want to earn? That may seem like an extraordi-
narily stupid question for us to ask you! Who doesn’t want to earn a high 
return? However, although investing in stocks, real estate, or small business 
can produce high long-term returns, you invest in these vehicles with greater 
risk, especially over the short term.
Some people can’t stomach the risk. Others are at a time in their lives when 
they can’t afford to take great risk. If you’re near or in retirement, your 
portfolio and nerves may not be able to wait a decade for your riskier invest-
ments to recover after a major stumble. Perhaps you have sufficient assets to 
accomplish your financial goals and are concerned with preserving what you 
do have, rather than risking it to grow more wealth.
If you work for a living, odds are that you need and want to make your invest-
ments grow at a healthy clip. If your investments grow slowly, you may fall 
short of your goals of owning a home or retiring or changing careers.

efore you make any great, wealth-building investments, we recommend 
that you get your financial house in order. The truth is that under-
standing and implementing some simple personal financial management 
concepts will pay off big for you in the decades ahead.
You want to know how to earn healthy returns on your investments without 
getting clobbered, right? Who doesn’t? Although you generally must accept 
greater risk to have the potential for earning higher returns (see Chapter 2), 
in this chapter we tell you about some free lunches in the world of investing. 
You have a right to be skeptical about free lunches — but this chapter points 
out some easy-to-tap opportunities for managing your money you likely have 
overlooked.
Establishing an Emergency Reserve
You never know what life will bring, so it makes good financial sense to have 
a readily accessible reserve of cash to meet unexpected expenses. If you 
have a sister who works on Bay Street as an investment banker or have 

48
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
wealthy and understanding parents, you may be able to use them as your 
emergency reserve. (Although you should ask them how they feel about that 
before you count on receiving funding from them!) If not, the ball’s in your 
court to establish a reserve.
 
Make sure you have quick access to at least three months’ to as much as 
six months’ worth of living expenses. Keep this emergency money in a 
high-interest savings account or a high-yielding money market fund (see 
Chapter 8). You may also be able to borrow against the equity you’ve built 
up in your home should you find yourself in a bind, but this option is much 
less desirable.
 
If you don’t have a financial safety net, you may be forced into selling an 
investment that you’ve worked hard for. Consider the case of Warren, who 
owned his home as well as an investment property. He felt, and appeared to 
be, financially successful. But then Warren lost his job, accumulated sizable 
medical expenses, and had to sell his investment property to come up with 
the cash to tide himself over. Warren didn’t have enough equity in his home to 
borrow. He didn’t have other sources — a wealthy relative, for example — 
to borrow from either, so he was stuck selling his investment property.
Selling some investments, such as real estate, costs big money (transaction 
costs, taxes, and so on). Warren wasn’t able to purchase another investment 
property and missed out on the large appreciation the property earned over 
the subsequent two decades. Between the costs of selling and taxes, getting 
rid of the investment property cost Warren about 15 percent of its sales 
price. Ouch!
Introducing a New Investment Option: 
The Tax-Free Savings Account
A good place to stash your emergency cash is in a Tax-Free Savings Account 
(TFSA). A TFSA is also a good choice if you are already contributing the 
maximum allowed to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and 
Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP), and still have savings left over.
You can put up to a maximum of $5,000 a year into a TFSA. The $5,000 limit 
on annual contributions will be indexed to inflation — in $500 increments — 
starting in 2010. If you don’t contribute the maximum allowed in any one 
year, you can carry forward that unused amount and contribute it in the 
future without any limitations.

49
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Unlike an RRSP, you don’t earn a tax deduction for your contribution. 
However, any interest you earn on the money after it’s inside this special 
account is tax-free. You can also invest money inside your TFSA into most of 
the same investments that qualify for RRSPs. This includes most mutual 
funds, as well as bonds and individual stocks.
No tax is payable when you take money out of a TFSA. In addition, any 
amount you withdraw is added back to your contribution room. This means 
you can choose to recontribute that amount in future years.
Evaluating Your Debts
Yes, paying down debts is boring, but it makes your investment decisions 
less difficult. Rather than spending so much of your time investigating 
specific investments, paying off your debts (if you have them) may be 
Should you invest emergency money in stocks?
As interest rates drifted lower during the 1990s, 
keeping emergency money in money market 
accounts became less and less rewarding. 
When interest rates were 8 or 10 percent, fewer 
people questioned the wisdom of an emergency 
reserve. However, in the late 1990s, with money 
market interest rates of 5 percent or less and 
stock market returns of 20 percent per year, 
more investors balked at keeping a low-interest 
stash of cash.
We began reading articles that suggested you 
simply keep your emergency reserve in stocks. 
After all, you can easily sell stocks (especially 
those of larger companies) any day the finan-
cial markets are open. Why not treat yourself to 
the 20 percent annual returns that stock market 
investors enjoyed during the 1990s rather than 
earning a paltry 5 percent?
As we discuss in Chapter 2, stocks historically 
have returned about 9 to 10 percent per year. 
But in some years — in fact, about one-third of 
the time — stocks decline in value, sometimes 
substantially.
Stocks can drop and have dropped 20, 30, or 50 
percent or more over relatively short periods of 
time. Witness what happened to stock prices in 
2008. Suppose that such a drop coincides with 
an emergency — such as the loss of your job, 
major medical bills, and so on. Your situation 
may force you to sell at a loss, perhaps a 
substantial one.
Another reason not to keep emergency 
money in stocks is that if your stocks appreciate 
and you need to sell some of them for 
emergency cash, you get stuck paying taxes on 
your gains.
We suggest that you invest your emergency 
money in stocks (ideally through well-
diversified mutual funds) only if you have a rela-
tive or some other resource to tap for money in 
an emergency. Having a backup resource for 
money minimizes your need to sell your stock 
holdings on short notice. As we discuss in 
Chapter 5, stocks are intended to be a longer-
term investment, not an investment that you 
expect (or need) to sell in the near future.

50
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
your best high-return, low-risk investment. Consider the interest rate 
you pay and your investing alternatives to determine which debts you 
should pay off.
Conquering consumer debt
 
Many folks have credit card or other consumer debt, such as auto loans, that 
costs 8, 10, 12, or as much as 18-plus percent per year in interest (some credit 
cards whack you with interest rates exceeding 20 percent if you make a late 
payment). Reducing and eventually eliminating this debt with your savings is 
like putting your money in an investment with a guaranteed tax-free return 
equal to the rate that you pay on your debt.
For example, if you have outstanding credit card debt at 15 percent interest, 
paying off that debt is the same as putting your money to work in an invest-
ment with a guaranteed 15 percent tax-free annual return. Because the 
interest on consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible, you would need to earn more 
than 15 percent investing your money elsewhere in order to net 15 percent 
after paying taxes. Earning such high investing returns is highly unlikely, and 
in order to earn those returns, you’d be forced to take great risk.
Consumer debt is hazardous to your long-term financial health (not to 
mention the damage it can do to your credit rating and future ability to 
borrow for a home or other wise investments) because it encourages you to 
borrow against your future earnings. Consider what happened to many 
Americans in the 2000s who borrowed most if not the full value of their home 
in the form of a mortgage. It was common for these homebuyers — who in 
normal times wouldn’t have been able to get a mortgage — to then turn 
around and use the short-term increase in the value of their property to 
borrow even more money thanks to the aggressiveness of lenders to do busi-
ness with just about anybody. When housing prices fell and the cost of the 
interest on their mortgages rose, some were unable to pay the interest on 
their homes, much less their other debts, and lost most if not all they had.
We often hear people say such things as “I can’t afford to buy most new 
cars for cash — look at how expensive they are!” That’s true, new cars are 
expensive, so set your sights lower and buy a good used car that you can 
afford. You can then invest the money that you’d otherwise spend on your 
auto loan.
Borrowing via credit cards, auto loans, and the like is also one of the most 
expensive ways to borrow. Banks and other lenders charge higher interest 
rates for consumer debt than for debt for investments, such as real estate 
and business. The reason: Consumer loans are the riskiest type of loan 
for a lender.

51
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
 
However, using consumer debt may make sense if you’re financing a 
business. If you haven’t built up extra equity in your home, personal loans 
(through a credit card or auto loan) may actually be your lowest-cost 
source of small-business financing. (See Chapter 14 for more details.)
Mitigating your mortgage
Paying off your mortgage quicker is an “investment” for your spare cash 
that may make sense for your financial situation. However, the wisdom of 
making this financial move isn’t as clear as is paying off high-interest con-
sumer debt, because mortgage interest rates are generally lower. When used 
properly, debt can help you accomplish your goals — such as buying a home 
or starting a business — and make you money in the long run. Borrowing to 
buy a home also generally makes sense. Over the long term, homes usually 
appreciate in value.
If your financial situation has changed or improved since you first needed 
to borrow mortgage money, you need to reconsider how much mortgage 
debt you need or want. Even if your income hasn’t escalated or you haven’t 
inherited vast wealth, your frugality may allow you to pay down some of your 
debt sooner than the lender requires. Whether paying down your debt 
sooner makes sense for you depends on a number of factors, including your 
other investment options and goals.
 
When evaluating whether to pay down your mortgage faster, you need to 
compare your mortgage interest rate versus your investments’ rates of return 
(which we define in Chapter 2). Suppose that you have a fixed-rate mortgage 
with an interest rate of 7 percent. If you decide to make investments instead of 
paying down your mortgage more quickly, your investments need to produce 
an average annual rate of return, after taxes, of about 7 percent to come out 
ahead financially.
Besides the most common reason of lacking the money to do so, other good 
reasons not to pay off your mortgage any quicker than necessary include the 
following:
 
✓ You instead contribute to your RRSP or other retirement plans, 
especially if your employer offers matching money. Paying off your 
mortgage faster has no tax benefit. By contrast, putting additional 
money into a retirement plan can immediately reduce your income tax 
burden. The more years you have until retirement, the greater the 
benefit you receive if you invest in your retirement plans. Thanks to 
the compounding of your retirement plan investments without the 
drain of taxes, you can actually earn a lower rate of return on your 
investments than you pay on your mortgage and still come out ahead. 
(We discuss RRSPs in detail in the “Funding Your RRSP” section, later 
in this chapter.)

52
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
✓ You’re willing to invest in growth-oriented, volatile investments, 
such as stocks and real estate. For you to have a reasonable chance of 
earning more on your investments than it costs you to borrow on your 
mortgage, you must be aggressive with your investments. As we discuss 
in Chapter 2, stocks and real estate have produced annual average rates 
of return of about 8 to 10 percent. You can earn even more with your 
own small business or by investing in others’ businesses. Paying down 
a mortgage ties up more of your capital, reducing your ability to make 
other attractive investments. To more aggressive investors, paying 
off the house seems downright boring — the financial equivalent of 
watching paint dry.
 
 Remember that you have no guarantee of earning high returns from 
growth-type investments, which can easily drop 20 percent or more in 
value over a year or two. The Toronto market lost more than 50 percent 
of its value between the summer of 2008 and March of 2009.
 
✓ Paying down the mortgage depletes your emergency reserves. 
Psychologically, some people feel uncomfortable paying off debt more 
quickly if it diminishes their savings and investments. You probably 
don’t want to pay down your debt if doing so depletes your financial 
safety cushion. Make sure that you have access — through a money 
market fund or other source (a family member, for example) — to at 
least three months’ living expenses (as we explain in the earlier section 
“Establishing an Emergency Reserve”).
Finally, don’t be tripped up by the misconception that somehow a real estate 
market downturn, such as many areas experienced in the mid- to late 2000s, 
will harm you more if you pay down your mortgage. Your home is worth what 
it’s worth — its value has nothing to do with your debt load. Unless you’re 
willing to walk away from your home and send the keys to the bank (also 
known as default), you suffer the full effect of a price decline, regardless of 
your mortgage size, if real estate prices collapse.
Establishing Your Financial Goals
You may want to invest money for different purposes simultaneously. For 
example, when you’re in your 20s, you may want to put some money away 
toward retirement, but also save a stash so you could hit the eject button 
from your job. Perhaps you know that one day you want to pursue an 
entrepreneurial path, and realize that in the early years of starting your own 
business, you can’t count on an income as stable or as large as what you 
get from your job.

53
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
In this case, you should invest your two “pots” of money — one for retire-
ment, the other for your small-business cushion — quite differently. As 
we discuss in the section “Choosing the Right Investment Mix,” later in this 
chapter, you can afford to take more risk with the money you plan on using 
longer term. As a result, you could invest the bulk of your retirement nest 
egg in stock mutual funds.
With the money you save for the start-up of your small business, consider 
taking an entirely different track. None of this money should go into risky 
stocks — what if the market plummets just as you’re ready to leave the 
security of your full-time job? Keep this money safely invested in a high-
interest savings account or a money market fund that pays a healthy rate 
of interest but doesn’t put your savings — your principal — at risk.
Tracking your savings rate
 
To accomplish your financial and some personal goals, you need to save 
money, and you need to know your savings rate. Your savings rate is the 
percentage of your past year’s income that you saved and didn’t spend. You 
may already know that your rate of savings is low, non-existent, or negative, 
and that you need to save more.
Part of being a smart investor involves figuring out how much you need to 
save to reach your goals. Not knowing what you want to do a decade or more 
from now is perfectly normal — after all, your goals and needs evolve over 
the years. But that doesn’t mean that you should just throw your hands in 
the air and not make an effort to see where you stand today and think about 
where you want to be in the future.
An important benefit of knowing your savings rate is that you’ll know better 
how much risk you need to take to accomplish your goals. Seeing how much 
you need to save to achieve your dreams may encourage you to take more 
risk with your investments.
If you consistently save about 10 percent of your income during your working 
years, you’re probably saving enough to meet your goals unless you want 
to retire at a relatively young age. On average, most people need about 
75 percent of their pre-retirement income throughout their retirement to 
maintain their standard of living.
If you’re one of the many people who don’t save enough, you need to do 
some homework. To save more, you need to reduce your spending, increase 
your income, or both.

54
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
 
For most people, reducing spending is the more feasible way to save. But 
where do you begin? First, figure out where your money goes. You may have 
some general idea, but you need to have facts. Get out your chequebook 
register, examine your online bill-paying records, and review your credit card 
bills and any other documentation you have of your spending history. Tally 
up how much you spend on dining out, operating your car(s), paying your 
taxes, and everything else. After you have this information, you can begin to 
prioritize and make the necessary trade-offs to reduce your spending and 
increase your savings rate. Earning more income may help boost your savings 
rate as well. Perhaps you can get a higher-paying job or increase the number 
of hours you work. But if you already work a lot, reining in your spending is 
usually better for your emotional and economic well-being.
If you don’t know how to evaluate and reduce your spending or haven’t 
thought about your retirement goals, looked into what you can expect from 
the Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan, or calculated how much 
you should save for retirement, now’s the time to do it. Pick up the latest 
edition of our book Personal Finance For Canadians For Dummies (published 
by Wiley), and find out all the necessary details for retirement planning and 
much more.
Determining your investment tastes
Many good investing choices exist — you can invest in real estate, the 
stock market, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or your own business 
or someone else’s, or you can pay down mortgage debt more quickly. 
What makes sense for you depends on your goals as well as your personal 
preferences. If you detest risk-taking and volatile investments, paying down 
your mortgage, as recommended earlier in this chapter, may make better 
sense than investing in the stock market.
How would you deal with an investment that plunges 20 percent, 40 percent, 
or more in a few years or less? Some aggressive investments can fall fast. 
Sometimes stocks in general collapse, as they did in 2008, with some markets 
falling more than 40 percent. (See Chapter 2 for examples.) You shouldn’t 
invest in the stock market, real estate, or a small business if such a drop is 
likely to cause you to sell low or make you a miserable wreck. If you haven’t 
tried riskier investments yet, you may want to experiment a bit to see how 
you feel with your money invested in them.
 
A simple way to “mask” the risk of volatile investments is to diversify your 
portfolio — that is, to put your money into different investments. Not 
watching prices too closely helps, too — that’s one of the reasons real estate 
investors are less likely to bail out when the market declines. Stock market 
investors, unfortunately from our perspective, can get daily and even 
minute-by-minute price updates. Add that fact to the quick phone call or 
click of your computer mouse that it takes to dump a stock in a flash, and you 
have all the ingredients for short-sighted investing — and financial disaster.

Funding Your RRSP
Saving money for the future is difficult for most people. Don’t make a 
tough job impossible by forsaking the terrific tax benefits that come from 
contri-buting money to — and investing inside — an RRSP.
Investing as couples
You’ve probably learned over the years how 
challenging it is just for you to navigate the 
investment maze and make sound investing 
decisions. When you have someone else to 
consider, dealing with these issues becomes 
doubly hard, given the typically different money 
personalities and emotions that come into play.
In most couples, usually one person takes pri-
mary responsibility for managing the household 
finances, including investments. As with most 
marital issues, the couples that do the best job 
with their investments are those who communi-
cate well, plan ahead, and compromise.
Here are a couple of examples to illustrate our 
point. Martha and Alex scheduled meetings with 
each other every three to six months to discuss 
financial issues. With investments, Martha 
came prepared with a list of ideas, and Alex 
would listen and explain what he liked or 
disliked about each option. Alex would tend 
toward more aggressive, growth-oriented 
investments, whereas Martha preferred con-
servative, less volatile investments. Inevitably, 
they would compromise and develop a diversi-
fied portfolio that was moderately aggressive. 
Martha and Alex worked as a team, discussed 
options, compromised, and made decisions they 
were both comfortable with. Ideas that made 
one of them very uncomfortable were nixed.
Henry and Melissa didn’t do so well. The only 
times they managed to discuss investments 
were in heated arguments. Melissa often criti-
cized what Henry was doing with their money. 
Henry got defensive and counter-criticized 
Melissa for other issues. Much of their money 
lay dormant in a low-interest bank account, and 
they did little long-term planning and decision 
making. Melissa and Henry saw each other as 
adversaries, argued and criticized rather than 
discussed, and were plagued with inaction 
because they couldn’t agree and compromise. 
They needed a motivation to change their 
behaviour toward each other, and they needed 
some counselling (or a few advice guides for 
couples) to make progress with investing their 
money.
Aren’t your long-term financial health and mar-
ital harmony important? Don’t allow your prob-
lems to fester!
Often, one of the most valuable (and difficult) 
things couples stuck in unproductive patterns 
of behaviour can do to help themselves is get 
the issue out on the table. When it comes to 
money, often the biggest step for couples is to 
make an appointment with an adviser to discuss 
their financial management. Once they do, it’s 
usually relatively easy to get them to explain 
their different points of view, which then 
enables the adviser to offer some compromises. 
Remember: You can’t change something if you 
don’t first acknowledge it.

Gaining tax benefits
Registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) should be called tax-reduction 
plans — if they were, people might be more jazzed about contributing to 
them. Contributions to these plans are tax-deductible. Suppose that you pay 
about 35 percent between federal and provincial income taxes on your last 
dollars of income. (See the section “Determining your tax bracket,” later in 
this chapter.) With an RRSP, you can save yourself about $350 in taxes for 
every $1,000 that you contribute in the year that you make your contribution.
After your money is in an RRSP, any interest, dividends, and appreciation 
grow inside the account without taxation. You defer taxes on all the accumu-
lating gains and profits until you withdraw your money down the road. In the 
meantime, more of your money works for you over a long period of time.
Understanding RRSPs
You can contribute to an RRSP as long as you have what the government 
dubs earned income. For most people, their earned income is their salary, 
along with any bonuses or commissions. If you’re self-employed or an active 
partner in a business, it includes any net income from your business. Earned 
income also includes any taxable alimony and maintenance payments as well 
as any research grants, royalties, and net rental income.
As long as you have earned income in a year, you can contribute 18 percent 
of that amount to your RRSP in the following year. However, two restrictions 
may cap the total amount you can contribute for that year:
 
✓ There is a maximum amount you’ll be able to contribute for any one 
year. The limit is scheduled to rise to $21,000 for 2009, and $22,000 for 
2010. After 2010, the maximum will be indexed, meaning it will increase 
at the rate of inflation.
 
✓ The maximum amount you are allowed to contribute may be further 
reduced if you belong to a company pension plan. The government 
calculates the value of contributions made to your employer-sponsored 
pension plan, called a pension adjustment (PA), and deducts this from 
whichever is less — the absolute dollar maximum allowed for the year 
or 18 percent of your earned income — to arrive at your allowable 
contribution.
 
Your pension adjustment for a given year should appear in that year’s T4 slip 
that you receive from your employer. (It should also be stated on the Notice 
of Assessment you receive in the spring after you file your tax return for the 
previous year.)

57
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Note that when we talk about the maximum contribution per year, we’re 
referring to how much you can contribute for each year. There’s no limit on 
how much you can contribute in any one given year. All that’s required is 
that you’ve built up that amount of allowable contributions. Say that based 
on your last year’s salary, your new allowable contribution is $5,000, but you 
only contribute $2,000. Next year, your new allowable contribution is another 
$5,000, based on your income this year. This means that the amount you can 
put into your RRSP will then be the sum of $5,000 and the $3,000 of allowable 
contribution you didn’t use this year, for a total of $8,000.
 
One nice feature of RRSPs is they’re not a case of “Use it or lose it.” If you 
don’t put in the full amount you’re allowed to in any given year, you can carry 
forward that amount — your RRSP deduction limit — and use it in the future. 
Think of it as having an ongoing allowable contribution account. Any time you 
have earned income, the next year you can add to your allowable contribution 
account the difference between the amount that year’s earned income gave 
you the right to contribute and what you actually put into your RRSP.
Delaying increases your pain
 
The common mistake that investors make is neglecting to take advantage 
of retirement plans because of their enthusiasm to spend or invest in 
“non-retirement” plans. Not investing inside tax-sheltered retirement plans 
can cost you hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars per year in lost tax 
savings. Add that loss up over the many years that you work and save, and 
not taking advantage of these tax reduction accounts can easily cost you tens 
of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long term. Ouch!
To take advantage of retirement savings plans and the tax savings that 
accompany them, you must first spend less than you earn. Only after you 
spend less than you earn can you afford to contribute to these retirement 
savings plans (unless you already happen to have a stash of cash from 
previous savings or inheritance).
 
The sooner you start to save, the less painful it is each year to save enough to 
reach your goals because your contributions have more years to compound.
Each decade you delay saving approximately doubles the percentage of your 
earnings that you need to save to meet your goals. For example, if saving 5 
percent per year in your early 20s gets you to your retirement goal, waiting 
until your 30s to start may mean socking away 10 percent to reach that same 
goal; waiting until your 40s, 20 percent. Beyond that, the numbers get truly 
daunting.

58
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
If you enjoy spending money and living for today, you should be more 
motivated to start saving sooner. The longer you wait to save, the more you 
ultimately need to save and, therefore, the less you can spend today!
Investing for University
From paying for diapers to having to buy a heck of a lot more groceries when 
your kids become teenagers, having children is a costly affair. But it can feel 
downright punitive when you start thinking about what it will cost to get 
them a post-secondary education.
That’s not exactly welcome news for those already trying to pay off their 
mortgage and save for retirement. But one of the best approaches is often to 
simply pay attention to your first two goals and ignore the third. If you work 
hard and knock down your mortgage, you’ll have a good chance of being able 
to reduce or even eliminate your mortgage payments by the time the little 
ones are ready to go to university. If you’ve knocked a good deal off of your 
mortgage, you’ll also be in the position to borrow against the equity you’ve 
built up in your home to pay for educational expenses.
 
By working hard to grow your RRSP, hopefully you’ll accumulate a good-sized 
sum that has built up some compounding steam. If you’re accustomed to 
“paying yourself first” — regularly diverting a portion of your income to your 
RRSP — you can turn your financial sights away from your old age and toward 
your children’s educational bills while they’re at school, and  resume your 
RRSP contributions after they graduate.
Choosing RRSP and other tax-deferred investments
When you establish an RRSP, RESP, or TFSA, 
you may not realize that you’re simply putting 
your money into a shell or shield that keeps 
the government from taxing your investment 
earnings each year. You still must choose 
what investments you want to hold inside your 
retirement plan shell.
You may invest money inside your tax-deferred 
plans in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. 
Mutual funds (offered in most employer-based 
plans), which we cover in detail in Chapter 8, 
are an ideal choice because they offer diversi-
fication and professional management. After 
you decide which financial institution you want 
to invest through, simply obtain and complete 
the appropriate paperwork for establishing the 
specific type of account you want.

59
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
We understand the feeling some have that education is so important they 
don’t feel comfortable unless they’re putting away some dollars specifically 
earmarked for that purpose. Others may be in the enviable position of being 
able to set aside savings for future educational costs while also taking care of 
their mortgage and building up their RRSP. If you want to start an education 
savings program, you have two basic ways to do it, each with some distinct 
benefits and drawbacks you need to consider. The approach that works best 
for you will be determined by your family circumstances, your outlook, and 
your sense of where your children are heading.
Looking at Registered Education 
Savings Plans
Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) sound similar to Registered 
Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), and they are, with a few important 
differences.
RESPs are a way to set money aside and defer tax on the earnings on that 
money. Although you don’t get a tax deduction for your contributions — as 
you do with an RRSP — you’re not taxed on any gains inside the plan. Similar 
to an RRSP, the money is treated as income and taxed accordingly only 
when it’s withdrawn. However, as long as it’s used to pay for your child’s 
education, the proceeds of the contributions are treated as if they are your 
child’s income. In most cases, because your child will have little or no other 
income, the funds will be able to come out of the RESP tax-free.
You can set up an RESP for each of your children, with a lifetime maximum 
contribution ceiling of $50,000. When RESPs were first introduced, there was 
also an annual limit on how much you could contribute, but that has been 
eliminated.
What makes RESPs financially friendly is that the government tops up your 
contributions. Under the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG), the federal 
government will put in another 20 percent of any contribution you make, to 
a maximum of $500 a year. The grant is available every year the beneficiary 
of the RESP is under the age of 18, up to a maximum of $7,200. (The grant 
amounts aren’t included when calculating your contribution limits.)
 
If you don’t make the most use of the CESG in any one year by contributing 
$2,500 and receiving the maximum annual grant of $500, don’t worry. If you 
put in less in any one year, you can earn the untapped grant in future years. 
However, in any one single year, the CESG grant per beneficiary is limited to 
the lesser of $1,000 or 20 percent of the unused CESG room.

60
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Like RRSPs, you can invest money inside an RESP in a wide choice of invest-
ments, including the many types of mutual funds and even individual stocks. 
(Be sure to opt for a self-directed RESP, not one of the group plans that have 
higher fees and more restrictions.)
How to pay for university or college
If you keep stashing away money in an RRSP, 
it’s reasonable for you to wonder how you’ll 
actually pay for your child’s education expenses 
when the momentous occasion arises. In most 
cases, even if you have some liquid assets that 
can be directed to your child’s university or col-
lege bill, you will, in all likelihood, need to borrow 
some money. Only the affluent can truly afford to 
pay for university or college with cash.
One good source of money is your home’s 
equity. You can borrow against your home at a 
relatively low interest rate. Another place to 
look is the Canada Student Loans Program, 
which the federal government runs in conjunc-
tion with the various provinces. (Quebec and 
the Northwest Territories run their programs 
independently from Ottawa.) To apply, contact 
your provincial ministry of education. While 
your child is at school, the federal government 
pays the interest, but your child will have to 
start repaying the loan six months after he or 
she graduates.
In addition to loans, a number of grant programs 
are available through schools and the govern-
ment, as well as through independent sources. 
A good starting point is your child’s guidance 
counselling office. Most schools have lists of 
local government and private bursaries, grants 
and awards, and scholarships. You should also 
consider your family’s various employers. A 
surprising number of companies have student 
grants available for their employees or children 
of employees. Contact the university or college 
your child is considering to see what other 
sources of funding are available. You can find 
easy links to their financial resources page by 
visiting www.canadian-universities.
net/index.html and clicking on Financial 
Aid & Scholarships. You can then choose a 
province, and you’ll get a page listing links to 
the financial aid page of each school.
Also, contact the Canada Millennium 
Scholarships Foundation. The federal gov-
ernment plans to distribute 100,000 scholar-
ships to low- and middle-income students. 
The scholarships will average $3,000 a year, 
and may be awarded for four years. You can 
find out more at www.millennium
scholarships.ca.
Other lists of funding sources are available 
online. Visit the sites of the universities or 
colleges your child is considering attending. 
You can find links to all the provincial and 
territorial student assistance offices at www.
canlearn.ca. Another good source for 
information on grants and scholarships is www.
scholarshipscanada.com. Your child 
can also work and save money for university 
during high school. Besides giving your gangly 
teen a stake in his or her own future, this train-
ing encourages sound personal financial man-
agement down the road.

61
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
 
If your child does not pursue a further education that allows him or her to use 
the money inside the plan, you can take out the original contributions without 
any penalty. However, you’ll have to return any grants you’ve received under 
the CESG. In addition, the money you’ve made on any grants as well as on 
your own contributions may be taxable. 
If the beneficiary is not a post-secondary student by age 21 and the plan has 
been running for at least ten years, you can transfer up to $50,000 of the 
plan’s profits to your own or your spouse’s RRSP. However, you must have 
sufficient unused RRSP deduction limit available. (The result is that 
the RRSP deduction you receive will offset any taxes including the RESP’s 
earnings in your income). Any of the plan’s profits that don’t get sheltered in 
this way are taxed at your full marginal tax rate. In addition, you pay an extra 
20 percent penalty. On top of your tax bill, that could mean giving up as 
much as 65 percent of the profits. Ouch!
Allocating university investments
 
If you keep up to 80 percent of your university investment money in stocks 
(diversified worldwide) with the remainder in bonds when your child is 
young, you can maximize the money’s growth potential without taking 
extraordinary risk. As your child makes his way through the later years of 
elementary school, you need to begin to make the mix more conservative — 
scale back the stock percentage to 50 or 60 percent. Finally, in the years just 
before he enters college, whittle the stock portion down to no more than 20 
percent or so.
Diversified mutual funds (which invest in stocks in Canada and internationally) 
and bonds are ideal vehicles to use when you invest for college. Be sure 
to choose funds that fit your tax situation if you invest your funds in non-
retirement plans. See Chapter 8 for more information.
Taming Your Taxes
When you invest outside of tax-sheltered retirement plans and accounts, the 
profits and distributions on your money are subject to taxation. So the type 
of non-sheltered plan investments that makes sense for you depends (at least 
partly) on your tax situation.
If you have money to invest, or if you’re considering selling current invest-
ments you hold, taxes should factor into your decision. But tax consider-
ations alone shouldn’t dictate how and where you invest your money. You 
should also weigh investment choices, your desire and the necessity to take 

62
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
risk, personal likes and dislikes, and the number of years you plan to hold the 
investment (see the “Choosing the Right Investment Mix” section, later in the 
chapter, for more information on these other factors).
Determining your tax bracket
You may not know it, but the government charges you different tax rates for 
different parts of your annual income. You pay less tax on the first dollars of 
your earnings and more tax on the last dollars of your earnings. For example, 
suppose your taxable income totalled $60,000 during 2009. The first $9,600 
of income is essentially tax-free, because the tax you would otherwise pay 
on that amount is offset by a federal tax credit of $1,440, the basic personal 
amount. After that, the approximate tax rate (the combined federal and 
provincial rates) you would pay would be 24 percent on the income between 
$9,600 and $37,885, and 36 percent on the income from $37,885 to $75,770. 
Income from 75,770 to $123,185 is taxed at 42 percent, and income over 
$123,185 is taxed at 46 percent.
Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax that you pay on your last (or your 
most recent) dollar(s) of income. In the example of a person with taxable 
income of $60,000, that person’s marginal tax rate is 36 percent. In other 
words, he effectively pays a 36 percent federal tax on his last dollars of 
income — those dollars earned between $37,885 and $60,000. Knowing your 
marginal tax rate allows you to quickly calculate the following:
 
✓ Any additional taxes that you would pay on additional income
 
✓ The amount of taxes that you save if you contribute more money into 
retirement plans or reduce your taxable income
Table 3-1 shows the approximate marginal tax bracket, including federal and 
provincial taxes and surtaxes.

 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
Knowing what’s taxed and when to worry
Interest you receive from bank accounts, GICs, and bonds is generally 
taxable. It’s treated just like your regular income, and taxed at the same rate.
Taxation on your capital gains, which is the profit (sales minus adjusted cost 
base) on an investment, works under a unique system. When you make a 
profit on an investment, defined as selling it for more than its cost to you, 
you have to include half of your gain in your income, which is then taxed at 
your marginal tax rate. The result is that the current tax rate you effectively 
pay on capital gains — your effective tax rate — will be half of your marginal 
tax rate.
If you’re in the lowest marginal tax bracket of 24 percent — remember that 
exact tax rates and marginal tax brackets vary from province to province — 
your effective capital gains tax rate will be 12 percent. If you are in the 
next tax bracket, where your salary is taxed at 36 percent, your effective tax 
rate on capital gains is 18 percent, while those in the 42 percent marginal 
tax bracket will have an effective capital gains tax rate of 21 percent. Finally, 
those in the top 46 percent marginal tax bracket will have capital gains 
taxed at 23 percent. See Table 3-2 for a look at the effective tax rates on 
capital gains.
Table 3-2

Approximate Effective Tax Rate on Capital Gains

$81,452 to $126,264

$126,264 and higher
21% to 24%
Any dividends you receive from Canadian corporations are taxed at the 
lowest effective rate. (Dividends from foreign corporations are treated and 
taxed just like your regular income.) A rather strange formula is used to 
determine the tax rate on dividends. This is because dividends are the distri-
bution of a company’s after-tax profits, so you receive a special tax credit to 
prevent the same profits being taxed twice.
First, the amount of the dividend actually received is increased by 45 
percent — grossed up — to reflect what the corporation is assumed to have 
made pre-tax. This inflated number is what you show on your tax return as 

64
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
the amount of your dividend income. To offset this, you then get a federal tax 
credit of 19 percent of the grossed-up dividends, or 27.5 percent of the actual 
dividend you received.
In addition, your dividend is eligible for a corresponding provincial tax credit. 
The levels of the provincial tax credits for dividends range widely, as do the 
levels of income at which they apply. That said, in most provinces you can 
receive just shy of $40,000 in income from eligible dividends before you have 
to pay any tax on that income. Table 3-3 shows the approximate tax rates for 
dividends.
Table 3-3 
2009 Dividend Income Tax Rates
Taxable Income
Approximate Tax Rate on Eligible Dividends
$9,600 to $37,885
0% to 7%
$37,885 to $75,770
2% to 19%
$75,770 to $123,185
11% to 26%
$123,185 and higher 
17% to 29%
 
The lower your overall income level, the lower the tax rate for any dividends 
you receive. But there’s more. In most provinces, if your income is below 
certain levels, not only is your dividend income not taxed, the tax you owe on 
income from other sources, including your regular job, is reduced. How? For 
lower-income earners, the marginal tax rate for dividends is actually negative. 
(In British Columbia, the most favourable province to receive dividend income 
in, the rate is negative 15.5 percent!) When there is a negative marginal tax 
rate for dividends, the dividend tax credit you earn not only offsets any tax 
due on the dividend income, but also reduces tax payable on other income. 
If your marginal tax rate for dividends is –10 percent, for example, a dollar of 
dividend income would mean you’d pay $0.10 less overall in taxes than you 
would without the dollar of dividend income.
 
Use these strategies to reduce the taxes on investments exposed to taxation:
 
✓ Invest in tax-friendly stock funds. Index funds are mutual funds that 
invest in a relatively static portfolio of securities, such as stocks and 
bonds. They don’t attempt to beat the market. Rather, they invest in the 
securities to mirror or match the performance of an underlying index, 
such as the TSX Composite Index or Standard & Poor’s 500 index (which 
we discuss in Chapter 5). Although index funds can’t beat the market, 
the typical actively managed fund doesn’t either, and index funds have 

65
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
several advantages over actively managed funds. Because index funds 
trade less, they tend to produce lower capital gains distributions. For 
mutual funds held outside tax-sheltered plans, this reduced trading 
effectively increases an investor’s total rate of return. See Chapter 
8 to find out more about tax-friendly stock mutual funds.
 
✓ Invest in tax-friendly stocks. Companies that pay little in the way of 
dividends reinvest more of their profits back into the company. If you 
invest outside of a retirement plan, unless you need income to live 
on, minimize your exposure to stocks with dividends. Be aware that 
low-dividend stocks tend to be more volatile.
 
✓ Invest in small business and real estate. The growth in value of a 
business and real estate asset isn’t taxed until you sell the asset. 
However, the current income that a small business and real estate pro-
duce is taxed as ordinary income. (If you sell the home you live in — 
your principal residence — for a profit, all those gains are tax-free.)
Choosing the Right Investment Mix
Diversifying your investments helps buffer your portfolio from being sunk by 
one or two poor performers. In this section, we explain how to mix up a great 
recipe of investments.
Considering your age
When you’re younger and have more years until you plan to use your money, 
you should keep larger amounts of your long-term investment money in 
growth (ownership) vehicles, such as stocks, real estate, and small business. 
As we discuss in Chapter 2, the attraction of these types of investments is the 
potential to really grow your money. The risk: The value of your portfolio can 
fall from time to time.
The younger you are, the more time your investments have to recover from a 
bad fall. In this respect, investments are a bit like people. If a 30-year-old and 
an 80-year-old fall on a concrete sidewalk, odds are higher that the younger 
person will fully recover. Such falls sometimes disable older people.
 
A long-held guiding principle says to subtract your age from 110 and invest the 
resulting number as a percentage of money to place in growth (ownership) 
investments. So if you’re 35 years old,

66
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
110 – 35 = 75 percent of your investment money can be in growth 
investments.
If you want to be more aggressive, subtract your age from 120:
120 – 35 = 85 percent of your investment money can be in growth 
investments.
Note that even retired people should generally still have a healthy chunk 
of their investment dollars in growth vehicles like stocks. A 70-year-old 
person may want to totally avoid risk, but doing so is generally a mistake. 
Such a person can live another two or three decades. If you live longer 
than anticipated, you can run out of money if it doesn’t continue to grow.
 
These tips are only general guidelines and apply to money that you invest for 
the long term (ideally for ten years or more). For money that you need to use 
in the shorter term, such as within the next several years, more-aggressive 
growth investments aren’t appropriate. See Chapters 7 and 8 for more ideas.
Making the most of your 
investment options
No hard-and-fast rules dictate how to allocate the percentage you’ve ear-
marked for growth investments among specific investments, like stocks and 
real estate. Part of how you decide to allocate your investments depends, 
for example, on the types of investments you want to focus on. As we discuss 
in Chapter 5, diversifying in stocks worldwide can be prudent as well as 
profitable.
Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:
 
✓ Maximize contributions to retirement plans. Unless you need accessible 
money for shorter-term non-retirement goals, why pass up the free extra 
returns from the tax benefits of retirement plans?
 
✓ Take advantage of a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). The capital 
gains, dividends, and interest you earn on money inside these accounts 
are tax-free, as are any withdrawals. Put short-term money such as your 
emergency funds into a TFSA. Also consider sheltering savings in a TFSA 
if you’re already contributing the maximum to your RRSP.
  
✓ Don’t pile into investments that gain lots of attention. Many investors 
make this mistake, especially those who lack a thought-out plan to buy 
stocks. In Chapter 5, we provide numerous illustrations of the perils of 
buying attention-grabbing stocks.

67
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
 
✓ Have the courage to be a contrarian. No one wants to jump on board a 
sinking ship or support a losing cause. However, just like shopping for 
something at retail stores, the best time to buy something is when its 
price is reduced.
 
✓ Diversify. As we discuss in Chapter 2, the values of different invest-
ments don’t move in tandem. So when you invest in growth investments, 
such as stocks or real estate, your portfolio’s value will have a smoother 
ride if you diversify properly.
 
✓ Invest more in what you know. Over the years, we’ve met successful 
investors who have built substantial wealth without spending gobs of 
their free time researching, selecting, and monitoring investments. Some 
investors, for example, concentrate more on real estate because that’s 
what they best understand and feel comfortable with. Others put more 
money in stocks for the same reason. No one-size-fits-all code exists for 
successful investors. Just be careful that you don’t put all your investing 
eggs in the same basket (for example, don’t load up on stocks in the 
same industry that you believe you know a lot about).
 
✓ Don’t invest in too many different things. Diversification is good to 
a point. If you purchase so many investments that you can’t perform a 
basic annual review of them (for example, reading the annual report 
from your mutual fund), you have too many investments.
 
✓ Be more aggressive inside retirement plans. When you hit your 
retirement years, you’ll probably begin to live off your non-retirement 
plan investments first. Why? For the simple reason that allowing 
your retirement plans to continue growing will save you tax dollars. 
Therefore, you should be relatively less aggressive with investments 
outside of retirement plans because that money will be invested for a 
shorter time period.
Easing into risk: Dollar cost averaging
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is the practice of investing a regular amount 
of money at set time intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, into volatile 
investments, such as stocks and stock mutual funds. If you’ve ever deducted 
money from a paycheque and pumped it into a retirement savings plan 
investment account that holds stocks and bonds, you’ve done DCA.
 
Most of us invest a portion of our employment compensation as we earn it, 
but if you have extra cash sitting around, you can choose to invest that 
money in one fell swoop or to invest it gradually via DCA. The biggest appeal 
of gradually feeding money into the market via DCA is that you don’t dump 

68
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
all of your money into a potentially overheated investment just before a 
major drop. Thus, DCA helps shy investors to psychologically ease into riskier 
investments.
DCA is made to order for skittish investors with a large lump sum of money 
sitting in safe investments like GICs or a savings account. For example, using 
DCA, an investor with $100,000 to invest in stock funds can feed her money 
into investments gradually — say, at the rate of $12,500 or so quarterly over 
two years — instead of investing her entire $100,000 in stocks at once and 
possibly buying all of her shares at a market peak. Most large investment 
companies, especially mutual fund companies, allow investors to establish 
automatic investment plans so the DCA occurs without an investor’s ongoing 
involvement.
Of course, like any risk-reducing investment strategy, DCA has drawbacks. 
If growth investments appreciate (as they’re supposed to), a DCA investor 
misses out on earning higher returns on his money awaiting investment. 
Finance professors Richard E. Williams and Peter W. Bacon found that 
approximately two-thirds of the time, a lump-sum stock market investor 
earned higher first-year returns than an investor who fed the money in 
monthly over the first year. (They studied data from the U.S. market over 
the past seven decades.)
York University business professor Moshe Arye Milevsky came to the same 
conclusion in his book Money Logic. According to Milevsky’s research, if you 
invested a $10,000 lump sum in a Canadian equity mutual fund, you would 
likely have $11,000 after a year had passed. In short, his research showed 
that two-thirds of the time, your initial investment would be worth between 
$9,500 and $12,500. In contrast, if you invested the money in equal amounts 
over 12 months, by the end of that year your initial investment would 
likely be worth $10,748. More specifically, two-thirds of the time you could 
anticipate having somewhere between $9,898 and $11,598.
However, knowing that you’ll probably be ahead most of the time if you 
dump a lump sum into the stock market is little solace if you happen to 
invest just before a major plunge in the stock market. In the fall of 2008, 
the Canadian stock market, as measured by the TSX composite index, 
plummeted 30 percent in just over four weeks. From late 2007 to the fall of 
2008, the market shed 42 percent of its value.
So investors who fear that stocks are due for such a major correction should 
practice DCA, right? Well, not so fast. Apprehensive investors who shun 
lump-sum investments and use DCA are more likely to stop the DCA invest-
ment process if prices plunge, thereby defeating the benefit of doing DCA 
during a declining market.

So what’s an investor with a lump sum of money to do?
 
✓ First, weigh the significance of the lump sum to you. Although $100,000 
is a big chunk of most people’s net worth, it’s only 10 percent if your net 
worth is $1,000,000. It’s not worth a millionaire’s time to use DCA. If the 
cash that you have to invest is less than a quarter of your net worth, you 
may not want to bother with DCA.
 
✓ Second, consider how aggressively you invest (or invested) your 
money. For example, if you aggressively invested your money through 
an employer’s retirement plan that you roll over, don’t waste your time 
on DCA.
DCA makes sense for investors with a large chunk of their net worth in cash 
who want to minimize the risk of transferring that cash to riskier invest-
ments, such as stocks. If you fancy yourself a market prognosticator, you can 
also assess the current valuation of stocks. Thinking that stocks are pricey 
(and thus riper for a fall) increases the appeal of DCA.
 
Over how long a time period should you practice DCA? If you use DCA too 
quickly, you may not give the market sufficient time for a correction to 
unfold, during and after which some of the DCA purchases may take place. If 
you practice DCA over too long of a period of time, you may miss a major 
upswing in stock prices. We suggest using DCA over one to two years to strike 
a balance.
As for the times of the year that you should use DCA, mutual fund investors 
should use DCA quarterly early in each calendar quarter because mutual 
funds that make taxable distributions tend to do so late in the quarter. 
Your money that awaits investment should have a suitable parking place. 
Select a high-yielding money market fund or high-interest savings account.
One last critical point: When you use DCA, establish an automatic investment 
plan so you’re less likely to chicken out. And for the more courageous, 
you may want to try an alternative strategy to DCA — value averaging, 
which allows you to invest more if prices are falling and invest less if prices 
are rising.
Suppose that you want to value average $500 per quarter into an aggressive 
stock mutual fund. After your first quarterly $500 investment, the fund 
drops 10 percent, reducing your account balance to $450. Value averaging 
has you invest $500 the next quarter plus another $50 to make up the 
shortfall. (Conversely, if the fund value had increased to $550 after your 
first investment, you would invest only $450 in the second round.) Increasing 
the amount that you invest requires confidence when prices fall, but doing 
so magnifies your returns when prices ultimately turn around.

Protecting Your Assets
You may be at risk of making a catastrophic investing mistake: not protecting 
your assets properly due to a lack of various insurance coverages. That’s 
the error that Manny, a successful entrepreneur, made. Starting from scratch, 
he built up a successful million-dollar manufacturing operation. He invested 
a lot of his own personal money and sweat into building the business over 
15 years.
One day, catastrophe struck: An explosion ripped through his building, and 
the ensuing fire destroyed virtually all the firm’s equipment and inventory, 
none of which was insured. The explosion also seriously injured several 
workers, including Manny, who didn’t carry disability insurance. Ultimately, 
Manny had to file for bankruptcy.
 
Decisions regarding what amount of insurance you need to carry are, to some 
extent, a matter of your desire and ability to accept financial risk. But some 
risks aren’t worth taking. Don’t overestimate your ability to predict what 
accidents and other bad luck may befall you. Here’s what you need to protect 
yourself and your assets: 
.
 
✓ Adequate liability insurance on your home and car to guard your 
assets against lawsuits: You should have at least enough liability 
insurance to protect your net worth (assets minus your liabilities/debts) 
or, ideally, twice your net worth. If you run your own business, get 
insurance for your business assets if they’re substantial, such as in 
Manny’s case. Also consider professional liability insurance to protect 
against a lawsuit. You may also want to consider incorporating your 
business (which we discuss more in Chapter 14).
 
✓ Long-term disability insurance: What would you (and your family) do 
to replace your income if a major disability prevents you from working? 
Even if you don’t have dependents, odds are that you are dependent 
on you. Most larger employers offer group plans that have good benefits 
and are much less expensive than coverage you’d buy on your own. 
Also, check with your professional association for a competitive 
group plan.
 
✓ Life insurance if others are dependent on your income: If you’re single 
or your loved ones can live without your income, skip life insurance. If 
you need coverage, buy term insurance that, like your auto and home 
insurance, is pure insurance protection. The amount of term insurance 
you need to buy largely depends on how much of your income you want 
to replace.

71
 Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order before You Invest
 
✓ Estate planning: At a minimum, most people need a simple will to 
delineate to whom they would like to leave all their worldly possessions. 
If you hold significant assets outside retirement plans, you may also 
benefit from establishing a living trust, which keeps your money from 
filtering through the hands of probate lawyers. Living wills and medical 
powers of attorney are useful to have in case you’re ever in a medically 
incapacitated situation. If you have substantial assets, doing more 
involved estate planning is wise to minimize taxes and ensure the 
orderly passing of your assets to your heirs.
In our experience, we’ve seen that although many people lack particular 
types of insurance, others possess unnecessary policies. Many people also 
keep very low deductibles. Remember to insure against potential losses 
that would be financially catastrophic for you — don’t waste your money to 
protect against smaller losses. (See the latest edition of our book Personal 
Finance For Canadians For Dummies, published by Wiley, to discover the 
right and wrong ways to buy insurance, what to look for in policies, and 
where to get good policies.)

T
o buy and enjoy a watch, you don’t need to understand the details of 
how it’s put together and works. Ditto for investing in stocks and bonds. 
However, spending some time understanding how and why the financial mar-
kets function will make you more comfortable with investing and make you a 
better investor.
This is especially true after events such as the stock market collapse in the 
fall of 2008 and spring of 2009. Most people saw the value of their invest-
ments drop dramatically from the fall-out of something they knew little about, 
namely the subprime mortgage market. (Later in this chapter we explain how 
the implosion of this type of security hampered the economy and took a big 
chunk out of most people’s savings.)
In this chapter, we tell you the ways that companies raise capital, and we 
give you a brief primer on financial markets and economics so you can under-
stand and be comfortable with investing in the financial markets.
How Companies Raise Money 
through the Financial Markets
All businesses start small — often in a garage, a spare bedroom, or a rented 
office. As companies begin to grow, they often need more money (known 
as capital in the financial world) to expand and afford their growing needs, 
such as hiring more employees, buying computer systems, and purchasing 

76
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
manufacturing equipment. Companies can choose between two major 
options for raising money when they go into the financial markets: issuing 
stocks or issuing bonds.
Deciding whether to issue stocks or bonds
 
A world of difference exists between stocks and bonds, two major types of 
securities, both from the perspective of the investor and from that of the 
issuing company, as the following explanations illustrate:
 
✓ Bonds are loans that a company must pay back. Rather than borrowing 
money from a bank, many companies elect to sell bonds, which are IOUs 
to investors. The primary disadvantage of issuing bonds compared 
with issuing stock, from a company’s perspective, is that the company 
must pay this money back with interest. On the other hand, the busi-
ness doesn’t have to relinquish ownership when it borrows money. 
Companies are also more likely to issue bonds if the stock market is 
depressed, meaning that companies can’t fetch as much for their stock.
 
✓ Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Some companies choose 
to issue stock to raise money. Unlike bonds, the money that the company 
raises through a stock issue isn’t paid back, because it’s not a loan. When 
the public (people like you and us) buys stocks, these outside investors 
continue to hold and trade it. (Although companies may occasionally 
choose to buy their own stock back, usually because they think it’s a 
good investment, they’re under no obligation to do so. If a company does 
a stock buyback, the price that the company pays is simply the price that 
the stock currently trades for.)
 
 When a company issues stock, it makes it much easier for the found-
ers and owners to sell some of their part of the business and reap the 
rewards of their successful venture. (It’s extremely difficult to sell off 
part of a private company, since valuing what a certain percentage is 
worth is a daunting challenge. This drastically reduces the number of 
potential buyers, which in turn makes selling even more challenging, 
since they know the difficulty they’ll face should they want to later sell 
their share. When an investment is difficult to purchase or sell, and has 
few potential buyers, its known as an illiquid investment.) Many growing 
companies also favour issuing stock because they don’t want the cash 
drain that comes from paying loans (bonds) back.
 
 Although many companies’ owners like to take their companies public 
(selling shares of the business) to cash in on their stake of the company, 
not all owners want to go public, and not all who do go public are happy 
that they did. One of the numerous drawbacks of selling shares that can 
be traded on the stock market is that you have to let others in on the 

77
 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
workings of your business. Deciding to sell shares of a company that has 
been completely privately owned to the general public — “going public” —
includes burdensome financial reporting requirements, such as the 
production of quarterly earnings statements and annual reports. These 
documents not only take lots of time and money to produce, but they 
can also reveal competitive secrets. Some companies also harm their 
long-term planning ability because of the pressure and focus on short-
term corporate performance that comes with being a public company.
Ultimately, companies seek to raise capital in the lowest-cost way they 
can, so they’ll elect to sell stocks or bonds— or borrow — based on what 
the finance folks tell them is the cheapest option. For example, if the stock 
market is booming and new stock can be sold at a premium price, companies 
usually opt to sell more stock.
 
From your perspective as a potential investor, you can usually make more 
money in stocks than bonds, but as we saw in the collapse of stock markets in 
2008, stocks are generally more volatile in the short term (see Chapter 2).
Taking a company public: 
Understanding IPOs
Suppose that The Capitalist Company (TCC) wants to issue stock for the 
first time, which is called an initial public offering (IPO). If TCC decides to go 
public, the company’s management team works with investment bankers, who 
help companies decide when and at what price to sell stock.
Suppose further that, based upon their analysis of the value of TCC, the 
investment bankers believe that TCC can raise $20 million by issuing stock, 
which represents a specific percentage of the company. When a company 
issues stock, the price they set per share of the stock is somewhat arbitrary. 
The amount that a prospective investor will pay for a particular portion of 
the company’s stock should depend on the company’s profits and future 
growth prospects. Companies that produce higher levels of profits and grow 
faster can generally command a higher sales price for a given portion of the 
company.
Suppose that the investment bankers valued TCC’s total business at $40 mil-
lion, and the company wanted to raise $20 million by selling half the business 
to the public. Consider the following ways that investment bankers can struc-
ture the IPO for TCC:

78
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Price of Stock
Number of Shares Issued
$5
4 million
$10
2 million
$2
1 million
In fact, TCC can raise the $20 million in an infinite number of ways, thanks 
to varying stock prices. If the company wants to issue the stock at a higher 
price, the company sells fewer shares.
 
A stock’s price per share by itself is meaningless in evaluating whether to buy a 
stock. Ultimately, the amount that investors will pay for a company’s stock 
should depend greatly on the company’s growth and profitability prospects.
The value of a company's stock
Relative to (divided by) its earnings = Its price/earnings ratio
In the case of TCC, supposing that its stock outstanding in the marketplace 
has a total value of $30 million and that it earned $3 per share in the past 
year, here are the numbers:
$30 million
$3 million
= 10
In Chapter 5, we talk more about price/earnings ratios and the factors that 
influence stock prices.
Understanding Financial 
Markets and Economics
Tens of thousands of books, millions of articles, and enough PhD disserta-
tions to pack a major landfill explore the topics of how the financial markets 
and economy will perform in the years ahead. You can spend the rest of your 
life reading all this stuff, and you still won’t get through it. In this section, we 
cut to the chase and explain what you need to know about the factors that 
make the financial markets and economy work so you can make informed 
investing decisions.
Uncovering the roots: Capitalism
In Canada, we live in a capitalistic (also known as free-market) society. Have 
you ever stopped to think what that term means? Capitalism means that you 
have a tremendous (although not unlimited) amount of economic freedom.

79
 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
If you want to start your own business, you can. However, that’s not to say 
that you don’t have to deal with obstacles, such as affording the start-up 
stages of your business and dealing with regulatory red tape. Most Canadian 
entrepreneurs will tell you that one of their greatest business frustrations is 
dealing with all the various government agencies that regulate and tax busi-
nesses. In addition to the long lists of licences you need to obtain for certain 
businesses, you may have to deal with zoning and planning offices regard-
ing the use of the location of your business. You may also have to work with 
other provincial and local agencies if you decide to incorporate, and with still 
more government folks to comply with the myriad tax laws of the land.
Whine, whine, whine. Go to a socialist country if you want to see tape that’s 
really red and a lack of economic opportunity and mobility. Socialism, in con-
trast to capitalism, is an economic system that its 19th-century promoters, 
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, best sum up: “Abolish all private property.”
Vladimir Lenin transformed the socialist theory of Marx and Engels into 
a political system known as communism. In communism, the government 
largely controls and owns the organizations that provide what people need. 
Over time, various countries in Europe, the former Soviet Union (Russia), and 
China have tried to make communism work. However, most of these parts of 
the world continue to become more capitalistic. The low standard of living in 
communist countries, long waits in lines to purchase goods, and poor health 
care all contributed to the downfall of communist systems.
Driving stock prices through earnings
The goal of most companies is to make money, or earnings (also called profits). 
Earnings result from the difference between what a company takes in (revenue) 
and what it spends (costs). We say most companies because some organizations’ 
primary purpose is not to maximize profits. Non-profit organizations, such 
as charities and universities, are a good example. But even non-profits can’t 
thrive and prosper without a steady flow of money coming in.
Companies that trade publicly on the stock exchanges are supposed to maxi-
mize their profit — that’s what their shareholders want. Higher profits gener-
ally make stock prices rise. Most private companies seek to maximize their 
profits as well, but they retain much more latitude to pursue other goals.
The following are the major ways that successful companies increase profits:
 
✓ Build a better mousetrap. Some companies develop or promote an 
invention or innovation that better meets customer needs. For example, 
many consumers welcomed the invention of the digital camera, which 
eliminated the need for costly and time-consuming development of film. 

80
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
The digital camera also made transferring and working with pictures 
much easier, allowing you to turn your pictures into cards and send 
them via e-mail.
 
✓ Sell their products to new markets. Many successful companies based 
in Canada have been stampeding into foreign countries to sell their 
products. Although some product adaptation is usually required to sell 
overseas, selling an already proven and developed product or service to 
new markets generally increases a company’s chances for success.
 
✓ Be in related businesses. Consider the hugely successful Walt Disney 
Company, which was started in the 1920s as a small studio that made 
cartoons. Over the years, it expanded into many new but related busi-
nesses, including theme parks and resorts, movie studios, radio and 
television programs, toys,children’s books, and video games.
 
✓ Build a brand name. Coca-Cola, for example, and many types of well-
known beers often aren’t rated any higher in blind taste tests than many 
generic colas and beers that are far less expensive. Yet consumers 
(perhaps you) fork over more of their hard-earned loot because of the 
name and packaging. Companies build brand names largely through 
advertising and other promotions. (For Dummies is a brand name, but 
For Dummies books cost about the same as lower-quality and smaller 
books on similar subjects!)
 
✓ Manage costs and prices. Smart companies control costs. Lowering the 
cost of manufacturing their products or providing their services allows 
companies to offer their products and services more cheaply. Managing 
costs may help fatten the bottom line (profit). Sometimes, though, com-
panies try to cut too many corners, and their cost-cutting ways come 
back to haunt them in the form of dissatisfied customers — or even 
lawsuits based on a faulty or dangerous product.
 
✓ Watch the competition. Successful companies don’t follow the herd, 
but they do keep an eye on what their competition is up to. If lots of 
competitors target one part of the market, some companies target a less-
pursued segment that, if they can capture it, may produce higher profits 
thanks to reduced competition.
Weighing whether markets are efficient
Companies generally seek to maximize profits and maintain a healthy financial 
condition. Ultimately, the financial markets judge the worth of a company’s 
stock or bond. Trying to predict what happens to the stock and bond markets 
and to individual securities consumes many a market prognosticator.
In the 1960s, somewhat to the chagrin of market soothsayers, academic 
scholars developed a theory called the efficient market hypothesis. This 

81
 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
theory basically maintains the following logic: Lots of investors collect and 
analyze all sorts of information about companies and their securities. If inves-
tors think that a security, such as a stock, is overpriced, they sell it or don’t 
buy it. Conversely, if the investors believe that a security is underpriced, 
they buy it or hold what they already own. Because of the competition among 
all these investors, the price that a security trades at generally reflects what 
many (supposedly informed) people think it’s worth.
Therefore, the efficient market theory implies that trading in and out of secu-
rities and the overall market in an attempt to obtain the right stocks at the 
right time is a futile endeavour. Buying or selling a security because of “new” 
news is also fruitless because the stock price adjusts so quickly to this news 
that investors can’t profit by acting on it. As Burton Malkiel so eloquently 
said in his classic book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, this theory, “Taken 
to its logical extreme . . . means that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at 
a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as 
well as one carefully selected by the experts.” Malkiel added, “Financial ana-
lysts in pin-striped suits don’t like being compared with bare-assed apes.”
Some money managers have beaten the markets. In fact, beating the market 
over a year or three years isn’t difficult, but few can beat the market over a 
decade or more. Efficient market supporters argue that some of those who 
beat the markets, even over a ten-year period, do so because of luck. Consider 
that if you flip a coin five times, on some occasions you get five consecutive 
heads. This coincidence actually happens, on average, once every 32 times 
you do 5 coin-flip sequences. And the results are due to random luck, not skill. 
Consistently identifying in advance which particular sequence will give you five 
consecutive heads isn’t possible.
Strict believers in the efficient market hypothesis say that it’s equally impossible 
to identify the best money managers in advance. Some money managers, such 
as those who manage mutual funds, possess publicly available track records. 
Inspecting those track records (and understanding the level of risk taken for the 
achieved returns) and doing other common-sense things, such as investing in 
funds that have lower expenses, improve your odds of performing a bit better 
than the market.
Various investment markets differ in how efficient they are. Efficiency means 
that the current price of an investment accurately reflects its true value. 
Although the stock market is reasonably efficient, many consider the bond 
market to be even more efficient. The real estate market is less efficient 
because properties are unique, and sometimes less competition and access 
to information exist. If you can locate a seller who really needs to sell, you 
may be able to buy property at a discount from what it’s really worth. Small 
business is also less efficient. Entrepreneurs with innovative ideas and 
approaches can sometimes earn enormous returns.

Moving the market: Interest rates, 
inflation, and the Bank of Canada
For decades, economists, investment managers, and other (often self-
anointed) gurus have attempted to understand the course of interest rates, 
inflation, and the monetary policies set forth by the Federal Reserve and, to 
a lesser degree, the Bank of Canada. Millions of investors follow these eco-
nomic factors. Why? Because interest rates, inflation, and monetary policy 
seem to move the world’s financial markets and the economy.
Realizing that high interest rates are generally bad
Many businesses borrow money to expand. People like you and us, who are 
affectionately referred to as consumers, also borrow money to finance home 
and auto purchases and education.
Interest rate increases tend to slow the economy. Businesses scale back on 
expansion plans because it’s too expensive to borrow money to grow, and 
some debt-laden businesses can’t afford the cost of higher interest rates 
and go under. Most individuals possess limited budgets as well and have to 
scale back some purchases because of higher interest rates. For example, the 
higher interest rates are, the larger mortgage payments are for homebuyers.
If high interest rates choke business expansion and consumer spending, then 
economic growth slows or the economy actually shrinks — and possibly ends 
up in a recession. The definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters (six 
months) of contracting economic activity.
The stock market usually develops a case of the queasies as corporate profits 
shrink. High interest rates may depress investors’ appetites for stocks as the 
yields increase on guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), Treasury bills, 
and other bonds.
Higher interest rates actually make some people happy. If you locked in a 
fixed-rate mortgage on your home or on a business loan, your loan looks much 
better than if you had a variable-rate mortgage. Some retirees and others who 
live off the interest income on their investments are happy with interest rate 
increases as well. Consider back in the early 1980s, for example, when a retiree 
received $10,000 per year in interest for each $100,000 invested in guaranteed 
investment certificates that paid 10 percent.
Fast-forward to the early 2000s: A retiree purchasing the same GICs saw interest 
income slashed by about 80 percent, because many GIC rates were just 3 per-
cent. So for every $100,000 invested, only $3,000 in interest income was paid.

83
 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
If you try to live off the income that your investments produce, an 80 percent 
drop in that income is likely to cramp your lifestyle. So higher interest rates 
are better if you’re living off your investment income, right? Not necessarily.
Discovering the inflation and interest rate connection
Consider what happened to interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
After Canada and the United States successfully emerged from a terrible 
recession in the mid-1970s, their economies seemed to be on the right track. 
But within just a few years, they were in turmoil again. The annual increase 
in the cost of living (known as the rate of inflation) burst through 10 percent 
on its way to 14 percent. Interest rates, which are what bondholders receive 
when they lend their money to corporations and governments, followed infla-
tion skyward.
 
Inflation and interest rates usually move in tandem. The primary driver of 
interest rates is the rate of inflation. Interest rates were much higher in the 
1980s because Canada and the United States had double-digit inflation. If the 
cost of living increases at the rate of 10 percent per year, why would you, as 
an investor, lend your money (which is what you do when you purchase a 
bond or GIC) at 5 percent? Interest rates were so much higher in the early 
1980s because you would never do such a thing.
In recent years, interest rates have been low because inflation has declined 
significantly since the early 1980s. Therefore, the rate of interest that investors 
could earn lending their money dropped accordingly. Although low interest 
rates reduce the interest income that comes in, the corresponding low rate 
of inflation doesn’t devour the purchasing power of your principal balance. 
That’s why lower interest rates aren’t necessarily worse and higher interest 
rates aren’t necessarily better as you try to live off your investment income.
So what are investors to do when they’re living off the income they receive 
from their investments but don’t receive enough because of low interest rates? 
Some retirees have woken up to the risk of keeping all or too much of their 
money in short-term GIC and bond investments. (Please review the sections in 
Chapter 3 dealing with asset allocation and investment mix.) A simple but psy-
chologically difficult solution is to use up some of your principal to supplement 
your interest and dividend income. Using up your principal to supplement your 
income is what effectively happens anyway when inflation is higher — the 
purchasing power of your principal erodes more quickly. You may also find that 
you haven’t saved enough money to achieve your desired standard of living — 
that’s why you may want to run a retirement analysis (see Chapter 3) before 
you retire.

Exploring the U.S. Federal Reserve
Much of the direction of interest rates in Canada 
is dictated by interest rates in the United States. 
And those rates are set by the Federal Reserve 
Board. When the chairman of the “Fed” speaks, 
an extraordinary number of people listen. Most 
financial market watchers and the media — 
in Canada and other countries, as well as in 
the United States — want to know what the 
Federal Reserve has decided to do about mon-
etary policy. (The Federal Reserve is the central 
bank of the United States. The Federal Reserve 
Board is comprised of the 12 presidents from 
the respective Federal Reserve district banks 
and the 7 Federal Reserve governors, including 
the chairman who conducts the Federal Open 
Market Committee meetings behind closed 
doors eight times a year.)
Much like the Bank of Canada does here, the 
Federal Reserve sets monetary policy. To do 
so, the Fed raises or lowers short-term inter-
est rates, primarily by buying and selling U.S. 
Treasury bills on the open market. Through this 
trading activity, known as open market opera-
tions, the Fed is able to target the Federal funds 
rate, the rate banks charge each other for over-
night borrowing.
Over the years, the Fed has come under attack 
for various reasons. Various pundits have 
accused former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 
of causing speculative bubbles (see Chapter 5), 
such as the boom in technology stock prices in 
the late 1990s or in housing in the early 2000s.
Greenspan came under even more criticism 
after the stock market crash of 2008. The 
staunch believer in free markets, who often 
awed lawmakers, called the chaos in the bank-
ing and housing markets a “once-in-a-lifetime 
credit tsunami” that had left him in a state of 
“shocked disbelief.” Yet he admitted that the 
flaw in his anti-regulatory philosophy was the 
belief that self-interest would mean the banks 
would do what was necessary to protect their 
shareholders and institutions. Unfortunately, he 
and his ilk missed the key, and we’d say kind 
of obvious, fact that, left uncontrolled, the bank 
(as well as mortgage and insurance company) 
executives’ overriding interest would be lining 
their own pockets with massive bonuses. And, of 
course, this would come at the expense of every-
body from the shareholders to the taxpayers and 
consumers faced with the economic cost of 
cleaning up the subprime mess. As one pundit 
so nicely put it, would you want to drink milk 
from a dairy that “self-regulates”? Fly in an air-
plane given safety clearance through “self-reg-
ulation”? Or how about drink water downstream 
from a “self-regulating” chemical plant?
In addition, some economists have argued 
that the Federal Reserve has, with a nudge of 
encouragement from the president, goosed the 
economy. The Fed gooses the economy by loos-
ening up on the money supply, which leads to 
a growth spurt in the economy and a booming 
stock market, just in time to make El Presidente 
look good prior to an election. Conveniently, the 
consequences of inflation take longer to show 
up — not until after the election. In recent years, 
others have questioned the Fed’s ability to 
largely do what it wants without accountability.

 Chapter 4: The Workings of Stock and Bond Markets
The role of the Bank of Canada
What exactly is the “Bank of Canada,” and what does it do? The Bank of Canada 
sets monetary policy. In other (perhaps clearer) words, the Bank of Canada influ-
ences interest rate levels and the amount of money or currency in circulation, 
known as the money supply, in an attempt to maintain a stable rate of inflation 
and growth in the Canadian economy.
Buying money is no different from buying lettuce, computers, or sneakers. 
All these products and goods cost you dollars when you buy them. The cost 
of money is the interest rate that you must pay to borrow it. And the cost or 
interest rate of money is determined by many factors that ultimately influ-
ence the supply of and demand for money.
The Bank of Canada, from time to time and in different ways, attempts to 
influence the supply and demand for money and the cost of money. To this 
end, the Bank of Canada raises or lowers short-term interest rates, primar-
ily by managing its target for the overnight rate — the rate at which banks 
borrow from one another overnight.
The senior officials at the Bank of Canada readily admit that the economy is 
quite complex and affected by many things, so it’s difficult to predict where 
the economy is heading. If forecasting and influencing markets are such dif-
ficult undertakings, why does the Bank of Canada exist? Well, the officials 
believe that they can have a positive influence in creating a healthy overall 
economic environment — one in which inflation is low and growth proceeds 
at a modest pace
 
Many factors influence the course of stock prices. Never, ever make a trade 
or investment based upon what someone at, say, the Federal Reserve says or 
what someone in the media or some market pundit reads into the interest 
rate comments. You need to make your investment plans based on your needs 
and goals, not based on what those supposedly steering the economy do or 
don’t do.

▶ Taking steps to improve your chance of success in the market
S
ome people liken investing in the stock market to gambling. A real 
casino structures its games — slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and 
so on — so that in aggregate, the casino owners siphon off a healthy slab 
(40 percent) of the money that people bring with them. The vast majority of 
casino patrons lose money, in some cases all of it. The few who leave with 
more money than they came with are usually people who are lucky and smart 
enough to quit while they’re ahead.
We can understand why some individual investors feel that the stock market 
resembles legalized gambling. So why bother with the stock market if it’s so 
confusing and filled with people who are eager to separate you from your 
money? In Chapter 2, we discuss the potential risks and rewards of different 
investments. Shares of stock, which represent portions of ownership in com-
panies, offer a way for people of modest and wealthy means, and everybody 
in between, to invest in companies and build wealth.
Fortunately, the stock market isn’t a casino — far from it. History shows that 
nearly all long-term investors can win in the stock market because it appreci-
ates over the years. We say nearly because even some people who remain 
active in the market over many years manage to lose some money because of 
easily avoidable mistakes, which we can keep you from making in the future.
R. Foster Winans, a former writer for Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal, 
said, “The only reason to invest in the market is because you think you know 
something others don’t.” Mr. Winans, who was later convicted of insider 
trading, was wrong in more ways than one. You don’t need inside information

Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
to profit from stock investments. You simply need to understand this basic 
concept: The increasing profits that expanding companies produce ulti-
mately propel stock prices higher. The trajectory path isn’t a straight line up, 
but more like the path that a small bird takes when it fights to gain altitude 
in a headwind. Although the bird sometimes hits an air pocket or spot of bad 
weather and loses some altitude, the bird’s aerodynamics win out. How many 
birds have you seen crash to the ground?
The same theory applies with corporate profits. Corporate profits also tend 
to trend up, but sometimes the economy hits a bad patch, and profits fall. As 
with the bird, economies don’t usually get completely decimated. Yes, it’s 
possible that if a huge meteor smashes into Earth or a horrible, contagious 
virus spreads like wildfire, society may be done for — people and companies 
may cease to exist. In the meantime, why not share in the expansion of the 
economy and keep an optimistic view on life?
Taking Stock of How You Make Money
 
When you purchase a share of a company’s stock, you can profit from your 
ownership in two ways:
 
✓ Dividends: Many stocks pay dividends. Companies ideally make some 
profits during the year. Some high-growth companies reinvest most or 
all of their profits right back into the business. Other companies, how-
ever, pay out some of their profits to shareholders in the form of 
dividends.
 
✓ Appreciation: When the price per share of your stock rises to a level 
greater than you originally paid for it, you make money. This profit, 
however, is only on paper until you sell the stock, at which time you 
realize a capital gain. Of course, the stock price per share can fall below 
what you originally paid (in which case you have a loss on paper unless you 
realize that loss by selling at a lower price than you paid for the stock).
If you add together dividends and appreciation, you arrive at your total 
return. Stocks differ in the dimensions of these possible returns, particularly 
with respect to dividends. Utility companies, for example, tend to pay out 
more of their profits as dividends. But don’t buy utility stocks thinking that 
you’ll make more money because of the heftier dividends. Utilities and other 
companies paying high dividends tend not to appreciate as much over time 
because they don’t reinvest as much in their businesses, and they’re not 
growing as fast as other businesses.

89
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Defining “The Market”
So you invest in stocks to share in the rewards of capitalistic economies. 
When you invest in stocks, you do so through the stock market. What is the 
stock market? Everybody refers to “The Market” the same way they refer to 
the largest city nearby as “The City”:
The Market is down 137 points today.
With The Market hitting new highs, isn’t now a bad time to invest?
The Market seems ready for a fall.
When people talk about The Market, they’re usually referring to the U.S. 
stock market. Even more specifically, they’re speaking about the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow and Eddie Jones, which 
is a famously known index or measure of the performance of the U.S. stock 
market. Dow and Jones, two reporters in their 30s, started publishing a paper 
that you may have heard of — The Wall Street Journal — in 1889. Like its 
modern-day version, the 19th-century Wall Street Journal reported current 
financial news. Dow and Jones also compiled stock prices of larger, important 
companies and created and calculated indexes to track the performance of 
the U.S. stock market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) market index tracks the perfor-
mance of 30 large companies that are headquartered in the United States. 
The Dow 30 includes companies such as telecommunications giant Verizon 
Communications; airplane manufacturer Boeing; beverage maker Coca-Cola; 
oil giant Exxon Mobil; automaker General Motors; technology behemoths 
IBM, Intel, and Microsoft; drug makers Merck and Pfizer; fast-food king 
McDonald’s; and retailers Home Depot and Wal-Mart.
Some criticize the Dow index for encompassing so few companies and for lack-
ing diversity. The 30 stocks that make up the Dow aren’t the 30 largest or the 
30 best companies in America. They just so happen to be the 30 companies 
that senior staff members at The Wall Street Journal think reflect the diversity 
of the economy in the United States (although utility and transportation stocks 
are excluded and tracked in other Dow indexes). The 30 stocks in the Dow 
change over time as companies merge, decline, and rise in importance.
Depending on whom you’re speaking to — or listening to on TV or the radio — 
“The Market” may also be short for the Toronto Stock Exchange, or the TSX. 
The TSX is where the largest and most well-known Canadian companies trade.

Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
Looking at major stock market indexes
Just as Toronto and New York City aren’t the 
only cities to visit or live in, the stocks in the 
TSX Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average are far from representative of all the 
different types of stocks that you can invest in. 
Here are some other important market indexes 
and the types of stocks they track:
 ✓ Standard & Poor’s 500: Like the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average, the S&P 500 tracks the 
price of 500 larger-company U.S. stocks. 
These 500 big companies account for more 
than 70 percent of the total market value of 
the tens of thousands of stocks traded in the 
United States. Thus, the S&P 500 is a much 
broader and more representative index of 
the larger-company stocks in the United 
States than is the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average.
 ✓ Unlike the Dow index, which is primar-
ily calculated by adding the current share 
price of each of its component stocks, the 
S&P 500 index is calculated by adding the 
total market value (capitalization) of its 
component stocks
 ✓ S&P/TSX 60: This index replaced the 
older TSE 35 and TSE 100 indexes. It was 
developed by the TSX in conjunction with 
Standard & Poor’s Corp. of New York. To 
be considered for the index, a company 
must be part of the TSX Composite Index, 
but those with poor liquidity don’t make the 
grade. An index committee chooses 60 of 
the largest companies that offer a repre-
sentation of the major industries. There’s 
also a capped version of this index, which 
limits the weighting of any one stock to a 
maximum of 10 percent of the total market 
capitalization of all the stocks in the index. 
This was done to prevent situations where 
one company whose stock has soared (as 
Nortel’s did in the late 1990s) dominates the 
index and gives an unbalanced reading of 
the market’s overall performance.
 ✓ S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index: This 
index is a broad measure of the perfor-
mance of the TSX Venture Exchange, 
home to Canada’s smaller and often much 
more speculative companies. The index 
has a somewhat confusing past. When the 
Vancouver Stock Exchange and the Alberta 
Stock Exchange merged, the two exchanges 
were replaced by the new Canadian Venture 
Exchange, or CDNX, and a new index — the 
Canadian Venture Exchange Index — was 
created. But that index was short-lived, and 
was replaced by the new S&P/TSX Venture 
Composite Index in 2001. However, the new 
Venture index isn’t a continuation of the old 
Canadian Venture Exchange index, but an 
entirely new index based on different rules 
and requirements. The Canadian Venture 
Exchange index was simply closed down, 
and the new index began on a different — 
and completely unconnected — level than its 
predecessor. The new index looks at market 
capitalization when determining eligibility, 
and the number of companies it includes is 
typically in the low 500 range.
 ✓ Russell 2000: This index tracks the market 
value of 2,000 smaller U.S. company stocks 
of various industries. Although small-com-
pany stocks tend to move in tandem with 
larger-company stocks over the longer 
term, it’s not unusual for one to rise or fall 
more than the other or for one index to fall 
while the other rises in a given year. For 
example, in 2001, the Russell 2000 actu-
ally rose 2.5 percent while the S&P 500 fell 
11.9 percent. In 2007, the Russell 2000 lost 
1.6 percent versus a gain of 5.5 percent for 

91
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
When people talk about how “Toronto” fared, they’re usually talking about 
performance of the S&P/TSX Composite Index. Similar to the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average, the S&P/TSX Composite tracks the performance of larger-
company Canadian stocks. In general, the index is made up of the companies 
with the largest market capitalization — their stock price multiplied by the 
number of shares outstanding. To be included in the index, companies must 
meet a number of other criteria. The most important is liquidity, which is 
measure by looking at the number of shares traded, the number of transac-
tions, and the total value.
(The index used to be called the TSE 300, but that ended in 2002. That year, 
all the indexes were revamped when the administration of the indexes was 
taken over by Standard & Poor’s, which revamped and became involved in 
administering the index. The number of companies included can now vary 
depending on how many meet the requirements. Recently, the number has 
been running in the low 200s.)
 
Conspicuously absent from this list of major stock market indexes is the 
NASDAQ index. With the boom in technology stock prices in the late 1990s, 
CNBC and other financial media started broadcasting movements in the 
technology-laden NASDAQ index, thereby increasing investor interest and the 
frenzy surrounding technology stocks. (See the section later in this chapter 
titled “The Internet and technology bubble.”) We’re not fans of sector- 
(industry-) specific investing; it undermines diversification and places you 
in the role of a professional money manager in having to determine when 
and how much to invest in specific industry groups. We suggest ignoring the 
NASDAQ as well as other industry-concentrated indexes.
the S&P 500. Be aware that smaller-com-
pany stocks tend to be more volatile. (We 
discuss this in more detail in Chapter 2.)
 ✓ Wilshire 5000: Despite its name, the 
Wilshire 5000 index actually tracks the 
prices of more than 6,500 stocks of U.S. 
companies of all sizes — small, medium, 
and large. Thus, many consider this index 
the broadest and most representative of the 
overall U.S. stock market.
 ✓ Morgan Stanley EAFE: Stocks don’t exist 
only in North America. Morgan Stanley’s 
EAFE index (EAFE stands for Europe, 
Australasia, and Far East) tracks the prices 
of stocks in the other major developed 
countries of the world.
 ✓ Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets: This 
index follows the value of stocks in the 
less economically developed but “emerg-
ing” countries such as Korea, Brazil, China, 
Russia, Taiwan, India, South Africa, Mexico, 
and so on. These stock markets tend to be 
more volatile than those in established 
economies. During good economic times, 
emerging markets usually reward inves-
tors with higher returns, but stocks can fall 
farther and faster than stocks in developed 
markets.

92
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
Counting reasons to use indexes
 
Indexes serve several purposes. First, they can quickly give you an idea of how 
particular types of stocks fare and perform in comparison with other types 
of stocks. In 1998, for example, the S&P 500 was up 28.6 percent, whereas the 
small-company Russell 2000 index was down 2.5 percent. That same year, the 
Morgan Stanley foreign stock EAFE index rose 20.3 percent. In 2001, by contrast, 
the S&P 500 fell 11.9 percent, and the EAFE foreign stock index had an even 
worse year — falling 21.4 percent.
Indexes also allow you to compare or benchmark the performance of your 
stock market investments. If you invest primarily in large-company Canadian 
stocks, for example, you should compare the overall return of the stocks in 
your portfolio to a comparable index — in this case, the S&P/TSX compos-
ite index. (As we discuss in Chapter 8, index mutual funds, which invest to 
match a major stock market index, offer a cost-effective, proven way to build 
wealth by investing in stocks.)
As we explain in the sidebar “Looking at major stock market indexes,” earlier 
in this chapter, you may also hear about some other types of more narrowly 
focused indexes, including those that track the performance of stocks in par-
ticular industries, such as advertising, banking, computers, pharmaceuticals, 
restaurants, semiconductors, textiles, and utilities. Other indexes cover the 
stock markets of other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, 
France, Hong Kong, and China. Focusing on your investments in the stocks 
of just one or two industries or smaller countries is dangerous due to the 
lack of diversification and your likely lack of expertise in making the diffi-
cult decision about what to invest in and when. As a result, we suggest that 
you ignore these narrower indexes. Many companies, largely out of desire 
for publicity, develop their own indexes. If the news media report on these 
indexes, the index developer effectively obtains free advertising. (In Chapter 
8, we discuss investing strategies, such as those that focus on value stocks or 
growth stocks, which also have market indexes.)
Stock-Buying Methods
When it comes to investing in stocks, many (perhaps too many) choices exist. 
Besides the tens of thousands of stocks among which you can select, you can 
hire a mutual fund manager, invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), put your 
money into hedge funds, or have an investment adviser select for you.

93
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Buying stocks via mutual funds
If you’re busy and suffer no delusions about your expertise, you’ll love the best 
stock mutual funds. Investing in stocks through mutual funds can be as simple 
as dialing a toll-free phone number or logging on to a fund company’s Web site, 
completing some application forms, and zapping them some money.
Recognizing bull and bear markets
If you read magazines or newspapers or listen 
to people talk about the stock market, you often 
hear references to bull markets and bear mar-
kets. You may know which term means a good 
market and which term means a bad market for 
investors, but even if you do, you may wonder 
where these silly terms came from.
It’s hard to find agreement on the origin of these 
terms, but our favourite description comes from 
Robert Claiborne’s Loose Cannons and Red 
Herrings — A Book of Lost Metaphors. The 
term bear, according to Claiborne, originates 
from a proverb that mocks a man who “sells 
the bearskin before catching the bear.” This is 
the connection to the stock market: When deal-
ers in the stock market thought that the market 
became too pricey and speculative, these deal-
ers sold stock that they hadn’t yet “caught” 
(bought). These dealers were labelled “bear-
skin jobbers” and, later, “bears.”
The practice that these bearish dealers 
engaged in is short selling. They hoped that 
when they ultimately bought the stock that they 
had first sold, they could buy it back at a lower 
price. Their profit was the difference between 
the price that they originally sold it for and what 
they later bought it for. Short selling is simply 
investing in reverse: You sell first and buy back 
later. The worst situation for a bear is if prices 
go up, and she must buy back the stock at a high 
price. As Claiborne said, “He who sells what 
isn’t his’n, must buy it back or go to prison.”
The bulls, according to Claiborne, are those 
who work the “other side” of the street. Bulls 
buy stocks with the hope and expectation that 
they will rise in value. Ben Travato, a man whom 
Claiborne describes as one prone to inventing 
colourful, but often inaccurate, etymologies, 
said that bulls toss stocks up in the air with 
their horns.
An alternative explanation for these terms 
comes from the research of economic and 
investment strategist Don Luskin. He says that 
the terms were in use in the early 1700s in the 
financial markets in England, and that they 
derive from the staged fights between wild ani-
mals that were offered as cruel public amuse-
ments at the time. When bulls were pitted 
against bears, the bull fought with an upward 
motion of its horns; the bear fought with a 
downward motion of its paws.

Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
Mutual funds take money invested by people like you, your neighbours, and 
your Aunt Cathy, pool that money, and invest it in a single portfolio of securi-
ties, such as stocks or bonds, that is professionally managed. Stock mutual 
funds, as the name suggests, invest primarily or exclusively in stocks (some 
“stock” funds sometimes invest a bit in other stuff, such as bonds).
 
Stock mutual funds offer many advantages:
 
✓ Diversification: No matter how little you invest in a mutual fund, your 
money is automatically spread out over the dozens if not hundreds of 
individual investments the fund holds. Buying individual stocks on your 
own is relatively costly unless you buy reasonable chunks (100 shares 
or so) of each stock. But in order to buy 100 shares each in, say, a dozen 
companies’ stocks to ensure diversification, you need about $60,000 if 
the stocks that you buy average $50 per share.
 
✓ Professional management: Even if you have big bucks to invest, mutual 
funds offer something that you can’t deliver: professional, full-time 
management. Mutual fund managers peruse a company’s financial state-
ments and otherwise track and analyze a company’s business strategy 
and market position. The best managers put in long hours and possess 
lots of expertise and experience in the field. (If you’ve been misled 
into believing that with minimal effort you can rack up market-beating 
returns by selecting your own stocks, please be sure to read the rest of 
this chapter.)
 
 Look at it this way: Mutual funds are a huge timesaver. It’s Friday 
night — would you rather do some research on semiconductor and 
toilet paper manufacturers, or enjoy dinner or a movie with family and 
friends? (Of course, the answer to that question may depend on who 
your family and friends are!)
 
✓ Low costs — if you pick ’em right: To convince you that mutual funds 
aren’t a good way for you to invest, those with a vested interest, such as 
stock-picking newsletter pundits, may point out the high fees that some 
funds charge. An element of truth rings here: Some funds are expensive, 
charging you 2 percent or more per year in operating expenses on top of 
hefty sales commissions.
 
 But just as you wouldn’t want to invest in a fund that a novice with no 
track record manages, you wouldn’t want to invest in a high-cost fund. 
Contrary to the “You get what you pay for” notion often trumpeted by 
those trying to sell you something at an inflated price, some of the best 
managers are the cheapest to hire. Through a no-load (commission-free) 
mutual fund, you can hire a professional, full-time money manager to 
invest your $10,000 for a mere $50 to $150 per year. And if you have far 
less than this to invest, they’ll still invest your money at a low cost: $5 to 
$15 per year if you invest $1,000.

95
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
 
As with all investments, mutual funds have drawbacks.
 
✓ Control is a problem for some investors. If you’re a controlaholic, turning 
over your investment dollars to a seemingly black-box process where 
others decide when and in what to invest your money may unnerve you. 
However, you need to be more concerned about the potential blunders 
that you may make investing in individual stocks of your own choosing or, 
even worse, those stocks pitched to you by an investment adviser.
 
✓ Taxes are another concern when you invest in mutual funds outside 
retirement plans. Because the fund manager, not you, decides when 
to sell specific stock holdings, some funds may produce relatively high 
levels of taxable distributions. Fear not — simply select tax-friendly 
funds if taxes concern you.
In Chapter 8, we discuss investing in the best mutual funds that offer a time- 
and cost-efficient, high-quality way to invest in stocks worldwide.
Using exchange-traded funds
Exchange-trade funds (ETFs) are the new kid on the block, certainly in com-
parison to mutual funds. ETFs are similar to mutual funds, specifically index 
funds (see Chapter 8), in many ways, except that they trade on a stock 
exchange. The chief attraction is those ETFs that offer investors the poten-
tial for even lower operating expenses than comparable mutual funds. We 
expand on ETFs and explain which ones to consider using in Chapter 8.
Using hedge funds
Like mutual funds, hedge funds are pools of money invested by a manager or 
managers on behalf of investors. But that’s where the similarities end. Much 
less regulated, hedge funds face nowhere near the same amount of rules and 
oversight mutual funds must comply with. Securities regulators also allow 
hedge funds to undertake a much wider range of investing activities. This 
includes the use of leverage, as well as trying to profit from the fall in value 
of investments through short-selling. As a result, in order to invest in a hedge 
fund, investors typically are required to make a large initial investment. What’s 
more, investors may have to have a net worth of $1 million or more, and may 
have to make a certain amount in income each year. However, hedge funds 
typically charge steep fees — a 1.0 to 1.5 percent annual management fee plus 
a 20 percent cut of the annual fund returns. More importantly, there’s no proof 
that hedge funds as a group perform any better than mutual funds. In fact, a 
number of objective studies that we’ve reviewed show inferior hedge fund 
returns, which makes sense. Those high hedge fund fees depress their returns.

Selecting individual stocks
More than a few investment books suggest and enthusiastically encourage 
people like you to do their own stock picking. However, the vast majority of 
people are better off not picking their own stocks.
We’ve long been advocates of people educating themselves and taking respon-
sibility for their own financial affairs, but taking responsibility for your own 
finances doesn’t mean that you should do everything yourself. Table 5-1 
includes some thoughts to consider about choosing your own stocks.
Table 5-1 
The Pros and Cons of Buying Your Own Stocks
Good Reasons to Pick 
Your Own Stocks
Bad Reasons to Pick Your Own Stocks
You enjoy the challenge.
You think you can beat the best money 
managers. (If you can, you’re in the wrong 
profession!)
You want to learn more about 
business.
You want more control over your investments, 
which you think may happen if you under-
stand the companies that you invest in.
You possess a substantial amount 
of money to invest.
You think that mutual funds are for people 
who aren’t smart enough to choose their 
own stocks.
You’re a buy-and-hold investor.
You’re attracted to the ability to trade your 
stocks any time you want.
Some popular investing books try to convince investors that they can do a better 
job than the professionals at picking their own stocks. Amateur investors, how-
ever, need to devote a lot of study to become proficient at stock selection. 
Many professional investors work 60, 70, or even 80 hours a week at invest-
ing. It’s unlikely that you’re willing to spend that much time on it. Don’t let 
the popularity of those do-it-yourself stock-picking books lead you astray.
 
Choosing a stock isn’t as simple as visiting a restaurant chain (or buying a pair 
of shoes or an iGadget), liking it, buying its stock, and then sitting back and 
getting rich watching your stock zoom to the moon.

97
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
If you invest in stocks, we think you know by now that guarantees don’t exist. 
But as in many of life’s endeavours, you can buy individual stocks in good 
and not-so-good ways. In Chapter 6, we explain how to research and trade 
individual stocks.
Spotting the Best Times to Buy and Sell
Now that you know about the different types of stock markets and ways to 
invest in stocks, you may wonder how you can build wealth with stocks and 
not lose your shirt. Nobody wants to buy stocks before the markets take a big 
drop (which we discuss in Chapter 2). Thousands of books have been written 
about how to get rich in the stock market by buying the best stocks cheaply 
and selling them when they become expensive.
As we discuss in Chapter 4, the stock market is reasonably efficient. A company’s 
stock price normally reflects many smart people’s assessments as to what 
is a fair price. Thus, it’s not realistic for an investor to expect to discover a 
system for how to “buy low and sell high.”
A few rare professional investors may obtain an ability for spotting good 
times to buy and sell particular stocks, but consistently doing so is enor-
mously difficult. In fact, the investing public doesn’t possess a great track 
record with buying low and selling high. Smaller investors tend to sell heavily 
after major declines and step up buying after major price increases.
 
The simplest and best way to make money in the stock market is to consistently 
and regularly feed new money into building a diversified and larger portfolio. If 
the market drops, you can use your new investment dollars to buy more shares. 
The danger of trying to time the market is that you may be “out” of the market 
when it appreciates greatly and “in” the market when it plummets.
Calculating price/earnings ratios
Suppose we tell you that Liz’s Distinctive Jewellery’s stock sells for $50 per 
share, and another stock in the same industry, The Jazzy Jeweller, sells for 
$100. Which would you rather buy?
If you answer, “I don’t have a clue because you didn’t give me enough infor-
mation,” go to the head of the class! On its own, the price per share of stock 
is meaningless.

98
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
Although The Jazzy Jeweller sells for twice as much per share, its profits 
might also be twice as much per share — in which case, The Jazzy Jeweller 
stock price may not be out of line given its profitability. The level of a com-
pany’s stock price relative to its earnings or profits per share helps you cali-
brate how expensively, cheaply, or fairly a stock price is valued.
Stock price per share
Annual earnings per share
= Price/earnings (P/E) ratio
Over the long term, stock prices and corporate profits tend to move in sync, 
like good dance partners. The price/earnings (P/E) ratio (say “P E” — the “/” 
isn’t pronounced) compares the level of stock prices to the level of corporate 
profits, giving you a good sense of the stock’s value. Over shorter periods 
of time, investors’ emotions as well as fundamentals move stocks, but over 
longer terms, fundamentals possess a far greater influence on stock prices. 
P/E ratios can be calculated for individual stocks as well as for entire stock 
indexes, portfolios, or funds.
A particular price level in and of itself is meaningless, like a given stock (such 
as RIM) that rises above a specific price (such as $100 per share). The level 
of a stock’s price, or a stock market index, is important and meaningful when 
you compare it with earnings for the company or companies in the stock 
market index.
Over the past 100-plus years, the P/E ratio of stocks has averaged around 15. 
During times of low inflation, the ratio has tended to be higher — in the high 
teens to low 20s. As we cautioned in the first edition of this book, published 
in 2000, the P/E ratio for stocks got into the 30s, well above historic norms 
even for a period of low inflation. Thus, the down market that began that year 
wasn’t surprising, especially given the fall in corporate profits that put even 
more pressure on stock prices.
Just because stocks have historically averaged P/E ratios of about 15 doesn’t 
mean that every individual stock will trade at such a P/E. Here’s why: 
Suppose that you have a choice between investing in two companies, Superb 
Software, which makes computer software, and Tortoise Technologies, which 
makes typewriters. If both companies’ stocks sell at a P/E of 15 and Superb 
Software’s business and profits grow 40 percent per year and Tortoise’s busi-
ness and profits remain flat, which would you buy?
Because both stocks trade at a P/E of 15, Superb Software appears to be the 
better buy. Even if Superb’s stock continues to sell at 15 times the earnings, 
its stock price should increase 40 percent per year as its profits increase. 
Faster-growing companies usually command higher price/earnings ratios.

99
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
 
Just because a stock price or an entire stock market seems to be at a high 
price level doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock or market is overpriced. 
Always compare the price of a stock to that company’s profits per share or 
the overall market’s price level to overall corporate profits. The price/earn-
ings ratio captures this comparison. Faster-growing and more-profitable com-
panies generally sell for a premium — higher P/E ratios. Also remember that 
future earnings, which are difficult to predict, influence stock prices more 
than current earnings, which are old news.
Citing times of speculative excess
Because the financial markets move on the financial realities of the economy 
as well as people’s expectations and emotions (particularly fear and greed), 
we don’t believe that you should try to time the markets. Knowing when to 
buy and sell is much harder than you think.
 
Be careful that you don’t get sucked into investing lots of your money in 
aggressive investments that seem to be in a hyped state. In fact, many people 
don’t become aware of an investment until it receives lots of attention. By the 
time everyone else talks about an investment, it’s often nearing or at its peak. 
In the sections that follow, we walk you through some of the biggest specula-
tive bubbles. Although some of these examples are from prior decades and 
even centuries, we chose these examples because we find that they best teach 
the warning signs and dangers of speculative fever times.
The Internet and technology bubble
Unless you’ve isolated yourself from what we call civilization, you’ve surely 
heard about the explosive growth in the Internet . . . and the Internet stock 
bubble. In the mid-1990s, a number of Internet-based companies launched 
initial public offerings of stock. (We discuss IPOs in Chapter 4.) Most of the 
early Internet company stock offerings failed to really catch fire. By the late 
1990s, however, some of these stocks began meteoric rises.
The bigger-name Internet stocks included companies such as Internet ser-
vice provider America Online, bookseller and online retailer Amazon.com, 
Internet auctioneer eBay, and Internet portal Yahoo! As with the leading new 
consumer product manufacturers of the 1920s that we discuss in “The 1920s’ 
consumer spending binge” section later in this chapter, many of the leading 
Internet companies’ stocks zoomed to the moon. Note that in the late 1990s, 
the absolute stock price per share of these companies was meaningless — 
the P/E ratio is what mattered. Valuing Internet stocks based on earnings 
posed a challenge because many of these companies were losing money or 
just beginning to make money. Some Wall Street analysts, therefore, valued 
Internet stocks based on revenue and not profits.

100
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
 
Valuing a stock based on revenue and not profits can be highly dangerous. 
Revenues don’t necessarily translate into high profits — or any profits at all.
In the case of Amazon.com, its stock price soared in early 1999 to $221 per 
share, which gave the company’s stock a total market valuation in excess 
of $35 billion, or more than 12 times that of competing bookseller Barnes & 
Noble. B&N had prior-year sales of nearly $3 billion compared with Amazon.
com’s approximate $400 million in sales as it was losing money! At its low 
in 2001, Amazon’s market value had fallen nearly 95 percent to less than $2 
billion, very nearly the same valuation that Barnes & Noble had at that time. 
(Since its low in 2001, Amazon’s stock value has bounced back — but it was 
recently valued at $18 billion, which still represents almost a 50 percent 
decline since its 1999 peak.)
Amazon.com, eBay, and other current leading Internet companies may go 
on to become some of the great companies and stocks of future decades. 
However, consider this perspective from veteran money manager David 
Dreman. “The Internet stocks are getting hundredfold more attention from 
investors than, say, a Ford Motor in chat rooms online and elsewhere. People 
are fascinated with the Internet — many individual investors have accounts 
on margin. Back in the early 1900s, there were hundreds of auto manufactur-
ers, and it was hard to know who the long-term survivors would be. The cur-
rent leaders won’t probably be long-term winners.”
Internet stocks weren’t the only stocks being swept to excessive prices rela-
tive to their earnings at the dawn of the new millennium. Various traditional 
retailers announced the opening of Internet sites to sell their goods, and 
within days their stock prices doubled or tripled. Also, leading name-brand 
technology companies, such as Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Lucent, and 
PeopleSoft, traded at P/E ratios in excess of 100. Companies in other indus-
tries, like investment brokerage firm Charles Schwab, which expanded to 
offer Internet services, saw their stock price balloon to push their P/E ratio 
over 100. As during the 1960s and 1920s, name-brand growth companies 
soared to high P/E valuations. For example, coffee purveyor Starbucks at 
times had a P/E near 100.
 
What we find troubling about the way investors piled into the leading name-
brand stocks, especially in Internet and technology-related fields, is that many 
of these investors didn’t even know what a price/earnings ratio was and why it 
was important. Before you invest in any individual stock, no matter how great 
a company you think it is, you need to understand the company’s line of busi-
ness, strategies, competitors, financial statements, and price/earnings ratio 
versus the competition, among many other issues. Selecting and monitoring 
good companies take lots of research, time, and discipline.
 
Also, remember that if a company taps into a product line or way of doing 
business that proves highly successful, that company’s success invites lots of 
competition. So you need to understand the barriers to entry that a leading 

101
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
company has erected and how difficult or easy it is for competitors to join the 
fray. Also, be wary of analysts’ predictions about earnings and stock prices. 
As more and more investment banking analysts initiated coverage of Internet 
companies and issued buy ratings on their stocks, investors bought more 
shares. Analysts, who are too optimistic (as shown in numerous independent 
studies), have a conflict of interest: The investment banks they work for seek 
to cultivate the business (new stock and bond issues) of the very companies 
they purport to rate and analyze. The analysts who say “Buy, buy, buy all 
the current market leaders” are the same analysts who generate much new 
business for their investment banks and get the lucrative job offers and multi-
million-dollar annual salaries.
 
Simply buying today’s rising and analyst-recommended stocks often leads to 
future investor disappointment. If the company’s growth slows or the profits 
don’t materialize as expected, the underlying stock price can nose-dive. This 
happened to investors who piled into the stock of computer disk-drive maker 
Iomega back in early 1996. After a spectacular rise to about $27½ per share, 
the company fell on tough times. Iomega stock subsequently plunged to less 
than $3 per share. This stock probably won’t recover to its early 1996 price 
levels for many more years.
Presstek, a company that uses computer technology for so-called direct imag-
ing systems, rose from less than $10 per share in mid-1994 to nearly $100 per 
share just two years later — another example of supposed can’t-lose technol-
ogy that crashed and burned. As was the case with Iomega, herds of novice 
investors jumped on the Presstek bandwagon simply because they believed 
the stock price would keep rising. By 1999, less than three years after hitting 
nearly $100 per share, the stock plunged more than 90 percent to about $5 
per share. It’s been recently trading at around $10 per share.
ATC Communications, which was similar to Iomega, plunged by more than 80 
percent in a matter of months before the Fools recommended selling.
The Japanese stock market juggernaut
Lest you think that the United States cornered the market on manias, over-
seas examples abound. A rather extraordinary mania happened not so long 
ago in the Japanese stock market.
After Japan’s crushing defeat in World War II, its economy was in shambles. 
Two major cities — Hiroshima and Nagasaki — were destroyed, and more 
than 200,000 died when the United States dropped atomic bombs.
Out of the rubble, Japan emerged a strengthened nation that became an eco-
nomic powerhouse. Over the course of 22 years, from 1967 to 1989, Japanese 
stock prices rose an amazing 30-fold (3,000 percent) as the economy boomed. 
From 1983 to 1989 alone, Japanese stocks soared more than 500 percent.

102
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
In terms of the U.S. dollar, the Japanese stock market rise was all the more 
stunning, as the dollar lost value versus Japan’s currency, the yen. The dollar 
lost about 65 percent of its value during the big run-up in Japanese stocks. 
In dollar terms, the Japanese stock market rose an astonishing 8,300 percent 
from 1967 to 1989.
 
Many considered an investment in Japanese stocks to be close to a sure thing. 
Increasing numbers of people became full-time stock market investors in 
Japan. Many of these folks were actually speculators because they relied heav-
ily on borrowed funds. As the Japanese real estate market boomed in tandem 
with the stock market, real estate investors borrowed from their winnings to 
invest in stocks and vice versa.
Borrowing heavily was easy to do; Japan’s banks were awash in cash, and it 
was cheap, cheap, cheap to borrow. Investors could borrow money for an 
interest rate of a mere few percent. “Established investors” could make prop-
erty purchases with no money down. Cash abounded from real estate as the 
price of land in Tokyo, for example, soared 500 percent from 1985 to 1990. 
Despite the fact that Japan has only @@bf1/25 as much land as the United States, 
Japan’s total land values at the close of the 1980s were four times that of all 
the land in the United States.
Speculators also used futures and options (discussed in Chapter 1) to gamble 
on higher short-term Japanese stock market prices. (Interestingly, Japan 
doesn’t allow selling short.)
Price/earnings ratios? Forget about it. To justify the high prices they paid 
for stocks, Japanese market speculators pointed out that the real estate that 
many companies owned was soaring to the moon and making companies 
more valuable.
Price/earnings ratios on the Japanese market soared during the early 1980s 
and ballooned to more than 60 times earnings by 1987. As we point out else-
where in this chapter, such lofty P/E ratios were sometimes awarded beloved 
stocks in Canada and the United States. But the entire Japanese stock market, 
which included many mediocre and not-so-hot companies, possessed P/E 
ratios of 60-plus!
When Japan’s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone went public in February 
1987, it met such frenzied enthusiasm that its stock price was soon bid up 
to a stratospheric 300-plus price/earnings ratio. At the close of 1989, Japan’s 
stock market, for the first time in history, unseated the U.S. stock market in 
total market value of all stocks. And this feat happened despite the fact that 
the total output of the Japanese economy was less than half that of the U.S. 
economy.

103
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Even some North American observers began to lose sight of the big picture 
and added to the rationalizations for why the high levels of Japanese stocks 
were justified. After all, it was reasoned, Japanese companies and execu-
tives were a tightly knit and closed circle, investing heavily in the stocks of 
other companies that they did business with. The supply of stock for outside 
buyers was thus limited as companies sat on their shares.
Corporate stock ownership went further, though, as stock prices were some-
times manipulated. Speculators gobbled up the bulk of outstanding shares of 
small companies and traded shares back and forth with others whom they 
partnered with to drive up prices. Company pension plans began to place all 
(as in 100 percent) of their employees’ retirement money in stocks with the 
expectation that stock prices would always keep going up.
The collapse of the Japanese stock market was swift. After peaking at the 
end of 1989, the Tokyo market fell nearly 50 percent in the first nine months 
of 1990 alone. By the middle of 1992, the worst of the damage was over, with 
Japanese stocks down nearly 65 percent — a drop that the U.S. market hasn’t 
experienced since the Great Depression. However, prices stagnated during 
the rest of the 1990s and then fell again in the early 2000s, finally reaching a 
bottom in 2003 that was more than 80 percent lower than the peak reached 
nearly 15 years prior. Japanese investors who borrowed lost everything and 
sometimes more. The total loss in stock market value was about $3 trillion, 
about the size of the entire Japanese annual output.
Several factors finally led to the pricking of the Japanese stock market 
bubble. Japanese monetary authorities tightened credit as inflation started to 
creep upward and concern increased over real estate market speculation. As 
interest rates began to rise, investors soon realized that they could earn 15 
times more interest from a safe bond versus the paltry yield on stocks.
As interest rates rose and credit tightened, speculators were squeezed first. 
Real estate and stock market speculators began to sell their investments to 
pay off mounting debts. Higher interest rates, less-available credit, and the 
already grossly inflated prices greatly limited the pool of potential stock 
buyers. The falling stock and real estate markets fed off each other. Investor 
losses in one market triggered more selling and price drops in the other. The 
real estate price drop was equally severe — registering 50 to 60 percent or 
more in most parts of Japan after the late 1980s.
The 1960s weren’t just about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll
North American stock markets mirrored the cultural climate during this 
decade of change and upheaval. There were good years and bad years, but 
overall, the stock market gained. Unfortunately, most investors who were 
old enough to remember what happened to the stock market during the 

104
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
Great Depression were retired or had passed away. The majority of investors 
during the 1960s were born after the go-go years of the 1920s or were still 
sucking on a pacifier in the 1920s.
During the 1960s, consumer product companies’ stocks were quite popular 
and were bid up to stratospheric valuations. When we say “stratospheric 
valuations,” we mean that some stock prices were high relative to the compa-
nies’ earnings — our old friend, the price/earnings (P/E) ratio. Investors had 
seen such stock prices rise for many years and thought that the good times 
would never end.
Take the case of Avon Products, which sells cosmetics door to door, primarily 
with an army of women. During the late 1960s, Avon’s stock regularly sold at 
a P/E of 50 to 70 times earnings. (Remember, the market average is about 15.) 
After trading as high as $140 per share in the early 1970s, Avon’s stock took 
more than two decades to return to that price level. Remember that during this 
time period the overall U.S. stock market rose more than tenfold!
 
When a stock such as Avon’s sells at such a high multiple of earnings, two 
factors can lead to a bloodletting:
 
✓ First, the company’s profits may continue to grow, but investors may 
decide that the stock isn’t such a great long-term investment after all 
and not worth, say, a P/E of 60. Consider that if investors decide it’s 
worth only a P/E of 30 (still a hefty P/E), the stock price would drop 50 
percent to cut the P/E in half.
 
✓ The second shoe that can drop is the company’s profits or earnings. If 
profits fall, say, 20 percent, as Avon’s did during the 1974–1975 recession, 
the stock price will fall 20 percent, even if it continued to sell for 60 times 
its earnings. But when earnings drop, investors’ willingness to pay an 
inflated P/E plummets along with the earnings. So when Avon’s profits 
finally did drop, the P/E that investors were willing to pay plunged to 9 — 
in less than two years, Avon’s stock price thus dropped nearly 87 percent!
Avon wasn’t alone in its stock price soaring to a rather high multiple of its 
earnings in the 1960s and early 1970s. Well-known companies such as Black & 
Decker, Eastman Kodak, Kmart (used to be called S.S. Kresge in those days), 
and Polaroid sold for 60 to as much as 100 times earnings. All these compa-
nies, like Avon, sell today at about the same or at a lower price than they 
achieved decades ago. Many other well-known and smaller companies sold at 
similar and even more outrageous premiums to earnings.
The 1920s’ consumer spending binge
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared nearly 500 percent in a mere eight 
years (from 1921 to 1929, one of the best bull market runs for the U.S. stock 
market). The country and investors had good reason for economic optimism. 
“New” devices — telephones, cars, radios, and all sorts of electric appliances —

105
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
were making their way into the mass market. The stock price of RCA, the 
radio manufacturer, for example, ballooned 5,700 percent during this eight-
year stretch.
Speculation in the stock market moved from Wall Street to Main Street. 
Investors during the 1920s were able to borrow lots of money to buy stock 
through margin borrowing. You can still margin borrow today — for every 
dollar that you put up, you may borrow an additional dollar to buy stock. At 
times during the 1920s, investors were able to borrow up to nine dollars for 
every dollar that they had in hand. The amount of margin loans outstand-
ing swelled from $1 billion in the early 1920s to more than $8 billion in 1929. 
When the market plunged, margin calls forced margin borrowers to sell their 
stock, thus exacerbating the decline.
The steep run-up in stock prices was also due in part to market manipulation. 
Investment pools used to buy stock from and sell stock to one another, thus 
generating high trading volume in a stock, which made it appear that interest 
in the stock was great. Also in cahoots with pool operators were writers who 
dispensed enthusiastic prognostications about said stock. (Reforms later 
passed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission addressed these 
problems.)
Not only were members of the public largely enthusiastic, so too were the 
supposed experts. After a small decline in September 1929, economist Irving 
Fisher said in mid-October, “Stock prices have reached what looks like a per-
manently high plateau.” High? Yes! Permanent plateau? Investors wish!
On October 25, 1929, just days before all heck began breaking loose, President 
Herbert Hoover said, “The fundamental business of the country . . . is on a 
sound and prosperous basis.” Days later, multimillionaire oil tycoon John D. 
Rockefeller said, “Believing that fundamental conditions of the country are 
sound . . . my son and I have for some days been purchasing sound common 
stocks.”
By December of that same year, the stock market had dropped by more 
than 35 percent. General Electric President Owen D. Young said at that time, 
“Those who voluntarily sell stocks at current prices are extremely foolish.”
Well, actually not. By the time the crash had run its course, the market had 
plunged 89 percent in value in less than three years.
The economy went into a tailspin. Unemployment soared to more than 25 
percent of the labour force. Companies entered this period with excess 
inventories, which mushroomed further when people slashed their spending. 
Tariffs stifled exports. Thousands of banks failed, because early bank failures 
triggered “runs” on other banks. (Government insurance on financial institu-
tions didn’t exist in those days.)

Psychologically, it’s easier for many people to buy stocks after the stocks have 
had a huge increase in price. Just as you shouldn’t attempt to drive your car 
looking solely through your rearview mirror, basing investments solely on 
past performance usually leads novice investors into overpriced investments. 
If many people talk about the stunning rise in the market, and new investors 
pile in based on the expectation of hefty profits, tread carefully.
We’re not saying that you need to sell your current stock holdings if you see 
an investment market getting frothy and speculative. As long as you diversify 
your stocks worldwide and hold other investments, such as real estate and 
bonds, the stocks that you hold in one market need to be only a fraction of 
your total holdings. Timing the markets is difficult: You can never know how 
Manias in prior centuries
We could fill an entire book with modern-day 
stock market manias. But bear with us as we 
roll back the clocks a couple of centuries to 
observe other market manias, the first being 
England’s so-called South Seas bubble of 
1719. South Seas wasn’t the kind of company 
that would’ve met today’s socially respon-
sible investor’s needs. Initially, the South Seas 
Company focused on the African slave trade, 
but too many slaves died in transit, so it wasn’t 
a lucrative business.
If you think government corruption is a prob-
lem today, consider what politicians of those 
days did without the scrutiny of a widely read 
press. King George backed the South Seas 
Company and acted as its governor. Politicos 
in Parliament bought tons of stock in the South 
Seas Company and even rammed through 
Parliament a provision that allowed investors to 
buy stock on borrowed money. The stock of the 
South Seas Company soared from about £120 
to more than £1,000 in just the first six months 
of 1720.
After such an enormous run-up, insiders real-
ized that the stock price was greatly inflated 
and quietly bailed. Citizens fell all over them-
selves to get into this surefire moneymaker. 
Other seafaring companies pursued the South 
Seas trade business, so the greedy politicians 
passed a law that allowed only government-
approved companies to pursue trade. The 
stocks of these other companies tumbled, and 
investor losses led to a chain reaction that 
prompted selling of the South Seas Company 
stock, which plunged more than 80 percent by 
the autumn of that same year.
Unfortunately, England wasn’t the only 
European country that was swept up in an 
investment mania. Probably the most famous 
mania of them all was the tulip bulb (yes, those 
flowers that you can plant in your own home 
garden). A botany professor introduced tulips 
into Holland from Turkey in the late 1500s. A 
fascination with these bulbs among residents 
turned into an investment feeding frenzy.
At their speculative peak, the price of a single 
tulip bulb was the equivalent of more than 
$10,000 in today’s dollars. Many people sold 
their land holdings to buy more. Documented 
cases show that people traded a bulb for a 
dozen acres of land! Labourers cut back on 
their work to invest. Eventually, tulip bulb prices 
came crashing back to earth. A trip to your local 
nursery shows you what a bulb sells for today.

107
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
high is high and when it’s time to sell, and then how low is low and when it’s 
time to buy. And if you sell non-retirement plan investments at a profit, you 
end up sacrificing some of the profit to taxes.
Buy more when stocks are “on sale”
 
Along with speculative buying frenzies come valleys of pessimism when stock 
prices fall sharply. Having the courage to buy when stock prices are “on sale” 
can pay big returns.
The 1970s’ stock sale
In the early 1970s, interest rates and inflation escalated. Oil prices shot up as 
the oil embargo choked off supplies, and Americans had to wait in long lines 
for gas. Gold prices soared, and the U.S. dollar plunged in value on foreign cur-
rency markets. Canada was coping with the kidnappings of the October Crisis.
If the economic problems weren’t enough to make most everyone gloomy, 
the U.S. political system hit an all-time low during this period as well. Vice 
President Spiro Agnew resigned in disgrace under a cloud of tax-evasion 
charges; then Watergate led to President Richard Nixon’s August 1974 resig-
nation, the first presidential resignation in our history.
When all was sold and done, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 
more than 45 percent from early 1973 until late 1974. The Toronto Stock 
Exchange dropped alongside the U.S. markets, falling 38 percent. Among the 
stocks that fell the hardest were those that had been most popular and sell-
ing at extreme multiples of earnings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. (See 
the section “The 1960s weren’t just about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll,” earlier 
in this chapter.)
Take a gander at Table 5-2 to see the drops in some well-known companies 
and how cheaply these stocks were valued relative to corporate profits (look 
at the P/E ratios) after the worst market drop since the Great Depression.

Those who were too terrified to buy stocks in the mid-1970s actually had 
plenty of time to get on board and take advantage of the buying opportunities. 
The U.S. stock market did have a powerful rally and, from its 1974 low, rose 
nearly 80 percent over the next two years. But over the next half-dozen years, 
the market backpedalled, losing much of its gains. The mid- to late 1970s was 
also a good time to take advantage of bargain prices on many Canadian stocks. 
From a low in late 1974, the TSE 300 climbed steadily to the end of the decade, 
rising 193 percent.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, inflation continued to escalate well into 
double digits. Corporate profits declined further, and unemployment rose 
higher than in the 1974 recession. Although some stocks dropped, others 
simply treaded water and went sideways for years after major declines in the 
mid-1970s. As some companies’ profits increased, P/E bargains abounded (as 
shown in Table 5-3).

When bad news and pessimism abound and the stock market has dropped, it’s 
actually a much safer and better time to buy stocks. You may even consider 
shifting some of your money out of your safer investments, such as bonds, and 
invest more aggressively in stocks. Most investors understandably feel — and 
worry — during these times that prices can drop further, but if you buy and 
wait, you’ll be amply rewarded. Most of the stocks listed in the last several 
pages appreciated 500 to 2,500-plus percent over the next couple of decades.

The 2008 subprime crisis
At the time this book was going to the printers, stock markets worldwide 
had plummeted due to the lending and banking crisis in the United States. 
Rewarded by ever-increasing fees — and huge bonuses to the head honchos — 
lenders went crazy offering money to American consumers. Mortgages covering 
the full amount of their home purchases were regularly made available to 
homebuyers who only a few years earlier wouldn’t have qualified to borrow 
75 percent of the value. When house prices rose, consumers used that new 
equity in their property to borrow even more. Wall Street, meanwhile, got in 
on the action, and began turning those mortgages into tradeable investment 
securities. Along the way, the finance whizzes somehow decreed that these 
bundles of shaky mortgages were now low-risk investments.
The end of this sorry mess came quickly and painfully. When house prices 
fell instead of rose, many homeowners found they could no longer afford 
their mortgage payments and defaulted on their loans. (Some homeowners 
had bought at peak prices, and borrowed the full cost of their home. But 
when housing prices dropped, they found themselves unable to refinance.) 
Overnight, it seemed, the associated bundles of mortgages that insurance 
companies and investment dealerships were busy trading and marketing 
turned sour. In a matter of weeks, previously major-league players in the 
insurance, mortgage, and brokerage worlds had collapsed or were desper-
ately looking for bailouts.
The larger economy soon hit the ropes. Lenders, once so anxious to lend 
money to just about anybody who asked, were suddenly terrified, unsure 
about who really had the financial stability to be a safe bet for a loan. Credit 
is the oil that keeps businesses chugging along, and when that dried up, so 
too did the economies around the world.
By the fall of 2008, North American markets had fallen by over 40 percent. 
The Japanese market had dropped 46 percent, while the Hong Kong market 
had lost 65 percent of its value. The London stock exchange was down 45 
percent, and the German market had dropped by almost 50 percent.
The events of 2008 posed very serious challenges. The financial industry 
managed to blow itself up and sideswipe the economy with it. But stock 
markets typically overshoot the mark, driven by the two extreme emotions 
of investors: fear and greed. It’s impossible to tell in the short term what will 
happen to the markets, and 2008 was no different. At the time of writing, we 
wouldn’t dream of hazarding a guess as to whether the lows reached late in 
2008 were setting the stage for more stable markets and possibly a recovery, 
or if many more violent drops are still ahead. But selling most or all of your 
stocks after dramatic market plunges has largely proved to be a bad idea.
Table 5-4 and Table 5-5 show just how far some large and well-known U.S. and 
Canadian companies had fallen by late 2008. The charts also show how 

111
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
relatively inexpensive these stocks were in terms of their price/earnings ratios. 
It’s highly likely that a few years after 2008, investors will once again look back 
and realize that it was a good time to go shopping for stocks on the cheap.

Avoiding Problematic Stock 
Buying Practices
 
You may be curious about other ways to buy individual stocks, but if we list 
those methods in this section, it’s because we don’t recommend using them. 
You can greatly increase your chances of success and earn higher returns if 
you avoid the commonly made stock investing mistakes that we present in 
this section.
Beware of investment advisers’ 
conflicts of interest
Some investors invest in individual stocks through an investment adviser who 
earns a living from commissions. The standard pitch of these firms and their 
investment advisers is that they maintain research departments that monitor 
and report on stocks. Their advisers, using this research, tell you when to 
buy, sell, or hold. Sounds good in theory, but this system has significant 
problems.

113
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
 
Many investment dealers happen to be in another business that creates 
enormous conflicts of interest in producing objective company reviews. You 
see, these investment firms also solicit companies to help them sell new 
stock and bond issues. To gain this business, the investment dealers need to 
demonstrate enthusiasm and optimism for the company’s future prospects.
Investment analysts who, with the best of intentions, write negative reports 
about a company, find their careers hindered in a variety of ways. Some firms 
fire such analysts. Companies that the analysts criticize sometimes exclude 
the analysts from analyst meetings about the company. Analysts who know 
what’s good for their careers and their investment dealers don’t write disap-
proving reports.
Although investment insiders know that analysts are overly optimistic, little 
documented proof about this fact exists, and few people are willing to talk on 
the record about it. One firm got caught encouraging its analysts via a memo 
not to say negative things about companies. As uncovered by Wall Street 
Journal reporter Michael Siconolfi, Morgan Stanley’s head of new stock issues 
stated in a memo that the firm’s policy needed to include “no negative com-
ments about our clients.” The memo also stated that any analyst’s changes 
in a stock’s rating or investment opinion, “which might be viewed negatively” 
by the firm’s clients, had to be cleared through the company’s corporate 
finance department head!
Various studies of the investment dealer’s stock ratings have conclusively 
demonstrated that from a predictive perspective, most of its research is 
barely worth the cost of the paper it’s printed on. In Chapter 6, we recom-
mend independent research reports that beat the investment dealer industry 
track record hands down. In Chapter 9, we cover the important issues you 
need to consider when you select a good investment adviser.
Don’t day trade or short-term trade
Unfortunately (for themselves), some investors track their stock investments 
closely and believe that they need to sell after short holding periods —months, 
weeks, or even days. With the growth of Internet and computerized trading, 
such shortsightedness took a turn for the worse with more investors engaging in 
a foolish process known as day trading, where you buy and sell a stock within the 
same day!

114
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
 
If you hold a stock only for a few hours or a few months, you’re not investing; 
you’re gambling. Specifically, the numerous drawbacks that we see to short-
term trading include the following:
 
✓ Higher trading costs: Although the commission that you pay to trade 
stocks has declined greatly in recent years, especially through online 
trading (which we discuss in Chapter 9), the more you trade, the more 
of your investment dollars go into an investment adviser’s wallet. 
Commissions are like taxes — once collected, your dollars are forever 
gone, and your return is reduced. Similarly, the spread between what 
you pay to purchase a stock and the price you would receive to sell the 
same stock (known as the bid-ask spread) can be a significant drag on 
your investment return.
 
✓ More taxes (and tax headaches): When you invest outside of tax-
sheltered retirement plans, you must track and report every time that 
you buy and then sell a stock on your annual income tax return. And 
if you make a profit, you must part with a good portion of it through 
the capital gains tax that you owe on your profits when you sell your 
stock. The return that you keep (after taxes) is more important than 
the return that you make (before taxes).
 
✓ Lower returns: If stocks increase in value over time, long-term buy-and-
hold investors will enjoy the fruits of the stock’s appreciation. However, 
when you jump in and out of stocks, your money spends a good deal of 
time not invested in stocks. The overall level of stock prices in general, 
and individual stock prices in particular, sometimes rises sharply during 
short periods of time. Thus, day traders and other short-term traders 
inevitably miss some stock run-ups. The best professional investors 
we know don’t engage in short-term trading for this reason (as well as 
because of the increased transaction costs and taxes that such trading 
inevitably generates).
 
✓ Lost opportunities: Most of the short-term traders we’ve met over the 
years spend inordinate amounts of time researching and monitoring 
their investments. During the late 1990s, we began to hear of more and 
more people who quit their jobs so they could manage their investment 
portfolio full time! Some of the firms that sell day-trading seminars tell 
you that you can make a living trading stocks. Your time is clearly worth 
something. Put your valuable time into working a little more on build-
ing your own business or career instead of using all those extra hours 
each day and week to watch your investments like a hawk, which usually 
hampers rather than enhances your returns.
 
✓ Poorer relationships: Time is our most precious commodity. In addition 
to the financial opportunities you lose when you indulge in unproduc-
tive trading, you need to consider the personal consequences. Like 
drinking, smoking, and gambling, short-term trading is often an addictive 
behaviour. Spouses of day traders and other short-term traders report 

115
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
unhappiness over how much more time and attention their mates spend 
on their investments than their families. And what about the lack of 
attention that day traders and short-term traders give friends and other 
relatives? (See the sidebar “Recognizing an investment-gambling problem” 
in this chapter to help determine whether you or a loved one has a 
gambling addiction.)
How a given stock performs in the next few hours, days, weeks, or even months 
may have little to do with the underlying financial health and vitality of the 
company’s business. In addition to short-term swings in investor emotions, 
unpredictable events (the emergence of a new technology or competitor, 
analyst predictions, changes in government regulation, and so on) push 
stocks one way or another for short periods of time.
 
As we say throughout this part of the book, stocks are intended to be long-
term holdings. You shouldn’t buy stocks if you don’t plan on holding them for 
at least five years or more — and preferably seven to ten. When stocks suffer a 
setback, it may take months or even years for them to come back.
Don’t buy penny stocks
 
Even worse than buying stocks through an investment adviser whose com-
pensation depends on what you buy and how often you trade is purchasing 
penny stocks through investment advisers that specialize in such stocks. Tens 
of thousands of smaller-company stocks trade on the over-the-counter market. 
Some of these companies are quite small and sport low prices per share that 
range from pennies to several dollars, hence the name penny stocks.
Here’s how penny-stock investment advisers typically work. Many of these 
firms purchase prospect lists of people who have demonstrated a propen-
sity for buying other lousy investments by phone. Advisers are taught to 
first introduce themselves by phone and then call back shortly thereafter 
with a tremendous sense of urgency about a great opportunity to get in on 
the “ground floor” of a small but soon-to-be stellar company. Not all of these 
companies and stocks have terrible prospects, but many do.
The biggest problem with buying penny stocks through such advisers is that 
the stocks are grossly overpriced. Just as you don’t make good investment 
returns by purchasing jewellery that’s marked up 100 percent, you don’t have 
a fighting chance of making decent money on penny stocks that the adviser 
may flog with similar markups. The individual adviser who cons you into 
“investing” in such cheap stocks gains a big commission, which is why he 
continues to call you with “opportunities” until you send him a cheque. Many 
advisers in this business who possess records of securities violations also 
possess an ability to sell, so they have no problem gaining employment with 
other penny-stock peddlers.

116

Recognizing an investment-gambling problem
Some gamblers spend their time at the race-
track, and you can find others in casinos. 
Increasingly, though, you can find gamblers at 
their personal computers, tracking and trading 
stocks.
More investors than ever are myopically 
focused on stocks’ short-term price move-
ments. Several factors contribute to this trou-
bling activity: the continued growth of the 
Internet, the increased responsibility more 
folks have in managing their own retirement 
investments, and increased media cover-
age (including stock market channels). Also, 
companies touting themselves as educational 
institutions suck legions of novice investors 
into dangerous practices. Masquerading 
under such pompous names as “institutes” or 
“academies,” these firms purport to teach you 
how to get rich by day trading stocks. Perhaps 
you’ve heard their ads on the radio or seen 
them on stock market television channels or 
on the Internet for “seminars” or other “train-
ing” methods. All you have to do is part with 
several thousands of dollars for the training, 
but the only people getting rich are the owners 
of such seminar companies.
The non-profit organization Gamblers 
Anonymous developed the following 20 ques-
tions to help you figure out whether you or 
someone you know is a compulsive gam-
bler who needs help. According to Gamblers 
Anonymous, compulsive gamblers typi-
cally answer yes to seven or more of these 
questions:
 1. Did you ever lose time from work or school 
due to gambling?
 2. Has gambling ever made your home life 
unhappy?
 3. Did gambling affect your reputation?
 4. Have you ever felt remorse after gambling?
 5. Did you ever gamble to get money with 
which to pay debts or otherwise solve 
financial difficulties?
 6. Did gambling cause a decrease in your 
ambition or efficiency?
 7. After losing, did you feel you must return 
as soon as possible and win back your 
losses?
 8. After a win, did you have a strong urge to 
return and win more?
 9. Did you often gamble until your last dollar 
was gone?
 10. Did you ever borrow money to finance your 
gambling?
 11. Have you ever sold anything to finance 
gambling?
 12. Were you reluctant to use “gambling 
money” for normal expenditures?
 13. Did gambling make you careless of the 
welfare of your family?
 14. Did you ever gamble longer than you had 
planned?
 15. Have you ever gambled to escape worry or 
trouble?
 16. Have you ever committed, or considered 
committing, an illegal act to finance 
gambling?
 17. Did gambling cause you to have difficulty in 
sleeping?
 18. Do arguments, disappointments, or frustra-
tions create within you an urge to gamble?
 19. Did you ever have an urge to celebrate any 
good fortune with a few hours of gambling?
 20. Have you ever considered self-destruction 
as a result of your gambling?

117
 Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
A number of penny-stock investment dealerships are known for engaging in 
manipulation of stock prices, driving up prices of selected shares to suck in 
gullible investors, and then leaving the public holding the bag. These firms 
may also encourage companies to issue new overpriced stock that their 
advisers can then sell to people like you.
If you remember a fellow by the name of Robert Brennan, you know that he 
is the granddaddy of this reptilian business. We won’t bore you with all the 
details except to say that after more than a decade of financial shenanigans, 
Brennan was ordered by a judge to pay investors more than $70 million for 
all the bad stuff that he did. And Brennan was sentenced to nearly a decade 
of prison time.
Brennan used to run infamous “Come Grow with Us” television ads, in which 
he hopped out of a helicopter. Brennan was always nicely dressed and main-
tained a polished image. It’s interesting to note that in addition to being in 
the penny-stock business, Brennan owned a horse racetrack and wanted to 
get into the casino business. All Brennan’s businesses share the same char-
acteristics — they don’t involve investments, and they stack the deck against 
the gullible members of the public whom they hoodwink.
The Keys to Stock Market Success
 
Anybody, no matter what his or her educational background, IQ, occupation, 
income, or assets, can make good money through stock investments. Over 
long periods of time, based on historic performance, you can expect to earn 
an average of 9 to 10 percent per year total return by investing in stocks.
 
To maximize your chances of stock market investment success, do the 
following:
 
✓ Don’t try to time the markets. Anticipating where the stock market and 
specific stocks are heading is next to impossible, especially over the 
short term. Consider that in 2008, the overwhelming majority of ana-
lysts, commentators, on-air “experts,” and columnists completely failed 
to offer any advance warning that the stock markets were headed for a 
massive collapse. Economic factors, which are influenced by thousands 
of elements, as well as human emotions, determine stock market prices. 
Be a regular buyer of stocks with new savings. As we discuss earlier in 
this chapter, buy more stocks when they’re on sale and when market 
pessimism is running high.
 
✓ Diversify. Invest in the stocks of different-size companies in varying 
industries around the world. When you assess the performance of your 
investments, look at your whole portfolio at least once a year, and calcu-
late your total return after expenses and trading fees.

118
Part II: Stocks, Bonds and Bay Street 
 
✓ Keep trading costs, management fees, and commissions to a minimum. 
These represent a big drain on your returns. If you invest through an 
individual investment adviser who earns a living on commissions, odds 
are high that you’re paying far more than you need to, and you’re likely 
receiving biased advice.
 
✓ Pay attention to taxes. Like commissions and fees, taxes are a major 
investment “expense” that you can minimize. Contribute most of your 
money to your RRSP and other tax-advantaged retirement plans. You 
can invest your money outside of tax-deferred savings plans, but keep 
an eye on taxes (see Chapter 3). Calculate your annual returns on an 
after-tax basis.
 
✓ Don’t overestimate your ability to pick the big winning stocks. One of 
the best ways to invest in stocks is through mutual funds (see Chapter 8), 
where you can use an experienced, full-time money manager at a low 
cost to perform all the investing grunt work for you.

Chapter 6
Investigating and Purchasing 
Individual Stocks
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the best research resources
▶ Figuring out what those annual reports really mean
▶ Deciphering 10-Ks, quarterly reports, information circulars, and proxies
▶ Placing stock trades
T
his chapter provides a crash course in researching individual companies 
and their stocks. Be sure that you consider your reasons for taking this 
approach before you head down the path of picking and choosing your own 
stocks. If you haven’t already done so, please read Chapter 5 to better 
understand the process of purchasing stocks on your own.
If you decide to tackle the task of researching your own stocks, you don’t 
need to worry about finding enough information: The problem to worry 
about is information overload. You can literally spend hundreds of hours 
researching and reading information on one company alone. Therefore, unless 
you’re financially independent and want to spend nearly all your productive 
time investing, you need to focus on where you can get the best bang for your 
buck and time.
Building on Others’ Research
If you were going to build a house, we’d bet that you wouldn’t actually try to 
do it on your own. At the very least, you’d probably find some sort of kit or 
a set of plans drawn up by others who have built many houses. You can do 
the same when it comes to picking individual stocks. In this section, we high-
light useful resources that allow you to hit the ground running when trying to 
pick the best stocks. In addition to the resources we cover here, please see 
Chapter 19 for a list and description of numerous other useful resources for 
researching individual stocks.

Checking out ShareOwner
 
ShareOwner Education Inc. is a Canadian company that helps educate individual 
investors. (ShareOwner evolved out of The Canadian Shareowners Association, a 
non-profit organization.) Through its mentorship program, ShareOwner’s 
online seminars help you develop a portfolio, and a ShareOwner “mentor” 
provides you with written feedback on your plan. Students can then try out 
their proposed portfolio without having to commit a lot of money, buying 
anywhere from $1 to $100 worth of up to 20 different stocks. The maximum 
allowable amount to invest at this stage is $2,000. At the end of nine months, 
students can choose to cash out or remain with ShareOwner and switch over 
to a regular ShareOwner account.
Memberships in the mentorship program are available for three months for 
around $500. A six-month membership costs about $700, and a nine-month 
membership goes for about $900. A membership includes a monthly tutorial 
and a monthly case study.
ShareOwner’s focus is on helping individual investors research and invest 
in high-quality growth stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the long 
term. To help investors do that, ShareOwner has an easy-to-understand 
methodology. To locate what it calls “Great Stocks,” it suggests looking for 
companies with a track record of consistently increasing both their revenues 
and their earnings per share at high rates. ShareOwner also looks for compa-
nies with a stable price/earnings ratio (refer to Chapter 5).
To help investors assess how companies are doing on these fronts, Share
Owner produces a software program as well as digital data on some 6,000 
companies, including just under 2,000 Canadian companies. The stock 
assessment software — included as part of the mentorship program — is also 
available without the membership service for around $200 as a download, and 
slightly more if you want it mailed out on a disk. The data on the companies — 
which is sold separately from the program — costs about $230 a year for 
unlimited downloads. You can also choose to have the database mailed 
out to you on disk every two months for a slightly higher price.
Discovering the Value Line 
Investment Survey
 
Value Line’s securities analysts have tracked and researched stocks since the 
Great Depression. Their analysis and recommendation track record is quite 
good, and their analysts are beholden to no one. Many professional money 
managers use Value Line as a reference because of its comprehensiveness.

121
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
The beauty of Value Line’s service is that it condenses the key information 
and statistics about a stock (and the company behind the stock) to a single 
page. Suppose that you’re interested in investing in Starbucks, the retail cof-
feehouse operator. You’ve seen all its stores, and you figure that if you’re 
going to shell out more than $3 for a cup of its flavoured hot water, you may 
as well participate in the profits and growth of the company. You look up the 
recent stock price (we explain how to do that later in this chapter) and see 
that it’s $19 per share.
Let’s take a look at the important elements of a Value Line page for Starbucks, 
shown in Figure 6-1.
How to minimize commissions with ShareOwner’s 
portfolio-building services
To maximize your returns, you must keep 
investment fees and other costs to a minimum. 
Staying diversified is also key. If one of your 
investments collapses, the other healthy secu-
rities you hold will limit the overall damage.
For investors who want to buy their own stocks, 
these two goals often conflict. Without a sub-
stantial sum to invest, purchasing shares of 
enough different companies to ensure proper 
diversification usually means paying a signifi-
cant amount in commissions and other costs. 
This is why we recommend mutual funds and 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By buying these 
efficient investments, investors get immediate 
broad diversification at a low cost.
For those who want to pick their own stocks, 
ShareOwner offers a second way to pur-
chase shares and accomplish these two 
goals. Through its pooled-buying service, indi-
vidual investors can make small purchases of 
numerous stocks and keep commissions low. 
ShareOwner charges commissions based 
on the number of different companies you 
purchase shares in, not the number of shares 
or the dollar amount. What’s more, you can 
purchase fractions of shares (up to four deci-
mal points!). Your purchase order for shares of 
a particular company will be added to those of 
other investors buying the same stock, and the 
orders for each company are processed on a 
regular basis, usually every two weeks or once 
a month.
If your purchase order is for shares in any-
where from one to four different companies, 
the charge is $9 per company. But what makes 
ShareOwner’s service appealing is the maxi-
mum order cost: $36. You can divide your pur-
chase between many more companies, and 
the order cost remains capped at $36. You 
can choose from 180 large Canadian and U.S. 
companies, and 30 exchange-traded funds. 
These stocks and ETFs have been selected by 
ShareOwner because they qualify as good-
quality growth investments according to its 
assessment methodology.

The information in Value Line reports is in no way inside information. Look at 
these reports the same way that you review a history book — as useful back-
ground information that can keep you from repeating common mistakes.

 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
1. Business
This section describes the business(es) that Starbucks participates in. You 
can see that Starbucks is the largest retailer of specialty coffee in the world. 
Although 85 percent of the company’s sales come from retail, note that 15 
percent come from other avenues — such as mail order and supermarket 
sales. You also find details about joint ventures, such as the partnership of 
Starbucks and Pepsi to develop and sell a bottled coffee drink. In this section, 
you also can see that the senior executives and directors of the company 
own a sizable stake (5.5 percent) of the stock — it’s good to see these folks 
have a financial stake in the success of the company and stock.
2. Analyst assessment
Securities analysts (in Starbucks’ case, a fellow called Justin Hellman) follow 
each Value Line stock. An analyst focuses on specific industries and follows a
few dozen stocks. This section provides the analyst’s summary and commentary 
of the company’s current situation and future plans.
Hellman notes that although the company and stock are facing some 
near-term challenges, the shares are attractive over the longer term.
3. Value Line’s rating
Value Line provides a numerical ranking for each stock’s timeliness (expected 
performance) over the next year. A rating of 1 is highest and 5 is lowest, but 
only about 5 percent of all stocks receive these extreme ratings. A 2 rating 
is above average and a 4 rating is below average, and about one-sixth of the 
ranked stocks receive each of these ratings. All remaining stocks, a little 
more than half the total ranked, get the average 3 rating.
The safety rank works the same way as the timeliness rating, with 1 repre-
senting the best and least volatile stocks and the most financially stable 
companies. Five is the worst safety ranking and is given to the most volatile 
stocks and least financially stable companies.
We’ve never been fans of predictions and short-term thinking. One year is a 
very short period of time for the stock market. Consider that at the time he 
wrote this analysis of Starbucks — early March 2008 — the stock was trading 
at around US$19. And while Hellman outlined the numerous challenges the 
company was facing, nothing in the report suggests that just over six months 
later, the stock would be trading for half that amount due to the collapse of 
stock markets in general.
That said, historically, Value Line’s system holds one of the best overall track 
records according to the Hulbert Financial Digest, which tracks the actual 
performance of investment newsletter recommendations. However, you 

124
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
shouldn’t necessarily run out and buy any stock that Value Line gives a high 
ranking to. Just keep in mind that higher-ranked stocks within Value Line 
have historically outperformed those without such ratings.
4. Stock price performance
This graph shows you the stock price’s performance over the past decade or 
so. The highest and lowest points of the line on the graph indicate the high 
and low stock prices for each month. At the top of the graph you see the 
year’s high and low prices. Starbucks stock has steadily risen since it first 
issued stock in 1992, but the company certainly has experienced some down 
periods. (The small box in the lower-right corner of the graph shows you 
the total return that an investor in this stock earned over the previous one, 
three, and five years and how those returns compare with the average stock. 
This graph shows you that Starbucks declined significantly over the past one 
to three years but has increased over the past five years.)
The graph also shows how the price of the stock moves with changes in the 
company’s cash flow (money coming in minus money going out). Over time, 
just as stock prices tend to track corporate profits, so too should they gener-
ally follow cash flow. Cash flow is an important measure of a company’s finan-
cial success and health — it’s different from net profits, which the company 
reports for tax purposes. For example, the tax laws allow companies to take a 
tax deduction each year for the depreciation (devaluation) of the company’s 
equipment and other assets. Although depreciation is good because it helps 
lower a company’s tax bill, subtracting it from the company’s revenue gives 
an untrue picture of the company’s cash flow. Thus, in calculating a company’s 
cash flow, depreciation isn’t subtracted from revenue.
5. Historic financials
This section shows you 12 to 18 years of financial information on the com-
pany (in the case of Starbucks, you get information going back to just 1992 
because that’s when the company went public). The two most helpful pieces 
of information in this section are
 
✓ Book value per share: This indicates the value of the company’s assets, 
including equipment, manufacturing plants, and real estate, minus any 
liabilities. Book value gives you somewhat of a handle on the amount 
that the company can sell for if it has a “going-out-of-business sale.” We 
say “somewhat” because the value of some assets on a company’s books 
isn’t correct. For example, some companies own real estate, bought long 
ago, that is worth far more than the company’s current financial statements 
indicate. Conversely, some manufacturers with equipment find that if 
they have to dump some equipment in a hurry, they need to sell the 
equipment at a discount to entice a buyer.

125
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
 
 The book value of a bank, for example, can mislead you if the bank makes 
loans that won’t be paid back, and the bank’s financial statements don’t 
document this fact. (This could be seen in action during the collapse of 
mortgage companies, insurers, and investment dealers during the 2008 
subprime lending crisis.) All these complications with book value are why 
full-time, professional money managers exist. (If you want to delve more 
into a company’s book value, you need to look at other financial state-
ments, such as the company’s annual report, which we discuss in the 
“Understanding Annual Reports” section, later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Market share: For some companies (not Starbucks), Value Line also 
provides another useful number in this section — the market share, which 
indicates the portions of the industry that the company has captured in a 
given year. A sustained decline in a company’s market share is a dangerous 
sign that may indicate its customers are leaving for other companies that 
presumably offer better products at lower prices. But that doesn’t mean 
that you should avoid investing in a company that has such problems. 
You can produce big returns if you can identify companies that reposition 
and strengthen their product offerings to reverse a market share decrease.
6. P/E ratio
This tells you that Starbucks sells at a P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio of 19.9 
because of its recent stock price and earnings. This P/E ratio is higher than that 
of the overall market. (You can see that Starbucks’ P/E ratio is 1.23 times 
that of the overall market.) To understand the importance of the P/E ratio in 
evaluating a stock, please refer to Chapter 5.
7. Capital structure
This section summarizes the amount of outstanding stocks and bonds the 
company possesses. Remember that when a company issues these securities, 
it receives capital (money). What is most useful to examine in this section is 
the company’s debt. If a company accumulates a lot of debt, the burden of 
interest payments can create a real drag on profits. If profits stay down for 
too long, debt can even push some companies into bankruptcy.
Figure 6-1 shows you that Starbucks has outstanding debt of $4 million. This 
section delineates between two types of debt:
 
✓ Short-term debt: Debt due within one year
 
✓ Long-term debt: Debt that has to be paid back in more than a year
So how do you know if this is a lot, a little, or just the right amount of debt? 
You can calculate long-term interest earned, which compares a company’s 
annual profits to the yearly interest payments on its long-term debt. For 
example, if a company has long-term interest earned of 4.5x, that means that 

126
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
the company’s most recent yearly profits can cover the interest payments on 
its long-term debt for about 41/2 years. Starbucks has little debt — the com-
pany’s most recent annual profits of $392 million dwarf its long-term interest 
payments of $0.1 million.
Possessing a larger cushion to cover debt is more important when the 
company’s business is volatile. Total interest coverage represents a similar 
comparison of profits to interest owed for all the debt that a company owes, 
not just long-term debt. This number tells you the number of years that the 
company’s most recent annual profits can cover interest on all the compa-
ny’s debt. Warning signs for total interest coverage numbers include a steep 
decline in this number over time and profits that cover less than one year’s 
worth of interest.
8. Current position
This section provides a quick look at how the company’s current assets (current 
meaning an asset that can be sold and converted into cash within a year 
relatively easily) compare with its current liabilities (debts due within the 
year). Trouble may be brewing if a company’s current liabilities exceed or are 
approaching its current assets.
 
Some financial analysts calculate the quick ratio, which ignores inventory 
when comparing current assets to current liabilities. A company may have to 
dump inventory at a relatively low price if it needs to raise cash quickly. Thus, 
some analysts argue, you need to ignore inventory as a current asset.
9. Annual rates
This nifty section can save wear and tear on your calculator. The good folks 
at Value Line calculate rates of growth (or shrinkage) on important financial 
indicators, such as sales (revenues) and earnings (profits) over the past five 
and ten years. Value Line also lists its projections for the next five years.
 
Projections can prove highly unreliable, even from a research firm as good as 
Value Line. In most cases, the projections assume that the company will con-
tinue as it has in the most recent couple years.
10. Quarterly financials
For the most recent years, Value Line shows you an even more detailed quar-
terly breakout of sales and profits, which may disclose changes that annual 
totals mask. You can also see the seasonality of some businesses. Starbucks, 
for example, tends to have its slowest quarter in the winter (quarter ending 
March 31). This makes sense if you figure that many of the customers who 
frequent Starbucks’ coffee shops do so as they walk around town, which 
people tend to do less of on a blustery winter day.

127
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
Considering independent investment 
dealer research
If you’re going to invest in individual stocks, you need an investment dealer 
account. In addition to low trading fees, the best investment dealers allow 
you to easily tap into useful research, especially through the firm’s Web site, 
that will assist you with your investing decisions.
Because discount brokers aren’t in the investment banking business of work-
ing with companies to sell new issues of stock, discount brokers sometimes 
have a level of objectivity in their research reports that too often is absent 
among traditional advisers. Please see Chapter 9 for how to select a top-
notch investment dealer.
Getting your hands on Value Line reports
The least costly way to obtain Value Line pages 
on stocks that interest you is to visit your local 
library. Many libraries that have decent busi-
ness sections subscribe to it.
If you want your own copy of Value Line to read 
in the comfort of your home, Value Line (800-
634-3583) offers a 13-week trial subscription to 
its Value Line Investment Survey for US$95. An 
annual subscription costs US$680. At the start 
of your subscription, you receive a rather large 
binder, divided into 13 sections, that includes 
the most recent reports on the 1,700-plus 
larger-company stocks that this publication 
tracks. Every week, you receive a new packet 
of reports that replaces one of the 13 sec-
tions. Thus, at the end of 13 weeks, you have 
new reports on all the stocks. (If you prefer, an 
electronic edition is available for US$65 for the 
13-week trial; US$538 yearly.)
The trial subscription is a great place to start 
your research because you receive all the 
current reports plus three months’ worth of 
updates for a reasonable fee. You can also see 
how much use you get out of the reports. The 
trial offer is available to each household only 
once every three years.
Value Line also offers a Small and Mid-Cap 
Edition that contains reports on about 1,800 
additional smaller companies. Unlike traditional 
Value Line pages, these pages include no ana-
lyst commentary or projections. A one-year 
subscription to this publication costs US$249.

Examining successful money 
managers’ stock picks
 
To make money in stocks, you certainly don’t need an original idea. In fact, it 
makes sense to examine what the best money managers are buying for their 
portfolios. Don’t worry; we’re not suggesting that you invade their privacy or 
ask rude questions!
Mutual fund managers, for example, are required to disclose at least twice 
a year what stocks they hold in their portfolio. You can call the best fund 
companies and ask them to send their most recent semi-annual reports that 
detail their stock holdings; you can also view those reports on many fund 
company’s Web sites. (See Chapter 8 for more information on the best stock 
mutual funds.)
Through its Web site, Morningstar (www.morningstar.ca) allows you to 
see which mutual funds hold large portions of a given stock that you may 
be researching and what the success or lack thereof is of the funds buying a 
given stock.
Finally, you can follow what investment legend Warren Buffett is buying 
through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. If you’d like to review 
Berkshire’s complete corporate filings on your own, visit the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission Web site at www.sec.gov.
Reviewing financial publications 
and Web sites
Many publications and Web sites cover the world of stocks. Be careful. Just 
because a columnist or publication advocates particular stocks or investing 
strategies doesn’t mean you’ll achieve success by following her advice.
 
The following publications offer useful columns and commentary, sometimes 
written by professional money managers, on individual stocks: Barron’s, 
Business Week, Canadian Business, Forbes, Kiplinger’s, Report on Business 
Magazine, and The Wall Street Journal. In addition, hundreds of Web sites are 
devoted to stock picking. We name our favourite investing sites in Chapter 19.

 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
Understanding Annual Reports
After you review the Value Line page on a company and want to dig further 
into financial documents, the next step is to ask yourself why. Why do you 
want to torture yourself so?
We both have business degrees from what are supposedly better business 
schools, and we have taken more than our fair share of accounting and 
finance courses. Over the years, we’ve gotten to know investment manag-
ers and financial analysts who research companies. Although some financial 
documents aren’t that difficult to read (we show you how in this section), 
interpreting what they mean in respect to a company’s future isn’t easy.
 
All publicly traded companies must annually file certain financial documents. 
Consider reviewing these documents to enhance your understanding of a 
company’s businesses and strategies rather than for the predictive value 
that you may hope they provide.
The first of such useful documents that companies produce is the annual 
report. This yearly report provides standardized financial statements as well 
as management’s discussion about how the company has performed and how 
it plans to improve its performance in the future. If you’re a bit of the skepti-
cal sort, like we are, you may think, “Aren’t the company’s officials going to 
make everything sound rosy and wonderful?”
To a certain extent, yes, but not as badly as you may think, especially with 
companies that adhere to sound accounting principles and good old-fashioned 
ethics. First, a large portion of an annual report includes the company’s finan-
cial statements, which an accounting firm must audit. However, audits don’t 
mean that companies and their accounting firms can’t (often legally) structure 
the company’s books to make them look rosier than they really are. And 
some companies have pulled the wool over the eyes of their auditors, who 
then became unwitting accomplices in producing false financial figures.
 
You’ve surely heard of the accounting scandals at companies such as Enron 
and WorldCom. These companies manipulated their financial books, with the 
blessing of supposedly blue-chip corporate auditors, to mislead investors into 
believing that they were more profitable than they really were. (Identifying 
trouble before other investors do is a skill that many professional investors 
haven’t mastered — if you can identify trouble early, go manage other people’s 
money!)

130
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Also keep in mind that more than a few companies have been sued for mis-
leading shareholders with inflated forecasts or lack of disclosure of problems. 
Responsible companies try to present a balanced and, of course, hopeful 
perspective in their annual reports. Most companies’ annual reports are written 
by non-techno geeks, so you have a decent chance of understanding them.
Financial and business highlights
The first section of most annual reports presents a description of a com-
pany’s recent financial highlights and business strategies. You can use this 
information to find out about the businesses that the company is in and 
where the company is heading. For example, in Figure 6-1, Value Line men-
tioned that Starbucks is also in the specialty sales business. The annual 
report can provide more detail about Starbucks’ specialty business.
Okay, enough about the coffee business — we want to expose you to another 
industry. Sears is one of Canada’s best-known retailers. In Figure 6-2, you can 
see Sears Canada’s discussion of its business activity in 2007.

Balance sheet
You can find a company’s hard-core financials in the back portion of most 
annual reports. You can find many of these same numbers in Value Line 
reports, except you get more specific details in the company’s annual report. 
All annual reports contain a balance sheet, which is a snapshot summary of 
all the company’s assets (what the company owns) and liabilities (what the 
company owes). The balance sheet covers the company’s assets and liabili-
ties from the beginning of the year to the last day of the company’s year-end, 
which is typically December 31. Some companies use a fiscal year that ends 
at other times of the year.
A company’s balance sheet resembles a personal balance sheet. The entries, 
of course, look a little different because you likely don’t own things like 
manufacturing equipment. Figure 6-3 shows a typical corporate balance sheet.
Assets
The assets section lists the following items that the company holds or owns 
that are of significant value:
 
✓ Cash: We suspect that you know what cash is. Lest you think that stacks 
of bills sit around in corporate vaults, rest assured that companies 
invest this money to earn interest. Many items are explained in more 
detail in explanatory notes that follow these financial statements.
  
✓ Accounts receivable: This is money that is owed to the company, such 
as invoices that customers haven’t paid yet.
 
 As companies grow, their accounts receivable usually do, too. Watch 
out for cases where the receivables grow faster than the sales (revenue). 
This growth may indicate that the company is having problems with its 
products’ quality or pricing. Unhappy customers pay more slowly or 
demand bigger price discounts.
 
✓ Inventories: Manufacturing and retail companies (such as Sears) also 
track and report inventory (the products that haven’t yet been sold) as 
an asset. Generally speaking, as a business grows, so too does its inven-
tory. If inventory grows more quickly than revenue, such growth may be 
a warning sign. This growth can indicate that customers are scaling back 
purchases and that the company miscalculated and overproduced or 
overbought. It can also be a leading indicator of an obsolete or inferior 
product offering.
 
✓ Investments: In addition to cash, some companies may invest in other 
securities, such as bonds and stocks. Just as with your own personal 
situation, companies usually invest money that they don’t expect to use 
in the near future. Sears, for example, details in an explanatory note how 
its investments are divvied up, with different amounts invested in 
unsecured debentures, subordinated loans, and so on.

 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
 
✓ Property and equipment: All companies need equipment to run their 
businesses. This equipment can include office furniture, computers, real 
estate they own, and manufacturing machinery that the company uses 
to make its products. Equipment — sometimes called fixed assets, or, 
as Sears does, capital assets — becomes less valuable over time, so the 
company considers this depreciation as a cost of doing business each 
year. Therefore, if a company ceases buying new equipment, this entry 
on the balance sheet gradually decreases because the depreciation is 
subtracted from the value of the equipment.
 
✓ Goodwill: One of the assets that doesn’t show up on most companies’ 
balance sheets is their goodwill. Companies work hard through advertising, 
product development, and service to attract and retain customers. Name-
brand recognition is a term that you sometimes hear thrown around. 
Companies can’t put a value on the goodwill that they’ve generated, but 
when they purchase (acquire) another firm, some of the purchase price 
is considered goodwill. Specifically, if a company is acquired for $100 
million but has a net worth (assets minus liabilities) of just $50 million, 
the extra $50 million goes to goodwill. The goodwill then becomes an 
asset on the acquiring company’s balance sheet.
 
✓ Other assets: This is a catch-all category that may include some stuff 
that can make your eyes glaze over. For example, companies keep a dif-
ferent set of books for tax purposes (yes, this is legal). Not surprisingly, 
companies do this because the tax authorities allow, in some cases, 
more deductions than what the company is required to show from an 
accounting standpoint on their financial statements. (If you were a com-
pany, wouldn’t you want your shareholders, but not the tax collectors, 
to see gobs of profits?) Companies treat tax deferment as an asset until 
the tax department receives more of its share down the road.
Liabilities
This section summarizes all the money that the company owes to others:
 
✓ Accounts payable: When a company places orders to purchase things 
for its business, it sometimes has a lag between receiving a bill and 
paying it; the money owed is called accounts payable. As with inventory 
and accounts receivable, accounts payable generally increases with a 
company’s increasing revenue.
 
 If accounts payable increases faster than revenue, it can indicate a problem. 
On the other hand, that increase can also be a sign of good financial 
management. The longer you take to pay your bills, the longer you 
have the money in your pocket working for you.

134
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
✓ Accrued liabilities: This line tallies money that the company must someday 
pay its employees. For example, many larger firms maintain pension 
plans. These plans promise workers who retire with at least five years 
of service a monthly income cheque in retirement. Thus, the company 
must reserve this money that it owes and list it as a liability or debt that 
it must someday pay. This is sometimes called accrued compensation.
 
✓ Income taxes payable: Companies are in business to make a profit, and 
as they earn those profits, they need to reserve a portion to pay income 
taxes. As we explain in the previous section, some of the taxes that the 
company owes can be caused by accounting differences between the 
company’s financial statements and those filed with the tax authorities.
 
✓ Dividends payable: Not all companies pay dividends (see Chapter 4) to 
their shareholders. But those companies that do pay dividends typically 
declare the dividend several weeks in advance of when they actually 
owe the dividend. During this interim period, the company lists the not-
yet-paid dividends as a liability.
Stockholders’ equity
The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is known as stock-
holders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity is what makes balance sheets always 
balance.
 
When companies issue stock, they receive cash, which they then list as an 
asset. Companies divide stock proceeds between par value and capital in 
excess of par value. Par values are arcane — and largely meaningless.
Income statement
The other big financial statement in an annual report is the income statement 
(see Figure 6-4).
Revenue
Revenue is simply the money that the company receives from its customers 
as compensation for its products or services. Just as you can earn income 
from your job(s) as well as investments and other sources, a company can 
make money from a variety of sources. Sears, of course, makes its money 
from retail sales, along with other ventures, including its travel division and 
its credit card operations.
 
Ideally, you want to see a steady or accelerating rate of growth in a company’s 
revenue. If a company’s revenue grows more slowly, you need to inquire why. 
Is it because of poor service or product performance, better competitor 
offerings, ineffective marketing, or all of the above?

For companies with multiple divisions or product lines, the annual report 
may detail the revenue of each product line in a later section. If it doesn’t, 
check out some of the other financial statements that the next section, 
“Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports,” recommends. Examine what 
spurs or holds back the company’s overall growth and what different busi-
nesses the company operates in. Look for businesses that were acquired but 
don’t really fit with the company’s other business units, and mark these as 
red flags. Large companies that have experienced stalled revenue growth 
sometimes try to “enter” new businesses through acquisition but then don’t 
manage them well because they don’t understand the keys to their success.
 
When researching department stores (such as Sears), restaurant chains (for 
example, McDonald’s), or clothing stores (such as The Gap), examine the rev-
enue changes that come from opening new locations versus the revenue 
changes at existing locations, sometimes referred to as same stores. Be 
concerned if you find that a company’s revenue growth comes from opening 

136
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
new locations rather than growth at existing locations. This may indicate that 
weakness in the company’s business is being masked by simply opening more 
locations.
Expenses
Just as personal income taxes, housing, food, and clothing expenses gobble 
up much of your personal income, company expenses use up much and 
sometimes all of a company’s revenue.
Even healthy, growing businesses can get into trouble if their expenses grow 
faster than their revenues. Well-managed companies stay on top of their 
expenses during good and bad times. Unfortunately, it’s easy for companies 
to get sloppy during good times.
 
Examine each category of expenses relative to (in other words, as a percentage 
of) the company’s revenue to see which categories grow and which shrink. As 
a well-managed and financially healthy company grows, expenses as a percent-
age of revenue should decrease. As this happens, profits as a percentage of 
revenue increase. (Not all expense categories necessarily decrease.)
Net income calculations
The net result of expenses increasing slower than revenues is a fatter bottom 
line. In the case of Sears, net income increased from 4.03 percent to 7.30 per-
cent of revenue between 2006 and 2007. (To help you better see any trends, 
companies typically will include financial information for the previous two 
years alongside the current year’s results. Although Sears only provides the 
preceding year’s numbers, elsewhere in its annual report the company sum-
marizes its financial record for the last 11 years.) When you examine how a 
company’s profits change relative to total revenue received, focus on operat-
ing income. Sometimes companies experience one-time events, such as the 
sale of a division, that can change profits temporarily. Companies usually list 
these one-time events in the section under expenses.
 
We also encourage you to review a company’s statement of cash flows included 
in its annual report. Cash can flow into and out of a company from normal busi-
ness operations, investment activities, and financing activities. Sometimes a 
company may report higher profits but actually be facing decreased cash flow 
from operations, for example, if its customers are getting slower with paying 
bills (which could indicate that its customers are having financial problems or 
they’re unhappy with the product or service being provided).
Earnings per share
Last but not least, and of great importance to shareholders, is the calculation of 
earnings per share. Higher profits per share generally help fuel a higher stock 
price, and declining profits feed falling stock prices. Remember, though, that 

137
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
smart financial market participants are looking ahead, so if you run out to 
buy stock in a company that is reporting higher profits, it’s old news and 
likely already priced into the company’s current market value.
Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports
In addition to annual reports, companies produce other financial statements 
that you may want to peruse. You can generally obtain these from the com-
pany for free from their Web sites, or by contacting a company’s investor 
relations department. You can also obtain financial statements from the 
SEDAR site (www.sedar.com) for Canadian companies, and from the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission site (www.sec.gov) for U.S. compa-
nies. (See Chapter 19 for more on these sites.)
10-Ks
Filed by U.S.-based companies, 10-Ks are expanded versions of an annual 
report. Most investment professionals read the 10-K instead of the annual 
report because the 10-K contains additional data and information, especially 
for a company’s various divisions and product lines. Also, 10-Ks contain little 
of the verbal hype that you find in most annual reports. The 10-K is probably 
one of the most objective reports that a company publishes. If you’re not 
intimidated by annual reports, or you want more company meat, go for it!
Quarterly reports
Quarterly reports (called 10-Qs in the United States) provide information on a 
quarterly basis. These reports are worthwhile if you like to read a reasonably 
detailed discussion by management of the latest business and financial devel-
opments at the company. However, we recommend leaving the research to 
folks like Value Line’s analysts.
The financial data in these reports is unaudited and not of great use for the 
long-term investor. If you want to watch your investments like a hawk and try 
to be among the first to detect indications of financial problems (easier said 
than done), these reports are required reading.
 
Many companies go back to restate their quarterly financials. Remember that 
the accountants haven’t approved these numbers. Sometimes companies take 
their financial lump in one quarter to get problems behind them, so one bad 
quarter doesn’t necessarily indicate a harmful long-term trend.

138
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Proxy forms and information circulars
The final corporate documents that you may want to review are the annual 
proxy form and information circular. (In the United States, the two together 
are collectively called the proxy statement.) These are sent out in advance of 
a company’s annual meeting. These documents contain important financial 
information and discussions, and also contain information on other corpo-
rate matters, such as the election of the board of directors. Directors — who 
are usually corporate executives, lawyers, accountants, and other suppos-
edly knowledgeable luminaries — serve as sounding boards, counsellors, and 
sometimes overseers to the management team of a company.
A proxy is a power of attorney that transfers a shareholder’s right to vote at 
a shareholders’ meeting to someone else, typically the company’s manage-
ment. The information circular tells you who serves on the board of directors 
as well as how much they and the executives of the company are paid. It also 
must contain information on any important matters that will be under discus-
sion, and the interest of management in these issues.
Fundamental versus technical analysis
Throughout this chapter and Chapter 5, we talk 
a lot about the financial statements and analy-
sis of a company — balance sheets, revenues, 
expenses, earnings, price/earnings ratios, 
and so on. Analyzing financial statements and 
making investing decisions based on them is 
known as fundamental analysis.
Another school of stock market analysis, known 
as technical analysis, exists. Folks who employ 
technical analysis like to examine chart patterns, 
volume, and all sorts of indicators that have little 
if anything to do with the underlying stock.
Technicians say things like “Stock XYZ has 
a major support area at $20 per share” and 
“Stock ABC has broken out above $30 per 
share.” Although it may be a bit extreme to say 
that all the technicians who have ever existed 
have never produced anything of value, you 
can safely ignore this school of thinking. In fact, 
ignoring the technicians will likely increase your 
stock market profits. Why? Because technical 
analysis thinking encourages a trader’s, not an 
investor’s, mindset.
Not surprisingly, most technicians come from 
one of two camps. Many technical analysts 
work for investment dealers and write daily, 
weekly, or monthly assessments of the entire 
stock market and some individual stocks. 
Recommendations and advice change over 
time, and the result is that you trade more. Not 
coincidentally, these investment dealers make 
more money the more you trade! Investment 
newsletter writers are the other big advocates 
of this Ouija-board approach to investment 
management. Again, it’s a great system for the 
newsletter writers who hook you on a $200-per-
year newsletter.

139
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
At annual meetings, where the board of directors discusses proxy state-
ments, shareholders sometimes get angry and ask why the executives are 
paid so much when the company’s stock price and business underperform. 
The proxy statement becomes much more important when a company faces 
a takeover or some other controversial corporate matter, such as the elec-
tion of an alternative board of directors. As a shareholder, you get to vote on 
proposed board members and on select other corporate issues.
Getting Ready to Invest in Stocks
Especially during the tech boom of the late 1990s, amid the chorus of self-
anointed gurus saying that you can make fat profits if you pick your own 
stocks, we sometimes thought that we were a lone voice urging caution and 
sensible thinking.
 
Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky or unusually gifted at analyzing company 
and investor behaviour, you won’t earn above-average returns if you select 
your own stocks.
For most people, it’s wise to keep to a minimum — ideally, no more than 20 
percent of your invested dollars — the amount that you dedicate to individ-
ual stock investments. We encourage you to do such investing for the educa-
tional value and enjoyment that you derive from it, not because you smugly 
think you’re as skilled as the best professional money managers. (If you want 
to find out more about analyzing companies, read the chapters in Part IV on 
small business as well as the chapters about investing resources in Part V.)
Understanding stock prices
Just about every major financial and news site on the Internet offers stock 
quotes, usually for free as a lure to get you to visit the site. To view a stock 
price quote online, all you need is the security’s trading symbol (which 
you obtain by using the stock symbol lookup feature universally offered 
with online quote services). Many major newspapers print a listing of the 
prior day’s stock prices, while some — notably The Globe and Mail — have 
stopped this practice given how readily available the information is online. 
Cable business channels such as BNN, Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox Business 
have stock quotes streaming across the bottom of the screen. You can stop 
by a local investment dealer office and see the current stock quotes whizzing 
by on a long, narrow screen on a wall. Many investment dealers also maintain 
publicly accessible terminals (that look a lot like a personal computer) on 
which you can obtain current quotes.

140
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
The following table is a typical example of the kinds of information that you 
can find in daily price quotes in papers and online — in this case, for Canadian 
National Railway (also known as CNR). After the name of the company, you see 
the trading symbol, CNR, which is the code that you and investment advisers 
use to look up the price on computer-based quotation systems.

Here’s a breakdown of what this information means:
 
✓ 52-Week Range: These two numbers indicate the low ($42.51) and high 
($58.44) trading prices for CNR during the past 52 weeks.
 
✓ Last Trade: This line indicates the most recent price that the stock 
traded at (you can see that we happened to get this CNR quote at 15:32, 
or 3:32 p.m. eastern standard time).
 
✓ Change: This entry indicates how that price differs from the previous 
day’s close. In this case, you can see that the stock was up $0.72, (1.25 
percent) from the prior day’s close.
 
✓ Day Range: These two numbers are lowest and highest prices that the 
stock has traded at during the day.
 
✓ Open: This line tells you the first trade of the day.
 
✓ Volume: This number indicates the number of shares that traded up to this 
point in the trading day. (To conserve space, many newspapers indicate 
the volume in hundreds of shares — in other words, you must add two 
zeros to the end of the number to arrive at the actual number of shares.)

141
 Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks
 
✓ The P/E ratio: As we explain in Chapters 4 and 5, the P/E ratio measures 
the price of CNR’s stock relative to the company’s earnings or profits.
 
✓ Market capitalization: This tells you the current market value of all of 
CNR’s stock, which in this case is $24.3 billion. It is arrived at by mul-
tiplying the current price per share by the total number of shares out-
standing. (See Chapter 8 for an explanation of so-called market caps as 
they apply to stocks and stock funds.)
 
✓ Dividends/share: This shows you the current dividend, which in this 
case is $0.84 per share, that the company pays yearly to shareholders. 
Most companies actually pay out one-quarter of their total annual divi-
dend every three months.
 
✓ Yield: This number indicates the effective percentage yield that the 
stock’s dividend produces. To calculate the effective yield, divide the 
dividend by the current stock price. Thus, CNR shareholders can expect 
to receive a dividend worth about 1.7 percent of the current stock price.
Now you know how to read stock quotes!
Purchasing stock “direct” from companies
Over the years, increasing numbers of companies have begun to sell their 
stock directly to the public. Proponents of these direct stock purchase plans 
say that you can invest in stocks without paying any commissions. However, 
some plans do charge fees, and may also require that your initial purchase be 
several hundred dollars.
Investing in such plans poses other challenges. In particular, you typically have 
to own shares in the company, and those shares must be registered in your 
name. These plans also typically allow you to have any dividends automatically 
reinvested and used to buy you more shares in the company. However, many 
discount brokers also allow you to reinvest dividends at no cost.
Some direct stock purchase plans entail even more hassle and cost, forcing you 
to buy your initial shares through an investment adviser and then transfer 
your shares to the issuing company in order to buy more!
 
Every time that you want to set up a stock purchase plan with a company, you 
must request and complete the company’s application forms. If you go 
through the headache of doing so, say, a dozen times, you’re rewarded with a 
dozen statements on a regular basis from each individual company. Frankly, 
because of this drawback alone, we prefer to buy stock through a discount 
brokerage account that allows centralized purchasing and holding of various 
stocks as well as consolidated tax-reporting statements.

142
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Placing your trade through 
an investment adviser
Unless you decide to buy stock directly, you generally need an investment 
adviser. As we explain in Chapter 9, discount brokers are the best way to go — 
they take your orders and charge far less than conventional investment deal-
ers, which pay their advisers on commission.
After you decide which discount broker you want to use (again, we provide 
all the info you need to make this decision in Chapter 9), request (by phone 
or via the Internet) an account application package for the type of account 
that you desire (non-retirement, RRSP, TFSA, RESP, and so on). Complete the 
forms (call the firm’s toll-free number or visit a branch office if you get stuck) 
and mail or take them back to the discounter. Many institutions also allow 
you to apply online.
When it comes time to place your order, simply go online (or call the dis-
count broker). You have two options:
 
✓ Market order: Our advice is to place what’s known as a market order. 
Such an order instructs your investment adviser to buy you the amount 
of stock that you desire (100 shares, for example) at the current and 
best (lowest) price available.
 
✓ Limit order: Alternatively, you can try to buy a desired stock at a 
specific price — for example, you can place a purchase order at $32 
per share when the stock’s last trade was $33 per share. This type of 
order is known as a limit order and is good until you cancel it. (You can 
also make it a day order, meaning it will expire if it isn’t filled at your 
requested price by the end of that day’s trading.) We don’t recommend 
that you try this tactic because it requires you to hope and gamble that 
the stock drops a little before it rises. If the stock simply rises from its 
current price of $33 per share or drops to $32.10 before it makes a big 
move higher, you may kick yourself. If you think that the stock is a good 
buy for the long haul, go buy it with a market order. If you don’t think 
it’s a good buy, don’t buy it.
 
One final word of advice: Try to buy stock in good-size chunks, such as 100 
shares. Otherwise, commissions gobble a larger percentage of the small dollar 
amount that you invest. If you don’t have enough money to build a diversified 
portfolio all at once, don’t sweat it. Diversify over time. Purchase a chunk of 
one stock after you have enough money accumulated and then wait to buy the 
next stock until you’ve saved another chunk to invest.

L
ending investments are those in which you lend your money to an orga-
nization, a bank, credit union, company, or government, which typically 
pays you a set or fixed rate of interest. (Ownership investments, by contrast, 
provide partial ownership of a company or some other asset, such as real 
estate, that has the ability to generate revenue and potential profits.)
If you really want to make your money grow, lending investments aren’t for 
you. However, even the most aggressive investors should consider placing 
some of their money into lending investments. Table 7-1 shows when such 
investments do make sense and when they don’t.

Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Lending investments are available everywhere — from banks, credit unions, 
investment dealers, insurance companies, and mutual fund companies. 
Lending investments that you may have heard of include regular bank sav-
ings accounts, high-interest savings accounts, guaranteed investment cer-
tificates (GICs), treasury bills and other bonds, bond mutual funds (and now 
exchange-traded bond funds), and mortgages.
In this chapter, we walk you through these investments and explain what’s 
good and bad about each of them and when you should and shouldn’t use them. 
We also tell you what to look for (and look out for) when comparing them.
Banks: The Cost of Feeling Secure
Putting your money in a bank may make you feel safe for a variety of reasons. 
If you’re like most people, your first investing experience was at your neigh-
bourhood bank where you opened up a chequing or savings account.
Part of the comfort of keeping money in the bank stems from the fact that 
the bank is where many of our parents first steered us financially. Also, at a 
local branch, often within walking distance of your home or office, you find 
vaults, security-monitoring cameras, and sometimes security guards. Most of 
these latter accoutrements shouldn’t make you feel safer about leaving your 
money with the bank — they’re needed because of the risk of bank robberies. 
Consider that the next time you pay a visit to your local bank.
 
Bank branches cost a lot of money to operate. Guess where that money comes 
from? From bank depositors, of course! That’s one of the reasons why the 
interest rates that banks pay often pale in comparison to other equally secure 
alternatives.
The realities of bank insurance
Some people are consoled by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(CDIC) insurance that comes with bank accounts. It’s true that if your bank 
fails, certain deposits — generally the savings accounts, chequing accounts, 
and GICs that mature in five years or less — you have with a member institution 
of the CDIC are insured up to a total of $100,000. So what, we say. Any Treasury 
bill is issued and backed by the federal government. Plenty of other equally safe 
lending investments yield higher returns.
 
Many credit unions offer unlimited deposit insurance!

145
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
 
Just because a bank is a member of the CDIC — a Crown corporation —
doesn’t mean that your money is 100 percent safe in the event of a bank 
failure. Although you’re insured for $100,000 in a bank, if the bank crashes, 
you may wait quite a while to get your money back — and you may well get 
less interest than you thought you would.
Any investment that involves lending your money to someone else or to 
some organization carries risk. That includes putting your money in a 
bank or buying a Treasury bill (T-Bill) that the federal government issues. 
Although we’re not doomsayers, any student of history knows that even gov-
ernments and civilizations fail.
The overused guaranteed investment 
certificate (GIC)
Other than savings accounts, banks also sell guaranteed investment certifi-
cates (GICs). GICs are without a doubt the most overused bank investment 
around. The attraction is that you usually get a higher rate of return on a GIC 
than on a regular bank savings account or money market fund. And, unlike 
a bond, which we discuss in the “Why Bother with Bonds?” section, later in 
this chapter, a GIC’s principal value doesn’t fluctuate. GICs, if you meet the 
requirements, also give you the peace of mind — up to $100,000 — afforded 
by the CDIC insurance program.
The reason that GICs pay higher interest rates than savings accounts is that 
you commit to tie up your money for a period of time, such as 6, 12, or 24 
months. The bank pays you 2 to 3 percent and then turns around and lends 
your money to people through credit cards, auto loans, and the like, and charges 
the borrower an interest rate of 6 to 16 percent. Not a bad business, eh?
When you tie up your money in a GIC, and later you decide you want it back 
before the GIC matures, a hefty penalty is shaved from your return. With 
other lending investments, such as bonds and bond mutual funds (discussed 
in the section “Why Bother with Bonds?” later in this chapter), you can 
access your money without penalty and generally at little or no cost.
In addition to penalties for early withdrawal, GICs yield less than a high-
quality bond with a comparable maturity (for example, two, three, or five 
years). Often, the yield difference is 1 percent or more, especially if you don’t 
shop around and simply buy GICs from the local bank where you keep your 
chequing account.

146
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
You can earn higher returns and have better access to your money in bonds 
than in GICs. GICs make the most sense when you know, for example, that you 
want to invest your money for one year, after which you need the money for 
some purchase that you expect to make. Just make sure that you shop around 
to get the best interest rate. Begin by simply asking for a better rate than the 
posted rate at your bank or trust company. If you do a reasonable amount of 
other business with your financial institution, or are simply a good bargainer, 
you may be able to get an increase of half a percent or even more. To get a 
sense of what the competition is offering, you’ll find sample GIC rates in the 
financial section of many newspapers. A number of sites, including www.money
sense.ca and money.canoe.ca/rates, offer extensive lists of up-to-date 
GIC rates. If having the CDIC insurance gives you peace of mind, take a look at 
Government of Canada bonds, which we discuss later in this chapter. These 
bonds usually pay as much interest as the vast majority of GICs available.
The money market fund alternative 
to savings accounts
You likely have a chequing account at a local bank that you use to pay house-
hold bills and to access cash through bank machines. But beyond keeping 
enough money in your chequing account to pay the bills, it doesn’t pay to 
keep extra savings in the bank.
Keep your chequing account at one of the big banks or a credit union, but not 
your extra savings, including your emergency funds. Because bank savings 
accounts generally pay pretty crummy interest rates, you’re better off stash-
ing any extra cash elsewhere. Two good choices are a money market mutual 
fund and a high-interest savings account.
Money market funds, which are a type of mutual fund (other funds focus on 
bonds or stocks), are a great place to keep your extra savings. Money market 
funds offer a higher-yielding alternative to bank savings and bank money 
market deposit accounts.
Money market fund advantages
The best money market mutual funds offer several significant benefits over 
bank savings accounts. The biggest advantage is higher yields. Money market 
mutual funds pay higher yields because they don’t have the high overhead 
that banks do. The most efficient mutual fund companies (we discuss them 
in Chapter 8) don’t have scads of branch offices. Another reason that banks 
can get away with paying lower yields is that they know that many deposi-
tors believe that the CDIC insurance that comes with a bank savings account 
makes it safer than a money market mutual fund. Also, the CDIC insurance is 
an expense that banks ultimately pass on to their customers.

147
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
Another useful feature of money market mutual funds is that some allow you 
to write cheques, without charge, against your account. Most mutual fund 
companies require that the cheques that you write be for larger amounts — 
typically at least $250. They don’t want you using these accounts to pay all of 
your small household bills because cheques cost money to process.
 
Money market funds are a good place to keep your emergency cash reserve of 
at least three to six months’ living expenses. They’re also a great place to keep 
money awaiting investment elsewhere in the near future. If you’re saving money 
for a home that you expect to purchase soon (in the next year or so), a 
money market fund can be a safe place to accumulate and grow the down 
payment. You don’t want to risk placing such money in the stock market, 
because the market can plunge in a relatively short period of time.
Money market funds, which are offered by mutual fund companies (see 
Chapter 8), are unique among mutual funds because they don’t fluctuate 
in value and maintain a fixed $10-per-share price. As with a bank savings 
account, your principal investment in a money market fund doesn’t change 
in value. If you invest your money in a money market fund, it earns dividends 
(which is just another name for the interest you would receive in a bank 
account).
Money market funds lack insurance
So what’s the catch? Good money market funds actually don’t have any, but 
you need to know about one difference between bank accounts and money 
market mutual funds: Money market funds aren’t insured. As we discuss earlier 
in this chapter, bank accounts and GIC deposits come with CDIC insurance that 
protects your deposited money up to $100,000 per person for each separate 
financial institution you deal with. So if a bank fails because it lends too much 
money to people and companies that go bankrupt or abscond with the funds, 
you should get your money back from the CDIC.
The lack of CDIC insurance on a money market fund shouldn’t trouble you. 
Mutual fund companies can’t fail because they have a dollar invested in 
securities for every dollar that you deposit in their money funds. By contrast, 
banks are required to have available just a fraction of every dollar that you 
hand over to them.
A money market fund’s investments can decline slightly in value, which can 
cause the money market fund’s share price to fall below a dollar. In a few 
cases, money market funds have bought some bad investments. However, 
in each and every case except one, the parent company running the money 
market fund infused cash into the affected fund, thus enabling it to maintain 
the $1-per-share price.

148
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
One U.S. money market fund did “break the buck.” It didn’t take money in from 
people like you or us but was run by a bunch of small banks for themselves. 
This money market fund made some boneheaded investments. The share price 
of the fund declined by 6 percent, and the fund owners decided to disband the 
fund; they didn’t bail it out because they would only have been repaying 
themselves.
 
Stick with bigger mutual fund companies if you’re worried about the lack of 
CDIC insurance. They have the financial wherewithal and the largest incentive 
to save a foundering money market fund. Fortunately, the bigger fund compa-
nies have the best money funds anyway. You can find more details about 
money market funds in Chapter 8.
High-interest savings accounts
In many cases, you may be looking for a place where you can simply keep 
some money on stash. Perhaps you know you’ll need to tap into it in the 
short term. Or maybe you want a place to put your emergency funds that 
will ensure your capital is protected but still earn you a decent return. High-
interest savings accounts offer a great, and in some ways superior, alternative 
to money market funds.
High-interest savings accounts are typically made available by institutions 
that don’t have — and don’t have plans to build — a nationwide string of 
bricks-and-mortar branches. This saves them substantially on staffing and 
other overhead. As a result, they’re able to offer interest rates that equal and 
even surpass those offered by money market funds. They generally have no 
minimum balance requirements, and offer other benefits not available with 
money market mutual funds. These benefits can include the convenience of 
telephone and online transactions, as well as access to your money through 
bank machines, often with no fees attached.
Although the idea of dealing at arm’s length with a company that doesn’t have 
a branch on your local street corner may seem a little unsettling, you need 
not worry. These accounts are not fly-by-night operations. President’s Choice 
Financial, for example, is a co-venture between Loblaw Ltd. and Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce, while ING Direct Bank is a division of International 
Nederlanden Groep, a Dutch bank. They also come with CDIC insurance, which 
protects you up to $100,000. Other institutions that offer high-interest savings 
accounts are Achieva Financial, Canadian Tire Financial, Citizens Bank, HSBC, 
ICICI Bank, Manulife Bank, Outlook Financial, RBC, and Vancity. The discount 
brokerage Scotia iTrade also offers a high-interest savings account, as does 
Altamira, the fund company.

 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
To open an account, you need to fill out an application and send in a cheque. 
You can then set up your account so that money can be electronically moved 
back and forth between your regular bank or trust account and your high-
interest account. You arrange deposits and withdrawals over the telephone 
or on the Internet. The transaction in most cases is completed by midnight 
of the next business day after you place your order. You can even arrange to 
have your paycheque deposited directly.
Profiting from a Tax-Free Savings Account
As long as you don’t need to regularly access the money, consider a high-
interest savings account or money market account that is inside a Tax-Free 
Savings Account (TFSA) wrapper. This saves you the tax you would have 
to otherwise pay on the interest you earn, which if earned outside a tax-
deferred account or plan is taxed at your marginal tax rate.
You can put up to a maximum of $5,000 into a TFSA each year. If you put in 
less in any year, the unused portion gets added on to what you can contribute 
in the future. TFSAs came into being at the beginning of 2009, and most of the 
high-interest savings account choices we’ve listed offer the option to earn 
these higher rates inside a TFSA. (For more about TFSAs, refer to Chapter 3.)
Why Bother with Bonds?
Conservative investors (that is, conservative when it comes to taking risk, 
not when professing their political orientation) prefer bonds. Otherwise-
aggressive investors who seek diversification or investments for shorter-term 
financial goals also prefer bonds. The reason: Bonds offer higher yields than 
bank accounts, usually without as much volatility as the stock market.
Bonds are similar to GICs, except that bonds are securities that trade in 
the market with a fluctuating value. For example, you can purchase a 
bond, scheduled to mature five years from now, that a company such as 
Bombardier, the maker of moving things from snowmobiles to planes and 
trains, issues. A Bombardier five-year bond may pay you 6 percent interest. 
The company sends you interest payments on the bond for five years. And 
as long as Bombardier doesn’t have a financial catastrophe, the company 
returns your original investment to you after the five years is up. So in effect, 
you’re lending your money to Bombardier (instead of the bank when you 
deposit money in a bank account).

150
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
The worst that can happen to your bond investment is that Bombardier’s 
business goes into a tailspin and the company ends up in financial ruin — also 
known as bankruptcy. If that happens, you may lose all of your original invest-
ment and miss out on the remaining interest payments you were supposed to 
receive.
But bonds that high-quality companies such as Bombardier issue are quite 
safe — they rarely default. Besides, you don’t have to invest all of your 
money in just one or two bonds. If you own bonds in many companies and 
one bond unexpectedly takes a hit, it affects only a small portion of your 
portfolio. And unlike GICs, you can generally sell your bonds any time you 
desire at minimal cost. (Selling and buying most bond mutual funds costs 
nothing, as we explain in Chapter 8.)
 
Bond investors accept the risk of default because bonds generally pay you 
more than bank savings and money market mutual funds, but there’s a catch. 
As we discuss later in this chapter, bonds are riskier than money market funds 
and savings accounts because their value can fall if interest rates rise. Plus 
you’re forgoing the security of CDIC insurance as compared to bank accounts. 
However, bonds tend to be more stable in value than stocks. (We cover the 
risks and returns of bonds and stocks in Chapter 2.)
Investing in bonds is a time-honoured way to earn a better rate of return on 
money that you don’t plan to use within the next couple of years or more. As 
with stocks, bonds can generally be sold any day that the financial markets 
are open. Because their value fluctuates, though, you’re more likely to lose 
money if you’re forced to sell your bonds sooner rather than later. In the 
short term, if the bond market happens to fall and you need to sell, you could 
lose money. In the longer term, as is the case with stocks, you’re far less 
likely to lose money.
 
Don’t put your emergency cash reserve into bonds — that’s what a money 
market fund or bank savings account is for. And don’t put too much of your 
longer-term investment money into bonds, either. As we explain in Chapter 2, 
bonds are generally inferior investments for making your money grow. Growth-
oriented investments, such as stocks, real estate, and your own business, hold 
the greatest potential to build real wealth.
The following list provides some common financial goals and reasons why 
investing some money in bonds can make sense:
 
✓ A major purchase: This purchase, such as buying a home or some other 
major expenditure, should be one that won’t happen for at least two 
years. Shorter-term bonds may work for you as a higher-yielding and 
slightly riskier alternative to money market funds.

151
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
 
✓ Diversification: Bonds don’t move in tandem with the performance of 
other types of investments, such as stocks. In fact, in a terrible economic 
environment (such as during the Great Depression and 2008–2009), bonds 
may appreciate in value while riskier investments such as stocks plunge.
 
✓ Retirement investments: You may invest some of your money in bonds 
as part of a longer-term investment strategy, such as for retirement. You 
should have an overall plan for how you want to invest your money, 
sometimes referred to as an asset allocation strategy (see Chapter 8). 
Aggressive, younger investors should keep less of their retirement 
money in bonds than older folks who are nearing retirement.
 
✓ Income-producing investments: If you’re retired or not working, bonds 
can be useful because they’re better at producing current income than 
many other investments.
Assessing the Different Types of Bonds
Bonds aren’t as complicated and unique as people, but they’re certainly 
more complex than a bank savings account. And thanks to shady marketing 
practices by some investing companies and salespeople who sell bonds, you 
can have your work cut out for you while trying to get a handle on what many 
bonds really are and how they differ from their peers.
Bonds differ from one another according to a number of factors — length of 
time to maturity, interest rate, credit quality, and the entities that issue the 
bonds. After you have a handle on these issues, you’re ready to consider 
investing in individual bonds and bond mutual funds.
Determining when you get your 
money back: Maturity matters
 
Maturity simply means the time at which the bond promises to pay back your 
principal — next year, in 5 years, in 30 years, and so on. You need to care how 
long it takes a bond to mature because a bond’s maturity gives you a good 
(although far-from-perfect) sense of how volatile a bond may be if interest 
rates change. If interest rates fall, bond prices rise; if interest rates rise, bond 
prices fall. Longer-term bonds drop more in price when the overall level of 
interest rates rises.

152
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Suppose you’re considering investing in two bonds that the same organization 
issues and that both yield 7 percent. The bonds differ from one another only 
in when they will mature: One is a 2-year bond; the other, a 20-year bond. If 
interest rates were to rise just 1 percent (from 7 percent to 8 percent), the 
2-year bond might decline about 2 percent in value, whereas the 20-year bond 
could fall approximately five times as much — 10 percent.
If you hold a bond until it matures, you get your principal back unless the 
issuer defaults. In the meantime, however, if interest rates rise, bond prices 
fall. The reason is simple: If the bond that you hold is issued at, say, 7 percent, 
and interest rates on similar bonds rise to 8 percent, no one (unless they don’t 
know any better) wants to purchase your 7 percent bond. The value of your 
bond has to decrease enough so that it effectively yields 8 percent.
Bonds are generally classified by the length of time until maturity:
 
✓ Short-term bonds mature in the next few years.
 
✓ Intermediate-term bonds come due within three to ten years.
 
✓ Long-term bonds mature in more than 10 years and generally up to 
30 years. Although rare, a number of companies issue 100-year bonds! 
A number of railroads did, as well as Coca-Cola, Disney, Nova Scotia 
Power, IBM, the New York Port Authority, and the government of China! 
Such bonds are quite dangerous to purchase, especially if they’re issued 
during a period of relatively low interest rates.
Most of the time, longer-term bonds pay higher yields than short-term bonds. 
You can look at a chart of the current yield of similar bonds plotted against 
when they mature — such a chart is known as a yield curve. At most times, 
this curve slopes upward. Investors generally demand a higher rate of inter-
est for taking the risk of holding longer-term bonds. Most financial newspa-
pers, magazines, and Web sites carry a current chart of the yield curve.
Weighing the likelihood of default
In addition to being issued for various lengths of time, bonds differ from one 
another in the creditworthiness of the issuer. Every year, billions of dollars’ 
worth of bonds default (that sounds like a lot, but it’s a small fraction of 
the multi-trillion-dollar bond market). To minimize investing in bonds that 
default, purchase highly rated bonds. Credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Duff & Phelps rate the credit quality and likeli-
hood of default of bonds.
The credit rating of a bond depends on the issuer’s (company or government) 
ability to pay back its debt. Bond credit ratings are usually done on some 
sort of a letter-grade scale, for example, where AAA is the highest rating, with 

153
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
ratings descending through AA and A, followed by BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, 
and so on.
 
✓ AAA- and AA-rated bonds are considered high-grade or high-credit quality 
bonds. Such bonds possess little chance — a fraction of 1 percent — of 
default.
 
✓ A- and BBB-rated bonds are considered investment-grade or general-
quality bonds.
 
✓ BB- or lower-rated bonds are known as junk bonds (or by their marketed 
name, high-yield bonds). Junk bonds, also known as non-investment grade, 
are more likely to default — perhaps as many as a couple of percent per 
year actually default.
You may ask yourself why any right-minded investor would buy a bond with 
a low credit rating. That’s because companies pay a higher interest rate on 
lower-quality bonds to attract investors. The lower a bond’s credit rating and 
quality, the higher the yield you can and should expect from such a bond. 
Poorer-quality bonds, though, aren’t for the faint of heart because they’re 
generally more volatile in value.
 
We don’t recommend buying individual junk bonds — consider investing in 
these only through a well-run junk-bond fund.
Examining the issuers
Bonds also differ from one another according to the type of organization 
that issues them — in other words, what kind of organization you lend your 
money to. The following sections go over the major options and let you know 
when each option may make sense for you.
Treasury bills
Treasury bills, or T-bills, are short-term government bonds available for terms 
of 3, 6, and 12 months. The federal government as well as some provinces 
issue T-bills in large denominations, but many financial institutions repackage 
them and make them available to the public in amounts as small as $1,000.
T-bills don’t pay any actual interest. Instead, you purchase them at a discount 
to their face value. Your return — in effect, the interest you make — is the 
difference between your purchase price and the face value, which you receive 
at maturity. You’ll usually see this return displayed as an interest rate by most 
financial institutions. This is done simply as a way to help you assess the 
return you’ll make.

154
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Government of Canada bonds
In addition to Treasury bills, the federal government — Canada’s biggest 
debtor of them all — issues marketable bonds. These can be bought in 
denominations as low as $1,000. Government of Canada marketable bonds — 
like most bonds — are usually quoted as a price per $100 of the value at maturity 
of the bond. Interest on Government of Canada bonds is paid twice a year.
 
The best use of T-bills and Government of Canada Bonds is in place of bank 
GICs. If you feel secure with the CDIC insurance that a bank GIC provides (up 
to $100,000 of your investments in qualifying accounts and GICs with any 
one financial institution), check out a T-bill or federal marketable bond. 
Government of Canada bonds sometimes pay the same or better interest 
rate as a GIC that matures in the same length of time. If you hunt around, 
you may stumble upon a bank that pays a slightly higher interest rate than 
a comparable marketable bond. Unless you really shop around for a GIC, 
you’ll likely earn a lower return on a GIC than on a marketable bond. No 
commission is charged for buying or selling these securities. Instead, bro-
kers make their money by building a commission into the price of the bond.
Canada Savings Bonds
Buying Canada Savings Bonds (CSBs) every year used to be an almost patriotic 
habit to keep. Their name and image may leave you feeling slightly warm 
and fuzzy, but in most cases, you are better off with a high-interest savings 
account or a GIC.
If you cash in CSBs within three months of the issue date, you get only your 
original investment back. You can get the same easy access to your money 
with a high-interest savings account, which also offers much better returns.
CSBs are often thought of as a good choice for a short-term investment when 
you want to earn a decent return on your money while having the option 
to cash out at any time. When you cash them in you get back your original 
investment, known as the face amount, as well as the interest that has been 
earned up to the end of the previous month. (If you cash in your CSBs before 
they mature, try to do it at the beginning rather than the end of a month to 
maximize your interest.)
The interest rate on CSBs is guaranteed for at least one year. When interest 
rates are climbing, the government sometimes also guarantees minimum 
rates for a set period. Because they can be cashed in at any time, CSBs offer 
another useful feature: If interest rates rise, the government often resets their 
rates to keep them attractive and prevent large-scale redemptions.
You have to pay tax each year on the interest earned on CSBs issued from 
1990 onwards. This applies even if you choose the compound-interest option. 
For compound-interest CSBs purchased before 1990, you can choose to 
declare earned interest once every three years.

155
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
Canada Savings Bonds: The details
Unlike other bonds, Canada Savings Bonds 
(CSBs) are registered in your name. You can’t 
sell them to others, including your investment 
adviser, or on the bond market. CSBs go on 
sale every fall, when they’re made available for 
several weeks up to several months, depending 
on anticipated demand. You can buy them from 
almost all financial institutions, including banks, 
trust companies, and credit unions. You can also 
buy them from most investment dealers and 
discount brokers.
Two basic types of Canada Savings Bonds are 
available: regular-interest bonds and compound-
interest bonds. Regular-interest bonds pay inter-
est annually until they mature on the anniversary 
of the issue date or when you redeem them. You 
can have the interest sent to you by cheque 
or deposited directly into your bank account. 
Regular-interest bonds come in denominations 
of $300, $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000.
With the second type of CSBs, compound-
interest bonds, instead of paying out the inter-
est, it is automatically reinvested and added to 
your original principal until your bonds mature 
or you cash them in. Compound-interest bonds 
can be bought in denominations of $100, $300, 
$1,000, $5,000, and $10,000. Many companies 
set up purchase plans so that you can buy them 
through automatic deductions from your pay-
cheque. Compound-interest CSBs issued since 
1990 require that you pay tax on the interest 
earned each year, even though you don’t actu-
ally receive the money.
Compound-interest bonds, unlike regular-
interest bonds, also give you the option of hold-
ing them inside a self-directed RRSP or RRIF. If 
you don’t have a self-directed RRSP, you can 
designate that you want to hold your CSBs in an 
RRSP when you make your purchase. The gov-
ernment will create what’s called The Canada 
RSP — a no-fee plan in which you can hold your 
CSBs and benefit from tax-free growth. You can 
also contribute other CSBs you may have into 
this account. CSBs can also be held inside a 
Tax-Free Savings Account.
A new type of CSB was introduced in 1998 
called the Canada Premium Bond, or CPB. You 
can buy a CPB for as little as $100. Unlike regu-
lar CSBs, Canada Premium Bonds can only be 
redeemed for a short period each year — on 
the anniversary of the issue date and for the fol-
lowing 30 days. In return for this lack of liquidity 
compared with regular CSBs, Canada Premium 
Bonds come with a slightly higher rate of inter-
est. If you hold CSBs inside a Canada RRIF — 
a registered retirement income fund set up 
with the government to hold your CSBs — you 
can cash them in order to meet your minimum 
mandatory RRIF withdrawals without paying a 
penalty. Canada Premium bonds are available 
as both regular-interest bonds and compound-
interest bonds.
 
CSBs are often seen as a good choice for a short-term investment when you 
want to earn a decent return on your money while having the option to cash 
out at any time. However, you’ll usually earn more with a high-interest sav-
ings account, which we discuss earlier on in this section. You can generally 
get close to double the interest rate available on CSBs with a high-interest 
savings account or a GIC. The rate of return on CSBs offered in the fall of 
2008, for example, was just 2 percent. Inflation at the time was pegged at 
3.5 percent. Meanwhile, high-interest savings accounts were offering 3 to 4 
percent, about what GICs were paying.

156
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are city and regional government bonds that pay interest. 
The rate is typically better than what you’d receive from other bonds with a 
similar maturity. They also usually offer a better rate than that paid by GICs 
with a comparable term. Unlike a GIC, though, you’re not locked in, and you 
can sell them when you want.
Corporate bonds
Companies such as Bell, Domtar, and SunLife issue corporate bonds. In the 
section “Understanding bond prices,” later in this chapter, we show you how 
to read the newspaper listings for such bonds. If you buy corporate bonds 
through a well-managed mutual fund, an approach we advocate, you don’t 
need to read the newspaper listings.
Mortgage bonds
Remember that mortgage you took out when you purchased your home? 
Well, you can actually purchase a bond to invest in a portfolio of mortgages 
just like yours! Many banks actually sell their mortgages as bonds in the 
financial markets, which allows other investors to invest in them. The mort-
gages are bundled together and sold as mortgage-backed securities, or MBSs. 
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, a government agency, usu-
ally guarantees repayment of principal on MBSs at the bond’s maturity. MBSs 
are sometimes referred to as Cannie Maes, a play on Ginnie Maes, the nick-
name for the U.S. mortgage-backed securities called Government National 
Mortgage Associations certificates.
The majority of mortgage bonds are quite safe to invest in. The risky ones 
that were in the news in the late 2000s for defaulting were so-called subprime 
mortgages, which lacked government agency backing.
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are hybrid securities — they’re bonds that you can convert 
under specified circumstances into a preset number of shares in the company 
that issued the bond. Although these bonds do pay interest, their yield is lower 
than nonconvertible bonds because convertibles offer you the upside potential 
of being able to make more money if the underlying stock rises.
Stripped bonds
You can also buy marketable bonds that don’t pay any interest. These bonds 
have had their interest coupons removed, or stripped off, thus the name 
stripped bonds, or strips. Stripped bonds are sold at a discount to the face 
value. The difference between the price you pay to buy a stripped bond and 
its value when it matures is expressed as an annual yield.

157
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
One benefit of strips is that they save you from having to reinvest the twice-
yearly interest payments if you aren’t using the bond as a source of regular 
income. This same feature makes their market price respond much more 
dramatically to changes in general interest rate levels. If interest rates rise, 
for example, someone who is receiving semi-annual interest payments has 
a chance to put that income back to work at the higher available rates. An 
investor who holds a stripped bond, however, has all her money locked in at 
the lower rates that were available when she purchased the bond.
Similarly, if interest rates fall, the value of the stripped bond will rise higher 
than that of regular bonds. With a regular bond, some of the interest is being 
paid out that, if reinvested, will earn a lower rate of return than the original 
rate at which the stripped bond was sold. As a result, strip bonds are highly 
sensitive to interest rate changes, which is why we don’t recommend them 
unless you plan on holding them until they mature.
 
If you hold stripped bonds until they mature, you don’t have to worry about 
how their value fluctuates along the way. You know exactly what your yield 
will be when you purchase them, and you can simply tuck them away knowing 
your return is guaranteed.
 
One drawback to stripped bonds is that you have to declare the accrued inter-
est each year as income, even though you don’t actually receive any ongoing 
payments. As a result, they generally should be purchased only inside an 
RRSP, RESP, or TFSA, where you don’t have to pay any tax on the accrued 
interest. Shopping around is important when buying strips.
Inflation-protected bonds
Bonds called Government of Canada Real Return Bonds, with an interest rate 
that fluctuates with the rate of inflation, are also available. Unlike the stan-
dard fixed-coupon marketable bonds that pay out a fixed amount of interest, 
the interest paid on Real Return Bonds is adjusted according to the cost of 
living, measured by the consumer price index.
Compared with traditional Government of Canada bonds, the inflation-indexed 
bonds carry a lower interest rate. The reason is that the other portion of your 
return with these inflation-indexed bonds comes from the inflation adjustment 
to the principal you invest, which gets added back into principal. For example, 
if inflation were 3 percent the first year you hold your inflation-indexed bond 
into which you invested $10,000, your principal would increase to $10,300 at 
the end of the first year.

158
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
What’s appealing about these bonds is that no matter what happens with the 
rate of inflation, investors who buy inflation-indexed bonds will always earn 
some return (the yield or interest rate paid) above and beyond the rate of 
inflation. Thus, holders of inflation-indexed Government of Canada bonds 
won’t have the purchasing power of their principal or interest eroded by high 
inflation.
 
Because inflation-indexed bonds protect the investor from the ravages of 
inflation, they represent a less risky security. As we discuss in Chapter 2, 
lower risk usually translates into lower returns.
Buying Bonds
You can invest in bonds in one of two major ways: You can purchase indi-
vidual bonds, or you can invest in a professionally selected and managed 
portfolio of bonds via a bond mutual fund (newer exchange-traded funds are 
a twist on mutual funds). In this section, we help you make that decision and 
promptly send you to Chapter 8 should you fall on the side of mutual funds. 
If you want to take the individual-bond route, we cover that path here, where 
we explain how to decipher bond listings, which you find in financial news-
papers or online, and the purchasing process.
International bonds
You can buy bonds outside the country that you 
call home. If you live in Canada, for example, 
you can buy most of the bonds that we describe 
in this chapter from foreign issuers as well. 
International bonds are riskier to you because 
their interest payments can be offset by 
currency price changes.
The prices of foreign bonds tend not to move 
in tandem with Canadian bonds. Foreign bond 
values benefit from, and thus protect against, a 
declining Canadian dollar and, therefore, offer 
some diversification value. That said, foreign 
bonds aren’t a vital holding for a diversified 
portfolio. Foreign bonds are generally more 
expensive to purchase and hold than compa-
rable domestic bonds.

159
 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
Deciding between individual 
bonds and bond mutual funds
 
Unless the bonds you’re considering purchasing are easy to analyze and 
homogeneous (such as Government of Canada bonds), you’re generally better 
off investing in bonds through a mutual fund. The first reason is diversification. 
You shouldn’t put your money into a small number of bonds that companies in 
the same industry issue or that mature at the same time. It’s difficult to cost-
effectively build a diversified bond portfolio with individual issues unless you 
have a substantial amount of money ($50,000) that you want to invest in bonds.
If you purchase individual bonds through an investment dealer, you’re going 
to pay a commission. In most cases, the commission cost is hidden — the 
dealer quotes you a price for the bond that includes the commission. Even if 
you use a discount broker, these fees take a healthy bite out of your invest-
ment. The smaller the amount that you invest, the bigger the bite — on a 
$1,000 bond, the commission fee can equal up to 5 percent. Commissions 
take a smaller bite out of larger bonds — perhaps less than 0.5 percent if you 
use discount brokers.
The best reason to invest in bond funds instead of individual bonds is that 
you’ve got better things to do with your time. Do you really want to research 
bonds and go bond shopping? Bonds are boring! And bonds and the compa-
nies that stand behind them aren’t that simple to understand. For example, 
did you know that some bonds can be called before their maturity date? 
Companies often call bonds (which means they repay the principal before 
maturity) to save money if interest rates drop significantly. After you pur-
chase a bond, you need to do the same things that a good bond mutual fund 
portfolio manager needs to do, such as track the issuer’s creditworthiness 
and monitor other important financial developments.
A final reason to invest in bonds through a mutual fund is that it’s cost effec-
tive. Great bond funds are yours for less than 1 percent per year in operating 
expenses. Selecting good bond funds isn’t hard, as we explain in Chapter 8.
Understanding bond prices
Business-focused publications, such as The Wall Street Journal, provide daily 
bond pricing. For Canadian bonds you’ll need to speak with an investment 
adviser or access your investment dealer account online. Most Canadian 

160
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
newspapers no longer regularly carry bond quotes, and unlike stock quotes, 
bond quotes aren’t generally available for free online. The following steps 
walk you through the bond listing for PhilEl (Philadelphia Electric), shown in 
Figure 7-1:
 
1. Bond name: This tells you who issued the bond. In this case, the issuer 
is a large utility company, Philadelphia Electric.
 
2. Funny numbers after company name: The first part of the numerical 
sequence here — 71/8 — refers to the original interest rate (7.125 per-
cent) that this bond paid when it was issued. This interest rate is known 
as the coupon rate, which is a percentage of the maturity value of the 
bond. The second part of the numerical sequence — 23 — refers to the 
year that the bond matures (2023, in this case).
 
3. Current yield: Divide the interest paid, 7.125, by the current price per 
bond, $93, to arrive at the current yield. In this case, it equals (rounded 
off) 7.7 percent.
 
4. Volume: Indicates the number of bonds that traded on this day.
 
5. Close: Shows the last price the bond traded at.
 
6. Change: Indicates how this day’s close compares with the previous 
day’s close. In this case, this bond rose 21/8 points. Some bonds don’t 
trade all that often. Notice that some bonds were up and others were 
down on this particular day. The demand of new buyers and the supply 
of interested sellers influence the price movement of a given bond.
 
In addition to the direction of overall interest rates, changes in the financial 
health of the company that stands behind the bond strongly affect the price of 
an individual bond.

With the exception of Government of Canada bonds, purchasing most types of 
individual bonds, such as corporate and mortgage bonds, is a treacherous and 
time-consuming undertaking. Here’s our advice for doing it right and minimiz-
ing the chance of a catastrophic mistake:
 
✓ Don’t be suckered into high yields — buy quality. Yes, junk bonds pay 
higher yields, but they also have a much higher chance of default. And 
did you know what a subprime mortgage was before reporters were all 
over the news in 2007 and 2008 saying that defaults were on the rise? 
Subprime mortgages are mortgage loans made to borrowers with lower 
credit ratings who pay higher interest rates because of their higher risk 
of default. Nothing personal, but you’re not going to do as good a job as 
a professional money manager at spotting problems and red flags. Stick 
with highly rated bonds so you don’t have to worry about and suffer 
through these unfortunate consequences.
 
✓ Understand that bonds may be called. Many bonds, especially corpo-
rate bonds, can legally be called before maturity. This means that the 
bond issuer pays you back early, because it doesn’t need to borrow as 
much money or because interest rates have fallen and the borrower 
wants to reissue new bonds at a lower interest rate. Be especially careful 
about purchasing bonds that were issued at higher interest rates than 
those that currently prevail. Borrowers pay off such bonds first.
Assessing individual bonds that you already own
If you already own individual bonds, and they 
fit your financial objectives and tax situation, 
you can hold them until maturity because 
you already incurred a commission when you 
purchased them; selling them now would just 
create an additional fee. When the bonds 
mature, the investment adviser who sold them 
to you will probably be more than happy to sell 
you some more. That’s the time to check out 
good bond mutual funds (see Chapter 8).
Don’t mistakenly think that your current indi-
vidual bonds pay the yield they had when they 
were originally issued. (That yield is the number 
listed in the name of the bond on your invest-
ment dealer account statement.) As the market 
level of interest rates changes, the effective 
yield (the interest payment divided by the bond’s 
price) on your bonds fluctuates as well, to rise 
and fall with the market level of rates. So if rates 
have fallen since you bought your bonds, the 
value of those bonds has increased — which in 
turn reduces the effective yield that you earn. 

162
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
✓ Diversify. Invest and hold bonds from a variety of companies in different
 industries to buffer changes in the economy that adversely affect one 
industry or a few industries more than others. Of the money that you want 
to invest in bonds, don’t put more than 5 percent into any one bond. That 
means that you need to hold at least 20 bonds. Diversification requires a 
good chunk of change to invest given the size of most bonds and because 
high fees erode your investment balance if you invest too little. If you 
can’t achieve this level of diversification, use a bond mutual fund.
 
✓ Shop around. Just like when you buy a car, shop around for good prices 
on the bonds that you have in mind. The hard part is doing an apples-to-
apples comparison because different investment dealers may not be able 
to offer the same exact bond as other dealers. Remember that the two big-
gest determinants of what a bond should yield are its maturity date and 
its credit rating (both of which we discuss earlier in this chapter).
 
Unless you invest in boring, simple-to-understand bonds such as Government 
of Canada bonds, you’re better off investing in bonds via the best bond 
mutual funds. One exception is if you absolutely, positively must receive 
your principal back on a certain date. Because bond funds don’t mature, 
individual bonds with the correct maturity for you may best suit your needs. 
Consider Government of Canada bonds because they carry such low default 
risk. Otherwise, you need a lot of time, money, and patience to invest well in 
individual bonds.
Out of sight: Fluctuations of mortgages, 
GICs, and T-bills
One of the allures of non-bond lending invest-
ments, such as private mortgages, GICs, and 
T-bills, is that they don’t fluctuate in value — at 
least not that you can see. Such investments 
appear safer and less volatile. You can’t watch 
your principal fluctuate in value because you 
can’t look up the value daily, the way you can 
with bonds and stocks.
But the principal values of your mortgage, GIC, 
and T-bill investments really do fluctuate; you 
just don’t see the fluctuations! As we explain 
in the section “Determining when you get your 
money back: Maturity matters,” earlier in this 
chapter, just as the market value of a bond 
drops when interest rates rise, so does the 
market value of these investments, and for the 
same reasons. At higher interest rates, investors 
expect a discounted price on your fixed-interest 
rate investment because they always have the 
alternative of purchasing a new mortgage, GIC, 
or T-bill at the higher prevailing rates. Some of 
these investments are actually bought and sold 
(and behave just like bonds) among investors 
on what’s known as a secondary market.
If the normal volatility of a bond’s principal 
value makes you queasy, try not to follow your 
investments so closely!

 Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments 
Being Wary of Private Mortgages
In the section “Mortgage bonds,” earlier in this chapter, we discuss invest-
ing in mortgages that resemble the ones that you take out to purchase a 
home. To directly invest in mortgages, you can lend your money to people 
who need money to buy or refinance real estate. Such loans are known as 
mortgages or second mortgages, in the case where your loan is second in line 
behind someone’s primary mortgage.
Private mortgage investments appeal to investors who don’t like the volatil-
ity of the stock and bond markets and aren’t satisfied with the seemingly low 
returns on bonds or other common lending investments. Private mortgages 
sometimes seem to offer the best of both worlds — stock-market-like 10-plus 
percent returns without volatility.
 
Mortgage and real estate agents often arrange mortgage investments, so you 
must tread carefully because these people have a vested interest in seeing the 
deal done. Otherwise, the mortgage broker doesn’t get paid for closing the loan, 
and the real estate broker doesn’t get a commission for selling a property.
One broker who also happens to write about real estate wrote a newspaper 
column describing mortgages as the “perfect real estate investment” and 
added that mortgages are a “high-yield, low-risk investment.” If that wasn’t 
enough to get you to whip out your chequebook, the writer/broker further 
gushed that mortgages are great investments because you have “little or no 
management, no physical labour.”
You know by now that a low-risk, high-yield investment doesn’t exist. Earning 
a relatively high interest rate goes hand in hand with accepting relatively high 
risk. The risk is that the borrower can default — which leaves you holding the 
bag. (In the mid- to late 2000s, mortgage defaults escalated significantly.) More 
specifically, you can get stuck with a property that you may need to foreclose 
on, and if you don’t hold the first mortgage, you’re not first in line with a claim 
on the property.
The fact that private mortgages are high risk should be obvious when you 
consider why the borrower elects to obtain needed funds privately rather 
than through a bank. Put yourself in the borrower’s shoes. As a property 
buyer or owner, if you can obtain a mortgage through a conventional lender, 
such as a bank, wouldn’t you do so? After all, banks generally give better 
interest rates. If a mortgage broker offers you a deal where you can, for exam-
ple, borrow money at 10 percent when the going bank rate is, say, 6 percent, 
the deal must carry a fair amount of risk.

164
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
We would avoid these investments. If you really want to invest in such 
mortgages, you must do some time-consuming homework on the borrower’s 
financial situation. A banker doesn’t lend someone money without examining 
a borrower’s assets, liabilities, and monthly expenses, and you shouldn’t 
either. Be careful to check the borrower’s credit, and get a large down 
payment (at least 20 percent). The best circumstance in which to be a lender 
is if you sell some of your own real estate and you’re willing to act as the 
bank and provide the financing to the buyer in the form of a first mortgage.
Also recognize that your mortgage investment carries interest rate risk: If 
you need to “sell” it early, you’d have to discount it, perhaps substantially if 
interest rates have increased since you purchased it. Try not to lend so much 
money on one mortgage that it represents more than 5 percent of your total 
investments.
 
If you’re willing to lend your money to borrowers who carry a relatively high 
risk of defaulting, consider investing in high-yield (junk) bond mutual funds 
instead. With these funds, you can at least diversify your money across many 
borrowers, and you benefit from the professional review and due diligence of 
the fund management team. You can also consider lending money to family 
members.

Mastering Mutual Funds
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at reasons to invest in mutual funds
▶ Uncovering the secrets of successful fund investing
▶ Deciding how to allocate your assets
▶ Finding the best stock, bond, hybrid, and money market funds
A
mutual fund is simply a big pool of money collected from lots of typical 
investors. The mutual fund manager uses this pool of money to buy a 
bunch of investments. These can be stocks, bonds, or other assets — or a 
combination of these types of different investments — that meet the 
particular fund’s investment criteria.
The better funds enable you to easily and cost-effectively diversify your 
investments — that is, invest in many different industries and companies. 
(In the earlier chapters of this part of the book, we explain all about stocks, 
bonds, and other common securities. If you understand these securities, 
you can understand mutual funds.)
When you invest in a fund, you buy shares and become a shareholder of the 
fund. Good mutual funds enable you to have some of the best money man-
agers in the world direct the investment of your money. Because efficient 
funds take most of the hassle and cost out of figuring out which companies 
to invest in, they’re among the finest investment vehicles available today. 
Different types of mutual funds can help you meet various financial goals — 
that’s one reason that Canadians have close to $497 billion invested in funds! 
You can use money market funds for something most everybody needs — an 
emergency savings stash of three to six months’ living expenses. Or perhaps 
you’re thinking about saving for a home purchase, retirement, or future 
educational costs. If so, you can consider some stock and bond mutual funds.
 
Too many people plunge in to mutual funds without looking at their overall 
financial situation and, in their haste, often end up paying more taxes and 
overlooking other valuable financial strategies. If you haven’t taken a compre-
hensive look at your personal finances, read Chapter 3 to begin this important 
process.

Discovering the Benefits 
of the Best Funds
The best mutual funds are superior investment vehicles for people of all eco-
nomic means and for accomplishing many financial objectives. The following 
sections go over the main reasons for investing in mutual funds rather than 
individual securities.
Professional management
The mutual fund investment company hires a portfolio manager and researchers 
whose full-time jobs are to research and purchase suitable investments for the 
fund. These people screen the universe of investments for those that meet 
the fund’s stated objectives.
Typically, fund managers are graduates of the top business and finance 
schools, where they learned portfolio management and securities valua-
tion and selection. Many have additional investing credentials, such as the 
Chartered Financial Analyst’s (CFA) degree. In addition to their educational 
training, the best fund managers typically possess ten or more years of expe-
rience in analyzing and selecting investments.
For most fund managers and researchers, finding the best investments is more 
than a full-time job. Fund managers do tons of analysis that you probably lack 
the time or expertise to perform. For example, fund managers assess company 
financial statements; interview a company’s managers to get a sense of the 
company’s business strategies and vision; examine competitor strategies; 
speak with a company’s customers, suppliers, and industry consultants; and 
attend trade shows and read industry periodicals.
 
In short, a mutual fund management team does more research, number 
crunching, and due diligence than you could ever have the energy or expertise 
to do in what little free time you have. Investing in mutual funds frees up time 
for friendships, family relationships, and maybe even your sex life — don’t 
miss the terrific timesaving benefits of fund investing!
Cost efficiency
Mutual funds are a cheaper, more communal way of getting your investment 
work done. When you invest your money in an efficiently managed mutual fund, 
it likely costs you less than trading individual securities on your own. Fund man-
agers can buy and sell securities for a fraction of the cost that you pay.

167
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Funds also spread the cost of research over thousands of investors. The most 
efficiently managed stock mutual funds cost less than 2 percent per year in fees. 
(Bonds and money market funds cost much less — in the neighbourhood of 
1 percent per year or less.) Funds that simply try to mirror the performance 
of a specific market such as the Toronto Stock Exchange charge annual fees 
of less than 0.75 percent per year — that’s less than a $7.50 annual charge per 
$1,000 you invest. Newer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are like index mutual 
funds (see the section “Buy index funds” later in this chapter), except that they 
trade on a stock exchange and, in the best cases, may have a slightly lower 
management fee than their sibling index mutual funds.
Diversification
Diversification is a big attraction for many investors who choose mutual 
funds. Most funds own stocks or bonds from dozens of companies, thus 
diversifying against the risk of bad news from any single company or sector. 
Achieving such diversification on your own is difficult and expensive unless 
you have a few hundred thousand dollars and a great deal of time to invest.
Mutual funds typically invest in 25 to 100 securities or more. Proper diversifi-
cation increases the chances of the fund earning higher returns with less risk.
 
Although most mutual funds are diversified, some aren’t. For example, some 
stock funds invest exclusively in stocks of a single industry (for example, health 
care) or country (such as Japan). We’re not fans of these funds because of the 
narrowness of their investments and their typically higher operating fees.
Reasonable investment minimums
Most funds have low minimum investment requirements. Many funds have 
minimums of $500 or less. Retirement plan investors can often invest with 
even less. Some funds even offer monthly investment plans, so you can start 
with as little as $50 per month.
 
Even if you have lots of money to invest, you should consider mutual funds. 
Increasing numbers of fund companies offer higher-balance customers special 
funds with lower annual operating expenses and thus even better returns 
(more on these funds later in this chapter).

168
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Different funds for different folks
 
Some people think that mutual funds = stock market investing = risky. That’s 
wrong. The majority of money in mutual funds isn’t in the stock market. You 
may select the funds that take on the kinds of risks that you’re comfortable 
with and that meet your financial goals. Following is a list of the three major 
types of mutual funds:
 
✓ Stock funds: If you want your money to grow over a long period of time 
(and you can handle down as well as up years), choose funds that invest 
more heavily in stocks.
 
✓ Bond funds: If you need current income and don’t want investments 
that fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do, consider some bond 
funds.
 
✓ Money market funds: If you want to be sure that your invested principal 
doesn’t decline in value because you may need to use your money in the 
short term, select a money market fund.
Most investors (ourselves included) choose a combination of these three 
types of funds to diversify and help accomplish different financial goals. (We 
cover each type of fund in depth later in this chapter.)
High financial safety
In 2008 and 2009, many banks and insurance companies collapsed due to the 
subprime mortgage crisis. Very simply, they owned too many investments 
whose value was based on homeowners who were poor credit risks in terms 
of being able to continue to make their mortgage payments. When interest 
rates moved up and property values fell, many homeowners couldn’t make 
those payments. This meant that the assets of many insurance companies 
and banks weren’t anywhere near what had been believed, which led to their 
collapse or need to be bailed out. But this round of high-profile financial insti-
tutions collapsing won’t be the last, nor was it the first.
In the U.S., thousands of banks and insurance companies have failed over 
the years. Banks and insurers can fail because their liabilities (the money 
that customers give them to invest, which they can be called upon to return 
on short notice) can exceed their assets (the money that they’ve invested or 
lent). For example, when big chunks of a bank’s loans go sour at the same 
time that its depositors want their money, the bank fails, because banks typi-
cally have less than 15 cents on deposit for every dollar that you and others 
place with them. (This is exactly what happened to Washington Mutual, 
which in 2008 was the largest bank failure in U.S. history.) Likewise, if an 
insurance company makes several poor investments or underestimates the 
number of insurance policyholder claims, it too can fail.

169
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
Such failures can’t happen with a mutual fund because the value of the fund’s 
shares fluctuates as the securities in the fund fluctuate in value. For every 
dollar of securities they hold for their customers, mutual funds have a dollar’s 
worth of securities. The worst that can happen with a fund is that if you want 
your money, you may get less cash than you originally put into the fund 
because the value of the investments the fund holds have declined — but you 
won’t lose all your investment.
For added security, the specific stocks, bonds, and other securities that 
a mutual fund buys are held at a custodian, a separate organization inde-
pendent of the mutual fund company. A custodian ensures that the fund 
management company can’t embezzle your funds or use assets from a better-
performing fund to subsidize a poor performer.
Accessibility
Mutual funds are set up for people who value their time and don’t like going 
to a local branch office and standing in long lines. With funds, you can fill out 
a simple form (often online, if you wish) and write a cheque in the comfort of 
your home (or authorize electronic transfers from your bank or other accounts) 
to make your initial investment. You can then typically make subsequent 
investments by mailing in a cheque or zapping in money electronically.
Additionally, some money market funds offer cheque-writing privileges. Many 
mutual fund companies also allow you to electronically transfer money back 
and forth from your local bank account; you can access your money almost 
as quickly through a money market fund as you can through your local bank.
Selling your shares of a mutual fund is usually simple. Generally, all you need 
to do is call the fund company’s toll-free number or visit its Web site. Some 
companies have representatives available around the clock, year-round. Most 
fund companies also offer online account access and trading capabilities as 
well (although as we discuss in Chapter 19, some people are prone to over-
trading online).
The Keys to Successful Fund Investing
This chapter helps explain why funds are a good investment vehicle to use, but 
not all funds are worthy of your investment dollars. Would you, for example, 
invest in a mutual fund run by an inexperienced and unproven 18-year-old? 
How about a fund that charges high fees and produces inferior returns in 
comparison to other similar funds? You don’t have to be an investing wizard 

170
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
to know the correct answers. When you select a fund, you can use a number 
of simple, commonsense criteria to greatly increase your chances of invest-
ment success. The criteria presented in this section have been scientifically 
proven to dramatically increase your fund investing returns.
Minimize costs
For any particular type of mutual fund (larger-company, Canadian stock 
funds, for example), hundreds of choices are available. The charges that you 
pay to buy or sell a fund, as well as the ongoing fund operating expenses, can 
have a big impact on the rate of return that you earn on your investments.
 
Fund costs are an important factor in the return that you earn from a mutual 
fund because fees are deducted from your investment returns and can attack 
a fund from many angles. All other things being equal, high fees and other 
charges depress your returns.
 
Stick with funds that maintain low total operating expenses and that don’t 
charge sales loads (commissions). Both types of fees come out of your pocket 
and reduce your rate of return. Plenty of excellent funds are available at 
reasonable annual operating expense ratios (less than 2 percent for stock 
funds; less than 1 percent for bond funds). See our recommendations in the 
respective sections on the best stock mutual funds, bond funds, and money 
market funds, later in this chapter.
Avoid load funds
 
The first such fee that you need to minimize is the sales load, which is a com-
mission paid to investment advisers and “financial planners” who work on 
commission and sell mutual funds. Commissions, or loads, can range up to 
6 percent or more of the amount that you invest. Sales loads are an additional 
and unnecessary cost that is deducted from your investment money. You can 
find plenty of outstanding no-load (commission-free) funds.
 
Investment advisers sing the praises of buying a load fund, warn against 
no-loads, and even sometimes try to obscure the load. For example, advisers 
may tell you that the commission doesn’t cost you because the mutual fund 
company pays it. Remember that the commission always comes out of your 
investment dollars, regardless of how cleverly some load funds and brokers 
disguise the commission.
Investment advisers also may say that load funds perform better than no-
load funds. One reason, advisers claim, is that load funds supposedly hire 
better fund managers. Absolutely no relationship exists between paying a 
sales charge to buy a fund and gaining access to better investment managers. 

171
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Remember that the sales commission goes to the selling broker, not to the 
fund managers. Objective studies demonstrate time and again that load funds 
not only don’t outperform but, in fact, underperform no-loads. Common 
sense suggests why — when you factor in the higher commission and the 
higher average ongoing operating expenses charged on load funds, you pay 
more to own a load fund, so your returns are less.
Another problem with commission-driven load fund sellers is the power of self-
interest. This issue is rarely talked about, but it’s even more important than the 
extra costs that you pay with load funds. When you buy a load fund through 
a salesperson, you miss out on the chance to get holistic advice on other 
personal finance strategies. For example, you may be better off paying down 
your debts or investing in something entirely different from a mutual fund. 
But in our experience, salespeople almost never advise you to pay off your 
credit cards or your mortgage — or to invest through your company’s retire-
ment plan or in real estate — instead of buying an investment through them.
Some mutual fund companies try to play it both ways (because they sell their 
funds through investment advisers as well as directly to consumers): They 
sell load as well as no-load funds.
Get what you pay for
For many people, the main reason for choosing load funds is to compensate 
an adviser who’s providing them with help in assembling a fund portfolio. At 
the very minimum, if you’re a new customer, request a written financial plan 
that examines your wider financial circumstances, not just your investment 
needs. Remember, too, that the commissions in mutual fund prospectuses 
and so forth are simply the maximum allowed by the fund company. You can 
and should negotiate those fees down.
There’s also no reason why an adviser who’s compensated through sales 
commissions shouldn’t include some no-load funds in your portfolio. 
Financial advisers, whether they charge fees or commissions, are making a 
living at what they do. Just make sure that, whichever route you choose, you 
get what you pay for.
 
A good adviser should act as a sober second opinion that comes between you 
and your desire to trade, buy, or sell. Discount brokers, instant access to infor-
mation, and the ease of executing trades over the phone or on the Internet all 
make it very easy and hassle-free to buy and sell mutual funds and other 
investments. Many people have a tough time fighting the desire to trade in and 
out of investments in a never-ending search for a better return. For some inves-
tors, an adviser can more than earn back his keep by serving as a hand-holder 
when the markets take a tumble or when an investment doesn’t immediately 
pan out like you hoped it would.

172
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
A good adviser will be open and forthcoming about commissions. Beware 
those who only sing the praises of buying a load fund, warn against the pitfalls 
of no-loads, or even try to obscure the load altogether. Some investment 
advisers and planners may even encourage you to regularly switch out of 
some funds and into other funds in order to earn themselves more money.
Beware of high operating expenses
In addition to loads, the other costs of owning funds are the ongoing operating 
expenses. All mutual funds charge fees as long as you keep your money in the 
fund. The fees pay for the costs of running a fund, such as employees’ salaries, 
marketing, toll-free phone lines, printing and mailing prospectuses (legal 
disclosure of the fund’s operations and fees), and so on.
A mutual fund’s operating expenses are essentially invisible to you because 
they’re deducted from the fund’s share price. Companies charge operating 
expenses on a daily basis, so you don’t need to worry about trying to get out of 
a fund at a particular time of the year before the company deducts these fees.
 
Although expenses are invisible to you, their impact on your returns is quite 
real. Expenses are critical for money market mutual funds and bond funds; 
these funds buy securities that are so similar and so efficiently priced in the 
financial markets that most fund managers in a given type of money market or 
bond fund earn quite similar returns before expenses.
Hiding loads
Unfortunately, fund companies have come 
up with craftier ways of hiding sales loads. 
Increasing numbers of investment advisers and 
“financial planners” sell funds that they call no-
loads, but these funds aren’t no-loads.
In back-end or deferred sales load funds, the 
commission is hidden. Salespeople tell you that 
as long as you stay in a fund for five to seven 
years, you need not pay the back-end sales 
charge that applies when you sell the invest-
ment. This claim may be true, but it’s also true 
that these funds pay investment salespeople a 
hefty commission.
The salespeople can receive their commissions 
because the fund company charges you exorbi-
tant continuing operating expenses (which are 
usually at least 1 percent more per year than 
the best funds). So one way or another, they 
get their commissions from your investment 
dollars.
Back-end loads are also an unfair arrangement 
that’s tilted in the fund company’s favour. You 
offer to lock up your money with a fund for a set 
number of years in return for them decreasing 
or eliminating the commission. The problem is 
that the fund can change the rules of the game, 
but you still aren’t allowed to get out of the 
contract. The manager may leave or be fired, 
the fund may change its investing focus, or the 
results may simply turn out to be much worse 
than the fund’s history suggested.

173
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
With stock funds, expenses may play less of an important role in your fund 
decision. However, don’t forget that over time, stocks have averaged returns 
of about 10 percent per year. So if one stock fund charges 1.5 percent more 
in operating expenses than another, you give up an extra 15 percent of your 
expected (pre-tax) annual returns (and an even greater portion of your 
after-tax returns).
 
All types of funds with higher operating expenses tend to produce lower rates 
of return on average. Conversely, funds with lower operating costs can more 
easily produce higher returns for you than a comparable type of fund with 
high costs. This effect makes sense because companies deduct operating 
expenses from the returns that your fund generates. Higher expenses mean a 
lower return to you.
Fund companies quote a fund’s operating expenses as a percentage of your 
investment. The percentage represents an annual fee or charge, and is typi-
cally called the management expense ratio, or MER. You can find this number 
in a fund’s prospectus, in the fund expenses section, usually in a line that 
says something like “Total Fund Operating Expenses.” Or you can call the 
mutual fund’s toll-free phone number and ask a representative, or try to 
find the information at the fund company’s Web site. Make sure that a fund 
doesn’t appear to have low expenses simply because it’s temporarily waiving 
them. (You can ask the fund representative or look at the fees in the fund’s 
prospectus to find this information.)
Consider performance and risk
A fund’s historic rate of return or performance is another important factor to 
weigh when you select a mutual fund. Keep in mind, however, as all mutual 
fund materials must tell you, that past performance is no guarantee of future 
results. In fact, many former high-return funds achieved their results only by 
taking on high risk or simply by short-term luck. Funds that assume higher 
risk should produce higher rates of return. But high-risk funds usually decline 
in price faster during major market declines. Thus, a good fund should con-
sistently deliver a favourable rate of return given the level of risk it takes.
 
A big mistake that many investors make when they choose a mutual fund is 
overemphasizing the importance of past performance numbers. The shorter 
the time period, the greater the danger of misusing high performance as an 
indicator for a good future fund.
Although past performance can be a good sign, high returns for a fund, relative 
to its peers, are largely possible only if a fund takes more risk (or if a fund 
manager’s particular investment style happens by luck to come into favour 
for a few years). The danger of taking more risk is that it doesn’t always 
work the way you’d like. The odds are high that you won’t be able to pick the 

174
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
next star before it vaults to prominence in the investing sky. You have a far 
greater chance of boarding that star when it’s ready to plummet back 
to Earth.
In fact, one U.S. study found that if you had invested in the annual, number-one, 
top-performing stock and bond funds over the last 15 years, the majority (more 
than 75 percent) of those top performers subsequently performed worse, over 
the next 3 to 10 years, than the average funds in their peer groups!
 
One clever way that mutual funds make themselves look better than other 
comparable funds is to compare themselves to funds that aren’t really compa-
rable. The most common ploy is for a fund to invest in riskier types of securi-
ties and then compare its performance to funds that invest in less risky 
securities. Examine the types of securities that a fund invests in, and make 
sure that the comparison funds or indexes invest in similar securities.
Stick with experience
A great deal of emphasis is placed on who manages a specific mutual fund. 
Although the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t an island 
unto himself. The resources and capabilities of the parent company are equally, 
if not more, important. Managers come and go, but fund companies don’t.
Different companies maintain different capabilities and levels of expertise 
with different types of funds. Phillips, Hager & North, for example, is terrific 
at money market, bond, and dividend stock funds, thanks in part to its low 
operating expenses. Fidelity and Templeton have significant experience with 
investing in international stocks.
A fund company gains more or less experience than others, not only from 
the direct management of certain fund types, but also through hiring out. For 
example, some fund families contract with private money management firms 
that possess significant experience. In other cases, private money manage-
ment firms with long histories in private money management, such as Mawer 
Investment Management and Sceptre Investment Counsel, offer mutual funds.
Buy index funds
Unlike other mutual funds, in which the portfolio manager and a team of analysts 
scour the market for the best securities, an index fund manager simply invests 
to match the makeup, and thus also the performance, of a particular index — a 
basket of stocks representing the performance of a stock market — such as the 
S&P/TSX Composite Index of the largest companies on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange. Index funds are funds that are mostly managed by a computer. 

175
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Index funds deliver relatively good returns by keeping expenses low, staying 
invested, and not trying to jump around. Over ten years or more, index funds 
typically outperform about three-quarters of funds that invest in the same 
types of companies but try to pick winners! Most so-called actively managed 
funds can’t overcome the handicap of high operating expenses that pull down 
their rates of return. Index funds can run with far lower operating expenses 
because significant ongoing research need not be conducted to identify com-
panies to invest in.
The average Canadian stock mutual fund, for example, has an operating 
expense ratio of 2.33 percent per year. (Some funds charge expenses as high 
as 3 percent or more per year.) That being the case, a Canadian stock index 
fund with an expense ratio of just 0.7 percent per year has an advantage of 
1.6 percent per year over the average fund. A 1.6 percent difference may not 
seem like much, but in fact it is a significant difference. Because stocks tend to 
return about 10 percent per year, you end up throwing away about 16 percent 
of your expected (pre-tax) stock fund returns with an “average fund” in terms 
of expenses (and an even greater portion of your post-tax returns).
With actively managed stock funds, a fund manager can make costly mistakes, 
such as not being invested when the market goes up, being too aggressive 
when the market plummets, or just being in the wrong stocks. Many actively 
managed funds can and do underperform the overall market index that they’re 
competing against. For example, only 20 to 30 percent of actively managed 
Canadian equity funds beat the index.
Don’t overestimate your own ability to pick in advance the few elite money 
managers who manage to beat the market averages by a few percentage 
points per year in the long run. Also, don’t overestimate the pros’ ability to 
consistently pick the right stocks. Index funds make sense for a portion of 
your investments, especially when you invest in bonds and larger, more con-
servative stocks, where beating the market is difficult for portfolio managers.
In addition to lower operating expenses, which help boost your returns, 
index mutual funds are tax-friendlier to invest in when you invest outside 
retirement plans. Mutual fund managers of actively managed portfolios, in 
their attempts to increase returns, buy and sell securities more frequently. 
However, this trading increases a fund’s taxable capital gains distributions 
and reduces a fund’s after-tax return.
Consider exchange-traded funds
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are relatively new. Although the first one was 
created back in 1993, they’ve gained some traction in recent years.

176
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
ETFs are similar to mutual funds, with the most significant difference being 
that in order to invest, you must buy into an ETF through a stock exchange 
where ETFs trade, just as individual stocks do. Thus, you need a brokerage 
account to invest in ETFs. (See Chapter 9 for general information on selecting 
a brokerage firm.)
ETFs are like index mutual funds in that each ETF generally tracks a major 
market index. (Be aware that more and more ETFs are being issued that track 
more narrowly focused indexes such as an industry group or small country.) 
The best ETFs may also have slightly lower operating expenses than the low-
est-cost index funds. However, you must pay a commission to buy and sell an 
ETF, and the current market value of the ETF may deviate slightly from the 
underlying market value of the securities in its portfolio.
 
A number of financial advisers are cheerleading for ETFs. In our observation, 
in some cases this advocacy is sometimes self-serving because such advisers 
have established investment management businesses built around ETFs. In 
one case, Ric Edelman, author of The Lies About Money, tells his readers the 
following:
The retail mutual fund industry is ripping you off . . . You need to sell all 
your retail mutual funds . . . the fact is that the retail mutual fund industry 
is now flush with liars, crooks, and charlatans. Daily business activities 
include deceit, hidden costs, undisclosed risks, deceptive trade prac-
tices, conflicts of interest, and fundamental violations of trust — all at 
your expense. Since September 2003, the retail mutual fund industry has 
paid out more than $5 billion in fines.
That sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it? Well, in the United States, US$5 bil-
lion in fines is a pittance. Consider that the fund industry averaged about 
$8 trillion under management per year in America, and these fines spanned 
about a decade’s worth of activity in the U.S. fund industry. So the US$5 
billion amounts to just 0.00625 percent of the fund industry’s assets under 
management. The mutual fund industry, like any other business or industry 
(brokerage firms, dentists, insurance firms, financial advisers), isn’t perfect. 
Unlike many industries, the mutual fund industry actually returned the 
US$5 billion to investors, thanks to government oversight.
Creating Your Fund Portfolio
The portion of the overall pool of your investment money that you decide 
to put into any particular type of investment is known as asset allocation. 
Asset allocation simply means choosing what percentage of your invest-
ments you place — or allocate — into bonds and cash versus stocks, and 

177
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
into international versus Canadian stocks. (Asset allocation can also include 
other assets, such as real estate and small business, which are discussed 
throughout this book.)
When you invest money for the longer term, such as for retirement, you can 
choose from the various types of funds that we discuss in this chapter. Most 
people get a big headache when they try to decide how to spread their money 
across the choices. This section helps you begin cutting through the clutter. 
(We discuss recommended funds for shorter-term goals later in this chapter 
as well.)
Allocating for the long term
Many working folks have time on their side, and they need to use that time 
to make their money grow. You may have two or more decades before you 
need to draw on some portion of your retirement plan assets. If some of your 
investments drop a bit over a year or two — or even over five years — the 
value of your investments has plenty of time to recover before you spend the 
money in retirement.
 
Your current age and the number of years until you retire should be the big-
gest factors in your allocation decision. The younger you are and the more 
years you have before retirement, the more comfortable you should be with 
growth-oriented (and more volatile) investments, such as stock funds. (See 
Chapter 2 for the risks and historic returns of different investments.)
Table 8-1 lists guidelines for allocating mutual fund money that you’ve ear-
marked for long-term purposes, such as retirement. You don’t need an MBA 
or PhD to decide your asset allocation — all you need to know is how old you 
are and the level of risk that you desire!
Table 8-1

= Age
= 100 – age
Middle of the road
= Age – 10
= 110 – age
Aggressive
= Age – 20

What’s it all mean, you ask? Consider this example: If you’re a conservative 
sort who doesn’t like a lot of risk, but you recognize the value of striving for 
some growth to make your money work harder, you’re a middle-of-the-road 

178
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
type. Using Table 8-1, if you’re 35 years old, you may consider putting 25 
percent (35 – 10) into bond funds and 75 percent (110 – 35) into stock funds.
 
Now divvy up your stock investment money between Canadian and interna-
tional funds. Here’s what portion of your “stock allocation” we recommend 
investing in overseas stocks:
 
✓ 20 percent (for play it safe)
 
✓ 35 percent (for middle-of-the-road)
 
✓ 50 percent (for aggressive)
If, for example, in Table 8-1, the 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road type invests 
75 percent in stocks, she can then invest about 35 percent of the stock fund 
investments (which works out to be around 25 percent of the total) in 
international stock funds.
So here’s what the 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road investor’s portfolio asset 
allocation looks like so far:
Bonds
25%
Canadian stocks
50%
International stocks
25%
Diversifying your stock fund investments
Suppose your investment allocation decisions suggest that you invest 50 
percent in Canadian stock funds. Which ones do you choose? As we explain 
in the section “Exploring different types of stock funds,” later in this chapter, 
stock funds differ on a number of levels. Some stocks and funds are growth 
oriented, and some focus on value stocks. Small-, medium-, and large-com-
pany stocks and funds also invest in such stocks. We explain these types of 
stocks and funds later in this chapter. You also need to decide what portion 
you want to invest in index funds (which we discuss in the “Buy index funds” 
section, earlier in the chapter) versus actively managed funds that try to beat 
the market.
 
Generally, it’s a good idea to diversify into different types of funds. You can 
diversify in one of two ways:
 
✓ Purchase several individual funds, each of which focuses on a different 
style. For example, you can invest in a large-company value stock fund 
and in a small-company growth fund. We find this approach somewhat 
tedious. Granted, it does allow a fund manager to specialize and gain 
greater knowledge about a particular type of stock. But many of the best 
managers invest in more than one narrow range of security.

179
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
✓ Invest in a handful of funds (five to ten), each of which covers several 
bases and that together cover them all. Remember, the investment 
delineations are somewhat arbitrary, and most funds do more than just 
one type of investment. For example, a fund may focus on small-company 
value stocks but also invest in medium-company stocks, as well as in 
some that are more growth oriented.
As for how much you should use index versus actively managed funds, it’s 
really a matter of personal taste. If you’re happy knowing that you’ll get the 
market rate of return and that you can’t underperform the market, index 
your entire portfolio. On the other hand, if you enjoy the challenge of trying 
to pick the better managers and want the potential to earn better than the 
market level of returns, don’t use index funds at all. A happy medium is to 
do both. (John Bogle, founder of the U.S. company Vanguard and pioneer of 
index mutual funds, has about half of his money invested in index funds.)
 
If you haven’t experienced the sometimes significant plummets in stock prices 
that occur — like the big drop investors had to live through in the fall of 2008 — 
you may feel queasy when it next happens and you’ve got a chunk of your nest 
egg in stocks. Be sure to read Chapters 2 and 5 to understand the risk in stocks 
and what you can and can’t do to reduce the volatility of your stock holdings.
The Best Stock Mutual Funds
In Chapters 2 and 5, we make the case for investing in stocks (also known as 
equities) to make your money grow. However, stocks sometimes plummet 
or otherwise remain depressed for a few years. Thus, stock mutual funds 
(also known as equity funds), which, as their name suggests, invest in stocks, 
aren’t a place for money that you know you may need to protect in the next 
few years.
 
Stock funds are excellent investment vehicles that reduce your risk — 
compared to purchasing individual stocks — because they
 
✓ Invest in dozens of stocks: Unless you possess a lot of money to invest, 
you’re likely to buy only a handful of stocks. If you end up with a lemon 
in your portfolio, it can devastate your other good choices. If such a 
stock represents 20 percent of your holdings, the rest of your stock 
selections need to increase about 25 percent in value just to get you 
back to even. Stock funds mitigate this risk. For example, if a fund holds 
equal amounts of 50 stocks, and one goes to zero, you lose only 2 percent 
of the fund value if the stock was an average holding. Similarly, if the 
fund holds 100 stocks, you lose just 1 percent. Remember that a good fund 
manager is more likely than you to sidestep disasters (see the earlier 
section “Professional management” for details).

180
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
✓ Invest in different types of stocks: Some funds invest in stocks of dif-
ferent sizes of companies in a variety of industries. Others may hold 
Canadian and international stocks. Different types of stocks (which are 
explained in the upcoming section titled “Exploring different types of 
stock funds”) don’t move in tandem. So if smaller-company stocks get 
beat up, larger-company stocks may fare better. If Canadian stocks are 
in the tank, international stocks may be faring better.
Making money with stock funds
When you invest in stock mutual funds, you can make money in three ways:
 
✓ Dividends: As a mutual fund investor, you can choose to receive your 
share of the dividends paid out to the fund as cash or reinvest them in 
purchasing more shares in the fund. Higher-growth companies tend to 
pay lower dividends.
 
 Unless you need the income to live on (if, for example, you’re already 
retired), reinvest your dividends into buying more shares in the fund. If 
you do this outside of a retirement plan, keep a record of those reinvest-
ments because you need to factor those additional purchases into the 
tax calculations you make when you sell your shares.
 
✓ Capital gains distributions: When a fund manager sells stocks for more 
than he paid, the resulting profits, known as capital gains, must be netted 
against losses and paid out to the fund’s shareholders. Just as with 
dividends, you can reinvest your capital gains distributions in the fund.
 
✓ Appreciation: The fund manager isn’t going to sell all the stocks that 
have gone up in value. Thus, the price per share of the fund increases to 
reflect the gains in its stock holdings. For you, these profits are on paper 
until you sell the fund and lock them in. Of course, if a fund’s stocks 
decline in value, the share price depreciates.
If you add together dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation, 
you arrive at the total return of a fund. Stocks, and the funds that invest in 
them, differ in the dimensions of these three possible returns, particularly 
with respect to dividends, as we explain in Chapter 5.
Exploring different types of stock funds
Stock funds and the stocks they invest in are usually pigeonholed into partic-
ular categories, based on the types of stocks that they focus on. Categorizing 
stock funds is often tidier in theory than in practice, though, because some 
funds invest in an eclectic mix of stocks. Don’t get bogged down with the names 
of funds — funds sometimes have misleading names and don’t necessarily do 

181
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
what their names imply. The investment strategies of the fund and the fund’s 
typical investments are what matter. The following characteristics are what 
you need to pay attention to:
 
✓ Company size: The first dimension on which a stock fund’s stock selection 
differs is based on the size of the company — small, medium, and large 
companies — in which the fund invests. The total market value (capital-
ization) of a company’s outstanding stock defines the categories of 
stocks that the fund invests in. A company’s capitalization is simply the 
going price of its shares multiplied by the number of shares. (The term 
capitalization is often shortened to “cap,” so you may hear financial folks 
tossing around terms like large cap and small cap.) The dollar amounts 
used to define the categories are arbitrary, and as stock prices increase 
over time, investment market analysts have moved up their cutoffs:
 
• Canadian small-company stocks, for example, are usually defined 
as stocks of companies that possess total market capitalization of 
less than $500 million. (In the United States, small-cap companies 
have market values of less than $2 billion.)
 
• Medium-capitalization Canadian stocks have market values 
between $500 million and $1 billion. (The market value of U.S. mid-
capitalization companies is between $2 billion and $10 billion.)
 
• Large-capitalization Canadian stocks are those of companies with 
market values greater than $1 billion. (In the United States, large-
capitalization stocks have a market value greater than $10 billion.)
 
• Why care about the size of the companies that a fund holds? 
Historically, smaller companies pay lower dividends but appreciate 
more. They have more volatile share prices but tend to produce 
slightly higher total returns. Larger companies’ stocks tend to pay 
greater dividends and on average are less volatile and produce 
slightly lower total returns than small-company stocks. Medium-size 
companies’ stocks, as you may suspect, fall between the two.
 
✓ Growth versus value: Stock fund managers and their funds are further 
categorized by whether they invest in growth or value stocks.
 
• Growth stocks have high prices in relation to the company’s assets, 
profits, and potential profits. Growth companies typically experience 
rapidly expanding revenues and profits. These companies tend 
to reinvest most of their earnings in the company to fuel future 
expansion; thus, these stocks pay low dividends. For example, 
Research in Motion (RIM) pays no dividends and reinvests most 
of its profits in its business.

182
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
• Value stocks are priced cheaply in relation to the company’s assets, 
profits, and potential profits. Value stocks tend to pay higher divi-
dends than growth stocks and historically have actually produced 
higher total returns than growth stocks.
 
• Mutual fund companies sometimes use other terms to describe 
other types of stock funds. Aggressive growth funds tend to invest 
in the most growth-oriented companies and may undertake riskier 
investment practices, such as frequent trading. Growth and income 
funds tend to invest in stocks that pay higher-than-average divi-
dends, thus offering the investor the potential for growth and 
income. Income funds tend to invest more in higher-yielding stocks. 
Bonds usually make up the other portion of income funds.
 
✓ Company location: Stocks and the companies that issue them are also 
divvied up based on the location of their main operations and head-
quarters. Funds that specialize in Canadian stocks are, not surprisingly, 
called Canadian stock funds. Funds that can invest anywhere in the world, 
including Canada, are called global funds, and those that can invest in any 
country except for Canada are referred to as international funds.
By putting together two or three of these major classifications, you can start 
to comprehend all those silly and lengthy names that mutual funds give their 
stock funds. You can have funds that focus on large-company value stocks or 
small-company growth stocks. You can add in U.S., international, and world-
wide funds to further subdivide these categories into more fund types. As a 
result, you can have international stock funds that focus on small-company 
stocks or growth stocks.
You can purchase several stock funds, each focusing on a different type of 
stock, to diversify into different types of stocks. Two potential advantages 
result from doing so:
 
✓ First, not all your money rides in one stock fund and with one fund 
manager.
 
✓ Second, each of the different fund managers can look at and track 
particular stock investment possibilities.
Using the selection criteria we outline in the section “The Keys to Successful 
Fund Investing,” earlier in this chapter, the following sections describe the best 
stock funds that are worthy of your consideration. The funds differ primarily in 
terms of the types of stocks they invest in. Keep in mind as you read through 
these funds that they also differ in their tax-friendliness (see Chapter 3). If you 
invest inside a retirement plan, you don’t need to worry about tax-friendliness.

183
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Canadian stock funds
Of all the different types of funds offered, Canadian stock funds are the largest 
category. Stock funds differ mainly in terms of the size of the companies that 
they invest in and in whether the funds focus on growth or value companies. 
Some funds do all these things, and some may even invest a bit overseas.
 
The only way to know for sure where a fund currently invests (or where the 
fund may invest in the future) is to ask. To start your information search, you 
can call the mutual fund company that you’re interested in or visit its Web site. 
You can also read the fund’s annual report. Don’t waste your time looking for 
this information in the fund’s prospectus because it doesn’t give you anything 
beyond general parameters that guide the range of investments. The prospec-
tus doesn’t tell you what the fund currently invests in or has invested in.
For mutual funds that you hold outside of retirement plans, you have to 
pay income tax on distributed dividends and capital gains. As we discuss 
in Chapter 3, long-term capital gains and stock dividends are taxed at lower 
rates than ordinary income and other investment income.

Canadian dividend funds
Dividend funds invest in preferred shares that pay fixed dividends, as well as 
in common shares of large blue-chip companies that pay high yields, such as 
the big banks. The goal of these funds is to maximize the amount of dividend 
income.

184
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
Changes to the tax system in 2005 reduced the tax rate on eligible dividends, 
which, broadly speaking, are dividends paid out by publicly traded compa-
nies. This change meant that in most provinces, and for people in most tax 
brackets, dividends have the lowest tax rate, lower even than capital gains. 
(Beginning in 2010, the tax rates on dividends will be raised modestly.)
For the 2008 tax year, the marginal tax rate on dividends for those in the 
lowest tax bracket (approximately $9,600 to $37,885) was actually negative. 
This means you not only don’t pay any tax on your dividend income, but that 
income earns you a tax credit that can be used to reduce your overall tax bill. 
For those earning between $37,886 and $75,769, dividend tax rates ranged 
from –1.4 percent in British Columbia to around 15 percent in Quebec and 
Newfoundland. For people in the $75,770 to $123,184 bracket, the approxi-
mate marginal tax rate on dividends ranged from 12 percent to 26 percent, 
depending on the province. Finally, those earning more than $123,184 faced a 
tax rate of anywhere from 16 percent to almost 30 percent on dividends.
 
If you’re looking for a steady flow of income on your investments with a low 
tax rate, consider these dividend funds:
 
✓ Bissett Dividend Income
 
✓ Claymore S&P/TSX CDN Preferred Share ETF
 
✓ iShares CDN Dividend Index (ETF)
 
✓ RBC Canadian Dividend
 
✓ Phillips, Hager & North Dividend Income

The United States accounts for almost half of the world’s stock market capital-
ization, so it makes sense to allocate a portion of your portfolio to American 
investments. Although investors were richly rewarded for holding U.S. stocks in 
the late 1990s, don’t forget that it was one of the biggest and best bull markets in 
history. Don’t expect that kind of return, and remember that other markets — 
including Canada’s — will likely outpace the U.S. market from time to time.
 
Here’s our short list of U.S. stock funds:
 
✓ Chou Associates
 
✓ iShares Canadian S&P 500 index (ETF)
 
✓ McLean Budden American Equity
 
✓ RBC O’Shaughnessy U.S. Value (and U.S. Growth)
 
✓ TD U.S. Index (index fund)
 
✓ TD U.S. Mid-Cap Growth

 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
International stock funds
For diversification and growth potential, you should include stock funds that 
invest overseas as part of your portfolio. Normally, you can tell that you’re 
looking at a fund that focuses its investments overseas if its name contains 
words such as international (usually foreign only) or global (foreign and 
Canadian)
 
As a general rule, avoid foreign funds that invest in just one country, regard-
less of whether that country is Australia, Zimbabwe, or anywhere in between. 
As with investing in a sector fund that specializes in a particular industry (see 
the following section), this lack of diversification defeats the whole purpose of 
investing in funds. Funds that focus on specific regions, such as Southeast 
Asia, are better but still generally problematic because of poor diversification 
and higher expenses than other, more-diversified international funds.
If you want to invest in more geographically limiting international funds, 
take a look at funds that invest in broader regions, such as investing just in 
Europe, Asia, and the volatile but higher-growth-potential emerging markets 
in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
In addition to the risks normally inherent with stock fund investing, changes 
in the value of foreign currencies relative to the Canadian dollar cause price 
changes in the international securities. A decline in the value of the Canadian 
dollar helps the value of foreign stock funds (and conversely, a rising dollar 
versus other currencies can reduce the value of foreign stocks). Some foreign 
stock funds hedge against currency changes. Although this hedging helps 
reduce volatility a bit, it does cost money.

your needs:

Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Sector funds
 
Sector funds invest in securities in specific industries. In most cases, you 
should avoid sector funds for a number of reasons, including the following:
 
✓ Lack of diversification: Investing in stocks of a single industry defeats a 
major purpose of investing in mutual funds — you give up the benefits 
of diversification. Also, even if you’re lucky enough to jump into a sector 
fund just before it becomes “hot,” you can’t assume that the fund will 
pick the right securities within that sector.
 
✓ High fees: They tend to carry much higher fees than other mutual funds.
 
✓ Taxable distributions: Many sector funds have high rates of trading or 
turnover of their investment holdings. Investors who use these funds 
outside of retirement plans have to pay the taxman for the likely greater 
taxable distributions that this trading produces.
The only types of specialty funds that may make sense for a small portion (10 
percent or less) of your entire investment portfolio are funds that invest in 
real estate or precious metals. These funds can help diversify your portfolio 
because they can perform better during times of higher inflation — which 
often depresses bond and stock prices. (However, you can comfortably skip 
these funds because diversified stock funds tend to hold some of the same 
stocks as these specialty funds.) Here are some details about these two spe-
cialty fund types:
 
✓ Real estate funds: Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are stocks of com-
panies that invest in real estate. REITs typically invest in properties such
as apartment buildings, shopping centers, and other rental properties. 
REITs allow you to invest in real estate without the hassle of being a 
landlord. Just as it’s a hassle to evaluate REIT stocks, you can always 
invest in a mutual fund of REITs.
 
 REITs usually pay healthy levels of dividends, which for most people 
are the most tax-friendly way to receive earnings on investments. Some 
good funds to choose from are CIBC Canadian Real Estate, Dynamic Focus 
Plus Real Estate, and Sentry Select REIT. You can also invest in a REIT 
ETF, the iShares Canadian REIT Sector index.
 
✓ Precious metals: If you expect high inflation, consider a gold fund. But 
know that these funds swing wildly in value and aren’t for the faint of 
heart; over the long term, such funds provide lousy returns — on about 
par with increases in the cost of living. Good gold funds to choose from 
are AGF Precious Metals Fund, CIBC Precious Metals Fund, RBC Precious 
Metals Fund, and Sprott Gold and Precious Minerals Fund.
 
Don’t buy bullion itself; storage costs and the concerns over whether you’re 
dealing with a reputable company make buying gold bars a pain. Also avoid 
futures and options, which are gambles on short-term price movements (see 
Chapter 1 for more information).

187
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
The Best Bond Funds
Bond funds can make you money in the same three ways that a stock fund 
can — through dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation. 
However, most of the time, the bulk of your return in a bond fund comes from 
dividends.
 
Although an overwhelming number of bond fund choices exists (thousands, in 
fact), not that many remain after you eliminate high-cost funds (those with 
loads and high ongoing fees), low-performance funds (which are often the 
high-cost funds), and funds managed by fund companies and fund managers 
with minimal experience investing in bonds. Here are the aspects to consider 
when choosing bond funds:
 
✓ Length to maturity: Bond fund objectives and names usually fit one of 
three maturity categories — short-, intermediate-, and long-term. You 
can earn a higher yield from investing in a bond fund that holds longer-
term bonds, but as we explain in Chapter 7, such bond prices are more 
sensitive to changes in interest rates.
 
✓ Quality: Generally speaking, the lower a bond issuer’s credit rating, the 
riskier the bond. As with the risk associated with longer maturities, a 
fund that holds lower-quality bonds should provide higher returns for 
the increased risk you take. A higher yield is the bond market’s way of 
compensating you for taking greater risk. Funds holding higher-quality 
bonds provide lower returns but more security.
 
✓ Loads and fees: After you settle on the type of bonds that you want, a 
bond fund’s costs — its sales commissions and annual operating fees — 
are a huge consideration. Stick with no-load funds that maintain lower 
annual operating expenses.
 
✓ Tax implications: Pay attention to the taxability of the dividends that 
bonds pay. If you’re investing in bonds inside of retirement accounts, 
you want taxable bonds. If you invest in bonds outside of retirement 
accounts, the choice between taxable versus tax-free depends on your 
tax bracket (see Chapter 3).
Invest in bond funds only if you have sufficient money in an emergency 
reserve. If you invest money for longer-term purposes, particularly retire-
ment, you need to come up with an overall plan for allocating your money 
among a variety of different funds, including bond funds. (See the section 
“Allocating for the long term,” earlier in this chapter.)

Avoiding yield-related missteps
When selecting bond funds to invest in, investors are often led astray as to 
how much they can expect to make. The first mistake is to look at recent 
performance and assume that you’ll get that return in the future. Investing 
in bond funds based on recent performance is tempting right after a period 
where interest rates have declined (1990s and early 2000s), because declines 
in interest rates pump up bond prices and, therefore, bond fund total returns. 
Remember that an equal but opposite force waits to counteract pumped-up 
bond returns — bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
Don’t get us wrong: Past performance is an important issue to consider. In 
order for performance numbers to be meaningful and useful, you must com-
pare bond funds that are comparable (such as intermediate-term funds that 
invest exclusively in high-grade corporate bonds).
Bond mutual funds calculate their yield after subtracting their operating 
expenses. When you contact a mutual fund company seeking a fund’s current 
yield, make sure that you understand what time period the yield covers. 
Fund companies are supposed to give you the SEC yield, which is a standard 
yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
allows for fairer comparisons among bond funds. The SEC yield reflects the 
bond fund’s yield to maturity. The SEC yield is the best yield to use when you 
compare funds because it captures the effective rate of interest that an inves-
tor can receive in the future.
 
Unfortunately, if you select bond funds based on advertised yield, you’re almost 
guaranteed to purchase the wrong bond funds. Bond funds and the mutual fund 
companies that sell them can play more than a few games to fatten a fund’s yield. 
Such sleights of hand make a fund’s marketing and advertising departments 
happy because higher yields make it easier for salespeople and funds to 
hawk their bond funds. But remember that yield-enhancing shenanigans can 
leave you poorer. Here’s what you need to watch out for:
 
✓ Lower quality: In comparing one short-term bond fund to another, 
you may discover that one pays 0.5 percent more and decide that it 
looks better. However, it turns out that the higher-yielding fund invests 
20 percent of its money in junk (non-investment grade) bonds, whereas 
the other fund fully invests in high-quality bonds.
 
✓ Longer maturities: Bond funds can usually increase their yield just by 
increasing their maturity a bit. If one long-term bond fund invests in 
bonds that mature in an average of 17 years, and another fund has an 
average maturity of 12 years, comparing the two is a classic case of com-
paring apples and oranges.

189
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
✓ Giving your money back without you knowing it: Some funds return a 
portion of your principal in the form of dividends. This move artificially 
pumps up a fund’s yield but depresses its total return. When you com-
pare bond funds, make sure that you compare their total return over 
time (in addition to making sure that the funds have comparable portfo-
lios of bonds).
 
✓ Waiving of expenses: Some bond funds, particularly newer ones, waive 
a portion or even all their operating expenses to temporarily inflate the 
fund’s yield. Yes, you can invest in a fund that has a sale on its operat-
ing fees, but you’d also buy yourself the bother of monitoring things to 
determine when the sale is over. Bond funds that engage in this practice 
often end sales quietly when the bond market is performing well. Don’t 
forget that if you sell a bond fund (held outside of a retirement plan) 
that has appreciated in value, you owe taxes on your profits.
Treading carefully with actively 
managed bond funds
Some bond funds are aggressively managed. Managers of these funds possess 
a fair degree of latitude to purchase and trade bonds that they think will per-
form best in the future. For example, if a fund manager thinks interest rates 
will rise, she usually buys shorter-term bonds and keeps more of a fund’s 
assets in cash. The fund manager may invest more in lower-credit-quality 
bonds if she thinks that the economy is improving and that more companies 
will prosper and improve their credit standing.
 
Aggressively managed funds are a gamble. If interest rates fall instead of rise, 
the fund manager who moved into shorter-term bonds and cash suffers worse 
performance. If interest rates fall because the economy sinks into recession, 
the lower-credit-quality bonds will likely suffer from a higher default rate and 
depress the fund’s performance even further.
Some people think the “experts” have no trouble predicting which way inter-
est rates or the economy is heading. The truth is that economic predictions 
are always difficult, and the experts are often wrong. Few bond fund manag-
ers have been able to beat a buy-and-hold approach.
Trying to beat the market can lead to getting beaten! In recent years, increas-
ing numbers of bond funds have fallen on their faces after risky investing 
strategies backfired. Interestingly, bond funds that charge sales commissions 
(loads) and higher ongoing operating fees are the ones that are more likely to 
blow up, perhaps because managers of these funds are under more pressure 
to pump up returns to make up for higher operating fees.

190
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
It’s fine to invest some of your bond fund money in funds that try to hold the 
best position for changes in the economy and interest rates, but remember 
that if these fund managers are wrong, you can lose more money. Over the 
long term, you’ll probably do best with efficiently managed funds that stick 
with an investment objective and don’t try to time and predict the bond market. 
Index funds that invest in a relatively fixed basket of bonds so as to track a 
market index of bond prices are a good example of this passive approach.
Short-term bond funds
Of all bond funds, short-term bond funds are the least sensitive to interest 
rate fluctuations. The stability of short-term bond funds makes them appro-
priate investments for money that you seek a better rate of return on than 
a money market fund can produce for you. But with short-term bond funds, 
you also have to tolerate the risk of losing a percent or two in principal value 
if interest rates rise.
 
Short-term bonds work well for money that you earmark for use in a few years, 
such as the purchase of a home or a car, or for money that you plan to with-
draw from your retirement account in the near future.
 
A few good short-term bond choices include the following:
 
✓ CIBC Canadian Short-Term Bond Index (index fund)
 
✓ Fidelity Canadian Short Term Bond
 
✓ iShares Canadian Short-Term Bond Index (ETF)
 
✓ Phillips, Hager & North Short-Term Bond and Mortgage
 
✓ TD Short Term Bond
Long-term bond funds
Long-term bond funds are more volatile than short-term bond funds. If inter-
est rates on long-term bonds increase substantially, you can easily see the 
principal value of your investment decline 10 percent or more. (See the dis-
cussion in Chapter 7 of how interest rate changes impact bond prices.)
 
Long-term bond funds are generally used for retirement investing in one of 
two situations:
 
✓ Investors don’t expect to tap their investment money for a decade or more.
 
✓ Investors want to maximize current dividend income and are willing to 
tolerate volatility.

191
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
Don’t use these funds to invest money that you plan to use within the next 
five years, because a bond market drop can leave your portfolio short of your 
monetary goal.
 
We recommend looking at the following long-term bond funds:
 
✓ Beutel Goodman Income
 
✓ iShares Canadian Bond Index (ETF of corporate and government bonds)
 
✓ iShares Canadian Government Bonds Index (ETF of government bonds)
 
✓ McLean Budden Fixed Income
 
✓ Phillips, Hager & North Bond
 
✓ TD Canadian Bond index – e (index fund only available online)
The Best Hybrid Funds
Hybrid funds invest in a mixture of different types of securities. Most com-
monly, they invest in both bonds and stocks. These funds are usually less 
risky and less volatile than funds that invest exclusively in stocks; in an eco-
nomic downturn, bonds usually hold value better than stocks.
 
Hybrid funds make it easier for investors who are skittish about investing in 
stocks to hold stocks because they reduce the volatility that normally comes 
with pure stock funds. Because of their extensive diversification, hybrid funds 
are excellent choices for an investor who doesn’t have much money to 
start with.
Hybrid funds come in two forms:
 
✓ Balanced funds generally try to maintain a fairly constant percentage of 
investment in stocks and bonds.
 
✓ Asset allocation funds, by contrast, normally adjust the mix of different 
investments according to the portfolio manager’s expectations. Some 
asset allocation funds, however, tend to keep more of a fixed mix of 
stocks and bonds, whereas some balanced funds shift the mix around 
quite frequently. (Although the concept of a manager being in the right 
place at the right time and beating the market averages sounds good in 
theory, most funds that shift assets fail to outperform a buy-and-hold 
approach.)

192

Here’s our recommended short list of great balanced-type mutual funds:
 
✓ Bissett Canadian Balanced
 
✓ CIBC Monthly Income
 
✓ Concordia Strategic Balanced
 
✓ Mawer Canadian Balanced RSP
 
✓ McLean Budden Balanced Growth
 
✓ RBC Monthly Income
 
✓ Saxon Balanced
 
✓ Standard Life Monthly Income
 
✓ TD Monthly Income
The Best Money Market Funds
As we explain in Chapter 7, money market funds are a safe, higher-yielding 
alternative to bank accounts. Money market funds can invest only in the 
highest credit-rated securities, and their investments must have an aver-
age maturity of less than 180 days. The short-term nature of these securi-
ties effectively eliminates the risk of money market funds being sensitive to 
changes in interest rates.
The securities that money market funds use are extremely safe. General-
purpose money market funds invest in Treasury bills, guaranteed investment 
certificates, and short-term corporate debt that the largest and most credit-
worthy companies issue.
When shopping for a money market fund, consider these factors:
 
✓ Expenses: Within a given category of money market funds (general 
and Treasury bill), money market fund managers invest in the same 
basic securities. The market for these securities is pretty darn efficient, 
so “superstar” money market fund managers may eke out an extra 
0.1 percent per year in yield, but not much more.
 
 Select a money market fund that does a good job controlling its 
expenses. The operating expenses that the fund deducts before 
payment of dividends are the biggest determinant of yield. All other 
things being equal (which they usually are with different money market 
funds), lower operating expenses translate into higher yields for you.

193
 Chapter 8: Mastering Mutual Funds
 
 You have no need or reason to tolerate annual operating expenses of 
greater than 1 percent. Some top-quality funds charge 0.75 percent or 
less annually. Remember, lower expenses don’t mean that a fund com-
pany cuts corners or provides poor service. Lower expenses are pos-
sible in most cases because a fund company is successful in attracting a 
lot of money to invest.
 
✓ Tax consequences: With money market funds, all your return comes 
from interest. What you actually get to keep of these returns (on non-
retirement plan investments) is what is left over after the federal and 
provincial governments take their cut of your earnings. Where possible, 
hold money market funds inside a tax-deferred retirement plan or Tax-
Free Savings Account.
 
✓ Location of other funds: Consider what other investing you plan to do 
at the fund company where you establish a money market fund. Suppose 
that you decide to make mutual fund investments in stocks and bonds at 
TD Canada Trust. Then keeping a money market fund at a different firm 
that offers a slightly higher yield may not be worth the time and admin-
istrative hassle, especially if you don’t plan on keeping much cash in 
your money market fund.
 
✓ Most mutual fund companies don’t have many local branch offices. 
Generally, this fact helps fund companies keep their expenses low so 
they can pay you greater money market fund yields. You may open and 
maintain your mutual fund account via the fund’s toll-free phone lines, 
the mail, or the company’s Web site. You don’t really get much benefit, 
except psychological, if you select a fund company with an office in your 
area. But we don’t want to diminish the importance of your emotional 
comfort level.
Using the criteria that we just discussed, we recommend in this section the 
best money market funds — those that offer competitive yields, access to 
other excellent mutual funds, and other commonly needed money market 
services.

Chapter 9
Choosing an Investment Dealer
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the different types of investment dealers
▶ Shopping for a discount broker
▶ Considering a full-service investment dealer
You can invest in most securities — such as the stocks and bonds that 
we discuss in Chapters 4 through 7 — on your own, without using an 
investment adviser, if you buy mutual funds direct from fund providers. But 
someday, you may need investment services. Investment advisers execute 
your trades to buy or sell stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Consider setting up an investment account for one or more of the following 
reasons:
 
✓ If you hold or invest in individual stocks and bonds
 
✓ If you seek to invest in and hold mutual funds from a variety of fund 
companies through a single account
 
✓ If you want to invest in newer exchange-traded funds (see Chapter 8)
In this chapter, we explain the ins and outs of discount brokers to help you 
find the right broker for your investment needs.
Getting Your Money’s Worth: 
Discount Brokers
When you hear the word discount, you probably think of adjectives like cheap, 
inferior quality, and such. However, when it comes to the investment industry, 
the discount brokers who place your trades at substantial discounts can offer 

198
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
you even better value and service than full-service investment dealers. The 
following list offers some of the reasons why discount brokers give you more 
bang for your buck:
 
✓ Discount brokers can place your trades at a substantially lower price 
because they have much lower overhead.
 
✓ Discount brokers tend not to rent the posh downtown office space, 
complete with mahogany-panelled conference rooms, in order to 
impress customers.
 
✓ Discounters don’t waste tons of money employing economists and 
research analysts to produce forecasts and predictive reports.
In addition to lower commissions, another major benefit of using discount 
brokers is that they generally work on salary. Working on salary removes a 
significant conflict of interest that continues to get commission-paid invest-
ment advisers and dealers into trouble. Although many of these dealers 
today claim to offer financial planning, the reality is that commission-paid 
advisers aren’t any different from other salespeople, whether the product is 
cars, copy machines, or computers. People who sell on commission to make 
a living aren’t inherently evil, but given the financial incentives they have, 
you might not receive holistic, in-your-best-interest investing counsel 
from them.
Ignoring the salespeople’s arguments
 
One of the many sales tactics of high-commission investment dealers is to try 
to disparage discounters by saying things such as “You’ll receive poor service 
from discounters.” Our own experience, as well as that of others, suggests that 
in many cases, discounters actually offer better service.
Many of the larger discounters, such as those run by the big banks, have 
convenient branch offices that offer help, including assistance with filling out 
paperwork and access to independent research reports. And as we discuss 
in Chapter 8, you can buy no-load (commission-free) mutual funds that are 
run by management teams that make investment decisions for you. Such 
funds can be bought from mutual fund companies as well as through many 
discount brokerage firms.
High-commission dealers used to argue that discount brokerage customers 
received worse trade prices when they bought and sold. This assertion 
is a bogus argument because all brokerage firms use a computer-based 
trading system for smaller retail trades. Trades are processed in seconds. 
High-commission investment dealers also say that discounters are only “for 
people who know exactly what they’re doing and don’t need any help.” This 
statement is also false.

199
 Chapter 9: Choosing an Investment Dealer 
Selecting a discount broker
Which discount broker is best for you depends on your needs and wants. In 
addition to fees, consider how important having a local branch office is to 
you. If you seek to invest in mutual funds, the discount brokerage firms that 
we list later in this section offer access to good funds. In addition, these firms 
offer money market funds into which you can deposit money awaiting invest-
ment or proceeds from a sale.
 
Here are our top picks for discount brokers:
 
✓ BMO InvestorLine (888-776-6886; www.bmoinvestorline.com): 
Bank of Montreal’s discount brokerage offers an easy-to-use Web site 
that’s been thoughtfully put together. The site has numerous useful 
tools, including good asset allocation and financial planning features. 
InvestorLine is also known for good customer service, and investors 
can access a load of useful research. The downside to InvestorLine is its 
transaction costs. Especially for investors with smaller accounts, com-
missions are higher than those of many other discount brokers.
 
✓ Qtrade Investor (877-787-2330; www.qtrade.ca): Qtrade not only offers 
low commissions but also keeps improving its offerings, including an 
expanded stock research section. Qtrade also offers online GIC purchases. 
Qtrade has strong customer service, and you can easily get a real person 
on the phone should you need assistance.
Birth of the discount broker
Prior to 1975, all securities brokerage firms 
charged the same fee, known as a commission, 
to trade stocks and bonds. In the United States, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 
the federal government agency responsible for 
overseeing investment firms and their services, 
regulated commissions.
Beginning May 1, 1975 — known in the bro-
kerage business as “May Day” — brokerage 
firms were free to compete with one another 
on price, like companies in almost all other 
industries. Most of the firms in existence at 
that time, such as Prudential, Merrill Lynch, E. 
F. Hutton, and Smith Barney, largely continued 
with business as usual, charging relatively high 
commissions. Canadians finally got the benefits 
of deregulated commissions in 1983, when the 
Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges deregu-
lated the retail brokerage industry here.
Deregulation led to the birth of a new type of 
brokerage firm, the discount broker. Discount 
brokerage firms charge substantially lower 
commissions — typically 50 to 75 percent 
lower — than the other firms. Today, discount 
brokers, which include many online brokers, 
abound and continue to capture the lion’s share 
of new business.

200
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
 
✓ Questrade (888-783-7866; www.questrade.com): This privately held 
firm has some of the lowest fees available. Recently, the brokerage offered 
a commission option of just $4.95 for stock trades. Questrade also is 
rare in allowing investors to hold U.S. dollars inside their RRSPs, which 
saves you charges for exchanging currencies.
 
✓ TD Waterhouse (800-465-5463; www.tdwaterhouse.ca): TD 
Waterhouse has a solid range of competitive services. You can choose 
from TD’s solid in-house funds as well as from a wide selection of other 
funds. TD Waterhouse also offers several “e-funds” that boast bargain-
basement-level management expenses — the MER or management 
expense ratio — if you buy them online.
All the preceding firms offer mutual funds from many fund companies in addi-
tion to their family of funds (if they have a family of funds). In other words, 
you may purchase non-TD mutual funds through TD’s brokerage department. 
Other discounters with good service and competitive rates are certainly 
available, including those of the other big banks not mentioned here, so shop 
around if you desire. Note, however, that you may have to pay a transaction 
fee to buy funds from firms that don’t offer their own family of funds.
Examining your online trading motives
If trading online attracts you, first examine why you’re motivated to do so. 
Tracking prices daily (or, even worse, hourly) and frequently checking your 
account balances leads to addictive trading. Even a low fee of $5 or $10 per 
trade doesn’t really save you any money if you trade a lot and rack up signifi-
cant total commissions. And, even if you do well, you’ll pay more in capital 
gains taxes. Don’t forget that as with trading through a full-service invest-
ment dealer, you also lose the spread (difference between the bid and ask 
prices when you trade stocks and bonds), in addition to the explicit commis-
sion rates that online brokers charge.
Frankly, trading online is also an unfortunately easy way for people to act 
impulsively and emotionally when making important investment decisions. If 
you’re prone to such actions, or you find yourself tracking and trading invest-
ments too closely, use the Internet to check account information and gather 
factual information, and stay away from this form of trading.
Know that most of the best investment firms allow you to trade via touch-
tone phone. In most cases, touch-tone phone trading is discounted when 
you compare it to trading through a live broker, although it’s admittedly less 
glamorous than trading through a Web site.

201
 Chapter 9: Choosing an Investment Dealer 
 
Some brokers also offer account information and trading capabilities via 
personal digital assistants, which, of course, add to your costs. Digital 
assistants can also promote addictive investment behaviours.
Investment Web sites also push the surging interest in online trading with the 
pitch that you can beat the market averages and professionals at their own 
game if you do your own research and trade online. Beating the market and 
professionals is highly unlikely. However, you can save some money trading 
online, but probably not as much as the hype has you believe.
Considering other costs
 
Discount brokerage customers often shop for low costs. However, simply talking 
with enough people who have traded online and reviewing online message boards 
where customers speak their minds clearly show that shopping merely for low-
cost trading prices often causes the investor to overlook other important issues.
 
✓ Some discounters charge fees for real-time stock quotes (as opposed 
to quotes that may be 15 to 20 minutes old and are free). Some brokers 
whack you $20 here and $50 there for services such as wiring money 
or simply closing your account. Also beware of “inactivity fees” that 
some brokers levy on accounts that have infrequent trading. So before 
you sign up with any broker, make sure that you examine its entire fee 
schedule.
 
✓ When you buy or sell an investment, you may have cash sitting around 
in your brokerage account. Not surprisingly, the online brokers pitch-
ing their cheap online trading rates in numbers 8 centimeters (3 inches) 
high don’t reveal their money market rates in such large type (if at all). 
Some don’t pay interest on the first $1,000 or so of your cash balance, 
and even then, some companies pay half a percent to a full percent less 
than their best competitors. In the worst cases, some online brokers have 
paid up to 3 percent less. Under those terms, you’d earn up to $150 less in 
interest per year if you averaged a $5,000 cash balance during the year.
Examining service quality
Common complaints among customers of online brokers include slow responses 
to e-mail queries, long dead time as you wait to speak with a live person to 
answer questions or resolve problems, delays in opening accounts and receiving 
literature, unclear statements, incorrect processing of trading requests, and slow 
Web response during periods of heavy traffic. With a number of firms that we 

202
Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
called, we experienced phone waits of up to ten minutes and were transferred 
several times to retrieve answers to simple questions, such as whether the 
firm carried a specific family of mutual funds.
 
When you shop for an online broker, check your prospects thoroughly. Call 
for literature and see how long reaching a live human being takes. Ask some 
questions and see how knowledgeable and helpful the representatives are. For 
non-retirement plans, if the quality of the firm’s year-end account statements 
concern you, ask prospective brokerages to send you a sample. Try sending 
some questions to the broker’s Web site and see how accurate and timely 
the response is. If you’re a mutual fund investor, check out the quality of the 
funds that the company offers — don’t allow the sheer number of funds that 
the company offers impress you. Also, inquire about the interest rates that 
the company pays on cash balances, as well as the rates that the company 
charges on margin loans, if you want such borrowing services.
 
Consider checking online message boards to see what current and past 
customers of the firm say about the firms that you’re considering. Most 
online brokers that have been around for more than six months lay claim to a 
number-one rating with some survey or ranking of online brokers. Place little 
value on such claims.
Transact business only with firms that offer sufficient account insurance 
(enough to protect your assets) through the Canadian Investor Protection Fund 
(CIPF). The severe stock market downturn in the early 2000s led to the first of 
what is likely to be many major shakeouts, and you need to protect yourself.
Considering Full-Service 
Investment Dealers
Although the use of discount brokers is now widespread, a great number of 
Canadians still work with full-service investment dealers, whom they con-
tinue to regard as the traditional “stockbrokers.” That is, in return for access 
to his or her company’s research, advice on structuring your portfolio, and 
other services, you compensate your adviser through commissions when you 
buy and sell. These commissions have declined somewhat with the advent 
of discount brokerages, but transactions through a full-service investment 
dealer will still cost you a lot compared with what you’d pay a discount 
broker. Many Canadians maintain both a discount brokerage account and an 
account with a full-service investment dealer.

203
 Chapter 9: Choosing an Investment Dealer 
Why you should keep your securities in an 
investment dealer or discount brokerage account
When most investors purchase stocks or bonds 
today, they don’t receive the actual paper cer-
tificate demonstrating ownership. Investment 
dealer and discount brokerage accounts often 
hold the certificate for your stocks and bonds 
on your behalf. Holding your securities through 
an account is beneficial because there is an 
extra fee to issue certificates.
Sometimes people hold stock and bond cer-
tificates themselves — this practice was more 
common among your parents’ and grandpar-
ents’ generations. The reason: During the Great 
Depression, many investment dealers failed and 
took people’s assets down with their sinking 
ships. Since then, various reforms have greatly 
strengthened the safety of money and the secu-
rities that you hold in an investment account.
Just as the CDIC insurance system backs up 
money in bank accounts, the CIPF (Canadian 
Investor Protection Fund) provides insurance 
to customers of investment dealers and dis-
count brokerage firms that are members of the 
fund. The base level of insurance is $1,000,000 
per account held with each financial institution. 
However, many firms purchase additional pro-
tection — some as high as $100 million total!
Investment firms don’t often fail these days, 
but unlike during the Depression, the CIPF pro-
tects you if they do. However, the CIPF cover-
age doesn’t protect you against a falling stock 
market. If you invest your money in stocks, 
bonds, or whatever that plunge in value, that’s 
your own problem!
Besides not having to worry about losing your 
securities if a dealer fails, another good reason 
to hold securities with an investment dealer or 
discount broker is so you don’t lose them — 
literally! Surprising numbers of people — the 
exact number is unknown — have lost their 
stock and bond certificates. Those who real-
ize their loss can contact the issuing firms to 
replace them, but doing so takes a good deal of 
time. However, just like future goals and plans, 
some certificates are simply lost, and owners 
never realize their loss. This financial fiasco 
sometimes happens when people die and their 
heirs don’t know where to look for the cer-
tificates or the securities that their loved ones 
held.
Another reason to hold your securities in an 
account is that doing so cuts down on process-
ing all those dividend cheques. For example, if 
you own a dozen stocks that each pays you a 
quarterly dividend, you must receive, endorse, 
and otherwise deal with 48 separate cheques. 
Some people enjoy this practice — they say 
that doing so is part of the “fun” of owning 
securities. Our advice: Stick all your securities 
in one brokerage account that holds your paid 
dividends. These accounts offer you the abil-
ity to move these payments into a reasonably 
good-yielding money market fund. Most of the 
better investment dealers and discount brokers 
even allow you to reinvest stock dividends in 
the purchase of more shares of that stock at no 
charge.

Par t II: Stocks, Bonds, and Bay Street 
Given the higher costs, why do people stick with full-service investment 
dealers? They may feel they benefit from the research they receive. They may 
look to a full-service investment dealer for advice on larger financial planning 
issues. Or maybe it’s just what their parents did, and setting up an account 
with Dad’s — or Mom’s — dealer was a rite of passage. Some people simply 
like to be able to say “My investment dealer says . . .” just like they enjoy being 
able to talk about their lawyer, their accountant, and so on.
Full-service investment dealers have one major strike against them: The more 
you buy and sell, the more money they make, plain and simple. That’s not to 
say there aren’t good, competent, trustworthy full-service dealers out there — 
there are. But if you’re going to deal with one, you need to take a few basic 
steps in order to get your money’s worth.
 
Your first step should be to educate yourself before you go any further with your 
full-service investment dealer — or before you open an account with one. 
Knowing what products and approach will best suit your circumstances will 
go a long way toward helping ensure your interests come first. Next, have a 
frank discussion about the commissions you’ll pay. Most dealers know that 
discount brokerages are a big competitive force, and are usually willing to 
reduce their commissions to keep your business. For instance, you could 
propose that when an investment comes from your own research and home-
work, you pay the commission that you’d otherwise pay a discount broker. In 
this way you can keep your investments in one place and keep costs down 
while still drawing on your dealer’s knowledge and advice.
Another strike against full-service investment dealers is that they often won’t 
recommend no-load funds because they won’t make a commission. Consider 
proposing a flat fee — say, 1 percent — to your dealer to buy into these 
funds. In many cases, that will be close to what you may end up paying with 
some discounters, once you count in the many buried fees that often exist.
 
The biggest benefit of using a full-service investment dealer — and one not to 
be underestimated — is that he can serve as a sober second opinion. Too many 
individual investors fail to even match the market indexes because they’re too 
quick to sell when prices fall and too slow to buy when prices rise. If a full-
service investment dealer saves you from selling at discount prices when the 
market corrects, she may more than earn her keep.

O
wning a home and investing in real estate are time-
proven methods for building wealth. However, if 
you’re not careful, you can easily fall prey to a number of 
pitfalls. In this part, you discover the right and wrong 
ways to purchase real estate and how to build your real 
estate empire. Even if you don’t want to be a real estate 
tycoon, you also see how simply owning your own home 
can help build your net worth and accomplish future 
financial goals.

F
or most people, buying a home in which to live is their first, best, and 
only real estate investment. Homes may require a lot of financial feeding, 
but over the course of your life, owning a home (instead of renting) can make 
and save you money. Although the pile of mortgage debt seems daunting in 
the years just after your purchase, someday your home may be among your 
biggest assets. (And, yes, real estate is still a good investment despite its 
recent declines in the late 2000s in many areas. Like stocks, real estate does 
well over the long term but doesn’t go continuously higher. Smart investors 
take advantage of down periods as times to buy at lower prices just like they 
do when their favourite retail stores are having a sale.)
 
Even though your home consumes a lot of dough (mortgage payments, property 
taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on) while you own it, it can help you 
accomplish important financial goals, such as
 
✓ Retiring: By the time you hit your 50s and 60s, the size of your monthly 
mortgage payment, relative to your income and assets, should start to 
look small or non-existent. Relatively low housing costs can help you 
afford to retire or cut back from full-time work. Some people are choosing 
to sell their homes and buy less-costly ones or to rent the homes out and 
use some or all of the cash to live on in retirement. Other homeowners 
enhance their retirement income by taking out a reverse mortgage to tap 
the equity (market value of the home minus the outstanding mortgage 
debt) that they’ve built up in their properties.
 
✓ Pursuing your small-business dreams: Running your own business can 
be a source of great satisfaction. Financial barriers, however, prevent 
many people from pulling the plug on a regular job and taking the entre-

208
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
preneurial plunge. You may be able to borrow against the equity that 
you’ve built up in your home to get the cash you need to start your own 
business. Depending on what type of business you have in mind, you 
may even be able to run your enterprise from your home. (We discuss 
small-business issues in more detail in Part IV.)
 
✓ Financing university: Although it may seem like only yesterday that 
your kids were born, soon enough they’re ready for an expensive four-
year undertaking: university. Borrowing against the equity in your home 
is a viable way to help pay for your kids’ educational costs.
Perhaps you won’t use your home’s equity for retirement, a small business, 
educational expenses, or other important financial goals. But even if you 
decide to pass your home on to your children, charity, or a long-lost relative, 
it’s still a valuable asset and a worthwhile investment. This chapter explains 
how to make the most of it.
The Buying Decision
We believe that most people should buy and own a home. But homeowner-
ship isn’t for everybody and certainly not at all times in your adult life.
The decision about if and when to buy a home can be complex. Money matters, 
but so do personal and emotional issues. Buying a home is a big deal — 
you’re settling down. Can you really see yourself coming home to this same 
place day after day, year after year? Of course, you can always move, but now 
you’ve got a financial obligation to deal with.
Weighing the pros and cons of ownership
To hear some people — particularly enthusiastic salespeople in the real 
estate business — everybody should own a home. You may hear them say 
things like the following:
 
✓ Buy a home for the tax break.
 
✓ Renting is like throwing your money away.
 
As we discuss later in this chapter, it’s true that the profit you make when you 
sell the home in which you’ve been living — your primary residence — is tax-free. 
However, many people end up living in their home for many, many years — 
perhaps for the rest of their lives — while others use all the profits from one 
home along with extra savings in order to buy a larger property as their family 

209
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
grows. Tax-free profits are great, but they often don’t get redirected to your 
retirement or other investment account. Don’t buy a home just because of the 
tax break.
As for renting, it isn’t necessarily “throwing your money away.” In fact, renting 
can have a number of benefits:
 
✓ In some communities, with a given type of property, renting is less 
costly than buying. Happy and successful renters we’ve seen include 
people who pay low rent, perhaps because they’ve made housing sac-
rifices. If you can sock away 10 percent or more of your earnings while 
renting, you’re probably well on your way to accomplishing your future 
financial goals.
 
✓ You can save money and hopefully invest in other financial assets. 
Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds (see Part II) are quite accessible and 
useful in retirement. Most homeowners, by contrast, have a substantial 
portion of their wealth tied up in their homes. (Accessibility is a double-
edged sword because it may tempt you as a cash-rich renter to blow the 
money in the short term.)
 
✓ Renting has potential emotional and psychological rewards. First is 
the not-so-inconsequential fact that you have more flexibility to pack 
up and move on. You may have a lease to fulfill, but you can renegotiate 
it if you need to move on. As a homeowner, you have a major monthly 
payment to take care of — to some people, this responsibility feels like 
a financial ball and chain. After all, you have no guarantee that you can 
sell your home in a timely fashion or at the price you desire if you want 
to move.
 
Although renting has its benefits, renting has at least one big drawback: expo-
sure to inflation. As the cost of living increases, your landlord can keep 
increasing your rent (unless you live in a rent-controlled unit). If you’re a hom-
eowner, however, the big monthly expense of the mortgage payment doesn’t 
increase during the existing term of your mortgage, assuming that it is a fixed-
rate mortgage. (Your property taxes, homeowners insurance, and mainte-
nance expenses are exposed to inflation, but these expenses are usually much 
smaller in comparison to your monthly mortgage payment or rent.)
Here’s a quick example to show you how inflation can work against you as a 
long-term renter. Suppose that you’re comparing the costs of owning a home 
that costs $300,000 to renting a similar property for $1,200 a month. (If you’re 
in a high-cost urban area and these numbers seem low, please bear with us 
and focus on the numbers and accompanying insights, which you can apply 
to higher-cost areas.) Buying at $300,000 sounds a lot more expensive than 
renting, doesn’t it? But this isn’t a fair apples-to-apples comparison. You must 
compare the monthly cost of owning to the monthly cost of renting. Figure 10-1 
does just that over 25 years.

The cost of owning versus renting*
As you can see in Figure 10-1, although it costs more in the early years to 
own, owning should be less expensive in the long run. Renting is higher in the 
long term because all of your rental expenses increase with inflation. Note: 
We haven’t factored in the potential change in the value of your home over 
time. Over long periods of time, home prices tend to appreciate, which makes 
owning even more attractive.
 
The example in Figure 10-1 assumes that if you buy, you make a 25 percent 
down payment, and that your mortgage is at 7.5 percent. We also assume that 
the cost of your insurance, property taxes, and maintenance starts at $450 
a month, and those costs increase by 4 percent each year. If you rent, the 
assumption is the rate of inflation of your monthly rental cost is also 4 percent 
per year. Note that if inflation is lower, renting doesn’t necessarily become 
cheaper in the long term. In the absence of inflation, your rent should escalate 
less, but your homeownership expenses (property taxes, maintenance, and 
insurance), which are subject to inflation, should increase less too. And with 
low inflation, you can probably renew your mortgage at a lower interest rate, 
which reduces your monthly mortgage payments. With low or no inflation, 
owning can still cost less, but the savings versus renting aren’t as dramatic as 
when inflation is greater.

211
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
Recouping transaction costs
 
Financially speaking, we advise that you wait to buy a home until you can see 
yourself staying put for a minimum of three years. Ideally, we’d like you to 
think that you have a solid chance of staying with the home for five or more 
years. Why? Buying and selling a home cost big bucks, and you generally need 
at least five years to recoup your transaction costs. Some of the expenses 
you’ll face include
 
✓ Inspection fees: You shouldn’t buy a property without thoroughly 
checking it out, so you’ll incur inspection expenses. Good inspectors 
can help you identify problems with the plumbing, heating, and electri-
cal systems. They also check out the foundation, roof, and so on and let 
you know whether termites are living in the house.
 
✓ Appraisal fee: Your lender may require you to get your home appraised 
so that it can have an independent assessment of the home’s value. An 
appraisal typically costs from $150 to $300 or more.
 
✓ Survey fee: Unless the sellers have recently had a survey done of the 
property, you’ll need to have a new one prepared. Done by a registered 
land surveyor, a survey is simply a drawing of your property that lets you 
and your lender ensure that the buildings you’re buying are indeed on 
your property, that your neighbours’ homes aren’t on your land, and that 
any buildings meet zoning regulations. An up-to-date survey is generally 
needed before you can legally be awarded title. A survey will typically 
cost around $400 to $500.
 
✓ Legal fees: Although you can prepare an offer to purchase yourself and 
tend to the closing costs, using a lawyer to at least search the title is usually 
advisable. A title search is carried out to determine that the vendor actually 
owns the home and has the right to sell it to you, and that the property 
doesn’t have any claims against it. You can save some money by using a 
paralegal, but it’s generally best to use a lawyer. In British Columbia and 
Quebec, lawyers are the only folks legally allowed to complete the pur-
chase. Using a lawyer also gives you valuable insurance. If the lawyer certi-
fies that the seller has the right to sell you the property and that it doesn’t 
have any claims against it — known as free and marketable title — and this 
later proves to be wrong, you can pursue a claim against the lawyer.
 
✓ Title insurance: When you buy a home, you and your lender need to 
protect yourselves against the chance — albeit small — that the property 
seller doesn’t actually legally own the home that you’re buying. That’s 
where title insurance comes in — it protects you financially from 
unscrupulous sellers.

212
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
✓ Moving costs: You can transport all your furniture, clothing, and other 
personal belongings yourself, but your time is worth something, and 
your moving skills are likely limited. Besides, do you want to end up in 
a hospital emergency room after you’re pinned at the bottom of a stair-
case by a runaway couch?
 
✓ Real estate agents’ commissions: A commission of 5 to 7 percent of the 
purchase price of most homes is paid to the real estate salespeople and 
the companies they work for.
 
On top of all these transaction costs of buying and then selling a home, you’ll 
also face maintenance expenses — for example, fixing leaky pipes and paint-
ing. To cover all the transaction and maintenance costs of homeownership, 
the value of your home needs to appreciate about 15 percent over the years 
that you own it just for you to be as well off financially as if you had continued 
renting. Fifteen percent! If you need or want to move elsewhere in a few years, 
Knowing when to buy
If you’re considering buying a home, you may 
be concerned whether home prices are poised 
to rise or fall. No one wants to purchase a home 
that then plummets in value. And who wouldn’t 
like to buy just before prices go on an upward 
trajectory?
It’s not easy to predict what’s going to happen 
with real estate prices in a particular city, prov-
ince, or country over the next one, two, or three 
or more years. (Just think about how quickly 
the subprime mortgage crisis hit in 2008. A year 
earlier you would have been hard-pressed to 
find more than the odd voice in the wilderness 
warning that house prices were set to drop 
in a number of regions.) Ultimately, the eco-
nomic health and vitality of an area drive the 
demand and prices for homes in that area. An 
increase in jobs, particularly ones that pay well, 
increases the demand for housing. And when 
demand goes up, so do prices.
If you first buy a home when you’re in your 20s, 
30s, or even your 40s, you may end up as a home-
owner for several decades. Over such a long time, 
you may experience lots of ups and downs, but 
probably more ups than downs, so we wouldn’t 
be too concerned about trying to predict what’s 
going to happen to the real estate market in 
the near term. We know some long-term rent-
ers who avoided buying homes decades ago 
because they thought that prices were expen-
sive. Consequently, they missed out on tremen-
dous appreciation in real estate values.
That said, you may be, at particular times in 
your life, ambivalent about buying a home. 
Perhaps you’re not sure that you’ll stay put for 
more than three to five years. Therefore, part 
of your home-buying decision may hinge on 
whether current home prices in your local area 
offer you a good value. The level of real estate 
prices as compared to rent, the state of the job 
market, and the number of home listings for sale 
are useful indicators of the housing market’s 
health. Trying to time your purchase has more 
importance if you think that you may move in 
less than five years. In that case, avoid buying 
in a high market. If you expect to move so soon, 
renting generally makes more sense because of 
the high costs of buying and selling real estate.

213
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
counting on that kind of appreciation in those few years is risky. If you happen 
to buy just before a sharp rise in housing prices, you may get this much appre-
ciation in a short time. But you can’t count on this upswing — you’re more 
likely to lose money on such a short-term deal.
Some people invest in real estate even when they don’t expect to live in 
the home for long and may consider turning their home into a rental if they 
move within a few years. Doing so can work well financially in the long haul, 
but don’t underestimate the responsibilities that come with rental property, 
which we discuss in Chapter 11.
Deciding How Much to Spend
Buying a home is a long-term financial commitment. You’ll probably choose to 
repay the money you borrow to purchase your home (your mortgage) over 25 
years. This is called the amortization. Over the years, your home will also need 
maintenance. So before you decide to buy, take stock of your overall financial 
health.
 
If you have good credit and a reliable source of employment, lenders will 
eagerly offer to loan you money. They’ll tell you how much you may borrow 
from them — the maximum that you’re qualified to borrow. But that doesn’t 
mean that you should borrow the maximum.
If you buy a home without considering your other monthly expenditures and 
long-term goals, you may end up with a home that dictates much of your 
future spending. Have you considered, for example, how much you need to 
save monthly to reach your retirement goals? How about the amount that 
you want to spend on recreation and entertainment?
If you want to continue your current lifestyle, you have to be honest with 
yourself about how much you can really afford to spend as a homeowner. 
First-time homebuyers in particular run into financial trouble when they 
don’t understand their current spending. Buying a home can be a wise deci-
sion, but it can also be a huge burden. And there are all sorts of nifty things 
to buy for a home. Some people prop up their spending habits with credit 
cards — a dangerous practice.
 
Don’t let your home control your financial future. Before you buy a property 
or agree to a particular mortgage, be sure that you can afford to do so — be 
especially careful not to ignore your retirement planning (if you hope to 
someday retire). Start by reading Chapter 3. After reading the following sec-
tions, you can also check out Chapter 12, where we cover mortgages and 
financing options in greater detail.

214
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Looking through lenders’ eyes
All mortgage lenders want to gauge your ability to repay the money that you 
borrow, so you have to pass a few tests. Mortgage lenders calculate the maxi-
mum amount that you can borrow to buy a piece of real estate.
For a home in which you will reside, lenders total your monthly housing 
expenses. They define your housing costs as:
+       Condominium maintenance fees
(for condominium buyers)
Mortgage payment       +
Property taxes 
(and sometimes heating)
 
Most lenders don’t want any more than 30 to 32 percent of your monthly gross 
(pre-tax) income going toward your housing expense. The maximum amount 
you’ll be able to borrow will typically be where the corresponding monthly 
payments come to just under a third of your pre-tax income. (Lenders don’t 
usually consider the maintenance and upkeep expenses that come with 
owning a home.) This is known as the gross debt service ratio.
 
If you’re self-employed, determining what a lender will allow you to borrow is 
much less formulaic. Lenders will typically want to see your financial state-
ments and income tax returns for the last few years. Just how much you’ll be 
able to borrow is often worked out on an individual basis. Lending ratios vary 
slightly from lender to lender.
Although lenders may not care where you spend money outside your home, 
they do care about your other debt. A lot of other debt, such as credit cards 
or auto loans, diminishes the funds that are available to pay your housing 
expenses. Lenders know that having other debt increases the possibility that 
you may fall behind or actually default on your mortgage payments.
If you have consumer debt that requires monthly payments, lenders calculate 
another ratio to determine the maximum that you can borrow. Lenders add 
the amount that you need to pay down your other consumer debt to your 
monthly housing expense.
 
Consumer debt is bad news even without considering that it hurts your quali-
fication for a mortgage. Consumer debt is costly and encourages you to live 
beyond your means. Get rid of it — curtail your spending and adjust to living 
within your means. If you can’t live within your means as a renter, doing so is 
going to be even harder as a homeowner.

215
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
Determining your down payment
Another factor to consider when you decide how much you should borrow is 
that most lenders require you to purchase mortgage insurance if your down 
payment is less than 20 percent of your home’s purchase price. Mortgage 
insurance protects the lender from getting stuck with a property that may be 
worth less than the mortgage you owe, in the event that you default on your 
loan. On a moderate-size loan, mortgage insurance can add hundreds of 
dollars per year to your payments.
If you have to take mortgage insurance to buy a home with less than 20 percent 
down, keep an eye on your home’s value and your loan balance. Over time, 
the value of your property should appreciate and your loan balance should 
decrease as you make monthly payments. After your mortgage represents 80 
percent or less of the market value of the home, you can get rid of the mortgage 
insurance (doing so entails contacting your lender and usually requires you to 
pay for an appraisal).
Homeownership tax savings
Any profit you make when you sell your home 
is generally tax-free. In addition to a house, this 
includes condos and townhouses, as well as a 
share in a co-operative housing corporation.
To qualify, the property you’re selling has to be 
what’s called your principal residence — you 
or your spouse or child must have “ordinarily 
inhabited” the property. This means you can’t 
claim the exemption on empty land or a building 
that you rent out and have never lived in. You 
don’t have to live there the majority of the year 
to call a property your “principal residence.”
Your principal residence doesn’t have to be a 
“house” in the traditional sense. You are, how-
ever, limited to designating a single property 
as your principal residence in any given year. 
If you have a home and a cottage, for example, 
you could choose to designate the home as 
your principal residence for some years and 
the cottage for others.
When you sell a property, just how much of 
your gain will be tax-free is determined by a for-
mula that looks at how many years you owned 
it, how many years it was your principal resi-
dence, and the overall increase in value. If you 
move out of your home, but rather than sell you 
choose to rent it out, you can generally still call 
it your “principal” residence — and claim the 
tax-break — for up to four years. You need to 
file a special election along with your tax return 
for the year in which you begin renting out your 
home. You can’t, however, claim another prop-
erty as your residence during that time, even if 
it is one in which you are living full-time.

216
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
What if you have so much money that you can afford to make more than 
a 20 percent down payment? How much should you put down then? (This 
problem doesn’t usually arise — most buyers, especially first-time buyers, 
struggle to get a 20 percent down payment together.) The answer depends 
on what else you can or want to do with the money. If you’re considering 
other investment opportunities, determine whether you can expect to earn a 
higher rate of return on those other investments versus the interest rate that 
you’ll pay on the mortgage. During the past century, stock market and real 
estate investors have enjoyed average annual returns of around 8 to 10 per-
cent per year. So if you borrow mortgage money at around 6 to 7 percent, in 
the long term you should come out a couple of percent ahead if you use the 
money you would have put toward a larger down payment to invest in such 
growth investments. You aren’t guaranteed, of course, that your investments 
will earn 8 to 10 percent yearly. (Remember that past returns don’t guarantee 
the future.) And don’t forget that all investments come with risk. The advan-
tage of putting more money down for a home and borrowing less is that it’s 
essentially a risk-free investment (as long as you have adequate insurance on 
your property).
 
If you prefer to put down just 20 percent and invest more money elsewhere, 
that’s fine. Just don’t keep the extra money (beyond an emergency reserve) 
under the mattress, in a savings account, or in bonds that pay less interest 
than your mortgage costs you in interest. Invest in stocks, real estate, or a 
small business. Otherwise, you don’t have a chance at earning a higher return 
than the cost of your mortgage, and you’re therefore better off paying down 
your mortgage.
Selecting Your Property Type
If you’re ready to buy a home, you must make some decisions about what 
and where to buy. If you grew up in the suburbs, your image of a home may 
include the traditional single-family home with a lawn, a couple of kids, and 
the family pets. But single-family homes, of course, aren’t the only or even 
the main types of residential housing in many areas, especially in some 
higher-cost, urban neighbourhoods. Other common types of higher-density 
housing include the following:
 
✓ Condominiums: These are generally apartment-style units that are 
stacked on top of and adjacent to one another. Many condo buildings 
were originally apartments that were converted — through the sale 
of ownership of separate units — into condos. When you purchase a 
condominium, you purchase a specific unit as well as a share of the 
common areas (for example, the pool, grass and other plantings, entry 
and hallways, laundry room, and so on).

217
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
 
✓ Townhouses: Townhouse is just a fancy way of saying attached or row 
home. Think of a townhouse as a cross between a condominium and 
a single-family house. Townhouses are condo-like because they’re 
attached (generally sharing walls and a roof) and are homelike because 
they’re often two-storey buildings that come with a small yard.
 
✓ Cooperatives: Cooperatives (usually called co-ops) resemble apartment 
and condominium buildings. When you buy a share in a cooperative, 
you own a share of the entire building, including some living space. 
Unlike in a condo, you generally need to get approval from the coopera-
tive association if you want to remodel or rent your unit to a tenant. In 
some co-ops, you must even gain approval from the association for the 
sale of your unit to a proposed buyer. Co-ops are generally much harder 
to obtain loans for and to sell, so we don’t recommend that you buy one 
unless you get a good deal and can easily obtain a loan.
All types of shared housing (the types of housing in the preceding list) offer 
two potential advantages:
 
✓ First, this type of housing generally gives you more living space for your 
dollars. This value makes sense because with a single-family home, a 
good chunk of the property’s cost is for the land that the home sits on. 
Land is good for decks, recreation, and children who want to roll around 
on the grass (or in the snow), but you don’t live “in” it the way you do 
with your home. Shared housing maximizes living space for the housing 
dollars that you spend.
 
✓ Another benefit of shared housing is that, in many situations, you’re not 
personally responsible for general maintenance. Instead, the homeowners’ 
association (which you pay into) takes care of it. If you don’t have the time, 
energy, or desire to keep up a property, shared housing can make sense. 
Shared housing units may also give you access to recreation facilities, 
such as a pool, tennis courts, and exercise equipment.
So why doesn’t everyone purchase shared housing? Well, as investments, 
single-family houses generally perform better in the long run. In a good real 
estate market, single-family houses tend to outperform other housing types. 
Shared housing is easier to build (and to overbuild) — and the greater supply 
tends to keep its prices from rising as much. Single-family houses tend to 
attract more potential buyers — most people, when they can afford it, prefer 
a stand-alone home, especially for the increased privacy.
 
If you can afford a smaller single-family house instead of a larger shared-housing 
unit, buy the single-family house. Shared housing makes more sense for 
people who don’t want to deal with building maintenance and who value the 
security of living in a larger building with other people. Also know that shared-
housing prices tend to hold up better in developed urban environments. If 

218
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
possible, avoid shared housing units in suburban areas where the availability 
of developable land makes building many more units possible, thus increasing 
the supply of housing and slowing growth in values.
If shared housing interests you, make sure that you have the property thor-
oughly inspected. Also, examine the trend in maintenance fees over time to 
ensure that these costs are under control. (See Chapter 11 for more specifics 
on how to check out property.)
Finding the Right Property and Location
Some people know where they want to live, so they look at just a handful of 
properties and then buy. Most people take much more time — finding the 
right house in a desired area at a fair price can take a lot of time. Buying a 
home can also entail much compromise when you buy with other family 
members (particularly spouses).
Be realistic about how long it may take you to get up to speed about different 
areas and to find a home that meets your various desires and concerns. If 
you’re a normal person with a full-time job and you’re confined to occasional 
weekends and evenings to look for a house, three to six months is a short 
time period to settle on an area and actually find and successfully negotiate 
on a property. Six months to a year isn’t unusual or slow. Remember that 
you’re talking about an enormous purchase that you’ll come home to daily.
 
Real estate agents can be a big barrier to taking your time with this monumental 
decision. Some agents are pushy and want to make a sale, get their commission, 
and move on to the next client. As a buyer, don’t work with such agents — 
they can make you miserable, unhappy, and broke. If necessary, begin your 
search without an agent to avoid this outside pressure. See Chapter 12 for 
additional information on working with an agent.
Keep an open mind
Before you start your search, you may have an idea about the type of prop-
erty and location that interests you or that you think you can afford. You may 
think, for example, that you can afford only a condominium in the neighbour-
hood that you want. But if you take the time to check out other communities, 
you may find another area that meets most of your needs and has affordable 
single-family homes. You’d never know that, though, if you narrowed your 
search too quickly.

219
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
Even if you’ve lived in an area for a while and think that you know it well, look 
at different types of properties in a variety of locations before you start to 
narrow your search. Be open-minded and make sure that you know which of 
your many criteria for a home you really care about. You’ll likely have to be 
flexible with some of your preferences.
 
After you focus on a particular area or neighbourhood, make sure that you see 
the full range of properties available. If you want to spend $250,000 on a home, 
look at properties that are more expensive. Unless an area is experiencing a 
boom, real estate usually sells for less than its listing price, and you may feel 
comfortable spending a little bit more after you see what you can purchase if 
you stretch your budget a little bit. Also, if you work with an agent, make sure 
that you don’t overlook homes that are for sale by their owners (that is, prop-
erties not listed with real estate agents). Otherwise, you may miss out on 
some good prospects.
Research, research, research
 
Thinking that you can know what an area is like from anecdotes or from a 
small number of personal experiences is a mistake. You may have read or 
heard that someone was mugged in a particular area. That doesn’t make that 
area dangerous — or more dangerous than others. Get the facts. Anecdotes 
and people’s perceptions often aren’t accurate reflections of the facts. Check 
out the following key items:
 
✓ Amenities: Hopefully, you don’t spend all your time at work, slaving 
away to make your monthly mortgage payment. We hope that you have 
time to use parks, sports and recreation facilities, and so on. You can 
drive around the neighbourhood you’re interested in to get a sense of 
these attractions. Most real estate agents just love to show off their 
favorite neighbourhoods. Cities and towns can also mail you information 
booklets that detail what they have to offer and where you can find it.
 
✓ Schools: If you have kids, you care about this issue a lot. Unfortunately, 
many people make snap judgments about school quality without doing 
their homework. Visit the schools and don’t blindly rely on test scores. 
Talk to parents and teachers and discover what goes on at the schools.
 
 If you don’t have (or want!) school-age children, you may be tempted to 
say, “What the heck do I care about the quality of the schools?” You 
need to care about the schools because even if you don’t have kids, the 
quality of the local schools and whether they’re improving or faltering 
has a direct bearing on the value of your property. Consider these issues 
even if they’re not important to you, because they can affect the resale 
value of your property.

220
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
✓ Property taxes: What will your property taxes be? Property tax rates 
vary from community to community. Check with the town’s assessment 
office or with a good real estate agent.
 
✓ Crime: Call the local police department or visit your public library to get 
the facts on crime. Cities and towns keep all sorts of crime statistics for 
neighbourhoods — use them!
 
✓ Future development: Check with the planning department in towns that 
you’re considering living in to find out what types of new development 
and major renovations are in the works. Planning people may also be 
aware of problems in particular areas.
 
✓ Catastrophic risks: Are the neighbourhoods that you’re considering 
buying a home in susceptible to major risks, such as floods, tornadoes, 
mudslides, fires, or earthquakes? Although homeowner’s insurance can 
protect you financially, consider how you may deal with such catastro-
phes emotionally — insurance eases only the financial pain of a home 
loss. All areas have some risk, and a home in the safest of areas can burn 
to the ground. Although you can’t eliminate all risks, you can at least 
educate yourself about the potential catastrophic risks in various areas.
 
If you’re new to an area or don’t have a handle on an area’s risks, try a number 
of different sources. Knowledgeable and honest real estate agents may help, 
but you can also dig for primary information. Contact Environment Canada as 
well as the Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada office (www.
ocipep.gc.ca) to find out about potential flooding and earthquake risks in 
the area you’re considering. Insurance companies and agencies can also tell 
you what they know about risks in particular areas.
Understand market value
Over many months, you’ll perhaps look at dozens of properties for sale. Use 
these viewings as an opportunity to find out what places are worth. The 
listing price isn’t what a house is worth — it may be, but odds are it’s not. 
Property that is priced to sell usually does just that — it sells. Properties left 
on the market are often overpriced. The listing price on such properties may 
reflect what an otherwise greedy or uninformed seller and his agent hope 
that some fool will pay.
 
Of the properties that you see, keep track of the prices that they end up sell-
ing for. (Good agents can help you obtain this information.) Properties usually 
sell for less than the listed price. Keeping track of selling prices gives you a 
good handle on what properties are really worth and a better sense of what 
you can afford.

221
 Chapter 10: Investing in a Home
Pound the pavement
After you set your sights on that special home, thoroughly check out the 
surroundings — you should know what you’re getting yourself into.
 
Go back to the neighbourhood in which the property is located at different 
times of the day and on different days of the week. Knock on a few doors and 
meet your potential neighbours. Ask questions. Talk to property owners as 
well as renters. Because they don’t have a financial stake in the area, renters 
are often more forthcoming with negative information about an area.
After you decide where and what to buy, you’re ready to try to put a deal 
together. We cover issues common to both home and investment property 
purchases — such as mortgages, negotiations, inspections, and so on — in 
Chapter 12.

f you’ve already bought your own home (and even if you haven’t), using 
real estate as an investment may interest you. Over the decades and 
generations, real estate investing, like the stock market and small-business 
investments, has generated tremendous wealth for participants. (Please see 
Chapter 2 for more on the rate of return from good real estate investments.)
 
Real estate is like other types of ownership investments, such as stocks, where 
you have an ownership stake in an asset. Although you have the potential for 
significant profits, don’t forget that you also accept greater risk. Real estate 
isn’t a gravy train or a simple way to get wealthy. Like stocks, real estate goes 
through good and bad performance periods. Most people who make money 
investing in real estate do so because they invest and hold property over 
many years. The vast majority of people who don’t make money in real estate 
don’t because they make easily avoidable mistakes. In this chapter, we discuss 
how to make the best real estate investments and avoid the rest.
Outlining Real Estate Investment 
Attractions
As we discuss in Chapter 1, many types of people build their wealth by invest-
ing in real estate. Some people focus exclusively on property investments, but 
many others build their wealth through the companies they started or through 
other avenues and then diversify into real estate investments. What do these 

224
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
wealthy folks know, and why do they choose to invest in real estate? In the 
following sections, we cover some of real estate’s attractions.
 
Real estate, like all investments, has its pros and cons. Investing in real estate 
is time intensive and carries investment and other risks. Invest in real estate 
because you enjoy the challenge and because you want to diversify your port-
folio (an advantage of real estate is that its value doesn’t move in lockstep 
with other investments, such as stocks or small-business investments that you 
hold). Don’t take this route because you seek a get-rich-quick outlet.
Limited land
The supply of buildable, desirable land on planet Earth is limited. And 
because people are prone to reproduce, demand for land and housing con-
tinues to grow. Land and what you can do with it are what make real estate 
valuable. Cities and islands such as Hawaii, Hong Kong, Vancouver, San 
Francisco, Toronto, Los Angeles, and New York City have the highest housing 
costs around because land is limited in these places.
Leverage
Real estate is different from most other investments in that you can borrow 
80 to 90 percent (or more) of the value of the property to buy it. Thus, you 
can use your small down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price 
to buy, own, and control a much larger investment; this concept is called 
leverage. Of course, you hope that the value of your real estate goes up — if 
it does, you make money on your original dollars invested, as well as on the 
money that you borrowed.
Here’s a quick example to illustrate. Suppose that you purchase a rental 
property for $150,000 and make a $30,000 down payment. Over the next three 
years, imagine that the property appreciates to $180,000. Thus, you have a 
profit (on paper at least) of $30,000 on an investment of just $30,000. In other 
words, you’ve made a 100 percent return on your investment. (Note that in 
this scenario, we ignore whether your expenses from the property exceed 
the rental income that you collect.)
 
Leverage is good for you if property prices appreciate, but leverage can also 
work against you. If your $150,000 property decreases in value to $120,000, 
even though it’s dropped only 20 percent in value, you actually lose (on 
paper) 100 percent of your original $30,000 investment. If you have an out-
standing mortgage of $120,000 on this property and you need to sell, you 

225
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
actually must pay money into the sale to cover selling costs, in addition to 
losing your entire original investment. Ouch!
Appreciation and income
Another reason that real estate is a popular investment is that you can make 
money from it in two major ways:
 
✓ First, you hope and expect that over the years, your real estate invest-
ments will appreciate in value. The appreciation of your properties 
compounds, tax-deferred, during your years of ownership. You don’t 
pay tax on this profit until you sell your property.
 
 If you sell a property for more than you paid for it — particularly if you 
have been renting it out for several years — your profits will generally 
be deemed to be capital gains. That’s a heck of a deal when you consider 
that capital gains are taxed at half the rate of ordinary income.
 
✓ In addition to making money from your properties’ increase in value, 
you can also make money from the ongoing business that you run — 
renting the property. You rent out investment property to make a profit 
based on the property’s rental income that (hopefully) exceeds your 
expenses (mortgage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so 
on). Unless you make a large down payment, your monthly operating 
profit will usually be small or non-existent in the early years of rental 
property ownership. Over time, your operating profit, which is subject 
to ordinary income tax, should rise as you increase your rental prices 
faster than your expenses. During soft periods in the local economy, 
however, rents may rise more slowly than your expenses (or rents may 
even fall).
Ability to “add value”
You as a small investor can’t add value to stocks by “fixing them up,” but 
you may have some good ideas about how to improve a property and make 
it more valuable. Perhaps you can fix up a property or develop it further and 
raise the rental income and resale value accordingly. Through legwork, per-
sistence, and good negotiating skills, you can purchase a property below its 
fair market value.
Relative to investing in the stock market, tenacious and savvy real estate inves-
tors can more easily buy property below its fair market value. You can do the 
same in the stock market, but the scores of professional, full-time money 
managers who analyze stocks make finding bargains more difficult.

226
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
Ego gratification
Face it, investing in real estate appeals to some investors because land and 
buildings are tangible. Although few admit it, some real estate investors get an 
ego rush from a tangible display of their wealth. You can drive past investment 
real estate and show it off to others. In an article in The New York Times titled 
“What My Ego Wants, My Ego Gets,” Donald Trump publicly admitted what 
most everyone else knew long ago: He holds his real estate investments partly 
for his ego. Trump confessed of his purchase of the famed Plaza Hotel in the 
Big Apple, “I realized it was 100 percent true — ego did play a large role in the 
Plaza purchase and is, in fact, a significant factor in all of my deals.”
Real estate investing isn’t as wonderful as they say
If you’ve read some of the many real estate 
investment books that have been published over 
the years, you may need to slightly deprogram 
yourself. Too often, authors attempt to make 
real estate investments sound like the one and 
only sure way to become a multimillionaire with 
little effort. Consider the following statements 
made by real estate book authors. Our rebuttals 
to their claims follow:
“Rather than yielding only a small interest pay-
ment or dividend, real estate in prime locations 
can appreciate 20 percent a year or more.”
Bank accounts, bonds, and stocks pay interest 
or dividends that typically amount to 2 to 6 per-
cent per year (the total return on stocks aver-
ages about 8 to 10 percent per year). However, 
bank accounts and bonds aren’t comparable 
investments to stocks or real estate — they’re 
far more conservative and liquid and therefore 
don’t offer the potential for double-digit returns. 
Stock market investing is comparable to invest-
ing in real estate, but you shouldn’t go into real 
estate investments expecting annual returns of 
20 percent or more. Those who purchased good 
Toronto or Vancouver real estate in the 1950s 
and held onto it for the next three decades 
earned handsome returns as the population of 
this area boomed. Finding areas like these — 
and knowing how long to hold on to investments 
in these areas — is easier said than done. With 
real estate investments, over the long haul you 
can expect to earn 8 to 12 percent per year, but 
not 20 percent or more.
“A good piece of property can’t do anything but 
go up!”
Any city, town, or community has good pieces of 
real estate. But that doesn’t mean that commu-
nities can’t and won’t have slow or depressed 
years. Real estate in some parts of the prairies, 
for example, has appreciated quite slowly — at 
or just above the rate of inflation — for periods 
as long as a generation or more.
“Real estate is the best way of preserving and 
enhancing wealth. . . . [it] stands head and shoul-
ders above any other form of investment.”
Investing in stocks or in a small business is 
every bit as profitable as investing in real estate. 
In fact, more great fortunes have been built in 
small business than in any other form of invest-
ment. Over the long term, stock market inves-
tors have enjoyed (with far less hassle) average 
annual rates of return comparable to real estate 
investors’ returns.

227
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
Longer-term focus
One problem with investing in the securities markets, such as the stock 
market, is that prices are constantly changing. Television news programs, 
Web sites, BlackBerrys, and other communication devices dutifully report 
the latest price quotes. From our observations and discussions with indi-
vidual investors, we’ve seen how the constant reports on changes in the 
financial markets cause some investors to lose sight of the long term and 
the big picture. In the worst cases, large short-term drops like we saw in late 
2008 lead investors to panic and sell at what end up being bargain prices. Or 
headlines about big increases pull investors in lemming-like fashion into an 
overheated and peaking market. Because all you need to do is click your com-
puter mouse or dial a toll-free phone number to place your sell or buy order, 
some stock market investors fall prey to irrational snap judgments.
Like the stock market, the real estate market is constantly changing. 
However, to a real estate investor, short-term, day-to-day, and week-to-week 
changes are invisible. Publications don’t report the value of your real estate 
holdings daily, weekly, or even monthly, and that’s a good thing because it 
encourages a longer-term focus. If prices do decline over the months and 
years, you’re much less likely to sell in a panic with real estate. Preparing a 
property for sale and eventually getting it sold take a good deal of time, and 
this barrier to quickly selling helps keep your vision in focus.
Figuring Out Who Should 
Avoid Real Estate Investing
 
Real estate investing isn’t for everyone; not even close. Most people do better 
financially when they invest their ownership holdings in a diversified portfolio of 
stocks, such as through stock mutual funds. Shy away from real estate invest-
ments that involve managing property if you fall into either of the following 
categories:
 
✓ You’re time starved and anxious. Buying and owning investment property 
and being a landlord take a lot of time. If you fail to do your homework 
before purchasing real estate, you can end up overpaying — or buying 
a heap of trouble. As for managing a property, you can hire a property 
manager to help with screening and finding good tenants and trouble-
shooting problems with the building, but this step costs money and 
still requires some time involvement. Also, remember that most tenants 
don’t care for a property the same way property owners do. If every 
little scratch or carpet stain sends your blood pressure skyward, avoid 
distressing yourself as a landlord.

228
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
 
✓ You’re not interested in real estate. Some people simply don’t feel com-
fortable and informed when it comes to investing in real estate. If you’ve 
had experience and success with stock market investing, that’s a good 
reason to stick with it and avoid real estate. Over long periods of time, 
both stocks and real estate provide comparable returns.
Examining Simple, Profitable 
Real Estate Investments
Investing in rental real estate that you’re responsible for can be a lot of work. 
With rental properties, you have all the headaches of maintaining a property, 
including finding and dealing with tenants, without the benefits of living in 
and enjoying the property.
 
Unless you’re extraordinarily interested in and motivated to own investment 
real estate, start with and perhaps limit your real estate investing to a couple 
of much simpler yet still profitable methods that we discuss in this section.
A place to call home
During your adult life, you need a roof over your head. However, you may be 
able to sponge off your folks or some other relative for a number of years. If 
you’re content with this arrangement, you can minimize your housing costs 
and save more for a down payment and possibly toward other goals. Go for 
it, if your relatives will!
But what if neither you nor your relatives are up for the challenge? For the 
long term, because you need a place to live, why not own real estate instead 
of renting it? Real estate is the only investment that you can live in or rent to 
produce income. You can’t live in a stock, bond, or mutual fund! Unless you 
expect to move within the next few years, buying a place probably makes 
good long-term financial sense. In the long term, owning usually costs less 
than renting and allows you to build equity in an asset. Read Chapter 10 to 
find out more about profiting from homeownership.
Real estate investment trusts
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are entities that generally invest in dif-
ferent types of property, such as shopping centres, apartments, and other 
rental buildings. For a fee, REIT managers identify and negotiate the purchase 

229
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
of properties that they believe are good investments and manage these prop-
erties, including all tenant relations. Thus, REITs are a good way to invest in 
real estate for people who don’t want the hassles and headaches that come 
with directly owning and managing rental property.
 
Surprisingly, most books that focus on real estate investing neglect REITs. 
Why? We’ve come to the conclusion that they do so for three major reasons:
 
✓ First, if you invest in real estate through REITs, you don’t need to read a 
long, complicated book on real estate investment.
 
✓ Second, real estate agents write many of these books. Not surprisingly, 
the real estate investment strategies touted in these books include and 
advocate the use of such agents. You can buy REITs without real estate 
agents.
 
✓ Finally, a certain snobbishness prevails among people who consider them-
selves to be “serious” real estate investors. One real estate writer/investor 
went so far as to say that REITs aren’t “real” real estate investments.
Please. No, you can’t drive your friends by a REIT and show it off. But those 
who put their egos aside when making real estate investments are happy that 
they considered REITs and have enjoyed double-digit annual gains over the 
decades.
Converting your home into a rental
If you move into another home, turning your 
current home into a rental property may make 
sense. After all, it saves you the time and cost 
of finding a separate rental property.
Unfortunately, many people make the mistake of 
holding on to their current home for the wrong 
reasons when they buy another. This situation 
often happens when homeowners must sell 
their home in a depressed market (such as 
existed in many areas in the late 2000s). Nobody 
likes to lose money and sell their home for less 
than they paid for it. Thus, some owners hold on 
to their homes until prices recover.
If you plan to move and want to keep your cur-
rent home as a long-term investment property, 
you can. But turning your home into a short-
term rental is usually a bad move for a couple 
of reasons:
 ✓ First, you may not want the responsibilities 
of a landlord, yet you force yourself into the 
landlord business when you convert your 
home into a rental.
 ✓ Second, if the home eventually does 
rebound in value, you owe tax on the profit 
if your property is a rental when you sell it 
and don’t buy another rental property.

230
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
You can research and purchase shares in individual REITs, which trade as 
securities on the major stock exchanges. An even better approach is to buy a 
mutual fund that invests in a diversified mixture of REITs (see Chapter 8).
In addition to providing you with a diversified, low-hassle real estate invest-
ment, REITs offer an additional advantage that traditional rental real estate 
doesn’t: You can easily invest in REITs with money inside a tax-deferred 
account (for example, an RRSP). As with traditional real estate investments, 
you can even buy REITs and mutual fund REITs with borrowed money.
Evaluating Direct Property Investments
Every year several publications put out lists of the wealthiest people. (They 
generally leave out mobsters and drug kingpins — the money must be made 
through seemingly legitimate and legal channels.) Numerous people get on 
these lists primarily because of their real estate investments. For others, real 
estate was an important secondary factor that contributed to their wealth.
Consider Marcel Adams. Born in Romania, Mr. Adams was forced into a 
labour camp during the Second World War, escaped his native country, and 
landed in Canada in the 1950s. After working as a hide tanner and trader in 
Quebec City, he got into real estate and began building strip malls and shop-
ping centres. After he’d built up his cash flow and minimized his debts, he 
moved into the lending business with Les Placements Jeton Bleu Inc. (Blue 
Chip Investments). The company specialized in lending money at high rates 
to high-risk commercial real estate ventures. In the early 1990s, real estate 
prices plummeted, dozens of owners defaulted on their over-leveraged prop-
erties, and Mr. Adams’s company took them back. The company expanded to 
own many buildings and malls, including some of Quebec’s most well-known 
shopping centres. At one point, Mr. Adams’s worth was estimated to be over 
$900 million.
If you think you’re cut out to be a landlord and are ready for the responsibil-
ity of buying, owning, and managing rental real estate, you have lots of direct 
real estate investment options from which to choose.
 
Before you begin this potentially treacherous journey, we strongly recom-
mend that you read Chapter 10. Many concepts you need to know to be a suc-
cessful real estate investor are similar to those you need to know when you 
buy a home. The rest of this chapter focuses on issues that are unique to real 
estate investing.
Ideally, you should plan to make real estate investments that you hold until, 
and perhaps through, your retirement years, although some investors prefer 
to buy properties, improve them, and then move on. But what should you 
buy? The following is our take on various real estate investments.

231
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
Residential housing
 
Your best bet for real estate investing is to purchase residential property. 
People always need a place to live. Residential housing is easier to under-
stand, purchase, and manage than most other types of property, such as office 
and retail property. If you’re a homeowner, you already have experience locat-
ing, purchasing, and maintaining residential property.
The most common residential housing options are single-family houses, con-
dominiums, and townhouses. You can also purchase multiunit buildings. In 
addition to the considerations that we address in Chapter 10, from an invest-
ment and rental perspective, consider the following issues when you decide 
what type of property to buy:
 
✓ Tenants: Single-family homes with just one tenant (could be a family, a 
couple, or a single person) are simpler to deal with than multiunit 
apartment buildings that require the management and maintenance 
of multiple renters and units.
 
✓ Maintenance: From the property owner’s perspective, condominiums 
are generally the lowest-maintenance properties because most condo-
minium associations deal with issues such as roofing, gardening, and 
so on for the entire building. Note that as the owner, you’re still respon-
sible for maintenance that is needed inside your unit, such as servicing 
appliances, interior painting, and so on. Beware, though, that some 
condo complexes don’t allow rentals.
 
 With a single-family home or apartment building, you’re responsible for all 
the maintenance. Of course, you can hire someone to do the work, but you 
still have to find the contractors and coordinate and oversee the work.
 
✓ Appreciation potential: Look for property where simple cosmetic and 
other fixes may allow you to increase rents. Such improvements can 
increase the market value of the property. Although condos may be 
easier on the unit owner to maintain, they tend to appreciate less than 
homes or apartment buildings, unless the condos are located in a desir-
able urban area. One way to add value to some larger properties is to 
“condo-ize” them. In some areas, if zoning allows, you can convert a 
single-family home or multiunit apartment building into condominiums. 
Keep in mind, however, that this metamorphosis requires significant 
research, both on the zoning front as well as with estimating remodelling 
and construction costs.
 
✓ Cash flow: As we discuss in the “Examining and estimating cash flow” 
section later in the chapter, your rental property brings in rental income 
that you hope covers and exceeds your expenses. The difference between 
the rental income you collect and the expenses you pay out is known as 
your cash flow.

Unless you can afford a large down payment (25 percent or more), the early 
years of rental property ownership may financially challenge you. Making a 
profit in the early years from the monthly cash flow with a single-family home 
is hard because such properties usually sell at a premium price relative to the 
rent that they can command. Remember, you pay extra for the land, which 
you can’t rent. Also, the downside to having just one tenant is that when you 
have a vacancy, you have no rental income.
Apartment buildings, particularly those with more units, can generally pro-
duce a small positive cash flow, even in the early years of rental ownership. 
With all properties, as time goes on, generating a positive cash flow gets 
easier as you pay down your mortgage debt and hopefully increase your rents.
 
Unless you really want to minimize maintenance responsibilities, avoid 
condominium investments. Single-family home investments are generally more 
straightforward for most people. Just make sure that you run the numbers (we 
show you how in the “Examining and estimating cash flow” section, later in 
this chapter) on your rental income and expenses to see whether you can 
afford the negative cash flow that often occurs in the early years of ownership. 
Apartment building investments are best left to sophisticated investors who 
like a challenge and can manage more complex properties. As we discuss in 
Chapter 12, do thorough inspections before you buy any rental property.
Land
 
If tenants are a hassle and maintaining a building is a never-ending pain, why 
not invest in land? Buy land in an area that will soon experience a building 
boom, hold on to it until prices soar, and then cash in. Such an investment 
idea sounds good in theory. In practice, however, making the big bucks 
through land investments isn’t easy. Although land doesn’t require upkeep 
and tenants, it does require financial feeding.
Investing in land is a cash drain, and because it costs money to purchase 
land, you also have a mortgage payment to make. Mortgage lenders charge 
higher interest rates on loans to purchase land because they see it as a more 
speculative investment. You don’t get depreciation tax write-offs because 
land isn’t depreciable. You also have property tax payments to meet, as 
well as other expenses. However, with land investments, you don’t receive 
income from the property to offset these expenses.
If you decide that you someday want to develop the property, that will also 
cost you a hefty chunk of money. Obtaining a loan for development is chal-
lenging and more expensive (because it’s riskier for the lender) than obtain-
ing a loan for a developed property.

233
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
Identifying many years in advance which communities will experience rapid 
population and job growth isn’t easy. Land in those areas that people believe 
will be the next hot spot already sells at a premium price. If property growth 
doesn’t meet expectations, appreciation will be low or non-existent.
 
If you decide to invest in land, be sure that you
 
✓ Can afford it: Tally up the annual carrying costs to see what your cash 
drain may be. What are the financial consequences of this cash outflow? 
For example, will you be able to fund your tax-advantaged retirement plans? 
If you can’t, count the lost tax benefits as another cost of owning land.
 
✓ Understand what further improvements the land needs: Running utility 
lines, building roads, landscaping, and so on all cost money. If you plan 
to develop and build on the land that you purchase, research what these 
things may cost. Make sure that you don’t make these estimates with 
your rose-tinted sunglasses on — improvements almost always cost 
more than you expect.
 
✓ Know its zoning status: The value of land depends heavily on what you 
can develop on it. Never purchase land without thoroughly understanding 
its zoning status and what you can and can’t build on it. Also research 
the disposition of the planning department and nearby communities. 
Areas that are anti-growth and anti-development are less likely to be good 
places for you to invest in land, especially if you need permission to do 
the type of project that you have in mind. Beware that zoning can change 
for the worse — sometimes a zoning alteration can reduce what you can 
develop on a property and, consequently, the property’s value.
 
✓ Become familiar with the local economic and housing situations: In the 
best of all worlds, you want to buy land in an area that is home to rap-
idly expanding companies and that has a shortage of housing and devel-
opable land. We discuss how to research these issues in the upcoming 
section “Deciding Where and What to Buy.”
Commercial real estate
Ever thought about owning and renting out a small office building or strip 
mall? If you’re really motivated and willing to roll up your sleeves, you may 
want to consider commercial real estate investments. Generally, you’re 
better off not investing in such real estate because it’s much more compli-
cated than investing in residential real estate. It’s also riskier from an invest-
ment and tenant-turnover perspective. When tenants move out, new tenants 
sometimes require extensive and costly improvements, which you’ll likely 
need to provide to compete with other building owners.

234
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
If you’re a knowledgeable real estate investor and you like a challenge, there 
are two good reasons to invest in commercial real estate:
 
✓ Your analysis of the local market suggests that it’s a good time to buy.
 
✓ You can use some of the space to run your own small business.
Just as owning your home is generally more cost-effective than renting over 
the years, so it is with commercial real estate if — and this is a big if — you 
buy at a reasonably good time and hold the property for many years.
 
So how do you evaluate the state of your local commercial real estate market? 
Examine the supply-and-demand statistics over recent years. How much space 
is available for rent, and how has that changed over time? What is the vacancy 
rate, and how has that changed in recent years? Also investigate the rental rates, 
usually quoted as a price per square foot. See the next section, “Deciding Where 
and What to Buy,” to find out how to gather this kind of information.
 
One way to tell that purchasing a commercial property in an area is a bad idea 
is if the supply of available space has increased faster than demand, leading to 
falling rental rates and higher vacancies. A slowing local economy and a 
higher unemployment rate also spell trouble for commercial real estate prices. 
Each market is different, so make sure you check out the details of your area. 
In the next section, we explain where you can find such information.
Deciding Where and What to Buy
If you’re going to invest in real estate, you can do tons of research to decide 
where and what to buy. Keep in mind, though, that as in other aspects of life, 
you can spend the rest of your life looking for the perfect real estate invest-
ment, never find it, never invest, and miss out on lots of opportunities, profit, 
and even fun. In the following sections, we explain what to look for in a com-
munity and area that you seek to invest in.
 
We’re not suggesting that you need to conduct a nationwide search for the 
best areas. In fact, investing in real estate closer to home is best because 
you’re probably more familiar with the local area and you should have an 
easier time researching and managing local property.
Considering economic issues
 
People need a place to live, but an area doesn’t generally attract homebuyers 
if no jobs exist. Ideally, look to invest in real estate in communities that main-
tain diverse job bases. If the local economy relies heavily on jobs in a small 
number of industries, that dependence increases the risk of your real estate 

235
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
investments. Statistics Canada tracks this data — you’ll find their number in 
the blue pages of your local telephone book, or visit www.statcan.gc.ca. A 
good local library should also have this data.
Also, consider which industries are more heavily represented in the local 
economy. If most of the jobs come from slow-growing or shrinking employ-
ment sectors, real estate prices are unlikely to rise quickly in the years 
ahead. On the other hand, areas with a greater preponderance of high-growth 
industries stand a greater chance of faster price appreciation.
Also, check out the unemployment situation and examine how the jobless 
rate has changed in recent years. Good signs to look for are declining 
unemployment and increasing job growth. Statistics Canada also tracks 
this information.
Evaluating the real estate market
The price of real estate, like the price of anything else, is driven by supply 
and demand. The smaller the supply and the greater the demand, the higher 
prices climb. Some real estate investors find out this fact the hard way. One 
such investor (John Reed, who also writes about real estate) lost all the money 
he had made in 15 years of apartment investing as a result of owning apartments 
in Texas when overbuilding occurred in the mid-1980s.
Ouch! Imagine investing for 15 years and then losing it all! Credit was loose in 
some areas during the 1980s, which led to a building boom. But in many parts 
of Texas, as in some other parts of North America, a ton of buildable land 
existed. This abundance of land and available credit inevitably led to over-
building. When the supply of anything expands at a much faster rate than 
demand, prices usually fall.
Upward pressure on real estate prices tends to be greatest in areas with little 
buildable land. This characteristic was one of the things that attracted Eric 
to real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area decades ago. If you look at a map 
of this area, you can see that the city of San Francisco and the communities 
to the south are on a peninsula. Ocean, bay inlets, and mountains bound the 
rest of the Bay Area. More than 80 percent of the land in the greater Bay Area 
isn’t available for development because state and federal government parks, 
preserves, and other areas protect the land from development or the land 
is impossible to develop. Of the land available for development, nearly all of 
it in San Francisco and the vast majority of it in nearby counties had been 
developed.
In the long term, the lack of buildable land in an area can be a problem. Real 
estate prices that are too high may cause employers and employees to relocate 
to less expensive areas. If you want to invest in real estate in an area with little 

236
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
buildable land and sky-high prices, run the numbers to see whether the deal 
makes economic sense. (We explain how to do this later in this chapter.)
 
In addition to buildable land, consider these other important real estate market 
indicators to get a sense of the health, or lack thereof, of a particular market:
 
✓ Building permits: The trend in the number of building permits tells you 
how the supply of real estate properties may soon change. A long and 
sustained rise in permits over several years can indicate that the supply 
of new property may dampen future price appreciation.
 
✓ Vacancy rates: If few rentals are vacant, that means more competition 
and demand for existing units, which bodes well for future real estate 
price appreciation. Conversely, high vacancy rates indicate an excess 
supply of real estate, which may put downward pressure on rental rates 
as many landlords compete to attract tenants.
 
✓ Listings of property for sale and number of sales: Just as the construc-
tion of many new buildings is bad for future real estate price apprecia-
tion, increasing numbers of property listings are also an indication of 
potential future trouble. As property prices reach high levels, some 
investors decide that they can make more money cashing in and invest-
ing elsewhere. When the market is flooded with listings, prospective 
buyers can be choosier, exerting downward pressure on prices. At high 
prices (relative to the cost of renting), more prospective buyers elect to 
rent, and the number of sales relative to listings drops.
 
 A sign of a healthy real estate market is a decreasing and relatively low 
level of property listings, indicating that the demand from buyers meets 
or exceeds the supply of property for sale from sellers. When the cost of 
buying is relatively low compared with the cost of renting, more renters 
can afford and choose to purchase, thus increasing the number of sales.
 
✓ Rents: The trend in rental rates that renters are willing and able to pay 
over the years gives a good indication as to the demand for housing. 
When the demand for housing keeps up with the supply of housing and 
the local economy continues to grow, rents generally increase. This 
increase is a positive sign for continued real estate price appreciation. 
Beware of buying rental property subject to rent control — the property’s 
expenses may rise faster than you can raise the rents.
Examining property valuation 
and financial projections
How do you know what a property is really worth? Some say it’s worth what 
a ready, willing, and financially able buyer is willing to pay. But some buyers 

237
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
pay more than what a property is truly worth. And sometimes buyers who 
are patient, do their homework, and bargain hard are able to buy property 
for less than its fair market value.
 
Crunching some numbers to figure what revenue and expenses a rental property 
may bring is one of the most important exercises you can go through when you 
determine a property’s worth and decide whether you should buy it. In the 
sections that follow, we walk you through these important calculations.
Examining and estimating cash flow
Cash flow is the difference between the money that a property brings in and 
what goes out for its expenses. If you pay so much for a property that its 
expenses (including the mortgage payment and property taxes) consistently 
exceed its income, you have a money drain on your hands. Maybe you have 
the financial reserves to withstand the temporary drain for the first few 
years, but you need to know upfront what you’re getting yourself into.
 
One of the biggest mistakes that novice rental property investors make is in 
failing to realize all the costs associated with investment property. In the worst 
cases, some investors end up in personal bankruptcy from the drain of negative 
cash flow (expenses exceeding income). In other cases, we’ve seen negative cash 
flow hamper people’s ability to accomplish important financial goals.
The second biggest mistake rental property investors make is in believing 
the financial statements that sellers and their real estate agents prepare. 
Just as an employer views a resume, you should always view such financial 
statements as advertisements rather than sources of objective information. 
In some cases, sellers and agents lie. In most cases, these statements contain 
lots of projections and best-case scenarios.
 
For property that you’re considering purchasing, ask for a copy of the Canada 
Revenue Agency Form T776 (Statement of Real Estate Rentals) from the prop-
erty seller’s federal income tax return. When most people complete their tax 
returns, they try to minimize their revenue and maximize their expenses — 
the opposite of what they and their agents normally do on the statements they 
sometimes compile to hype the property sale. Confidentiality and privacy 
aren’t issues when you ask for Form T776 because you’re asking only for this 
one schedule and not the person’s entire income tax return. (If the seller owns 
more than one rental property for which financial data is compiled, he can 
simply black out this other information if he doesn’t want you to see it.)

238
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
You should prepare financial statements based on facts and a realistic 
assessment of a property (see Figures 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3). There’s a time and 
a place for unbridled optimism and positive thinking, such as when you’re 
lost in a major snowstorm. If you think pessimistically, you may not make it 
out alive! But deciding whether to buy a rental property is not a life-or-death 
situation. Take your time and do it with your eyes and ears open and with a 
healthy degree of skepticism.
 
The monthly rental property financial statement that you prepare in Figures 11-1 
through 11-3 is for the present. Over time, you hope and expect that your rental 
income will increase faster than the property’s expenses, thus increasing the 
cash flow. If you want, you can use this financial statement for future years’ pro-
jections as well.
Valuing property
Examining and estimating a property’s cash flow is an important first step 
to figuring a property’s value. But on its own, a building’s cash flow doesn’t 
provide enough information for you to intelligently decide whether to buy a 
particular real estate investment. Just because a property has a positive cash 
flow doesn’t mean that you should buy it. Real estate generally sells for less 
and may have better cash flow in areas that investors expect to earn lower 
rates of appreciation.
Refuting the wisdom of buying in the “best” areas
Some people, particularly those in the real 
estate business, say, “Buy real estate in 
the best school districts” or “Buy the least 
expensive home in the best neighbourhood.” 
Conventional wisdom is often wrong, and these 
examples prove that.
Remember that as a real estate investor, you 
hope to profit from someday selling your prop-
erties, many years in the future, for a much 
higher price than you purchased them. If you 
buy into the “best,” there may not be as much 
room for growth.
Take school districts, for example. Conventional 
wisdom says that you should look at the test 
scores of different districts and buy real estate 
in the best (that is, highest-scoring) districts. But 
odds are that real estate in those areas is prob-
ably already priced at a premium level. If things 
deteriorate, such an area may experience more 
decline than an area where property buyers 
haven’t bid prices up into the stratosphere.
The biggest appreciation often comes from 
those areas and properties that benefit the most 
from improvement. Identifying these in advance 
isn’t easy, but look for communities where the 
trend in recent years has been positive. Even 
some “average” areas perform better in terms 
of property value appreciation than today’s 
“best” areas.

239
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
In the stock market, you have more clues about a specific security’s worth. 
Most companies’ stocks trade on a daily basis, so you at least have a recent 
sales price to start with. Of course, just because a stock recently traded at 
$20 per share doesn’t mean that it’s worth $20 per share. Investors may be 
overly optimistic or pessimistic.
Just as you should evaluate a stock versus other comparable stocks, so too 
should you compare the asking price of a property with other comparable 
real estate. But what if all real estate is overvalued? Such a comparison 
doesn’t necessarily reveal the state of inflated prices. In addition to compar-
ing a real estate investment property to comparable properties, you need to 
also perform some local area evaluations of whether prices from a historic 
perspective appear too high, too low, or just right. To answer this last ques-
tion, see Chapter 10.

larger buildings sometimes have an on-site manager to show vacant

The tax law allows you to claim a yearly tax deduction
for depreciation, but remember that you can’t depreciate land. Break
down the purchase of your rental property between the building and
land. You can make this allocation based on the assessed value for
the land and the building or on a real estate appraisal. Residential
property is depreciated at 4 or 5 percent per year of the remaining 
undepreciated value, depending on the type of building and when it 
was purchased. (You’re generally limited to half that rate in the year 
you make your purchase.) For example, say you buy a residential 
rental property for $300,000 and $200,000 of that is allocated to the 
building, which can be depreciated at 4 percent. In the first year, you 
can take $4,000 as a depreciation tax deduction ($200,000 × ½ of 
0.02%). The next year you can claim 4 percent of the remaining 
undepreciated value of $196,000 or $7,840, as your depreciation 
expense.

:  Although depreciation is a deduction that helps you reduce your profit for tax
purposes, it doesn’t actually cost you money. Your cash flow from a rental property is the revenue minus
your out-of-pocket expenses.
 
Here are the pros and cons of the different approaches you can use to value 
property:
 
✓ Appraisers: The biggest advantage of hiring an appraiser is that she values 
property for a living. An appraisal also gives you some hard numbers to use 
for negotiating with a seller. Hire a full-time appraiser who has experience 
valuing the type of property that you’re considering. Ask for examples of 
a dozen similar properties in the area that she has appraised in the past 
three months.
 
 The drawback of appraisers is that they cost money. A small home may 
cost several hundred dollars to appraise, and a larger multiunit building 
may cost $1,000 or more. The danger is that you can spend money on an 
appraisal for a building that you don’t end up buying.
 
✓ Real estate agents: If you work with a good real estate agent (we discuss 
how to find one in Chapter 12), ask him to draw up a list of comparable 
properties and help you estimate the value of the property you’re 
considering buying. The advantage of having your agent help with this 
analysis is that you don’t pay extra for this service.

242
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
 
 The drawback of asking an agent what to pay for a property is that his 
commission depends on your buying a property and on the amount 
that you pay for that property. The more you’re willing to pay for a 
property, the more likely the deal flies, and the more the agent makes 
on commission.
 
✓ Do-it-yourself: If you’re comfortable with numbers and analysis, you can 
try to estimate the value of a property yourself. The hard part is identifying 
comparable properties. It’s usually impossible to find identical properties, 
so you need to find similar properties and then make adjustments to their 
selling price so you can do an apples-to-apples comparison.
Among the factors that should influence your analysis of comparable proper-
ties are the date the properties sold; the quality of their locations; lot size; 
building age and condition; the number of units; the number of rooms, bed-
rooms, and bathrooms; and whether they have garages, fireplaces, and yards. 
A real estate agent can provide this information, or you can track it down for 
properties that you’ve seen or that you know have recently sold.
For example, if a similar property sold six months ago for $250,000 but prices 
overall have decreased 3 percent in the last six months, subtract 3 percent 
from the sales price. Ultimately, you have to attach a value or price to each 
difference between comparable properties and the one that you’re consider-
ing buying. Through a series of adjustments, you can then compare the value 
of your target property to others that have recently sold.
 
These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you probably want to at least 
review the numbers and analysis that an appraiser or real estate agent puts 
together.
Finding the information you need
When you evaluate properties, you need to put on your detective hat. If 
you’re creative and inquisitive, you soon realize that this isn’t a hard game 
to play. You can collect useful information about a property and the area in 
which it’s located in many ways.
 
The first place to begin your inquiries is with the real estate agent who listed 
the property for sale. One thing that most agents love to do is talk and 
schmooze. Try to understand why the seller is selling. This knowledge helps 
you negotiate an offer that’s appealing to the seller.
As for specifics on the property’s financial situation, as we explain in the ear-
lier section “Examining and estimating cash flow,” ask the sellers for specific 
independent documents, including Form T776 from their tax return. Hire 

243
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
inspectors to investigate the property’s physical condition (we advise you on 
hiring inspectors in Chapter 12).
Local government organizations can be treasure troves of information
about their communities. You can also see the other recommended sources 
in Chapter 10, as well as some other sources that we suggest earlier in this 
chapter.
Digging for a Good Deal
Everyone likes to get a deal or feel like they bought something at a relatively 
low price. How else can you explain the North American retail practice of 
sales? merchandise is first overpriced, and what doesn’t sell quickly enough 
is then marked down to create the illusion that you’re getting a bargain! Some 
real estate sellers and agents do the same thing. They list property for sale 
at an inflated price and then mark it down after they realize that no one will 
pay their asking price. “$30,000 price reduction!” the new listing screams. Of 
course, this reduction isn’t a deal.
Purchasing a piece of real estate at a discount is possible. Without doing a 
lick of work, you can make money simply by purchasing a property at a dis-
count — one of the ultimate thrills of capitalism!
Scores of books claim to have the real estate investment strategy that can 
beat the system. Often these promoters claim that you can become a multi-
millionaire through investing in distressed properties. A common strategy is 
to purchase property that a seller has defaulted on or is about to default on. 
Or how about buying a property in someone’s estate through probate court? 
Maybe you’d like to try your hand at investing in a property that has been 
condemned or has toxic-waste contamination!
 
It’s possible to get a good buy and purchase a problem property at a discount 
larger than the cost of fixing the property. However, these opportunities are 
hard to find, and sellers of such properties are often unwilling to sell at a dis-
count that’s big enough to leave you much room for profit. If you don’t know 
how to thoroughly and correctly evaluate the property’s problems, you can 
end up overpaying.
In some cases, the strategies these real estate gurus advocate involve taking 
advantage of people’s lack of knowledge. If you can find a seller in dire financial 
straits and desperate for cash, you may get a bargain buy on the home. (You 
may struggle with the moral issues of buying property cheaply this way.)

Other methods of finding discounted property take lots of time and digging. 
Some involve cold-calling property owners to see whether they’re interested 
in selling. This method is a little bit like trying to fill a job opening by inter-
viewing people you run into on a street corner. Although you may eventually 
find a good candidate this way, if you factor in the value of your time, the 
deal seems like less of a bargain.
 
Without making things complicated or too risky, you can use some of the 
following time-tested and proven ways to buy real estate at a discount to 
its fair market value:
 
✓ Find a motivated seller: Be patient and look at lots of properties, and 
sooner or later you’ll come across one that someone needs to sell (and 
these aren’t necessarily the ones advertised as having a motivated 
seller). Perhaps the seller has bought another property and needs the 
money to close on the recent purchase. Having access to sufficient 
financing can help secure such deals.
 
✓ Buy unwanted properties with fixable flaws: The easiest problems 
to correct are cosmetic. Some sellers and their agents are lazy and 
don’t even bother to clean a property. One single-family home that Eric 
bought had probably three years’ worth of cobwebs and dust accumu-
lated. It seemed like a dungeon at night because half the light bulbs were 
burned out.
 
 Painting; tearing up old, ugly carpeting; refinishing hardwood floors; and 
putting new plantings in a yard are relatively easy jobs. They make 
the property worth more and make renters willing to pay higher rent. 
Of course, these tasks take money and time, and many buyers aren’t 
interested in dealing with problems. If you have an eye for improving 
property and are willing to invest the time that coordinating the fix-up work 
requires, go for it! Just make sure that you hire someone to conduct a thor-
ough property inspection before you buy. (See Chapter 12 for more details.)
 
 Be sure to factor in the loss of rental income if you can’t rent a portion 
of the property during the fix-up period. Some investors have gone belly 
up from the double cash drain of fix-up expenses and lost rents.
 
✓ Buy when the real estate market is depressed: When the economy takes 
a few knocks and investors rush for the exits (like the downturn in the late 
2000s), it’s time to go shopping! Buy real estate when prices and investor 
interest are down. During times of depressed markets, obtaining proper-
ties that produce a positive cash flow (even in the early years) is easier. 
In Chapter 10, we explain how to spot a depressed market.
 
✓ Check for zoning opportunities: Sometimes, you can make more produc-
tive use of a property. For example, you can legally convert some multiunit 
apartment buildings into condominiums. Some single-family residences 
may include a rental unit if local zoning allows for it. A good real estate 
agent, contractor, and the local planning office in the town or city where 

245
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
you’re looking at the property can help you identify properties that you 
can convert. If you’re not a proponent of development, then you probably 
won’t like this strategy.
 
If you buy good real estate and hold it for the long term, you can earn a 
healthy return from your investment. Over the long haul, having bought a 
property at a discount becomes an insignificant issue. You make money from 
your real estate investments as the market appreciates and as a result of your 
ability to manage your property well. So don’t obsess over buying property at 
a discount, and don’t wait for the perfect deal, because it won’t come along.
Recognizing Inferior Real Estate 
“Investments”
Some supposedly “simple” ways to invest in real estate rarely make sense 
because they’re near-certain money losers. In this section, we discuss real 
estate investments that you should generally (but not always) avoid.
Second/vacation homes
Some folks dream of having a weekend cottage 
or condo — a place you can retreat to when 
crowded urban or suburban living conditions 
get on your nerves. When it’s not in use, you 
may rent out your vacation home and earn 
some income to help defray part of the mainte-
nance expenses.
If you can realistically afford the additional 
costs of a second, or vacation, home, we’re not 
going to tell you how to spend your extra cash. 
Investment real estate is property that you rent 
out 90 percent or more of the time. Most second-
home owners we know rent their property out 
very little — 10 percent or less of the time. As a 
result, second homes are usually money drains. 
Even if you do rent your second home most of 
the time, high tenant turnover decreases your 
net rental income.
Now, we have seen some people make a 
decent return with second homes that were 
infrequently rented. Usually, these homes are 
held over many years and located in areas that 
have become increasingly popular.
Part of the allure of a second home is the sup-
posed tax benefits. Even when you qualify for 
some or all of them, tax benefits only partially 
reduce the cost of owning a property. We’ve 
seen more than a few cases in which the 
second home is such a cash drain that it pre-
vents its owners from making tax-deductible 
contributions to retirement savings plans.
If you don’t rent out a second home property most 
of the time, ask yourself whether you can afford 
such a luxury. Can you accomplish your other 
financial goals — saving for retirement, paying 
for the home in which you live, and so on — with 
this added expense? Keeping a second home 
is more of a consumption than an investment 
decision.

246
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate  
Time-shares
 
Time-shares are near-certain money losers. With a time-share, you buy a 
week or two of ownership or usage of a particular unit, usually a condomin-
ium, in a resort location. If you pay $8,000 for a week of “ownership,” you pay 
the equivalent of more than $400,000 a year for the whole unit ($8,000/week × 
52 weeks). However, a comparable unit nearby may sell for only $150,000. 
The extra markup pays the salespeople’s commissions, administrative 
expenses, and profits for the time-share development company. (This little 
analysis also ignores the not-so-inconsequential ongoing time-share mainte-
nance fees, which can easily run $200 per year or more.) People usually get 
hoodwinked into buying a time-share when they’re enjoying a vacation some-
place. Vacationers are easy prey for salespeople who, often using high-
pressure sales tactics, want to sell them a souvenir of the trip. The cheese 
in the mousetrap is an offer of something free (for example, a free night’s 
stay in a unit) for going through the sales presentation. As one regretful 
buyer told Tony, “I went in for a free pina colada and came out with a condo!”
 
If you can’t live without a time-share, consider buying a used one. Many previ-
ous buyers, who almost always have lost much of their original investment, 
try to dump their time-shares. This fact tells you something about time-shares. 
You may be able to buy a time-share from an existing owner at a fair price, but 
why commit yourself to taking a vacation in the same location and building at 
the same time each year? Many time-shares let you trade your weeks; how-
ever, doing so is usually a hassle, and you’re limited by what time slots you 
can trade for, which are typically dates that other people don’t want.
Limited partnerships
In Chapter 2, we give you good reasons to avoid limited partnerships. High 
sales commissions and ongoing management fees burden limited partner-
ships sold through investment dealers and financial planners who work on 
commission. Quality real estate investment trusts (REITs), which we discuss 
earlier in this chapter, are infinitely better alternatives. REITs, unlike limited 
partnerships, are also completely liquid.
Scams
 
Wanting to make a lot of money in a hurry is very North American. Real estate 
investors with lofty expectations for high returns become bait for various 
hucksters who promise these investors great riches. It’s bad enough when the 
deck is stacked against you. Even worse is to put your money into scams.

247
 Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate 
First Pension, for example, was a U.S. outfit, run by loan broker William 
Cooper, that bilked investors out of more than $100 million. First Pension 
was sold as a limited partnership that invested in mortgages. Using a Ponzi-
type (pyramid) scheme, Cooper used the money from new investors to pay 
dividends to earlier investors. Time-shares, a truly terrible investment that 
we discuss earlier in this chapter, have also been subject to bankruptcy and 
fraud problems.
Hundreds of thousands of viewers fall prey annually to infomercial hucksters. 
Among the more infamous real estate infomercial promoters is Tom Vu. At 
his seminars, according to The Los Angeles Times, he says, “Well, if you make 
no money with me, you a loser.” Vu, who came to the United States from 
Vietnam in the mid-1970s, claims to have made a fortune investing in real 
estate by using a fairly simple system. He says that he searches for property 
owners who are in debt up to their eyeballs and offers to buy their properties 
with no money down. By finding desperate sellers, he says, you can buy real 
estate at a big discount from its fair market value.
Vu actually makes his money from running high-priced seminars to teach 
you basic real estate techniques that you can read in a book that costs about 
$20. Vu, however, charges up to $15,000 for a five-day seminar! As if overpay-
ing this much isn’t enough, Vu’s former “students,” who filed a number of 
lawsuits that included a class action suit, say that his methods don’t work 
and that he reneged on his promises to go into partnership on properties 
they identified. A number of states investigated Vu’s practices, have barred 
further Vu seminars in their states, and are seeking compensation for vic-
tims. Unfortunately, Vu appears to have moved much of his money overseas. 
Other real estate seminar hucksters such as Robert Allen and Ed Buckley saw 
their seminar enterprises end up in bankruptcy, sunk by the claims of their 
unhappy students.
Other scams also abound. Stephen Murphy was a real estate investor who 
claimed to make a fortune buying foreclosed commercial real estate and 
wrote and self-published a book to share his techniques with the public. 
Murphy’s organization contacted the people who bought his book and 
pitched them into collaborating with him on property purchases that sup-
posedly would return upwards of 100 percent or more per year. However, 
Murphy had other ideas, and he siphoned off nearly two-thirds of the money 
for himself and for promotion of his books! He even hoodwinked Donald 
Trump into writing praise for his book and work: “I really admire Steve 
Murphy. . . . Steve commands some very wise, intelligent . . . and unique pur-
chasing strategies.” No kidding!
 
If an investment “opportunity” sounds too good to be true, it is. If you want to 
invest in real estate, avoid the hucksters and invest directly in properties that 
you can control or invest through reputable REITs (or REIT mutual funds), 
which we discuss earlier in this chapter.

Real Estate Financing 
and Deal Making
In This Chapter
▶ Selecting the best real estate investment financing
▶ Locating a good real estate agent
▶ Negotiating and inspecting your deals
▶ Making smart selling decisions
I
n this chapter, we discuss issues such as understanding and selecting 
mortgages, working with real estate agents, negotiating, and other impor-
tant details that help you put a real estate deal together. We also provide 
some words of wisdom about taxes and selling your property that may come 
in handy down the road. (In Chapter 10, we cover what you need to know to 
purchase a home, and in Chapter 11, we review the fundamentals of investing 
in real estate.)
Financing Your Real Estate Investments
Unless you’re affluent or buying a low-cost property, you likely need to 
borrow some money, via a mortgage, to finance your property acquisition. 
Without financing, your dream to invest in real estate will remain just that — 
a dream. So first, you’ve got to maximize your chances of getting approved 
for a loan, which, unfortunately, got a lot tougher in the late 2000s because of 
the soft real estate market in many parts of the country. Shopping wisely for 
a good mortgage can save you thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of 
dollars in extra interest and fees. Don’t get saddled with a loan that you may 
not be able to afford someday and that could push you into foreclosure or 
bankruptcy.

250
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Getting your loan approved
Even if you have perfect or near-perfect credit, you may encounter financ-
ing problems with some properties. And of course, not all real estate buyers 
have a perfect credit history, tons of available cash, and no debt. With the 
soft real estate market of the late 2000s, lenders tightened credit standards 
to avoid making loans to people likely to default. If you’re one of those bor-
rowers who ends up jumping through more hoops than other borrowers do 
to get a loan, don’t give up hope. Few borrowers are perfect from a lender’s 
perspective, and many problems are fixable.
 
The best defence against loan rejection is avoiding it in the first place. To head 
off potential rejection before you apply for the loan, you can sometimes dis-
close to your lender anything that may cause a problem. For example, if you 
already know that your credit report indicates some late payments from when 
you were out of the country for several weeks five years ago, write a letter that 
explains this situation.
Solving down payment problems
Most people, especially when they make their first real estate purchase, are 
strapped for cash. In order to qualify for the most attractive financing, lenders 
typically require that your down payment be at least 20 percent of the prop-
erty’s purchase price. The best investment property loans sometimes require 
20 to 30 percent down for the best terms. In addition, you need reserve money 
to pay for other closing costs, such as title insurance and loan fees.
 
If you don’t have 20-plus percent of the purchase price available, don’t 
despair — you can still own real estate with the following strategies.
Checking out high-ratio mortgages
You may be able to put down as little as 5 percent of the purchase price and 
still get a mortgage. However, if you put down less than 20 percent of the 
value of the property, you’re required by law (under the National Housing 
Act) to purchase mortgage insurance for your loan.
The insurance protects your lender in the event that you can’t make your 
payments and you default on a high-ratio mortgage. The premium you’ll 
pay is calculated on the full value of your mortgage — not just the amount 
beyond 80 percent of the property’s value that you can borrow under a regu-
lar mortgage.
 
As a result of the subprime loan crisis, in 2008 the government brought in a 
rule requiring that any new insured mortgages must have an amortization — 
the number of years you take to pay back your home loan — of no more than 
35 years. The new rules, which came into effect in late 2008, also required 

251
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
those taking out a new insured mortgage to meet certain credit requirements. 
In addition, zero-money-down mortgages were banned, with a new require-
ment that to get a new mortgage, borrowers must have at least a 5 percent 
down payment.
Mortgage insurance is available from the federal government’s Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). You can also purchase mort-
gage insurance from Genworth Financial Capital, which evolved out of 
GE Mortgage Insurance Canada. A third choice is newcomer AIG United 
Guaranty.
The rate you’ll pay is determined by the size of your down payment 
compared with the value of the property. In the late 2000s, for example, 
insurers were charging about 1.75 percent if you were borrowing from 80 to 
85 percent of the purchase price. For updated rates, visit the CMHC Web 
site at cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en. Rates for Genworth can be found at www.
genworth.ca, and for AIG at www.aigug.ca.
You can choose either to pay the premium as a lump sum or to have it added 
to your mortgage amount. Adding it to your mortgage means you’ll pay the 
premium several times over due to the extra interest you’ll incur. Usually 
you’ll also have to pay an application fee that can be as high as a few hun-
dred dollars.
Considering the Home Buyers’ Plan
Under the federal government’s Home Buyers’ Plan, you can borrow up to 
$25,000 from your RRSP to buy (or build) a home. Your spouse can also 
borrow an additional $25,000 from his or her RRSP, meaning you can take out 
a combined maximum of $50,000 if you’re jointly purchasing a property.
The program is open to you only if you haven’t owned a home and lived in it 
for the last five years. You’re also ineligible if your spouse, and this includes 
those living in common-law, has owned a home in which you’ve lived over 
the same period.
Any money you borrow under the plan is treated as an interest-free loan 
you’re making to yourself. The money doesn’t have to be included in your 
income for that year, and you don’t have to pay any tax on the withdrawal.
 
You have to start repaying the money you borrowed in the second year after 
you borrowed it. You must repay the full amount over 15 years, and are 
required to repay at least 1/15 each year. If you miss a payment or part of a pay-
ment, that amount is included in your taxable income for that year, and you’ll 
have to pay tax on it at your full marginal tax rate (the rate you pay on the 
highest, or last, dollars of income in any year).

252
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
Although it seems like a good deal, the Home Buyers’ Plan has some signifi-
cant costs:
 
✓ If making RRSP contributions is already a challenge, you may find it 
tough to make your repayments.
 
✓ You don’t get a tax deduction for the repayments, because you’re simply 
replacing money the government let you borrow interest-free — and 
tax-free — from your plan. If the tax savings from your RRSP contribu-
tions are an important factor in your finances, you need to consider the 
impact on your cash flow of having to replace that money as well as 
having to come up with the money to repay your loan.
 
✓ The plan can do damage to the long-term growth of your RRSP. When 
you withdraw money, you lose all its potential tax-free compounding 
until it’s repaid to your plan. In addition, if you feel you’ll be able to get 
together only the required repayments, you will also lose out on the tax 
savings and compound growth of the new RRSP contributions you could 
have used that money for.
The younger you are, the more costly this lost growth becomes. While your 
home’s appreciation will likely offset the loss, it won’t boost your retirement 
income unless you sell your property and move to a less expensive home, or 
take out a reverse mortgage. (A reverse mortgage allows you to trade some or 
all of the equity in your home for a series of payments to yourself. The money 
you receive, along with interest charges, is eventually paid back using the 
proceeds from the sale of your home, usually after you and your spouse die.)
 
Before you tap your retirement savings, get hold of a financial planning calcu-
lator (these are included with most personal finance planning software, and 
are also available at many Web sites) and calculate how much using the Home 
Buyers’ Plan will decrease the future value of your RRSP. We address retire-
ment planning issues in more detail in Chapter 3.
Investigating other options
Borrowing from your RRSP or taking out a high-ratio home loan aren’t the 
only ways to deal with a lack of money for a down payment. Here are some 
other options to consider:
 
✓ Postpone your purchase: If you don’t want the cost and strain of extra 
fees and bad mortgage terms, you can also postpone your purchase. Go 
on a financial austerity program and boost your savings rate.
 
✓ Consider lower-priced properties: Smaller properties and ones that 
need some work can help keep down the purchase price and the 
required down payment.

253
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
 
✓ Find a partner: Make sure that you write up a legal contract to specify 
what happens if a partner wants out. Family members sometimes make 
good partners. Your parents, grandparents, and maybe even your sib-
lings may have some extra cash they’d like to lend, invest, or even give 
to you as a gift!
 
✓ Look into seller financing: Some property owners or developers may 
finance your purchase with as little as 5 to 10 percent down. However, 
you can’t be as picky about such seller-financed properties because a 
limited supply is available and many that are available need work or 
haven’t yet sold for other reasons.
Improving your credit rating
Late payments, missed payments, or debts that you never bothered to pay 
can tarnish your credit rating and squelch a lender’s desire to offer you a 
mortgage. If you’re turned down for a loan because of your less-than-stellar 
credit history, request (at no charge to you) a copy of your credit report 
from the lender that turned down your loan.
But if you think that your credit history may be a problem, the first thing 
to do is get the facts. Thanks to consumer legislation, you have the right 
to obtain a credit report for free from both of the main credit bureaus in 
Canada. To get a copy of your credit rating, contact either of the following 
credit bureaus:
 
✓ Equifax: www.equifax.ca; 1-800-465-7166
 
✓ TransUnion: www.tuc.ca; 1-800-663-9980
In order to obtain your report you’ll need to provide the companies with 
signed photocopies of two pieces of ID, as well as your name, address, and 
social insurance number.
 
If you visit the Web sites of either credit bureau, you’ll find it all but impos-
sible to see that the companies will send you a free report in the mail. At both 
sites, it looks as if your only option is to pay a fee for an online report. In addi-
tion, both companies pitch a number of unnecessary credit services.
Explain any credit report problems to your lender. If the lender is unsym-
pathetic, try calling other lenders. Tell them your credit problems up front 
and see whether you can find a lender willing to offer you a loan. Mortgage 
brokers may also be able to help you shop for lenders in these cases. (We 
discuss working with mortgage brokers later in this chapter.)
Sometimes you may feel that you’re not in control when you apply for a loan. 
In reality, you can fix a number of credit problems yourself, and you reap 

254
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
great rewards (access to better loan terms, including lower interest rates) 
for doing so. And you can often explain those that you can’t fix. Remember 
that some lenders are more lenient and flexible than others. Just because 
one mortgage lender rejects your loan application doesn’t mean that all the 
others will as well.
 
If any erroneous information is listed on your credit report, get on the phone 
to the credit bureaus and start squawking. If specific creditors are the culprits, 
call them too. Keep notes from your conversations and make sure that you 
put your case in writing and have your comments added to your credit report. 
If the customer service representatives you talk with are no help, send a letter 
to the president of each company. Let the head honcho know that his or her 
organization caused you problems in obtaining credit. For more information 
on examining and disputing items on your credit report and managing credit 
in general, check out the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Web site at 
www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca.
Another common credit problem is having too much consumer debt when 
you apply for a mortgage. The more credit card, auto loan, and other con-
sumer debt you rack up, the less mortgage you qualify for. If you’re turned 
down for the mortgage, take it as a well-meaning nudge to get rid of this high-
cost debt. Hang on to the dream of buying real estate and use it as motivation 
to keep paying off your debts a priority.
To find out more about how credit scores work and techniques to improve 
yours, please see the latest edition of our book Personal Finance For Canadians 
For Dummies (Wiley).
Dealing with low appraisals
Even if you have sufficient income, a clean credit report, and an adequate 
down payment, the lender may turn down your loan if the appraisal of the 
property you want to buy comes in lower than the amount you agreed to pay 
for the property.
 
Assuming you still like the property, renegotiate a lower price with the seller 
by using the low appraisal to strengthen your case. With a low appraisal on 
a property that you already own and are refinancing, you obviously need to 
follow a different path. If you have the cash available, you can simply put more 
money down to get the loan balance to a level for which you qualify. If you 
don’t have the cash, you may need to try another lender or forgo the refinance 
until you save more money or until the property value rises. (We discuss refi-
nancing in more detail later in this chapter.)
In rare cases, lenders sometimes lowball (intentionally undervalue) an 
appraisal on refinances to sabotage a loan. A lender may do so, for example, 

255
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
if your current mortgage is under better terms (from their point of view). If 
you suspect that the lender is sabotaging your appraisal, ask for a copy of 
your appraisal, to which you are entitled. If you have comparable sale prices 
of homes from your area that support your case, go back to the lender and 
see what he or she has to say.
Handling insufficient income
If you’re self-employed or you’ve changed jobs, your current income may 
not resemble your past income or, more importantly, your income may not 
be what a mortgage lender likes to see in respect to the amount that you 
want to borrow. A simple (but often impossible) way around this problem 
is to make a larger down payment. For example, if you put down 30 percent 
or more, you may be able to get a stated-income or no-documentation loan. 
Another option is to get mortgage insurance, which is offered by the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), as well as private insurers such 
as Genworth Financial (www.genworth.ca) and AIG United Guaranty (www.
aigug.ca). Because of the real estate market downturn and the rise in fore-
closures in the late 2000s, fewer lenders are willing to make these sorts of 
loans, but they aren’t extinct just yet.
 
If you can’t make a large down payment, another option is to get a co-signer 
for the loan — your relatives may be willing. As long as they aren’t over-
extended themselves, they may be able to help you qualify for a larger loan 
than you can get on your own. As with partnerships, put your agreement in 
writing so that no misunderstandings occur.
Understanding the differences between 
short-term and long-term mortgages
Most mortgage lenders offer you the option of taking out a home loan for any-
where from six months to five years. You can even take a mortgage for seven 
or even ten years, but these are less common.
 
The period of time you arrange to borrow money for your home is called the 
term. When your term is up, your loan agreement comes to an end, or matures. 
The term of your mortgage is completely separate from the amortization you 
choose — the number of years over which you spread out the repayment of 
your principal and the interest charges. Most mortgages are amortized over 
25 years.
When your mortgage’s term is up, you have the choice of renewing with your 
existing lender or taking your mortgage elsewhere. Each time your mortgage 
matures, you’re also free to choose whatever term you wish for your new loan. 

256
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
You can stick with the same term, or choose a longer or shorter term. In gen-
eral, the shorter the term, the lower the interest rate you’ll pay. For instance, 
your lender might offer you an interest rate of 6 percent on a six-month term, 
6.75 percent on a three-year term, and 7.5 percent on a five-year term.
Choosing a longer term of four or five years means you don’t have to concern 
yourself about what happens to interest rates for a while, at least as they 
affect your home loan. Your payments are set and guaranteed for the entire 
period. That makes longer-range budgeting easier, as it removes uncertainty 
from that part of your required expenses, which for many people is a fre-
quent source of stress. The drawback is that, as we note earlier, you’ll pay a 
higher interest rate. Think of it as an insurance premium.
A short-term mortgage that lasts, say, only six months or one year puts you 
at the whim of interest rate fluctuations much more frequently. If rates trend 
upward, each time your mortgage renews you’ll be hit by higher payments. 
Conversely, if rates are falling, you’ll be able to enjoy lower payments much 
sooner than those who lock into longer terms.
Choosing between a short-term 
and long-term mortgage
 
Whether to go for a short- or long-term loan is an important decision in the 
real estate buying process. You need to weigh the pros and cons of each and 
decide what’s best for your situation before you go out to purchase real estate 
or refinance.
In the real world, most people ignore this sensible advice. The excitement of 
purchasing a home or other piece of real estate tends to cloud judgment. In 
our experience, few buyers look at their entire financial picture before they 
make a major real estate decision.
Unfortunately, too many people let their interest rate crystal ball dictate 
whether they should take a short- or long-term mortgage. For example, those 
who think interest rates can only go up find long-term mortgages attractive.
You can’t predict the future course of interest rates. Even the professional 
financial market soothsayers and investors can’t accurately predict where 
rates are heading. If you could foretell this information, you could make a for-
tune investing in bonds and interest-rate futures and options. So cast aside 
your crystal ball, consider the following statistics, and then ask yourself the 
vital question that follows to help you decide whether a short-term or long-
term mortgage will work best for you.

 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Assessing the cost
When many people are trying to decide between a short- and long-term mort-
gage, they focus on how much they can save over the next little while, and 
then factor in their sense of whether interest rates will rise in the future.
Much more important, though, is to get a sense of each option’s total cost 
over the full life of your loan. Several studies have assessed how homeown-
ers would have fared if they either continually renewed a short-term mort-
gage or stuck with five-year terms. Going back to 1980 when short-term 
mortgages were first made available, the studies found that 85 to over 90 
percent of the time, the least expensive choice was to continually roll over 
a short-term mortgage. One study found that for a $200,000 mortgage, the 
average cost of five-year terms versus a series of one-year terms was an extra 
$2,000 of interest a year.
Continually renewing a five-year term costs more because short-term rates 
are almost always lower than long-term rates. In order for a series of short-
term mortgages to cost more than a five-year term, interest rates over that 
time must rise enough so that the one-year rate increases beyond the five-
year rate, and stays there for a good percentage of that time.
Of course, that’s just the numbers side of your decision. You also need to 
consider how comfortable you are with the extra uncertainty that choosing 
short-term mortgages brings.
Determining how comfortable you are with taking risk
How much of a gamble can you take with the size of your monthly mortgage 
payment? For example, if your job and income are unstable and you need 
to borrow an amount that stretches your monthly budget, you can’t afford 
much risk. If you’re in this situation, you may want to stick with a long-term 
mortgage. You may also sleep better with a long-term mortgage if you’re 
buying your first home and have little savings to fall back on should interest 
rates rise in a year or two and hit you with much higher monthly payments.
 
If you’re in a position to take the financial risks associated with mortgage pay-
ments that may change every six months or year, you have a better chance of 
saving money with a shorter-term mortgage. Your interest rate starts lower 
and stays lower when the overall level of interest rates stays unchanged. Even 
if rates go up, there’s a good possibility they will come back down over the life 
of your loan. Sticking with your short-term mortgage for better and for worse 
will likely help you come out ahead in the long run.

258
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
A short-term mortgage makes more sense if you borrow less than you’re 
qualified for. Or perhaps you can save a sizable chunk — more than 10 
percent — of your monthly income. If your income significantly exceeds your 
spending patterns, you may feel less anxiety about fluctuating interest rates. 
If you do choose a short term, you may feel more financially secure if you 
have a hefty financial cushion (at least six months’ to as much as a year’s 
worth of expenses reserved) that you can access if rates go up.
 
Don’t take a short-term mortgage because the lower interest rate allows you 
to afford the property you want to buy (unless you’re absolutely certain your 
income will rise to meet possible future payment increases). Try setting your 
sights on a property you can afford to buy with a longer-term mortgage.
Understanding the differences between 
open and closed mortgages
Another decision you’ll have to make when setting up your mortgage is 
whether you want to be able to pay some or all of it off or to be able to refi-
nance. Although this is possible with most mortgages, you may have to pay 
so much in penalties that it’s not worthwhile if you have a closed mortgage. 
In contrast, there are typically no restrictions or penalties in paying off an 
open mortgage. Here are other key distinctions between these two types of 
mortgages:
 
✓ Closed mortgage: With this mortgage type, you agree to the specific 
conditions and interest rate on your loan for the entire term of your 
loan. If interest rates drop significantly in the meantime, you may be 
prevented from refinancing — ending your agreement and working out 
a new loan. If you’re permitted to refinance, you’ll likely have to pay 
a financial penalty that compensates the lender for the extra interest 
given up by allowing you to renegotiate your agreement. In most cases, 
this penalty will eliminate any gain from negotiating a new mortgage at 
the prevailing lower interest rates.
 
✓ Open mortgage: This mortgage type gives you the right to pay off some 
or all of the loan whenever you wish without incurring any penalties. 
This can be useful if interest rates are falling rapidly and you want to 
take advantage of them. An open mortgage is also a good idea if you 
know you’ll be coming into a significant sum that will allow you to pay 
off your mortgage, or if you’ll be selling your home in the near future. 
Because of this extra flexibility, open mortgages have higher interest 
rates than closed mortgages.

259
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Choosing an open, closed, 
or convertible mortgage
 
If you know you’ll be paying off your mortgage or selling your property in the 
near future, an open mortgage makes sense because of the flexibility to end 
your loan whenever you want without penalty.
In most other cases, paying higher interest rates for an open mortgage usu-
ally doesn’t put you ahead. If you’re going to be coming into a large sum of 
money, you could simply choose a short term and pay down your principal 
when the term is up. Even if you choose a longer term, most lenders allow 
you to pay off a reasonable chunk of your loan — typically 10 percent — once 
a year. If you’re considering an open mortgage because interest rates appear 
to be heading steadily downward, you can simply select a short term — say 
six months or a year — so that you can soon renew at (hopefully) a lower 
interest rate and with lower monthly payments.
 
If you’re like most people, you want to pay as little as you can but also want 
some protection against a sudden and large jump in rates. In that case, a good 
choice is a convertible mortgage. Convertible mortgages vary slightly from 
lender to lender, but the basic concept is the same. You agree to a short-
term closed mortgage — either six months or one year, usually at or close to 
the same interest rate as a closed mortgage for the same term. However, at 
any point during the term, you can convert your loan to a different term. For 
instance, if you choose a six-month term and rates start rising rapidly, you can 
simply lock in a five-year rate at the prevailing level to protect yourself against 
rates being much higher by the time your existing term ends.
The attraction of a convertible mortgage is that it allows you to avoid paying 
the premium for longer-term fixed rates. At the same time, you’re protected 
against rapidly rising rates because you can lock in for a longer term at 
any time, instead of either having to wait until your current term expires or 
paying a hefty penalty to refinance early. If rates are the same or lower when 
your current mortgage matures, you can just sign up for another six-month 
or one-year convertible mortgage.
 
Check the fine print. For instance, if you choose to convert to a different term, 
your lender may restrict you to a five-year term. The major drawback to a 
convertible mortgage is that if you do decide to convert while the mortgage 
is in existence, you can’t change lenders, which eliminates much of your abil-
ity to bargain for a better rate. Unless you work out a rate discount ahead of 
time, when you convert you’ll have to pay the going or posted rate for the new 
term you select. This means your rate will likely be anywhere from a quarter to 
three-quarters or more of a percent higher than you could otherwise negotiate.

Understanding other mortgage fees
 
In addition to the ongoing interest rate, lenders tack on all sorts of other 
upfront charges in processing your loan. Get an itemization of these other 
fees and charges in writing from all lenders that you’re seriously considering 
(we explain how to find the best lenders for your needs in the next section). 
You need to know the total of all lender fees so you can accurately compare 
different lenders’ loans and determine how much closing on your loan will 
cost you. Other mortgage fees can pile up in a hurry. Here are the common 
ones you may see:
 
✓ Application and processing fees: Most lenders charge a few hundred dol-
lars to work with you to complete your paperwork and funnel it through 
their loan evaluation process. Should your loan be rejected, or if it’s 
approved and you decide not to take it, the lender needs to cover its 
costs. Some lenders return this fee to you upon closing with their loan.
 
✓ Credit report charge: Most lenders charge you for the cost of obtaining 
your credit report, which tells the lender whether you’ve repaid other 
loans on time. Your credit report should cost about $50.
 
✓ Appraisal fee: The property for which you borrow money needs to be 
valued. If you default on your mortgage, a lender doesn’t want to get 
stuck with a property that’s worth less than you owe. The cost for an 
appraisal typically ranges from several hundred dollars for most resi-
dential properties to as much as $1,000 or more for larger investment 
properties.
 
To minimize your chances of throwing money away on a loan that you may 
not qualify for, ask the lender whether there is any reason your loan request 
may be denied. Be sure to disclose any problems on your credit report or any 
problems with the property that you’re aware of. Lenders may not take the 
time to ask about these sorts of things in their haste to get you to complete 
their loan applications.
Finding the best lenders
You can easily save thousands of dollars in interest charges and other fees if 
you shop around for a mortgage deal. It doesn’t matter whether you do so on 
your own or hire someone to help you, but you should shop because much 
money is at stake!
Shopping yourself
Many mortgage lenders compete for your business. Although having a large 
number of lenders to choose from is good for keeping interest rates lower, it 
also makes shopping a chore.

261
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
Real estate agents can refer you to lenders with whom they’ve done business. 
Those lenders don’t necessarily offer the most competitive rates — the agent 
simply may have done business with them in the past or received client refer-
rals from them.
 
Look in the real estate section of a large, local weekend newspaper for charts 
of selected area lender interest rates. Just as with Internet sites that advertise 
lender rates, these tables are by no means comprehensive or reflective of the 
best rates available. In fact, many of these rates are sent to newspapers for 
free by firms that distribute mortgage information to mortgage brokers. Use 
them as a starting point and call the lenders that list the best rates.
Shopping through a mortgage broker
A competent mortgage broker can be a big help in getting you a good loan 
and closing the deal, especially if you’re too busy or disinterested to dig for a 
good deal on a mortgage. A good mortgage broker also keeps abreast of the 
many different mortgages in the marketplace. He or she can shop among lots 
of lenders to get you the best deal available. The following list presents some 
additional advantages to working with a mortgage broker:
 
✓ An organized and detail-oriented mortgage broker can help you through 
the process of completing all those tedious documents that lenders 
require.
 
✓ Mortgage brokers can help polish your loan package so the information 
you present is favourable yet truthful.
 
✓ The best brokers can also help educate you about various loan options 
and the pros and cons of available features.
 
Be careful when you choose a mortgage broker, because some brokers are 
lazy and don’t shop the market for the best current rates. Even worse, some 
brokers may direct their business to specific lenders so they can take a bigger 
cut or commission.
A mortgage broker typically gets paid a percentage, usually 0.5 to 1 percent, 
of the loan amount. This commission is completely negotiable, especially on 
larger loans that are more lucrative.
 
You need to ask what the commission is on loans that a broker pitches. Some 
brokers may be indignant that you ask — that’s their problem. You have every 
right to ask — it’s your money.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be 
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what bro-
kers say they can get for you. Again, be careful. Some brokers tell you what 
you want to hear — that is, that they can beat your best find — and then 
can’t deliver when the time comes.

262
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
If your loan broker quotes you a really good deal, make sure that you ask 
who the lender is. (Most brokers refuse to reveal this information until you 
pay the necessary fee to cover the appraisal and credit report.) You can 
check with the actual lender to verify the interest rate that the broker quotes 
you and make sure that you’re eligible for the loan.
Working with Real Estate Agents
When you purchase real estate, if you’re like most people, you enlist the 
services of a real estate agent. A good agent can help screen property so you 
don’t spend all of your free time looking at potential properties, negotiating a 
deal, helping coordinate inspections, and managing other preclosing items.
Recognizing agent conflicts of interest
All real estate agents, good, mediocre, and awful, are subject to a conflict 
of interest because of the way they’re compensated — on commission. 
We must say that we respect real estate agents for calling themselves what 
they are. Real estate agents don’t hide behind an obscure job title, such as 
When to consider a home equity loan
Home equity loans, also known as second mort-
gages, allow you to borrow against the equity in 
your home in addition to the mortgage that you 
already have (a first mortgage).
A home equity loan may benefit you if you need 
more money for just a few years or if your first 
mortgage is at such a low interest rate that refi-
nancing it to get more cash would be too costly. 
Otherwise, we advise you to avoid home equity 
loans.
If you need a larger mortgage, why not refi-
nance the first one and wrap it all together? 
Home equity loans often have higher inter-
est rates than comparable first mortgages. 
That’s because they’re riskier from a lender’s 
perspective because the first mortgage lender 
gets first claim against your property if you file 
bankruptcy or you default on the mortgage.
One attraction of a home equity loan is that 
when you use your home as the security for 
a line of credit, the interest rate is usually the 
lowest available for consumer loans. You can 
borrow only the amount you need at the time 
you need it, and you can repay any or all of your 
borrowings at any time. These features mean 
you pay interest only on money you actually 
need, and you can cut your interest charges as 
soon as you have money available to pay down 
your loan.

263
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
“shelter consultant.” (Many financial “planners,” “advisers,” or “consultants,” 
for example, actually work on commission and sell investments and life insur-
ance and, therefore, are really stockbrokers and insurance brokers, not plan-
ners or advisers.)
Real estate agents aren’t in the business of providing objective financial 
counsel. Just as car dealers make their living selling cars, real estate agents 
make their living bringing together real estate buyers and sellers. Never 
forget this fact as a buyer.
 
The pursuit of a larger commission may encourage an agent to get you to do 
things that aren’t in your best interests, such as the following:
 
✓ Buy, and buy sooner rather than later: If you don’t buy, your agent 
doesn’t get paid for all the hours she spends working with you. The 
worst agents fib and use tricks to motivate you to buy. They may say 
that other offers are coming in on a property that interests you, or they 
may show you a bunch of dumps and then one good listing to motivate 
you to buy the one good listing.
 
✓ Spend more than you should: Because real estate agents get a percent-
age of the sales price of a property, they have a built-in incentive to 
encourage you to spend more on a property than what fits comfortably 
with your other financial objectives and goals. An agent doesn’t have to 
consider or care about your other financial needs.
 
✓ Purchase their company’s listings: Agents also may have a built-in 
incentive (higher commission) to sell their own listings.
 
✓ Buy in their territory: Real estate agents typically work a specific ter-
ritory. As a result, they usually can’t objectively tell you the pros and 
cons of the surrounding regions.
 
✓ Use people who scratch their backs: Some agents refer you to brokers, 
lenders, inspectors, and title insurance companies that have referred 
customers to them. Some agents also solicit and receive referral fees (or 
bribes) from mortgage lenders, inspectors, and contractors to whom 
they refer business.
Finding a good agent
A mediocre, incompetent, or greedy agent can be a real danger to your 
finances. Whether you’re hiring an agent to work with you as a buyer or 
seller, you want someone who is competent and with whom you can get 
along. Working with an agent costs a good deal of money, so make sure you 
get your money’s worth.

264
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
 
Interview several agents and check references. Ask agents for the names and 
phone numbers of at least three clients with whom they’ve worked in the past 
six months in the geographical area in which you’re looking. By narrowing the 
period during which they worked with references to six months, you maximize 
the chances of speaking with clients other than the agent’s all-time-favourite 
clients.
As you speak with an agent’s references, look for these traits in any agent 
that you’re considering working with, whether as a buyer or seller:
 
✓ Full-time employment: Some agents work in real estate as a second or 
even third job. Information in this field changes constantly — keeping 
track of it is hard enough on a full-time basis. It’s hard to imagine a 
good agent being able to stay on top of the market while moonlighting 
elsewhere.
 
✓ Experience: Hiring someone with experience doesn’t necessarily mean 
looking for an agent who’s been an agent for decades. Many of the best 
agents come into the field from other occupations, such as business and 
teaching. Agents can acquire some sales, marketing, negotiation, and 
communication skills in other fields, but experience in real estate does 
count.
 
✓ Honesty and integrity: You need to trust your agent with a lot of infor-
mation. If the agent doesn’t level with you about what a neighbourhood 
or particular property is really like, you suffer the consequences.
 
✓ Interpersonal skills: An agent must get along not only with you but also 
with a whole host of other people who are involved in a typical real 
estate deal: other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage lenders, 
and so on. An agent needs to know how to put your interests first with-
out upsetting others.
 
✓ Negotiation skills: Putting a real estate deal together involves negotia-
tion. Is your agent going to exhaust all avenues to get you the best deal 
possible? Most people don’t like the sometimes aggravating process of 
negotiation, so they hire someone else to do it for them. Be sure to ask 
the agent’s former client references how the agent negotiated for them.
 
✓ High quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical 
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend an inspec-
tion, for example, you may get stuck with undiscovered problems after 
the deal is done.
Agents who pitch themselves as buyers’ brokers claim that they work for 
your interests. Agents who represent you as a buyer’s broker still get paid 
only when you buy. And agents still get paid a commission that’s a percent-
age of the purchase price, so they still have an incentive to sell you a piece of 
real estate that’s more expensive because their commission increases.

265
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
 
Some agents market themselves as top producers, which means that they sell 
a relatively larger volume of real estate. This title doesn’t count for much for 
you, the buyer. In fact, you may use this information as a potential red flag for 
an agent who focuses on completing as many deals as possible. Such an agent 
may not be able to give you the time and help that you need to get the house 
you want.
When you buy a home, you need an agent who is patient and who allows 
you the necessary time to educate yourself and helps you make the decision 
that’s best for you. The last thing you need or want is an agent who tries to 
push you into making a deal.
You also need an agent who is knowledgeable about the local market and 
community. If you want to buy a home in an area where you don’t currently 
live, an informed agent can have a big impact on your decision.
 
Finding an agent with financing knowledge is a plus for buyers, especially first-
time buyers or those with credit problems. Such an agent may be able to refer 
you to lenders that can handle your type of situation, which can save you a lot 
of legwork.
Closing the Deal
After you locate a property that you want to buy, and you understand your 
financing options, the real fun begins. Now you have to put the deal together. 
The following sections discuss key things to keep in mind.
Buying without a real estate agent
You can purchase property without an agent 
if you’re willing to do some additional legwork. 
You need to do the things that a good real estate 
agent does, such as searching for properties, 
scheduling appointments to see them, deter-
mining fair market value, negotiating the deal, 
and coordinating inspections.
If you don’t work with an agent, have a lawyer 
review the various contracts, unless you’re a 
legal expert. Having someone else not vested 
in the transaction look out for your interests 
helps your situation. Real estate agents gener-
ally aren’t legal experts, so getting legal advice 
from a lawyer is generally better. One possible 
drawback to working without an agent is per-
forming the negotiations yourself. Negotiating 
can be problematic if you lack these skills or get 
too caught up emotionally in the situation.

266
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Negotiating 101
When you work with an agent, the agent usually carries the burden of the 
negotiation process. But even if you delegate responsibility for negotiating 
to your agent, you still should have a strategy in mind. Otherwise, you may 
overpay for real estate.
 
Find out about the property and the owner before you make your offer. How 
long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is the 
owner selling? The more you understand about the property you want to buy 
and the seller’s motivations, the better your ability is to draft an offer that 
meets everyone’s needs. Some listing agents love to talk and will tell you the 
life history of the seller. Either you or your agent may be able to get them to 
reveal helpful information about the seller.
 
Also, bring facts to the bargaining table. Get comparable sales data to support 
your price. Too often, homebuyers and their agents pick a number out of the 
air when they make an offer. If you were the seller, would you be persuaded 
to lower your asking price? Pointing to recent and comparable home sales to 
justify your offer price strengthens your case.
Remember that price is only one of several negotiable items. Sometimes sell-
ers fixate on selling their homes for a certain amount. Perhaps they want to 
get at least what they paid for it themselves several years ago. You may get a 
seller to pay for certain repairs or improvements or to offer you an attractive 
loan without all the extra fees that a bank charges. Also, be aware that the 
time for closing on the purchase is a bargaining point. Some sellers may need 
cash soon and may concede other terms if you can close quickly. Likewise, 
the real estate agent’s commission is negotiable.
Finally, try to leave your emotions out of any property purchase. This is 
easier said than done and hardest to do when you purchase a home in which 
you’ll live. Try, as best you can, not to fall in love with a property. Keep 
searching for other properties even when you make an offer because you 
may be negotiating with an unmotivated seller.
Inspecting the property
Unless you’ve built homes and other properties and performed contracting 
work yourself, you probably have no idea what you’re getting yourself into 
when it comes to furnaces and termites.

267
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
 
Spend the money and time to hire inspectors and other experts to evaluate 
the major systems and potential problem areas of the home. Because you 
can’t be certain of the seller’s commitment, we recommend that you do the 
inspections after you’ve successfully negotiated and signed a sales contract. 
Although you won’t have the feedback from the inspections to help with this 
round of negotiating, you can always go back to the seller with the new infor-
mation. Make your purchase offer contingent on a satisfactory inspection.
Hire people to help you inspect the following features of the property. (With 
multiunit rental property, be sure to read Chapter 11 for other specifics that 
you need to check out, such as parking.)
 
✓ Overall condition of the property (for example, is the paint peeling, are 
the floors level, are appliances present and working well, and so on?)
 
✓ Electrical, heating and air conditioning, and plumbing systems
 
✓ Foundation
 
✓ Roof
 
✓ Pest control, dry rot, and mould
 
✓ Seismic/slide/flood risk
Inspection fees often pay for themselves. If you uncover problems that 
you weren’t aware of when you negotiated the original purchase price, the 
inspection reports give you the information you need to go back and ask the 
property seller to fix the problems or reduce the property’s purchase price.
 
Never accept a seller’s inspection report as your only source of information. 
When a seller hires an inspector, he or she may hire someone who isn’t as dili-
gent and critical of the property. Review the seller’s inspection reports if avail-
able, but get your own as well. Also, beware of inspectors who are popular 
with real estate agents. They may be popular because they help agents close 
deals by not bothering to document all the property’s problems.
As with other professionals whose services you retain, interview a few differ-
ent inspection companies. Ask which systems they inspect and how detailed 
a report they can prepare for you. Consider asking the company that you’re 
thinking of hiring for customer references. Ask for names and phone numbers 
of three people who used the company’s services within the past six months. 
Also, request from each inspection company a sample of one of its reports.
 
The day before you close on the purchase, take a brief walk-through of the 
property to make sure that everything is still in the condition it was before 
and that all the fixtures, appliances, curtains, and other items the contract 
lists are still there. Sometimes, sellers ignore or don’t recall these things, and 
consequently, they don’t leave what they agreed to in the sales contract.

268
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Shopping for title insurance
Some mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone 
else claiming legal title to your property. This can happen, for example, when 
a husband and wife split up, and the one who remains in the home decides to 
sell and take off with the money. If the title lists both spouses as owners, the 
spouse who sells the property (possibly by forging the other’s signature) has 
no legal right to do so. The other spouse can come back and reclaim rights to 
the home even after it has been sold. In this event, both you and the lender 
can get stuck holding the bag. (If you’re in the enviable position of paying 
cash for a property, buying title insurance is still wise, even though a mort-
gage lender won’t prod you to do so. You need to protect your investment.)
 
Title insurance fees may vary from company to company. Don’t simply use 
the company that your real estate agent or mortgage lender suggests — shop 
around. When you call around for title insurance fee quotes, make sure that 
you understand all the fees. Many companies tack on all sorts of charges for 
things such as courier fees and express mail. If you find a company with lower 
prices and want to use it, consider asking for an itemization in writing so you 
don’t receive any unpleasant surprises.
An insurance company’s ability to pay claims is always important. Provincial 
and federal insurance departments monitor and regulate title insurance com-
panies. Title insurers rarely fail, and regulators generally do a good job shut-
ting down financially unstable ones. Check with your province’s department 
if you’re concerned. You can also ask the title insurer for copies of its ratings 
from insurance-rating agencies.
Selling Real Estate
 
You should buy and hold real estate for the long term. If you do your home-
work, buy in a good area, and work hard to find a fairly priced or underpriced 
property, why sell it quickly and incur all the selling costs, time, and hassle to 
locate and negotiate another property to purchase?
Some real estate investors like to buy properties in need of improvement, 
fix them up, and then sell them and move on to another. Unless you’re a 
contractor or experienced real estate investor and have a real eye for this 
type of work, don’t expect to make a windfall or even to earn back more 
than the cost of the improvements. The process of buying, fixing, and flip-
ping can be profitable, but it’s not as easy as the home-improvement tele-
vision shows and some books would have you believe. In fact, it’s more 
likely that you’ll erode your profit through the myriad costs of frequent 

269
 Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
buying and selling. The vast majority of your profits should come from the 
long-term appreciation of the overall real estate market in the communities 
that you own property in.
Use the reasons that you bought in an area as a guide if you think you want 
to sell. Use the criteria that we discuss in Chapter 11 as a guideline. For 
example, if the schools in the community are deteriorating and the planning 
department is allowing development that will hurt the value of your property 
and the rents you can charge, you may have cause to sell. Unless you see sig-
nificant problems like these in the future, holding good properties over many 
years is a great way to build your wealth and minimize transaction costs.
Negotiating real estate agents’ contracts
Most people use an agent to sell real estate. As we discuss in “Finding a good 
agent,” earlier in this chapter, selling and buying a home demand agents with 
different strengths. When you sell a property, you want an agent who can get 
the job done efficiently and for as high a sales price as possible.
 
As a seller, you should seek agents who have marketing and sales expertise 
and who are willing to put in the time and money necessary to sell your house. 
Don’t be impressed by an agent just because she works for a large company. 
What matters more is what the agent can do to market your property.
When you list a property for sale, the contract you sign with the listing agent 
includes specification of the commission you pay the agent if he succeeds in 
selling your property. In most areas of the country, agents usually ask for a 6 
percent commission for single-family homes. In an area that maintains lower-
cost housing, agents may ask for 7 percent. For small multifamily properties 
and commercial properties, commissions are often in the 3 to 5 percent range. 
(Rates are notably higher in Quebec, where the standard rate is 8 percent.)
 
Regardless of the commission an agent says is “typical,” “standard,” or “what 
my manager requires,” always remember that you can negotiate commissions. 
Because the commission is a percentage, you have much greater ability to get 
a lower commission on a higher-priced property. If an agent makes 6 percent 
selling both a $200,000 and a $100,000 property, the agent makes twice as 
much on the $200,000 property. Yet selling the higher-priced property doesn’t 
usually take twice as much work.
If you live in an area with higher-priced properties, you may be able to negoti-
ate a 5 percent commission. For expensive properties, a 4 percent commis-
sion is reasonable. You may find, however, that your ability to negotiate a 
lower commission is greatest when an offer is on the table. Because of the 
cooperation of agents who work together through the multiple listing service 

270
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
(MLS), if you list your real estate for sale at a lower commission than most 
other properties, some agents won’t show it to prospective buyers. For this 
reason, you’re better off having your listing agent cut his take instead of cut-
ting the commission that you pay to a real estate agent who brings a buyer 
for your property to you.
 
In terms of the length of the listing agreement, three months is reasonable. If 
you give an agent too long to list your property (6 to 12 months), the agent 
may simply toss your listing into the multiple listing database and not expend 
much effort to get your property sold. Practically speaking, you can fire your 
agent whenever you want, regardless of the length of the listing agreement, 
but a shorter listing may motivate your agent more.
Selling without a real estate agent
The reason for selling real estate without an agent is usually to save the com-
mission that an agent deducts from your property’s sale price. If you have 
the time, energy, and marketing experience, you can sell sans agent and pos-
sibly save some money.
 
The major problem with attempting to sell real estate on your own is that 
you can’t list it in the MLS, which, in most areas, only real estate agents can 
access. If your property isn’t listed in the MLS, many potential buyers never 
know that your home is for sale. Agents who work with buyers don’t generally 
look for or show their clients properties that are for sale by owner or listed 
with discount brokers.
Several companies have tried to find a middle ground, offering home sellers 
low commissions or flat fees, while giving them access to MLS. These include 
erealty.ca (www.erealty.ca), which operates in British Columbia, and two 
Ontario companies, Home@ease Realty Inc. (www.homeatease.ca) and 
Flatfee Realty Inc. (www.flatfeerealty.ca).
Besides saving you time, a good agent can help ensure that you’re not sued 
for failing to disclose known defects of your property. If you decide to sell on 
your own, have access to a legal adviser who can review the contracts. Take 
the time to educate yourself about the many facets of selling property for top 
dollar.

lthough the businesses may be small, the potential 
for earning profits and finding a fulfilling career 
isn’t. Here, we explain such things as how to develop a 
business plan, identify marketable products or services,

your own shop seems either too overwhelming or too 
uninspiring, you also find out how to buy an existing

M
any people dream about running their own companies, and for good 
reason. If you start your own business, you can pursue something 
that you’re passionate about, and you have more control over how you do 
things. Plus, successful business owners can reap major economic bounties.
 
But tales of entrepreneurs becoming multimillionaires focus attention on the 
financial rewards without revealing the business and personal challenges and 
costs associated with being in charge. Consider what your company has to do 
well to survive and succeed in the competitive business world:
 
✓ Develop products and services that customers will purchase
 
✓ Price your offerings properly and promote them
 
✓ Deal with the competition
 
✓ Manage the accounting
 
✓ Interpret lease contracts and evaluate office space
 
✓ Keep current with changes in your field
 
✓ Hire, train, and retain good employees
Business owners also face personal and emotional challenges, which rarely 
get airtime among all the glory of the rags-to-riches tales of multimillionaire 
entrepreneurs. Major health problems, divorces, fights, and lawsuits among 
family members who are in business together, the loss of friends, and even 
suicides have been attributed to the passions of business owners who are 
consumed with winning or who become overwhelmed by their failures.

Had enough already? We’re not trying to scare you, but we do want you to be 
realistic about starting your own business. Maybe you do have the right stuff 
to run your own company, but most people don’t.
Testing Your Entrepreneurial IQ
The keys to success and enjoyment as an entrepreneur vary as much as the 
businesses do. But if you can answer yes to most of the following questions, 
you probably have the qualities and perspective needed to succeed as a 
small-business owner.
 
Don’t be deterred by the questions that you can’t answer in the affirmative. A 
perfect entrepreneur doesn’t exist. Part of succeeding in business is knowing 
what you can’t do, as well as what you can do, and finding creative ways (or 
people) to help you.
 
1. Are you a self-starter? Do you like challenges? Are you persistent? Are 
you willing to do research to solve problems?
 
 Running your own business isn’t glamorous most of the time, espe-
cially in the early years. You have many details to mind and things to 
do. Success in business is the result of doing lots of little things well. If 
you’re accustomed to working for large organizations where much of the 
day is spent attending meetings and keeping up on office politics and 
gossip, with little accountability, you probably won’t enjoy or succeed at 
running your own business.
 
2. Do you value independence and self-control?
 
 Particularly in the early days of your business, you need to enjoy work-
ing on your own. When you leave a company environment and work on 
your own, you give up a lot of socializing. Of course, if you work in an 
unpleasant environment or with people you don’t really enjoy socializ-
ing with, venturing out on your own may be a plus.
 
 If you’re a people person, many businesses offer lots of contact. But you 
must recognize the difference between socializing with co-workers and 
networking with business contacts and customers.
 
3. Can you develop a commitment to an idea, product, or principle?
 
 Most entrepreneurs work about 50 hours per week, 50 or so weeks a 
year — that’s about 2,500 hours per year. If the product, service, or 
cause that you’re pursuing doesn’t excite you and you can’t motivate 
others to work hard for you, you’re going to have a long year!

275
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
 One of the worst reasons to start your own business is for the pursuit of 
great financial riches. Don’t get us wrong — if you’re good at what you 
do and you know how to market your services or products, you may 
make more money working for yourself. But for most people, money 
isn’t enough of a motivation, and many people make the same or less 
money on their own than they did working for a company.
 
4. Are you willing to make financial sacrifices and live a reduced life-
style before and during your early entrepreneurial years?
 
 “Live like a student, before and during the start-up of your small busi-
ness” was the advice that Eric’s best business school professor, James 
Collins, gave him before he started his business. With most businesses, 
you expend money during the start-up years and likely have a reduced 
income compared to the income you received while working for a com-
pany. You also have to buy your own benefits.
 
 To make your entrepreneurial dream a reality, you need to live within 
your means both before and after you start your business. But if running 
your own business really makes you happy, sacrificing expensive vaca-
tions, overpriced luxury cars, the latest designer clothing, and $4 lattes 
at the corner cafe shouldn’t be too painful.
 
5. Do you recognize that when you run your own business, you must still 
report to bosses?
 
 Besides the allure of huge profits, the other reason some people mistak-
enly go into business for themselves is that they’re tired of working for 
other people. Obnoxious, evil bosses can make anyone want to become 
an entrepreneur.
 
 When you run your own business, you may have customers and other 
bosses who are miserable to deal with. Fortunately, even the worst cus-
tomers usually can’t make your life anywhere near as miserable as the 
worst bosses. (If you have enough customers, you can simply decide not 
to do business with such misfits.)
 
6. Can you withstand rejection, naysayers, and negative feedback?
 
 “I thought every no that I got when trying to raise my funding brought 
me one step closer to a yes,” says Alex Popov, an entrepreneur. Unless 
you come from an entrepreneurial family, don’t expect your parents to 
endorse your “risky, crazy” behaviour. Even other entrepreneurs can 
ridicule your good ideas. Some people (especially parents) simply think 
that working for a giant company makes you safer and more secure 
(which, of course, is a myth, because corporations can lay you off in a 
snap). It’s also easier for them to say to their friends and neighbours 
that you’re a big manager at a well-known corporation (such as Cadillac 
Fairview, Nortel, or WorldCom) than to explain that you’re working on 
some kooky business idea out of a spare bedroom. (How secure do you 
think those former employees of Nortel and WorldCom feel now about 
having lost their jobs at their former large company?)

276
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
 
7. Are you able to identify your shortcomings and hire or align yourself 
with people and organizations that complement your skills and 
expertise?
 
 To be a successful entrepreneur, you need to be a bit of a jack-of-all-
trades: marketer, accountant, customer service representative, admin-
istrative assistant, and so on. Unless you get lots of investor capital, 
which is rare for a true start-up, you can’t afford to hire help in the early 
months, or perhaps even years, of your business.
 
 Partnering with others or buying certain services or products rather 
than trying to do everything yourself may make sense for you. And over 
time, if your business grows and succeeds, you should be able to afford 
to hire more help. If you can be honest with yourself and surround and 
partner yourself with people whose skills and expertise complement 
yours, you can build a winning team!
 
8. Do you deal well with ambiguity? Do you believe in yourself?
 
 When you’re on your own, determining when and if you’re on the right 
track is difficult. Some days, things don’t go well — and such days are 
much harder to take flying solo. Therefore, being confident, optimistic, 
and able to work around obstacles are necessary skills.
 
9. Do you understand why you started the business or organization and 
how you personally define “success”?
 
 Many business entrepreneurs define success by such measures as sales 
revenue, profits, number of branch offices and employees, and so on. 
These are fine measures, but other organizations, particularly non-
profits, have other measures. For example, the Sierra Club of Canada 
seeks to “develop a diverse, well-trained grassroots network working to 
protect the integrity of our global ecosystems.”
 
 To accomplish such goals as affecting public policy and public opinion 
about issues such as the environment and health, money is necessary, 
but such a cause-focused organization has a “bottom line” very different 
from a for-profit organization.
 
10. Can you accept lack of success in the early years of building your 
business?
 
 A few rare businesses are instant hits, but most businesses take time to 
build momentum — it may take years, perhaps even decades. Some suc-
cessful corporate people suffer from anxiety when they go out on their 
own and encounter the inevitable struggles and lack of tangible success 
as they build their companies.

277
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
Considering Alternative Routes
Sometimes, entrepreneurial advocates imply that running your own business 
or starting your own non-profit is the greatest thing in the world and that all 
people would be happy owning their own business if they just set their mind 
to it. The reality is that some people won’t be blissful as entrepreneurs. If 
Myths of being an entrepreneur
Many myths persist about what it takes to be an 
entrepreneur, partly because those who aren’t 
entrepreneurs tend to hang out with others who 
aren’t. The mass media’s popularization of “suc-
cessful” entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates, Donald 
Trump, and Oprah Winfrey leads to numerous 
misperceptions and misconceptions, including 
these often-cited nuggets:
 ✓ You have to be well-connected or know 
“important” people. We think that being a 
decent human being is far more important. 
Enough rude, inconsiderate, and self-cen-
tred people are in the business world (and, 
yes, some of them do succeed in spite of 
their character flaws), and if you’re not that 
way, you’ll be able to meet people who can 
help you in one way or another. But remem-
ber that looking in the mirror shows you 
your best and most trusted resource.
 ✓ You need to have an MBA or some 
other fancy degree. Many successful 
entrepreneurs — Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, 
for example — don’t even have university 
degrees, for goodness’ sake. Perusing 
Forbes magazine’s lists of the most finan-
cially successful small companies shows 
that about 15 percent of the CEOs didn’t 
earn a university degree and about half 
don’t have advanced degrees! These sta-
tistics are even more amazing when you 
consider that a relatively large number of 
entrepreneurs with humble backgrounds 
leave or are forced out of the successful 
enterprises they started.
 
 We’re not saying that a good education 
isn’t worthwhile in general and that it can’t 
help you succeed in your own business. But 
a formal education isn’t necessary.
 ✓ You need to be a genius. Intelligence is 
admittedly a difficult thing to measure, but 
the majority of entrepreneurs have IQs 
under 120, and a surprising percentage 
have IQs under the average of 100 — more 
entrepreneurs, in fact, have IQs under 100 
than have IQs greater than 130!
 ✓ You must be a gregarious, big-egoed extro-
vert. Although some studies show that more 
entrepreneurs are extroverted, many entre-
preneurs are not.
 ✓ You have to be willing to take a huge risk. 
Some people focus on the potential for fail-
ure. Consider the worst-case scenario — 
if your venture doesn’t work out, you can 
always go back to a job similar to the one 
you left behind. Also, recognize that risk is 
a matter of perception, and as with invest-
ments, people completely overlook some 
risks. What about the risk to your happiness 
and career if you stay in a boring, claw-
your-way-up-the-corporate-ladder kind 
of job? You always risk a layoff when you 
work for a company. An even greater risk 
is that you’ll wake up in your 50s or 60s and 
think that it’s too late to do something on 
your own and wish you had tried sooner.

278
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
you didn’t score highly on our ten-question entrepreneur assessment in the 
preceding section, don’t despair. You can probably be happier and more suc-
cessful doing something other than starting your own business.
 
Some people are better off working for someone else. Consider the following 
options.
Being an entrepreneur inside a company
A happy medium is available for people who want the challenge of running 
their own show without giving up the comforts and security that come with a 
company environment — for example, you can manage an entrepreneurial ven-
ture at a company. That’s what John Kilcullen, president and chief executive 
officer of IDG Books Worldwide (former publisher of the For Dummies books), 
did when he helped launch the book publishing division of IDG in 1990. (IDG 
Books was subsequently bought by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in 2001.)
Kilcullen had publishing industry experience and wanted to take on the 
responsibility of growing a successful publishing company. But he also knew 
that being a player in the book publishing industry takes a lot of money and 
resources. Because he was a member of the founding team of the new IDG 
Books division, Kilcullen had the best of both worlds.
Kilcullen always had a passion to start his own business but found that most 
traditional publishers weren’t interested in giving autonomy and money to a 
division and letting it run with the ball. “I wanted the ability to build a busi-
ness on my own instincts . . . the appeal of IDG was that it was decentralized. 
IDG was willing to invest and provide the freedom to spend as we saw fit.”
If you’re able to secure an entrepreneurial position inside a larger company, 
in addition to significant managerial and operational responsibility, you can 
also negotiate your share of the financial success you help create. The parent 
company’s senior management wants you to have the incentive that comes 
from sharing in the financial success of your endeavours. Bonuses, stock 
options, and the like are often tied to a division’s performance.
Investing in your career
Some people are happy or content as employees. Companies need and want 
lots of good employees, so you can find a job if you have skills, a work ethic, 
and the ability to get along with others.
 
You can improve your income-earning ability and invest in your career in a 
variety of different ways:

279
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
✓ Work: Be willing to work extra hours and take on more responsibility, 
but do so within reason. Those who take extra initiative and then deliver 
really stand out in a company where many people working on a salary 
have a time-clock, 9-to-5 mentality. But be careful that the extra effort 
doesn’t contribute to workaholism, a dangerous addiction that causes 
too many people to neglect important personal relationships and their 
own health. Don’t bite off more than you can chew — otherwise, your 
supervisors won’t have faith that they can count on you to deliver. Find 
ways to work smarter, not just longer, hours.
 
✓ Read: One of the reasons that you don’t need a PhD, master’s degree, 
or even an undergraduate university degree to succeed in business is 
that you can find out a lot on your own. You can gain insight by doing, 
but you can also gain expertise by reading a lot. A good bookstore has 
no entrance requirements, such as an elevated high school grade point 
average — you only have to walk through the doors. A good book isn’t 
free, but it costs a heck of lot less than taking more university or gradu-
ate courses!
 
✓ Study: If you haven’t completed your university or graduate degree and 
the industry you’re in values those who have, consider investing the 
time and money to finish your education. Speak with others who have 
taken that path and see what they have to say.
Exploring Small-Business 
Investment Options
Only your imagination limits the ways that you can make money with small 
businesses. Choosing the option that best meets your needs isn’t unlike 
choosing other investments, such as in real estate (see Part III) or in the 
investment industry (see Part II). Following are the major ways you can 
invest in small business and what is and isn’t attractive about each option.
Starting your own business
Of all your small-business options, starting your own business involves the 
greatest amount of work. Although you can perform this work on a part-time 
basis in the beginning, most people end up working in their business full time.
For most of our working years, we’ve both run our own businesses, and over-
all, we both really like it. In our experience with small-business owners, we’ve 
seen many people of varied backgrounds, interests, and skills achieve suc-
cess and happiness running their own businesses.

280
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Don’t start a business for tax write-offs
“Start a small business for fun, profit, and 
huge tax deductions,” a financial advice book 
declares, adding that “the tax benefits alone 
are worth starting a small business.” A seminar 
company offers a course titled “How to Have 
Zero Taxes Deducted from Your Pay Cheque.” 
This tax seminar tells you how to solve your tax 
problems: “If you have a sideline business, or 
would like to start one, you’re eligible to have 
little or no taxes taken from your pay.”
All this sounds too good to be true — and of 
course it is. Not only are the strategies sure to 
lead to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) audit pur-
gatory, but such books and seminars may also 
seduce you to pony up $100 or more for audio-
tapes or notebooks of “inside information.”
Unfortunately, many self-proclaimed self-help 
gurus state that you can slash your taxes simply 
by finding a product or service that you can sell 
on the side of your regular employment. The 
problem, they argue, is that as a regular wage 
earner who receives a paycheque from an 
employer, you can’t write off many of your other 
(personal) expenses. Open a sideline business, 
they say, and you can deduct your personal 
expenses as business expenses.
The pitch is enticing, but the reality is some-
thing quite different. You have to spend money 
to get tax deductions, and the spending must 
be for legitimate purposes of your business in 
its efforts to generate income. If you think that 
taking tax deductions for your hobby is worth the 
risk because you won’t get caught unless you’re 
audited, the odds are stacked against you. The 
CRA audits an extraordinarily large portion of 
small businesses that show regular losses.
The bottom line is that you need to operate a 
real business for the purpose of generating 
income and profits, not tax deductions. It used 
to be that the CRA placed a lot of importance 
on whether an undertaking had “a reasonable 
expectation of profit.” The problem is that the 
test was done after the fact. It wasn’t uncom-
mon for people to be turned down when they 
tried to claim their losses as legitimate deduc-
tions, since in hindsight it’s a lot easier to see 
why a failed business didn’t have a fighting 
chance in the first place.
More importantly, the rule set a much higher 
standard for entrepreneurs than it did for larger 
companies that regularly deduct the cost of 
misguided blunders, ill-advised takeovers, and 
pie-in-the-sky planning. What’s more, many 
of today’s successful businesses would never 
have got off the ground if the entrepreneurs 
behind them had listened to all the reasons 
they were “bound to fail” offered up by naysay-
ers. Sometimes, too, businesses launched on a 
foolhardy premise manage to survive and often 
thrive thanks to good luck and fortuitous timing.
The good news for entrepreneurs is that in 2002, 
the Supreme Court greatly reduced the impor-
tance of the “reasonable expectation of profit” 
test, making it just one of many factors that the 
tax department considers when assessing the 
commercial viability of an enterprise. At the 
same time, the Court emphasized that a tax-
payer’s business smarts — or complete com-
mercial naïveté — are not to be considered 
when assessing whether expenses qualify as 
business losses.
If you have rung up losses for three years or 
more, and want to continue to claim your future 
losses, you may still have to convince the CRA 
that you’re seriously trying to make a profit and 
run a legitimate business. The bottom line is 
that you need to operate a real business for the 
purpose of generating income and profits, not 
tax deductions. And remember that deducting 
any expenses that aren’t directly applicable to 
your business is illegal.

281
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
Most people perceive starting their own business as the riskiest of all small-
business investment options. But if you get into a business that uses your 
skills and expertise, the risk isn’t nearly as great as you may think. Suppose 
that you teach and make $35,000 per year and you want to set up your own 
tutoring service, making a comparable amount of money. If you find through 
your research that others who perform these services charge $40 per hour, 
you need to actually tutor about 20 or so hours per week, assuming that you 
work 50 weeks per year. Because you can run this business from your home 
(which can possibly generate small tax breaks) without purchasing new equip-
ment, your expenses should be minimal.
Instead of leaving your job cold turkey and trying to build your business from 
scratch, you can start moonlighting as a tutor. Over a couple of years, if you 
can build the tutoring up to ten hours per week, you’re halfway to your goal. 
If you leave your job and focus all your energies on your tutoring business, 
getting to 20 hours per week of billable work shouldn’t be a problem. Still 
think starting a business is risky?
 
Many businesses can be started with little money by leveraging your existing 
skills and expertise. If you have the time to devote to building “sweat equity,” 
you can build a valuable company and job. As long as you check out the 
competition and offer a valued product or service at a reasonable cost, the 
principal risk with your business is that you won’t do a good job marketing 
what you have to offer. If you can market your skills, you should succeed. See 
Chapter 14 for more details on starting and running your own business.
Buying an existing business
If you don’t have a specific idea for a business that you want to start, but 
you have business management skills and an ability to improve existing busi-
nesses, consider buying an established business. Although you don’t have to 
go through the riskier start-up period if you take this route, you’ll likely need 
more capital to buy a going enterprise.
You also need to be able to deal with potentially sticky personnel and man-
agement issues. The history of the organization and the way things work 
predates your ownership of the business. If you don’t like making hard deci-
sions, firing people who don’t fit with your plans, and coercing people into 
changing the way they did things before you arrived on the scene, buying 
an existing business likely isn’t for you. Also realize that some of the good 
employees may be loyal to the old owner and his or her style of running the 
business, so they may split when you arrive.
 
Some people perceive that buying an existing business is safer than starting 
a new one, but buying someone else’s business can actually be riskier. You’ll 
have to shell out far more money up front, in the form of a down payment, to 
buy a business. If you don’t have the ability to run the business and it does 

282
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
poorly, you may lose much more financially. Another risk is that the business 
may be for sale for a reason — perhaps it’s not very profitable, it’s in decline, 
or it’s generally a pain in the posterior to operate.
Good businesses that are for sale don’t come cheaply. If the business is a suc-
cess, the current owner has removed the start-up risk from the business, so 
the price of the business should include a premium to reflect this lack of risk. 
If you have the capital to buy an established business and you have the skills 
to run it, consider going this route. Chapter 15 discusses how to buy a good 
business.
Investing in someone else’s business
If you like the idea of profiting from successful small businesses but don’t 
want the day-to-day headaches of being responsible for managing the enter-
prise, you may want to invest in someone else’s small business. Although this 
route may seem easier, fewer people are actually cut out to be investors in 
other people’s businesses.
Investing for the right reasons
 
Consider investing in someone else’s business if you meet the following 
criteria:
 
✓ You have sufficient assets so that what you invest in small privately held 
companies is a small portion (20 percent or less) of your total financial 
assets.
 
✓ You can afford to lose what you invest. Unlike investing in a diversified 
stock mutual fund (see Chapter 8), you may lose all of your investment 
when you invest in a small, privately held company.
 
✓ You’re astute at evaluating financial statements and business strategies. 
Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common with 
investing in a publicly traded firm. The difference is that private firms 
aren’t required to produce comprehensive, audited financial statements 
that adhere to certain accounting principles the way that public compa-
nies are. Thus, you have a greater risk of not receiving sufficient or accu-
rate information when you evaluate a small private firm.
Putting money into your own business (or someone else’s) can be a 
high-risk — but potentially high-return — investment. The best options are 
those that you understand well. If you hear about a great business idea or 
company from someone you know and trust, do your research and make 
your best judgment. That company or idea may well be a terrific investment.

283
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
Before you invest, ask to see a copy of the business plan and compare it with 
the business plan model that we suggest later in this chapter. Thoroughly 
check out the people running the business. Talk to others who don’t have a 
stake in the investment and benefit from their comments and concerns. But 
don’t forget that many a wise person has rained on the parade of what turned 
out to be a terrific business idea.
Avoiding investing mistakes
 
Although some people are extra careful when they invest other people’s 
money, know that many small-business owners seek investors’ money for the 
wrong reasons. Some business owners are impatient and perhaps don’t under-
stand the feasibility of making do with a small amount of capital (a process 
called bootstrapping, which we discuss in Chapter 14).
Other businesses need money because they’re in financial trouble. Consider 
the small furniture retailer that conducted a stock offering to raise money. 
On the surface, everything seemed fine, and the company made it onto the 
Inc. 500 list of fast-growing small companies. But it turns out that the com-
pany wanted to issue stock because it expanded too quickly and didn’t sell 
enough merchandise to cover its high overhead. The company ended up in 
bankruptcy.
Another problem with small businesses that seek investors is that many 
small-business owners may take more risk and do less upfront planning and 
homework with other people’s money. Many well-intentioned people fail at 
their businesses. Take the MBA from a top business school — we’ll call him 
Jacob — who convinced an investor to put up about $300,000 to purchase a 
small manufacturing company. Jacob put a small amount of his own money 
into the business and immediately blew about $100,000 on a fancy computer 
scheduling and order-entry system.
Likewise, Jacob wasn’t interested much in sales (a job that the previous 
owner managed), so he hired a sales manager. The sales manager he hired 
was a disaster — many of the front-line salespeople fled to competitors, 
taking key customers with them. By the time Jacob came to his senses, it 
was too late — the disaster had unfolded. He tried to cut costs, but doing so 
hurt the quality and timeliness of the company’s products. The business dis-
solved, and the investor lost everything.
Drawing Up Your Business Plan
If you’re motivated to start your own business, the next step is to figure out 
what you want to do and how you’re going to do it; in other words, you need 
a business plan. You need a general plan that helps you define what you think 

284
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
you want to do and the tasks you need to perform to accomplish your goal. 
The business plan — which is essential for your own planning, obtaining 
loans, and showing to potential investors — should be a working document 
or blueprint for the early days, months, and years of your business.
You don’t need a perfectly detailed plan that spells out all the minutiae. 
Making such an involved plan is a waste of your time because things change 
and evolve.
The amount of detail your plan needs depends on your goals and the specif-
ics of your business. A simple, more short-term focused plan (ten pages or 
so) is fine if you don’t aspire to build an empire. However, if your goal is to 
grow, hire employees, and open multiple locations, then your plan needs to 
be longer (20 to 50 pages) to cover longer-term issues. If you want outside 
investor money, a longer business plan is a necessity.
 
As you put together your plan and evaluate your opportunities, open your 
ears and eyes. Expect to do research and to speak with other entrepreneurs 
and people in the industry. Most people will spend time talking with you as 
long as they realize that you don’t want to compete with them. And for more 
details on crafting a business plan, check out Business Plans For Canadians For 
Dummies, by Paul Tiffany, Steven D. Peterson, and Nada Wagner (Wiley).
Identifying your business concept
What do you want your business to do? What product or service do you want 
to offer? Maybe your business goal is to perform tax-preparation services for 
small-business owners. Or perhaps you want to start a consulting firm, open 
a restaurant that sells healthy fast food, run a gardening service, or manufac-
ture toys.
 
Your concept doesn’t have to be unique to survive in the business world — 
witness the legions of self-employed consultants, plumbers, tax preparers, and 
restaurant owners. The existence of many other people who already do what 
you want to do validates the potential for your small-business ideas. We know 
many wage slaves who say they would love to run their own business if they 
could only come up with “the idea.” Most of these people still dream about 
their small-business plans as they draw their Canada Pension Plan cheques. 
Being committed to the idea of running your own business is more important 
than developing the next great product or service. In the beginning, the busi-
ness opportunities you pursue can be quite general to your field of expertise 
or interest. What you eventually do over time will evolve.
We’re not saying that an innovative idea lacks merit. A creative idea gives 
you the chance to hit a big home run, and the first person to successfully 
develop a new idea can achieve big success.

Even if you aspire to build the next billion-dollar company, you can put a twist 
on older concepts. Suppose that you’re a veterinarian, but you don’t want a 
traditional office where people must bring their cats and dogs for treatment. 
You believe that because many people are starved for free time, they want a 
vet who makes house calls. Thus, you open your Vet on Wheels business.

Outlining your objectives
The reasons for starting and running your own small business are as varied 
as the entrepreneurs behind their companies. Before you start your firm, it’s 
useful to think about what you’re seeking to achieve. Your objectives need 
not be cast in concrete and will surely change over time. If you like, you can 
write a short and motivating mission statement.
When you ask an MBA, especially one from a big-name school, to think about 
objectives, he or she usually says something like, “My goal is to run a $20 mil-
lion company in seven years.” Financial objectives are fine, but don’t make 
your objectives strictly financial unless money is the only reason that you 
want to run your own business.
Introductory economics courses teach students that the objective of every 
for-profit firm is to maximize profits. As with many things taught in econom-
ics courses, this theory has one problem — it doesn’t hold up in reality. Most 
small-business owners we know don’t manage their businesses maniacally in 
the pursuit of maximum profits. The following list gives you some other pos-
sible objectives to consider:
 
✓ Working with people you like and respect: Some customers may buy 
your products and services, and some employees and suppliers may 
offer you their services for a good price, but what if you can’t stand 
working with them? If you have sufficient business or just have your own 
standards, you can choose whom you do business with.
 
✓ Educating others: Maybe part of your business goal is to educate the 
public about something that you’re an expert in. We know that when we 
started our businesses, we both saw educating people about personal 
finance and investing as a core part of our companies’ purpose.
 
✓ Improving an industry/setting a higher standard: Perhaps part of your 
goal in starting your business is to show how your industry can better 
serve its customers. Having an ideal and putting it into practice can be 
very rewarding and a terrific motivator that helps you get through tough 
stretches.
Of course, you can’t accomplish these objectives without profits, and doing 
these things isn’t inconsistent with generating greater profits. But if your 
objectives are more than financial or your financial objectives aren’t your 
number-one concern, don’t worry — that’s usually a good sign. Remember 
the expression “Do what you love, the money will follow.”

287
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
Analyzing the marketplace
 
The single most important area to understand is the marketplace in which 
your business competes. To be successful, your business must not only pro-
duce a good product or service, but it must also reach customers and con-
vince them to buy your product at a price at which you can make a profit. You 
should discern what the competition has to offer, as well as its strengths and 
vulnerabilities. In most industries, you also need to understand government 
regulations that affect the type of business you’re considering.
Meeting customer needs
If the market analysis is the most important part of the business plan, then 
understanding your potential customers is the most important part of your 
market analysis. If you don’t understand your desired customers and their 
needs, don’t expect to have a successful business.
If you’re in a business that sells to consumers, consider your customers’ 
gender, age, income, geographic location, marital status, number of children, 
education, living situation (rent or own), and the reasons they want your 
product or service. Who are your prospective customers? Where do they 
live, and what do they care about? If you sell to businesses, you need to 
understand similar issues. What types of businesses may buy your product 
or services? Why?
 
The best way to get to know your potential customers is to get out and talk 
to them. While more time-consuming, live interviews allow you to go with the 
flow of the conversation, improvise questions, and probe more interesting 
areas. Although you can e-mail or mail paper-based surveys to many people 
with a minimal investment of your time, the response rate is usually quite 
low, and the answers are usually not very illuminating. To encourage better 
response, offer a product or service sample or some other promotional item 
to those who help you with your research. Doing so attracts people who are 
interested in your product or service, which helps you define your target 
customers.
Also, try to get a sense of what customers do pay and will pay for the prod-
ucts or services that you offer. Analyzing the competition’s offerings helps, 
too. Some products or services also require follow-up or additional servicing. 
Understand what customers need and what they’ll pay for your services.
 
If you want to raise money from investors, include some estimates of the 
size of the market for your product or services. Of course, such numbers are 
ballpark estimates, but sizing the market for your product helps you estimate 
profitability, the share of the market needed to be profitable, and so on.

288
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Besting the competition
Always examine the products, services, benefits, and prices that competi-
tors offer. Otherwise, you go on blind faith that what you offer stacks up well 
versus the alternatives in the industry.
You first need to decide whether you have a realistic chance of winning the 
consumer choice battle. We think you’ll agree that going into the same dis-
count warehouse retailing business and competing head-to-head with Real 
Canadian Superstore, Costco, or Rona is crazy.
 
Examine your competitors’ weaknesses so you can exploit them. Rather 
than trying to beat them on their terms, maybe you’ve identified a need for a 
neighbourhood pet supply store that offers a more specialized range of pet 
supplies than the big-selling brands of dog and cat food that warehouse stores 
sell. Providing knowledgeable customer sales representatives to answer cus-
tomer questions and make product suggestions can also give you a competi-
tive edge. These advantages may allow you to surpass the warehouse stores 
on three counts: convenience of location for people in your neighbourhood, 
breadth of product offerings, and customer assistance.
 
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that even if you have a completely innova-
tive product or service that no other business currently offers, you don’t have 
competitors. All businesses have competitors. In the event that you’ve devel-
oped something truly unique that has little competition, your success will 
surely breed competition as imitators follow or attempt to leapfrog your lead.
Complying with regulations
Most businesses are subject to some sort of regulation. If you want to start 
a retail business, for example, few communities permit you to run it out of 
your home. If you lease or purchase a private location, the zoning laws in that 
location may restrict you. Therefore, you need to check what you can and 
can’t sell at that location. Check with the zoning department of your city or 
town — don’t simply believe a real estate agent or property owner who says, 
“No problem!” That person’s goal, after all, is to sell the property.
If you were going to start a veterinary practice, you would quickly discover 
that special zoning is required to use a piece of real estate for a vet’s office. 
Convincing a local zoning board to allow a new location to get such special 
zoning is quite difficult, if not impossible, in some areas.
Many businesses face other local, provincial, and even federal regulatory 
issues, including ordinances, laws, and the need for specific licences and fil-
ings. For example, if you were opening a restaurant, you’d have to heed ordi-
nances and laws that regulate everything from signage to operating hours 
to your ability to serve alcohol. And you’d be subject to an amazing array of 
health codes, building codes, and fire codes, to name a few.

289
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
If you enter an industry that you’re relatively new to, ask questions and open 
your ears to find out more about where you should locate and how you should 
design your business. Speak to people who are currently in the field and your 
local chamber of commerce to see what, if any, licences or filings you must 
complete. Read books on the subject and check the newsstand and local 
library for trade magazines that may deal with your questions. Libraries have 
books and online services that can help you locate specific articles on topics 
that interest you.
Delivering your service or product
Every business has a product or service to sell. How are you going to provide 
this product or service? Suppose you want to start a business that delivers 
groceries and runs errands for busy people or older and disabled people who 
can’t easily perform daily tasks for themselves. Delineate the steps that you’ll 
take to provide the service. When potential customers call you to inquire 
about your business, what kinds of information do you want to record about 
their situation? Create a pricing sheet and other marketing literature (dis-
cussed in the next section) that you can mail curious potential customers. 
After someone calls and says, “I want to hire you,” you need to collect more 
details. Try drawing up an information sheet that prompts you for the infor-
mation that you need (for example, address, promised delivery time, desired 
items, and so on).
 
You need to map out a system that you can work with before you dive into 
running your business. Your system may evolve over time — you can be guar-
anteed of that — but a tentative game plan has great value.
If you want to manufacture a product, you definitely need to scope out the 
process you’re going to use. Otherwise, you have no idea how much time the 
manufacturing process may take or what the process may cost.
As your business grows and you hire employees to provide services or create 
your products, the more you codify what you do, the better your employees 
can replicate your good work.
Marketing your service or product
After you get more in-depth information about your company’s services or 
products, you need to find more specific information about the following:

290
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
 
✓ How much will you charge for your services and products? Look at 
what competing products and services cost. Estimating your costs helps 
you figure out what you need to charge to cover your costs and make a 
reasonable profit.
 
✓ How will you position your product and services versus the competi-
tion? Remember the local pet supply store example that we mention 
in the earlier section “Besting the competition”? It positions itself as a 
convenient store equipped with a broad selection and knowledgeable 
customer assistance. Books similarly position themselves in the book 
marketplace. We hope, in your mind, that our financial books are down-
to-earth, practical, answer-oriented, and educational.
 
✓ Where will you sell your product or service? Business consultants 
label this decision the distribution channel question. For example, if 
you’re going to go into the hula-hoop manufacturing business, you may 
consider selling via mail order and the Internet, through toy stores, or 
through discount warehouse stores. Selling through each of these dif-
ferent distribution channels requires unique marketing and advertising 
programs. If you market a product or service to companies, you need to 
find out who the key decision makers are at the company and what will 
persuade them to buy your product or service.
Having a great product or service isn’t enough if you keep it a secret — you 
gotta get the word out. It’s doubtful that you have the budget or want to 
reach the same region that television and radio advertising reach.
 
Start marketing your product to people you know. Develop a punchy, informa-
tive one-page letter that announces your company’s inception and the prod-
ucts or services it offers, and mail it to your contacts. Include an envelope 
with a reply form that allows recipients to provide the addresses of others 
who may be interested in what you have to offer. Send these folks a mailing as 
well, mentioning who passed their names along to you.
Finding and retaining customers is vital to any business that wants to grow 
and be profitable. One simple, inexpensive way to stay in touch with cus-
tomers you’ve dealt with or others who have made inquiries and expressed 
interest in your company’s offerings is via a mailing list. Once a quarter, once 
a year, or whatever makes sense for your business, send out a simple, pro-
fessional-looking postcard or newsletter announcing new information about 
your business and what customer needs you can fulfill. Such mailings also 
allow you to remind people that you’re still in business and that you provide 
a wonderful product or service. Computer software gives you a fast, efficient 
way to keep a customer mailing list up to date and to print mailing labels.

291
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
 
E-mailing this information has the attraction of no out-of-pocket expenses. 
However, due to the deluge of junk e-mail most people get, your e-mail is likely 
to be deleted without being opened. At least a snail-mailed postcard will get 
the attention of prospective customers, even if only for a brief period.
Organizing and staffing your business
Many small businesses are one-person operations. So much the better for 
you — you have none of the headaches of hiring, payroll, and so on. You only 
have to worry about you — and that may be a handful in itself!
But if you would rather manage the work being done instead of doing all 
the work yourself, and if you hope to grow your business, you’ll eventually 
want to hire people. (We explain the best way to fill your personnel needs 
in Chapter 14.) Give some thought now to the skills and functional areas of 
expertise that future hires need. If you want to raise money, the employment 
section of your business plan is essential to show your investors that you’re 
planning long-term.
Maybe you’ll want an administrative assistant, researcher, marketing person, 
or sales representative. What about a training specialist, finance person, or 
real estate person if your company expands? Consider the background that 
you want in those you hire, and look at the types of people that similar com-
panies select and hire.
You should also consider what legal form of organization — for example, a 
sole proprietorship, partnership, incorporated company, and so on — your 
business will adopt. We address this topic in Chapter 14.
Projecting finances
 
An idea often becomes a bad idea or a business failure if you neglect to con-
sider, or are unrealistic about, the financial side of the business you want to 
start. If you’re a creative or people-person type who hates numbers, the finan-
cial side may be the part of the business plan that you most want to avoid. 
Don’t! Doing so can cost you tens of thousands of dollars in avoidable mis-
takes. Ignoring the financial side can even lead to the bankruptcy of a business 
founded with a good idea.
Before you launch your business, you should do enough research so you 
can come up with some decent estimates to address these financial issues. 

292
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Financial projections are mandatory, and knowledgeable investors will scruti-
nize them if you seek outside money. You also need to think through how and 
when investors can cash out.
Start-up and development costs
Spending money to get your business from the idea stage to an operating 
enterprise is inevitable. Before the revenue begins to flow in, you’ll incur 
expenditures as you develop and market your products and services. 
Therefore, you need to understand what you must spend money on and the 
approximate timing of the needed purchases.
If you were going to build a house, you would develop a list of all the required 
costs. How much are the land, construction, carpeting, landscaping, and so 
on going to cost? You can try to develop all these cost estimates yourself, 
or you can speak with local builders and have them help you. Likewise, with 
your business, you can hire a business consultant who knows something 
about your type of business. However, we think you’re best served by doing 
the homework yourself — you discover a lot more, and it’s cheaper.
If you’re going to work in an office setting, at home or in another space, you 
need furniture (such as a desk, chair, filing cabinets, and so on), a computer, 
printer, and other office supplies. Don’t forget to factor in the costs of any 
licences or government registrations you may need.
If you run a retailing operation, you need to also estimate your cost for estab-
lishing an initial inventory of goods. Remember, selling your inventory takes 
time, especially when you first start up. And because it’s a new business, 
suppliers won’t give you months on end to pay for your initial inventory. Be 
realistic — otherwise, the money that you tie up in inventory can send you to 
financial ruin.
Income statement
Preparing an estimated income statement that summarizes your expected rev-
enue and expenses is a challenging and important part of your business plan. 
(We explain the elements of an income statement in Chapter 6.) Preparing an 
income statement is difficult because of all the estimates and assumptions 
that go into it. As you prepare your estimated income statement, you may 
discover that making a decent profit is tougher than you thought. This sec-
tion of your business plan helps you make pricing decisions.
Consider the Vet on Wheels business idea that we discuss in the “Identifying 
your business concept” section, earlier in this chapter. What range of veteri-
nary services can you provide if you make house calls? You can’t perform all 
the services that you can in a larger office setting. What equipment do you 

293
 Chapter 13: Assessing Your Appetite for Small Business
need to perform the services? How much should you charge for the services? 
You need to estimate all these things to develop a worthwhile income state-
ment. You should be able to answer these questions from the insights and 
information you pulled together regarding what customers want and what 
your competitors are offering.
 
With service businesses in which you or your employees sell your time, be 
realistic about how many hours you can bill. You may end up being able to bill 
only a third to half of your time, given the other management activities you 
need to perform.
Because building a customer base takes several years, try to prepare esti-
mated income statements for the first three years. In the earlier years, you 
have more start-up costs. In later years, you reap more profits as your cus-
tomer rolls expand. Having income statements for several years is also essen-
tial if you’re seeking investor money.
Balance sheet
An income statement measures the profitability of a business over a span of 
time, such as a year, but it tells you nothing of a business’s resources and 
obligations. That’s what a balance sheet does. Just as your personal balance 
sheet itemizes your personal assets (for example, investments) and liabilities 
(debts you owe), a business balance sheet details a company’s assets and 
liabilities.
If you operate a cash business — you provide a service and are paid for that 
service, and you don’t hold any inventory, for example — a balance sheet has 
limited use. An exception is if you’re trying to get a bank loan for your service 
business.
 
A detailed balance sheet isn’t as important as tracking your available cash, 
which will be under pressure in the early years of a business because 
expenses can continue to exceed revenue for quite some time.
A complete balance sheet is useful for a business that owns significant 
equipment, furniture, inventory, and so on. The asset side of the balance 
sheet provides insight into the financial staying power of the company. For 
example, how much cash does your business have on hand to meet expected 
short-term bills? Conversely, the liability side of the ledger indicates the obli-
gations, bills, and debts the company has coming due in the short and long 
term.
See Chapter 6 for more information on all the elements of a balance sheet.

Writing an executive summary
An executive summary is a 2- to 3-page summary of your entire business plan 
that you can share with interested investors who may not want to first wade 
through a 40- to 50-page plan. The executive summary whets the prospec-
tive investor’s appetite by touching on the highlights of your entire plan. 
Although you should put this summary at the beginning of your plan docu-
ment, we list this element last because you’re not going to be able to write 
an intelligent summary of your plan until you flesh out the body of your busi-
ness plan.

A
fter you research and evaluate the needs of your business, at some 
point you need to decide whether to actually start your business. In 
reference to his business plan, Alex Popov, founder of Smart Alec’s, a healthy 
fast-food restaurant, says, “Something just clicked one day, and I said to 
myself, ‘Yes, this is a business that is viable and appropriate now.’”
Most entrepreneurs experience this sudden realization, including us — we’ve 
experienced it with every business that we’ve ever started. If you really want 
to, you can conduct and analyze market research and crunch numbers until 
the cows come home. Even if you’re a linear, logical, analytic, quantitative 
kind of person, you need to make a gut-level decision in the final analysis: Do 
you want to jump in the water and start swimming, or do you want to stay on 
the sidelines and remain a spectator? In our opinion, watching isn’t nearly as 
fun as doing. If you feel ready but have some trepidation, you’re normal — 
just go for it!

Starting Up: Your Preflight Checklist
When you decide to take off into the world of small-business ownership, you 
also need to ponder and make some decisions about a number of important 
issues. Just like a pilot before launching an airplane into flight, you need to 
make sure that all systems are in order and ready to do the job. If your fuel 
tanks aren’t adequately filled, your engines clean and in working order, and 
your wing flaps in the proper position, you may never get your business off 
the ground.
Preparing to leave your job
 
The top reasons that wannabe entrepreneurs remain wannabe entrepreneurs 
are the psychological and financial aspects. Financial and emotional issues 
cause many aspiring entrepreneurs to remain their employers’ indentured ser-
vants and cause those who do break free to soon return to their bondage. You 
may never discover that you have the talent to run your own business, and 
perhaps have a good idea to boot, unless you prepare yourself financially and 
psychologically to leave your job.
The money side of this self-exploration is easier to deal with than your mind, 
so we’ll start with that. Dealing with a net reduction in the income you bring 
home from work — at least in the early years of your business — is a fore-
gone conclusion for the vast majority of small-business opportunities that 
you may pursue. Accept this fact and plan accordingly.
 
Do all you can to reduce your expenses to a level that fits the entrepreneurial 
life you want to lead. You must examine your monthly spending patterns now 
to make your budget lean, mean, and entrepreneurially friendly. Determine 
what you spend each month on your rent (or mortgage), groceries, eating out, 
telephone calls, insurance, and so on. Unless you’re one of those organized 
computer geeks — someone who keeps all this data detailed in a software 
package — you need to whip out your chequebook register, ATM receipts, 
credit card statements, and anything else that documents your spending 
habits. Don’t forget to estimate your cash purchases that don’t leave a trail, 
like when you eat lunch out or spend $35 on gas.
Don’t tell us that everything you spend your money on is a necessity and that 
you can’t cut anywhere. Question your expenditures! If you don’t, continuing 
to work as an employee will be a necessity, and you’ll never be able to pursue 
your entrepreneurial dream.

Beyond the bare essentials of food, shelter, health care, and clothing, most 
of what you spend money on is discretionary — that is, you spend money on 
things you don’t need, like luxuries. Even the amount that you spend on the 
necessities, such as food and shelter, is probably only part necessity and 
may include a fair amount of luxury and waste. If you need a helping hand 
and an analyst’s eye in preparing and developing strategies for reducing your 
spending, pick up a copy of the latest edition of our book Personal Finance 
For Canadians For Dummies (published by Wiley).
 
If reducing your spending is the most important financial move you can make 
before and during the period that you start your business, the second-best 
thing you can do is to figure how you’ll manage the income side of your per-
sonal finances. The following list gives you some proven strategies to ensure 
that you earn enough income to live on:
 
✓ Transition gradually. One way to pursue your entrepreneurial dreams 
(and not starve while doing so) is to continue working part time in a reg-
ular job while you work part time at your own business. If you have a job 
that allows you to work part time, seize the opportunity. Some employ-
ers may even allow you to maintain your benefits.
 
 In addition to ensuring a steady source of income, splitting your time 
allows you to adjust to a new way of making a living. Some people have 
a hard time adjusting to their new lifestyle if they quit their jobs cold 
turkey and plunge headfirst into full-time entrepreneurship.
 
 Another option is to completely leave your job but line up a chunk of 
work that provides a decent income for at least some of your weekly 
work hours. Consulting for your old employer is a time-tested first 
“entrepreneurial” option with low risk.
 
✓ Get/stay married. Actually, as long as you’re attached to someone who 
maintains a regular job and you manage your spending so you can live 
on that person’s income alone, you’re golden! Just make sure that you 
talk things through with the love of your life to minimize misunderstand-
ings and resentments. Maybe someday you can return the favour!
Valuing and replacing your benefits
One money dilemma you may encounter deals with the benefits that your 
employer provides. For many people, walking away from these benefits is 
both financially and emotionally challenging. Benefits are valuable, but you 
may be surprised by how efficiently you can replicate them in your own 
business.

Extended health care benefits
Some prospective entrepreneurs fret over finding new extended health care 
benefits. Unless you have a significant existing medical problem (known as a 
pre-existing condition), getting this coverage as an individual isn’t difficult.
The first option to explore is whether your existing coverage through your 
employer’s group plan can be converted into individual coverage.
 
Don’t just buy continuing coverage because it’s available. Before you do, 
explore other health plans on your own. You may find you can purchase simi-
lar benefits at a lower cost. Also, get proposals for individual coverage from 
major health plans in your area. Investigate the cost and value of coverage 
from Blue Cross, Liberty Health, Ingle Health, and other major health plan 
offerers in your area. Look into joining your local chamber of commerce or 
board of trade, which often offer insurance plans to their members. Take a 
high deductible, if available, to keep costs down.
Long-term disability insurance
For most people, their greatest asset is their ability to earn money. If you 
suffer a disability and can’t work, how would you manage financially? Long-
term disability insurance protects your income in the event of a disability.
 
Before you leave your job, secure an individual long-term disability policy. 
After you leave your job and are no longer earning steady income, you won’t 
qualify for a policy. Most insurers want to see at least six months of self-
employment income before they’ll write you a policy. If you become disabled 
during this time, you’re uninsured and out of luck — that’s a big risk to take!
 
Check with any professional associations that you belong to or could join to 
see whether they offer long-term disability plans. As with many employer-
based programs, association plans are sometimes less expensive because of 
the group’s purchasing power.
Life insurance
If you have dependents who count on your income, you need life insurance. 
And unlike with disability insurance, in the vast majority of cases, you can 
purchase a life insurance policy at a lower cost than you can purchase addi-
tional coverage through your employer.
Retirement plans
If your employer offers a retirement savings program, such as a pension plan 
or a deferred profit sharing plan, don’t despair about not having these when 
you head out on your own. For starters, what you’ve already earned and 
accumulated while employed is yours as long as you’ve been in the plan the 

299
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
required amount of time to own the benefits, known as vesting. And when 
you’re self-employed you can continue — or start — putting money into an 
RRSP. As long as you earn an income from your enterprise, you’ll be able to 
take advantage of RRSPs, which allow you to sock away a hefty chunk of your 
earnings on a tax-deductible basis.
Other benefits
Yes, employers offer other benefits that you may value. For example, you 
seem to get paid holidays and vacations. In reality, though, your employer 
simply spreads your salary over all 52 weeks of a year, thus paying you for 
actually working the other 47 weeks or so out of the year. You can do the 
same by building the cost of this paid time off into your product and service 
pricing.
Another “benefit” of being an employee is that your employer pays half of 
your Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan contributions. When 
you’re self-employed, you have to pay the full amount yourself. However, you 
get to claim half that amount — the “employer’s contribution” — as a deduc-
tion from your taxable income. You also get a 15.5 percent federal tax credit 
for the other half — the “employee’s share” — which also generally gets 
you an accompanying provincial tax credit. As with vacations and holidays, 
you can build the cost of this tax into your product and service pricing. Just 
think: Your employer could pay you a higher salary if it wasn’t paying CPP on 
your behalf.
 
Some employers offer other insurance plans, such as dental or vision care 
plans. Ultimately, these plans cover small out-of-pocket expenditures that 
aren’t worth insuring. Don’t waste your money purchasing such policies when 
you’re self-employed. If you want this sort of coverage, look for a plan that 
includes it as part of a wider range of health coverage. Whether you’re self-
employed or incorporated, the premiums for health and dental insurance are 
generally deductible from your business income.
Financing Your Business
When you create your business plan (which we explain how to do in Chapter 
13), you should estimate your start-up and development costs. You can start 
many worthwhile small businesses with little capital. The following sections 
explain methods for financing your business.
 
No matter what type of business you have in mind and how much money you 
think you need to make it succeed, be patient. Start small enough that you 
don’t need outside capital (unless you’re in an unusual situation where your 
window of opportunity is now, but it will close if you don’t get funding soon). 
Starting your business without outside capital instills the discipline required 

300
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
for building a business piece by piece over time. The longer you can wait to 
get a loan or an equity investment, the better the terms are for you and your 
business because the risk is lower for the lender or investor.
Bootstrapping
Making do with a small amount of capital, and spending it as you can afford 
to, is known as bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is just a fancy way of saying that 
a business lives within its means. This forces a business to be more resource-
ful and less wasteful. Bootstrapping is also a great training mechanism for 
producing cost-effective products and services. It offers you the advantage of 
getting into business in the first place with little capital.
Millions of successful small companies were bootstrapped at one time or 
another. Like small redwood saplings that grow into towering trees, small 
companies that had to bootstrap in the past can eventually grow into 
multi-million-dollar and even multi-billion-dollar companies. For example, 
Magna International, one of the world’s largest suppliers to the auto indus-
try, started off as a one-man tool and die shop opened by founder Frank 
Stronach. Then there’s the Jim Pattison Group, Canada’s third largest pri-
vately held company, which employs some 27,000 people. Entrepreneur Jim 
Pattison began by borrowing the money to buy a car dealership by using his 
home and life insurance policy as collateral. Microsoft, Motorola, Sony, and 
Disney were all bootstrapped, too.
Whether you want to maintain a small shop that employs just yourself, hire a 
few employees, or dream about building the next Canadian Tire, Research in 
Motion, or Tim Hortons, you need capital. However, misconceptions abound 
about how much money a company needs to achieve its goals and sources of 
funding.
“There’s an illusion that most companies need tons of money to get estab-
lished and grow,” says James Collins, former lecturer at the Stanford Graduate 
School of Business and coauthor of the best-sellers Built to Last and Good to 
Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap . . . and Others Don’t. “The Silicon 
Valley success stories of companies that raise gobs of venture capital and 
grow 4,000 percent are very rare. They are statistically insignificant but catch 
all sorts of attention,” he adds.
Studies show that the vast majority of small businesses obtain their initial 
capital from personal savings and family and friends rather than outside 
sources, such as banks and venture capital firms. A Harvard Business School 
study of the Inc. 500 (500 large, fast-growing private U.S. companies) found 
that more than 80 percent of the successful companies were started with 

301
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
funds from the founder’s personal savings. The median start-up capital was 
a modest $10,000, and these are successful, fast-growing companies! Slower-
growing companies tend to require even less capital.
With the initial infusion of capital, many small businesses can propel them-
selves for years after they develop a service or product that brings in more 
cash flow. For example, Jim Gentes, the founder of Giro, the bike helmet 
manufacturer, raised $35,000 from personal savings and loans from family 
and friends to make and distribute his first product and then used the cash 
flow for future products.
 
Eventually, a successful, growing company may want outside financing to 
expand faster. Raising money from investors or lenders is much easier after 
you demonstrate that you know what you’re doing and that a market exists for 
your product or service.
As we explain in the section “Preparing to leave your job,” earlier in this 
chapter, aspiring entrepreneurs must examine their personal finances for 
opportunities to reduce their own spending. If you want to start a company, 
the best time for you to examine your finances is many years before you want 
to hit the entrepreneurial path. As with other financial goals, advance prepa-
ration can go a long way toward helping start a business. The best funding 
source and easiest investor to please is you.
Alan Tripp, founder and CEO of Score Learning, a chain of storefront interac-
tive learning centres, planned for seven years before he took the entrepre-
neurial plunge. He funded his first retail centre fully from personal savings. 
He and his wife lived frugally to save the necessary money. Tripp’s first 
centre proved the success of his business concept: retail learning centres 
where kids can use computers to improve their reading, math, and science 
skills. With a business plan crafted over time and hard numbers to demon-
strate the financial viability of his operation, Tripp then successfully raised 
funds from investors to open many more centres. (Kaplan Inc. ultimately 
bought out his company.)
Some small-business founders put the cart before the horse and don’t plan 
and save for starting their business the way Tripp did. And in many cases, 
small-business owners want capital but don’t have a clear plan or need for it.
Borrowing from banks
If you’re starting a new business or have been in business for just a few 
years, borrowing, particularly from banks, may be difficult. Borrowing money 
is easier when you don’t really need to do so. No one knows this fact better 
than small-business owners do.

302
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Small-business owners who successfully obtain bank loans do their home-
work. To borrow money from a bank, you generally need a business plan, 
three years of financial statements and tax returns for the business and its 
owner, as well as projections for the business. Hunt around for banks that are 
committed to and understand the small-business marketplace.
Canada Small Business Financing Program
The Canada Small Business Financing (CSBF) Program guarantees some 
small-business loans provided by banks, credit unions, and many trust, loan, 
and insurance companies. Because many small businesses lack collateral 
and pose a higher loan risk, banks would not otherwise make many of these 
loans. In addition to guaranteeing loans for existing businesses, the CSBF 
backs loans to start-ups. The loans, which can go as high as $250,000, can be 
used to finance the purchase of assets, leasehold improvements, computer 
acquisitions, and so on, and are available to sole proprietorships, partner-
ships, and incorporated companies.
If you choose a floating-rate loan, the interest rate can’t be more than 3 per-
cent above the lender’s prime lending rate, the rate they charge their lowest-
risk corporate borrowers. You can also choose a fixed-rate loan: In this case, 
the interest rate can’t be greater than 3 percent over the lender’s residential 
mortgage rate for a similar term.
 
For more information, call the Small Business Loans Administration 
branch of Industry Canada at 613-954-5540. You can also find them online 
at strategis.ic.gc.ca.
Business Development Bank of Canada
Another good potential source of funds is the Business Development Bank of 
Canada (BDC). For start-ups or companies in their first 12 months of ringing 
up sales, the BDC offers working capital you can use to boost an existing line 
of credit. You may also be able to get financing for buying equipment and for 
marketing and other start-up costs. Financing is also available for buying a 
franchise.
BDC is worth looking into because it offers a number of financing options that 
can be very valuable to newer businesses. For instance, you may be able to 
spread out repayment of your loan over a number of years. You may also be 
able to fit your repayments to your projected cash flow, including a schedule 
that suits the seasonality of your business, or payments that grow as your 
business grows.
For businesses already on their way, the BDC offers working capital loans as 
well as loans for expanding your existing premises or constructing new facili-
ties. It also provides financing for a range of other undertakings, including 

303
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
product and market research, sales planning, feasibility studies, and develop-
ing marketing and distribution plans.
The BDC is also a good place to turn for counselling and consulting services. 
It offers programs to assist small businesses on a number of fronts, including 
developing a business plan, strategic planning, human resources, finance, 
and assessing opportunities for growing your business.
 
To get more information on BDC’s services and how to contact a local office, 
call 1-888-463-6232. BDC also has an informative Web site at www.bdc.ca.
Other sources of bank financing
Other potential sources of financing include the following:
 
✓ Credit unions: These institutions can be another source of financial 
help, and small businesses are generally a key target market for credit 
unions. Credit unions also are generally more willing to make personal 
loans to individuals.
  
✓ Credit cards: If you’ve got the itch to get your business going but can’t 
wait to save the necessary money and lack other ways to borrow, the 
plastic in your wallet may be your ticket to operation. You can acquire 
some credit cards at interest rates of 10 percent or less. Because credit 
cards are unsecured loans, if your business fails and you can’t pay back 
your debt, your home equity and assets in retirement accounts aren’t 
at risk.
Borrowing from yourself
You can use your RRSP as another potential source of capital. However, any 
money you take out of your plan will be taxed as income at your full marginal 
tax rate (the rate you pay on your highest, or last, dollar of income in the 
year). If you do withdraw money from your RRSP, your plan administrator 
has to retain some of the money to help pay the tax on the withdrawal. This 
is known as a withholding tax. The tax is 10 percent on withdrawals up to 
$5,000, 20 percent on withdrawals of between $5,001 and $15,000, and 30 per-
cent on amounts over $15,000. Quebec charges a withholding tax of 16 per-
cent, regardless of the amount, in addition to the federal withholding tax.
 
If you use your RRSP savings for your business, you’ll increase your cash 
flow if you take out several smaller chunks rather than one large amount. For 
instance, if you need to take $9,000 out of your RRSP, instead of taking it out as 
one lump sum, make two withdrawals, one for $5,000 and one for $4,000.

304
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
 
The withholding tax will often not be enough to cover the total tax bill on 
your withdrawal. That means the following spring you may need to find extra 
money in order to pay the outstanding tax on your withdrawal. Far more 
importantly, taking money out of your plan can be an expensive way to fund 
your business. For example, say you borrow $20,000 from your RRSP. If you 
left that money in your plan and it compounded annually by 10 percent, it 
would grow to almost $135,000 in 20 years’ time.
You can also borrow against the equity in your home or other real estate 
to ease your access to capital, because it acts as security on your loan and 
allows you to get a lower interest rate.
Borrowing from family and friends
Because they know you and hopefully like and trust you, your family and 
friends may seem like a good source of investment money for your small 
business. They also have the added advantage of offering you better terms 
than a banker, wealthy investor, or venture capitalist.
 
Before you solicit and accept money from those you love, consider the pitfalls:
 
✓ First, defaulting on a loan made by a large, anonymous lender if your busi-
ness hits the skids is one thing, but defaulting on a loan from your dear 
relatives can make future Thanksgiving meals mighty uncomfortable!
 
✓ Second, most entrepreneurs receive surprisingly little encouragement 
from people they’re close to. Most parents, for example, think you’ve 
severed some of your cerebral synapses if you announce your intention 
to quit your job with the lofty job title, decent pay, and benefits. The 
lack of emotional support can discourage you far more than the lack of 
financial support.
 
From entrepreneurs we’ve observed, we’ve found that family investments in a 
small business work best under the following conditions:
 
✓ You prepare and sign a letter of agreement that spells out the terms 
of the investment or loan, as if you’re doing business with a banker or 
some other investor you know for business purposes only. We also rec-
ommend clearly disclosing the risk of losing one’s entire investment. 
As time goes on, people have selective recall. Putting things in writing 
reminds everyone what was agreed to.
 
✓ You’re quite certain that you can repay the loan.
 
✓ You can start your business with an equity investment. With an equity 
investment, a person is willing and able to lose all the money invested 
but hopes to hit a home run while helping you with your dream.

305
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
Courting investors and selling equity
Beyond family members and friends, private individuals with sufficient 
money — also known as wealthy individuals — are your next best source of 
capital if you want an equity investor (and not a loan from a lender). Before 
you approach wealthy people, you must have a good business plan, which we 
explain how to prepare in Chapter 13. A worthwhile angel investor (a wealthy 
individual who invests in small companies) should have a track record of 
success with somewhat similar businesses that she’s funded and should 
bring other things to the table besides money, such as strategic advice, help-
ful business contacts, and so on.
Although you want such people to care about your business, it’s best if their 
investment in your business is no more than 5 to 10 percent of their total 
investment portfolio. No one wants to lose money, but doing so is less painful 
if you diversify well. A $10,000 investment from a millionaire is 1 percent of 
his portfolio.
 
Finding people who may be interested in investing isn’t difficult, but you need 
to be persistent and creative. Consider these approaches:
 
✓ Consulting tax advisers and lawyers you know may have contacts
 
✓ Networking with successful entrepreneurs in similar fields
 
✓ Considering customers or suppliers of your business who like your busi-
ness and believe in its potential
Finding your way to wealthy individuals who don’t know you may prove fruit-
ful as well. Alex Popov, whom we introduce at the beginning of this chapter, 
sent hundreds of letters to people who lived in upscale neighbourhoods. The 
letter, a one-page summary of Alex’s investment opportunity, got an astound-
ing 5 percent response for interest in receiving a business plan. Ultimately 
through this search method, Popov found one wealthy investor who funded 
his entire deal.
Determining how much of the business you’re selling for the amount invested 
isn’t easy. Basically, the equity percentage should hinge upon what the whole 
business is worth (see Chapter 15 for details on how to value a business). 
If your whole business is worth $500,000 and you’re seeking $100,000 from 
investors, that $100,000 should buy 20 percent of the business.
 
New businesses are the hardest to value — yet another reason you’re best off 
trying to raise money after you demonstrate some success. The farther along 
you are, the lower the risk to an investor and the lower the cost to you (in 
terms of how much equity you must give up) to raise money.

306
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Deciding Whether to Incorporate
Most businesses operate as sole proprietorships. The term sole proprietor-
ship doesn’t mean that only one person owns the business, but rather that 
for legal and tax purposes, your business is not a corporation. If you run a 
sole proprietorship, you report your business income and costs on your tax 
return on the Statement of Business Activities (Form T2124). Certain pro-
fessionals such as doctors, lawyers, and engineers, are required to use the 
Professional Income and Expenses form (T2032). You attach these to your 
personal income tax return, the T1 General.
Incorporating, which establishes a distinct legal entity under which you do 
business, takes time and costs money. Therefore, incorporation must offer 
some benefits.
Because corporations are legal entities distinct from their owners, they offer 
features that a proprietorship or partnership doesn’t. For example, corpora-
tions can have shareholders who own a piece or percentage of the company. 
These shares can be sold or transferred to other owners, subject to any 
restrictions in the shareholder’s agreement. Corporations also offer continuity 
of life, which simply means that they can continue to exist despite an owner’s 
death or the owner’s transfer of her stock in the company.
 
Don’t waste your money incorporating if you simply want to maintain a 
corporate-sounding name. If you operate as a sole proprietor, you can choose 
to operate under a different business name (“doing business as,” or d.b.a.) 
without the cost and hassles of incorporating.
Obtaining liability protection
A major reason to consider incorporation is liability protection. Incorpo-
ration effectively separates your business from your personal finances, 
thereby better protecting your personal assets from lawsuits that may arise 
from your business.
 
Before you incorporate, ask yourself (and perhaps others in your line of busi-
ness or advisers — legal, tax, and so on — who work with businesses like 
yours) what can or may cause someone to sue you. Then see whether you can 
purchase insurance to protect against these potential liabilities. Insurance 
is superior to incorporation because it pays claims, and people can still sue 
you, even if you’re incorporated. If you incorporate and someone successfully 
sues you, your company must cough up the money for the claim, and doing 
so may sink your business. (You may also have to offer personal guarantees 

307
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
for obtaining financing for an incorporated business, which also exposes you 
legally.) Only insurance can cover such financially destructive claims.
People can also sue you if, for example, they slip and suffer an injury while on 
your property. To cover these types of claims, you can purchase a property 
or premises liability policy from an insurer.
 
Accountants, doctors, and a number of other professionals can buy liabil-
ity insurance, and in fact, are sometimes required to do so by regulators or 
professional bodies. A good place to start searching for liability insurance 
is through the associations for your profession. Even if you’re not a current 
member, check out the associations anyway — you may be able to access the 
insurance without membership, or you can join the association long enough 
to sign up. (Associations also sometimes offer competitive rates on disability 
insurance.)
Paying corporate taxes
A big difference between operating as a sole proprietor and as a corporation 
is that the government taxes a corporation’s profits differently from those 
realized in a sole proprietorship. Which is better for your business depends 
on your situation.
Suppose that your business performs well and makes lots of money. If your 
business isn’t incorporated, the government taxes all profits from your busi-
ness on your personal tax return in the year that your company earns those 
profits. If you intend to use these profits to reinvest in your business and 
expand, incorporating can potentially save you some tax dollars.
 
Resist the short-term temptation to incorporate just so you can have money 
left in the corporation taxed at a lower rate. If you want to pay yourself the 
profits in the future, you can end up paying more taxes. Why? Because you 
first pay taxes at the corporate tax rate in the year that your company earns 
the money, and then you pay taxes again on your personal income tax return 
when the corporation pays you.
Another reason not to incorporate, especially in the early months of a busi-
ness, is that you can’t immediately claim the losses for an incorporated 
business on your personal tax return. Because most businesses produce 
little revenue in their early years and have all sorts of start-up expenditures, 
losses are common.
 
The general federal corporate tax rate is 22 percent. In addition, corpora-
tions pay provincial tax of around 12 percent. If your enterprise qualifies as a 
Canadian-controlled private corporation, the federal tax rate is just 13 percent 
on the first $400,000 of active business income. Income over this level is taxed 

308
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
at the general 22 percent federal corporate tax rate. In order to qualify, the 
corporation has to be resident in Canada, and not controlled by any combina-
tion of non-residents or public corporations.
The provinces also have reduced small-business tax rates for the first $400,000 
or $500,000 (depending on the province) of small-business income. As a 
result, a corporation with profits that qualify as “small-business income” will 
be taxed at anywhere from about 14 to 21 percent. The tax rate on profits 
above the threshold amount ranges from around 32 percent to 38 percent, 
depending on the province.
Making the decision
If you’re totally confused about whether to incorporate because your busi-
ness is undergoing major financial changes, it’s worth getting competent pro-
fessional help. The hard part is knowing where to turn, because finding one 
adviser who can put together all the pieces of the puzzle (financial, legal, and 
taxes) is challenging. Also be aware that you may get wrong or biased advice.
 
Although many lawyers and tax advisers don’t understand the business 
side of business, try to find one who does, or you may also need a business 
adviser. Lawyers who specialize in advising small businesses can help explain 
the legal issues. Tax advisers who perform a lot of work with business owners 
can help explain the tax considerations.
If you’ve weighed the factors and you still can’t decide, our advice is to 
keep your business simple — don’t incorporate. Why? Because doing the 
paperwork for incorporating costs time and money, and corporations have 
additional reporting requirements. In addition, should you decide being 
incorporated is not beneficial, unincorporating also takes time and money. 
Start off your business as a sole proprietorship and then take it from there. 
Wait until the benefits of incorporating your business clearly outweigh the 
costs and drawbacks.
Finding and Keeping Customers
When you write your business plan (see Chapter 13), you need to think about 
your business’s customers. Just as the sun is the centre of our solar system, 
everything in your business revolves around your customers. If you take care 
of your customers, they’ll take care of you and your business for many years.

309
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
 
The first thing we recommend doing is putting together a mailing list of people 
you know who may be interested in what you’re offering. Draft and mail an 
upbeat, one-page letter that provides an overview of what your business 
offers. As you have news — successes to report, new products and services, 
and so on — do another mailing. Short letters get read more than something 
that looks like another glossy advertising newsletter. Most people are busy 
and don’t care about your business enough to read something lengthy.
In addition to mailings, other successful ways to get the word out and 
attract customers are limited only to your imagination and resourcefulness. 
Consider the following ideas:
 
✓ If your business idea is indeed innovative or somehow different, or if 
you have grand expansion plans, add some local media people to your 
mailing list and send them the one-page updates on your business, too. 
Everybody from newspaper, radio, and television business reporters to 
Web site writers and bloggers are always looking for story ideas. Just 
remember to make your press releases informational and not an 
advertisement.
 
✓ If your business seeks customers in a specific geographic area, blanket 
that area by mailing your one-page letter or delivering it door to door. 
You can include a coupon that offers your products or services at a 
reduced cost (perhaps at your cost) to get people to try them. Make 
sure that people know that this is a special opening-for-business 
bargain.
 
After you attract customers, treat them as you would like to be treated by a 
business. If customers like your products and services, they not only come 
back to buy more when the need arises, but they also tell others. Satisfied cus-
tomers are every business’s best cost-effective marketers.
We never cease to be amazed by how many businesses have mediocre, poor, 
or downright awful customer service. One reason for poor service is that as a 
business grows, its employees are on the customer service front lines. If you 
don’t hire good people and give them the proper incentives to service cus-
tomers, many of them won’t do it. For most employees on a salary, the day-
to-day servicing of customers may be just an annoyance for them.
 
One way to make your staff care about customer service is to base part of 
their pay on the satisfaction of the customers they work with. Tie bonuses and 
increases at review time to this issue. You can easily measure customer satis-
faction with a simple survey form.
Treating the customer right starts the moment the selling process begins. 
Honesty is an often-underused business tool. More than a few salespeople

mislead and lie in order to close a sale. Many customers discover after their 
purchase that they’ve been deceived, and they get angry. These unethical 
businesses not only likely lose future business from customers but also 
surely — and justifiably — lose referrals.
If your business doesn’t perform well for a customer, apologize and bend 
over backward to make the customer happy. Offer a discount on the problem 
purchase or, if possible, a refund on product purchases. Also, make sure that 
you have a clear return-and-refund policy. Bend that policy if doing so helps 
you satisfy an unhappy customer or rids you of a difficult customer.
Setting Up Shop
No matter what type of business you have in mind, you need space to work 
from, whether it’s a spare room in your home, shared office space, or a small 
factory. You also need to outfit that space with tools of your trade. This sec-
tion explains how to tackle these tasks.
Finding business space and 
negotiating a lease
You may be in the market for office or retail space unless you can run your 
business from your home. Finding good space and buying or leasing it takes 
tons of time if you do it right.
 
In the early months and years of your business, buying an office or a retail 
building generally doesn’t make sense. The down payment consumes impor-
tant capital, and you may end up spending lots of time and money on a real 
estate transaction for a location that may not interest you in the long term. 
Buying this type of real estate rarely makes sense unless you plan to stay put 
for five or more years.
Leasing a space for your business is far more practical. Renting office space 
is simpler than renting retail space because a building owner worries less 
about your business and its financial health. Your business needs more credi-
bility to rent retail because your retail business affects the nature of the strip 
mall or shopping centre where you lease. Owners of such properties don’t 
want quick failures or someone who does a poor job of running his business.
Because renting retail space is harder, if you and your business don’t have 
a track record with renting space, getting references is useful. If you seek 
well-located retail space, you must compete with national chains like Tim 
Hortons, so you’d better have an A+ credit rating and track record. Consider 

311
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
subletting — circulate flyers to businesses that may have some extra space in 
the area where you want to locate your business. Also prepare financial state-
ments that show your creditworthiness (personally and in business).
Agents list most spaces for lease. Working with an agent can be useful, but 
the same conflicts exist as with residential agents (see Chapter 12). You 
should also examine spaces for lease without an agent, where you deal with 
the landlord directly. Such landlords may give you a better deal, and they 
don’t worry about recouping an agent’s commission.
 
The biggest headaches with leasing space are understanding and negotiat-
ing the lease contract. Odds are that the lessor presents you with a standard, 
preprinted lease contract that she says is fair and is the same lease that every-
one else signs. Don’t sign it! This contract is the lessor’s first offer — have an 
expert review it and help you modify it. Find yourself a lawyer who regularly 
deals with such contracts.
Office leases are usually simpler than retail leases. About the most compli-
cated issue you face with office leases is that they can be full service, which 
includes janitorial benefits. Retail leases, however, are almost always triple-
net, which means that you as the tenant pay for maintenance (for example, 
resurfacing the parking lot, cleaning, and gardening), utilities, and property 
taxes. You’re correct to worry about a triple-net retail lease because you 
can’t control many of these expenses. For example, if the property is sold, 
property taxes can jump. Here are provisions to keep in mind when dealing 
with a triple-net lease:
 
✓ Compare your site’s costs to other sites to evaluate the deal that the 
lessor offers you.
 
✓ Your lease contract needs to include a cap for the triple-net costs at a 
specified limit per square foot.
 
✓ Try to make sure that the lease contract doesn’t make you responsible 
for removal costs for any toxic waste you may discover during your 
occupation. Also exclude increased property taxes that the sale of the 
property may cause.
 
✓ If feasible, get your landlord to pay for remodelling — it’s cheaper for 
the landlord to do it and entails fewer hassles for you.
 
✓ With retail leases, get an option for renewal — this is critical in retail, 
where location is important. The option should specify the cost — for 
example, something like 5 percent below market, as determined by 
arbitration.
 
✓ Get an option that the lease can be transferred to a new owner if you sell 
the business.
If you really think that you want to purchase (not lease) because you can see 
yourself staying in the same place for at least five years, read Chapter 11.

Equipping your business space
You can easily go overboard spending money when leasing or buying office 
space and outfitting that space. The most common reason that small-business 
owners spend more than they should is to attempt to project a professional, 
upscale image. You can have an office or retail location that works for you 
and your customers without spending a fortune if you observe some simple 
rules:
Should you work from home?
You may be able to run a relatively simple small 
business from your home. If you have the choice 
of running your business out of your home 
versus securing outside office space, consider 
the following issues:
 ✓ Cost control: As we discuss earlier in this 
chapter, bootstrapping your business can 
make a lot of financial and business sense. 
If you have space in your home that you 
can use, then you’ve found yourself a rent-
free business space. (If you’re considering 
buying a larger home to have more space, 
then you can’t really say that your home 
office is rent-free.)
 ✓ Business issues: What are the needs of 
your business and customers? If you don’t 
require fancy office space to impress 
others or to meet with clients, work at 
home. If you operate a retail business that 
requires lots of customers coming to you, 
getting outside space is probably the best 
(and legally correct) choice. Check with the 
governing authorities of your town or city 
to find out what local regulations exist for 
home-based businesses.
 ✓ Discipline: At home, do you have the disci-
pline to work the number of hours that you 
need and want, or will the kitchen goodies 
tempt you to make half a dozen snack trips? 
Can you refrain from turning on the televi-
sion every hour for late-breaking news? The 
sometimes amorphous challenge of figuring 
out how to grow the business may cause 
you to focus your energies elsewhere.
 ✓ Family matters: Last but not least, your 
home life should factor into where you 
decide to work. One advantage to working 
at home when you’re a parent is that you 
can be a more involved parent. If nothing 
else, you can spend the one to two hours 
per day that many people spend commuting 
with your kids! Just make sure that you try 
to set aside work hours, during which time 
your office is off limits.
 
 Ask other family members how they feel 
about your working at home. Be specific 
about what you plan to do, where, when, 
and how. Will clients come over? What 
time of day and where in the home will 
you meet with them? You may not think 
that your home office is an imposition, but 
your spouse may. Home business problems 
come between many couples. If you’re 
single and living alone, of course, home life 
is less of an issue.

313
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
 
✓ Buy — don’t lease or finance — equipment. Unless you’re running a 
manufacturing outfit where the cost of buying equipment is prohibi-
tive, try to avoid borrowing and leasing. If you can’t buy office furniture, 
computers, cash registers, and so on with cash, then you probably can’t 
afford them! Buying such things on credit or leasing them — leasing is 
invariably the most expensive way to go — encourages you to spend 
beyond your means.
 
 Consider buying used equipment, especially furniture, which takes 
longer to become obsolete. The more popular a piece of equipment, the 
more beneficial it is for you to purchase rather than lease: If many other 
businesses would be willing to buy the equipment, you’ll have an easier 
time unloading it if you ever want to sell it. Leasing may make more 
sense with oddball-type equipment that is more of a hassle and costly 
for you to unload after a short usage period.
 
✓ Don’t get carried away with technological and marketing gadgets. 
Many small-business owners we speak with spend all sorts of money 
on items such as laptops, smart phones, and continual roving Internet 
capability because they feel the need to be “competitive” and “current.” 
Don’t forget the virtues of picking up the phone or meeting in person — 
these forms of communication are much more personal ways of doing 
business.
 
Voice mail is one device that many small-business owners find worth spending 
money on. Voice mail sounds more professional than an answering machine 
and can handle simultaneous calls with ease. Best of all, voice mail can save 
you money on administrative help.
Bootstrap-equipping your office makes sense within certain limits (see 
“Bootstrapping,” earlier in this chapter). If customers come to you, of course, 
you don’t want a shabby-looking store or office. However, that doesn’t mean 
that you have to purchase the Rolls Royce equivalent of everything that you 
need for your office.
Accounting for the Money
One of the less glamorous aspects of running your own business is dealing 
with accounting. Unlike when you work for an employer, you must track 
your business’s income, expenses, and taxes (for you and your employees). 
Although you may be able to afford to hire others to help with these dreary 
tasks, you must know the inner workings of your business to keep control of 
your business, to stay out of trouble with the tax authorities, and to minimize 
your taxes. The following sections show you how to handle the accounting 
aspect of your business.

314
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Tax record keeping and payments
With revenue hopefully flowing into your business and expenses surely head-
ing out, you must keep records to help satisfy your tax obligations and to 
keep a handle on the financial status and success of your business. You can’t 
accurately complete the necessary tax forms for your business if you don’t 
properly track your income and expenses. And should the Canada Revenue 
Agency (CRA) audit you — the probability of being audited as a small-
business owner is about four times higher than when you’re an employee 
at a company — you’ll need to prove some or even all of your expenses and 
income.
 
In order to keep your sanity, and keep the CRA at bay, make sure that you do 
the following:
 
✓ Pay your taxes each quarter and on time. When you’re self-employed, 
you’re responsible for the accurate and timely filing of all taxes that you 
owe on your income on a quarterly basis. You must pay taxes by the 
15th of March, June, September, and December (unless the 15th falls on 
the weekend, in which case the payment is due the Monday that follows 
the 15th). To pay correctly, call the Canada Revenue Agency — you’ll 
find the number for your local office in the blue pages of your telephone 
book — and ask for Form T2WS3 (Calculating Quarterly Instalment 
Payments). This form includes an easy-to-use estimated tax worksheet 
to help you calculate your quarterly tax payments. Mark the due dates 
for your quarterly taxes on your calendar so you don’t forget!
 
 If you have employees, you need to withhold taxes from each paycheque 
they receive. You must use the money that you deduct from their 
paycheques to make timely payments to the Canada Revenue Agency. 
In addition to income tax, you need to withhold and send in Canada 
Pension Plan (or Quebec Pension Plan) and Employment Insurance pre-
miums. Pay these premiums immediately and never use the money to 
fund your business needs.
 
 Use a payroll service to ensure that your payments are made on time 
and correctly to all the different places that these tax filings need to go.
 
✓ Keep your business accounts separate from your personal accounts. 
The CRA knows that small-business owners, as a group, cheat more on 
their tax returns than do company employees. One way that dishonest 
entrepreneurs cheat is hiding business income and inflating business 
expenses. Thus, the CRA looks skeptically at business owners who use 
and commingle funds in personal chequing and credit card accounts for 
business transactions.

315
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
 
 Although you may find opening and maintaining separate business 
accounts bothersome, do so. And remember to pay for only legitimate 
business expenses through your business account. You’ll be thankful 
come tax preparation time to have separate records. Having separate 
records can also make the CRA easier to deal with if and when you’re 
audited.
 
✓ Keep good records of your business income and expenses. You can 
use file folders, software, or a shoebox to collect your business income 
and expense records, but just do it! When you need to file your annual 
return, you want to be able to find the documentation that allows you 
to figure your business income and expenses. For most people, the 
file folder system works best. If your business is small, one folder for 
income and one for your expenses will do. Computer software can help 
you with this drudgery as well. Because you must go through the hassle 
of entering the data, software is more useful with larger small businesses 
and in those businesses that process lots of cheques or expenses.
 
 Charging expenses on a credit card or writing a cheque can make the 
documentation for most businesses easier. These methods of payment 
leave a paper trail that simplifies the task of tallying up your expenses 
come tax time, and they make the CRA auditor less grumpy in the event 
that he audits you. (Just make sure that you don’t overspend, as many 
people do with credit cards!)
How to (legally) pay lower taxes
Every small business must spend money, and spending money in your busi-
ness holds the allure of lowering your tax bill. But don’t spend money on 
your business just for the sake of generating tax deductions. Spend your 
money to make the most of the tax breaks that you can legally take. The fol-
lowing are some examples of legal tax breaks:
 
✓ Appreciate depreciation. If you buy a computer, printer, furniture, or 
other equipment — called capital assets — you can’t simply deduct the 
price as a business expense. Instead, you have to spread the cost over a 
number of years. Each year, you’re allowed a deduction for the decrease 
in the value — the wear and tear — of the equipment (for example, com-
puters, desks, chairs — even that funky espresso machine) you use in 
your business. The income tax system refers to this as capital cost allow-
ance, or CCA.
 
 Normally, equipment for your business is depreciated over a number 
of years. With depreciation, you claim a yearly tax deduction for a por-
tion of the total purchase price of the equipment. Different types of 
equipment are grouped into different CCA classes, which have different 

316
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
allowable rates of depreciation. For instance, computer hardware can be 
depreciated at 30 percent annually, while furniture can be depreciated 
at 20 percent annually. Each year, your maximum deduction is equal to 
the allowable depreciation, or CCA rate, times the remaining undepreci-
ated value of the assets. In addition, in the year you purchase an asset, 
you can claim a deduction of only one-half of the regular CCA.
 
 For example, say you buy a new desk and chair for $4,000. Furniture 
can be depreciated at 20 percent, so you’d normally get a deduction for 
$800. However, in the first year, you can claim only half that, or $400. 
The next year you can claim a deduction worth 20 percent of the remain-
ing undepreciated value of $3,600 ($4,000 – $400), worth $720.
 
 You’re not required to claim the maximum allowable CCA each year. The 
undepreciated amount simply gets carried ahead to the next year. This 
can be a profitable strategy. Consider that in the early years of most 
businesses, profits are low. When your business is in a low tax bracket, 
the value of your deductions is low. If your business grows, you may 
come out ahead if you don’t claim some or all of the allowable deduc-
tion for some of your early-year big-ticket purchases, instead postponing 
claiming the expenses until your income — and therefore your marginal 
tax rate — is higher.
 
✓ Make the most of your auto deductions. If you use your car for busi-
ness, you can claim a deduction for a portion of the expenses, usually 
based on the kilometers you drive for business compared with the over-
all kilometres you put on your vehicle. You can also claim a deduction 
for the depreciation (capital cost allowance), again using the same per-
centage. However, the CRA puts a ceiling on the purchase cost you can 
use when doing your calculations. The maximum price you can use for 
calculating your CCA is $26,000 for cars bought in 1998 or 1999, $27,000 
for cars bought in 2000, and $30,000 for cars bought in 2001 through 
2009.
 
 If you lease a vehicle, the deduction you can claim is also limited, 
depending on the year you entered into the lease. For 1998–1999, the 
maximum monthly deductible lease amount is $650, for 2000 the maxi-
mum is $700, and for 2001–2009 it’s $800. Your actual allowable deduc-
tion may be less than this amount, because the CRA also uses a complex 
formula to come up with another ceiling. If you borrow money to pur-
chase a vehicle, the maximum interest expense allowed is $300 a month.
 
✓ Deduct travel, meal, and entertainment expenses. You can deduct 
these expenses as long as they’re for a bona fide business purpose. You 
need to be aware of certain restrictions, however. For instance, say you 
live in Winnipeg and fly to Honolulu for a week for a convention. You 
spend three days at a seminar for business purposes, and then the other 
four days snorkelling and getting skin cancer on Waikiki Beach. You 

317
 Chapter 14: Starting and Running a Small Business
can deduct the expenses for only the three days of your trip that you 
devoted to business. In most cases, however, you can deduct the full 
cost of getting there and back. Note that you’re allowed to deduct only 
the cost of a maximum of two conventions a year. Furthermore, the con-
vention has to be held in a location that’s part of the normal area of the 
sponsoring organization.
 
 You can only deduct 50 percent of meal and entertainment expenses, 
so don’t spend frivolously on business trips and think you can deduct 
everything. Even if you’re out of town at a convention, you can deduct 
only 50 percent of the cost of any meals.
 
 The Canada Revenue Agency doesn’t allow business deductions for club 
dues, such as for health, business, airport, or social clubs; or for enter-
tainment such as executive boxes at sports stadiums. If you entertain 
others for business purposes at a club, you can deduct the cost subject 
to the limitations noted above.
Keeping a Life and Perspective
David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, said, “You are likely to die not 
of starvation for opportunities, but of indigestion of opportunities.”
Most small businesses succeed in keeping their owners more than busy — in 
some cases, too busy. If you provide needed products or services at a fair 
price, customers will beat a path to your door. Your business will grow and 
be busier than what you can personally handle. You may need to start hiring 
people. We know small-business owners who work themselves into a frenzy 
and put in 70 or more hours a week.
If you enjoy your work so much so that it’s not really work and you end up 
putting in long hours because you enjoy it, terrific! But success in your com-
pany can cause you to put less energy into other important aspects of your 
life that perhaps don’t come as easily.
 
Although careers and business successes are important, don’t place these 
successes higher than fourth on your overall priority list. You can’t replace 
your health, family, and friends — but you can replace a job or a business.

▶ Examining franchises and multilevel marketing companies
▶ Checking out and negotiating a successful purchase
E
ach year, hundreds of thousands of small businesses change hands. This 
chapter is for those of you who want to run or invest in an existing small 
business but don’t want to start the business yourself. And of course, this 
chapter can show you how to make good money and have fun along the way!
Examining the Advantages of Buying
We don’t want to scare you off if you want to start a business. However, 
buying someone else’s business works better for some people than others. 
The following list reflects the main advantages of buying a business:
 
✓ You avoid start-up hassles and headaches. Starting a business from 
scratch requires dealing with many issues. In the early years, beyond 
formulating a business plan, you must also deal with a variety of issues, 
such as developing a marketing plan, finding customers, locating space, 
hiring employees, and incorporating. If you buy a good existing busi-
ness, you buy into an ongoing enterprise with customers, assets, and 
hopefully profits (although you still need to fix any problems the busi-
ness may have).
 
 Think about the learning curve for the type of business you’re con-
sidering purchasing. Buying an existing business makes more sense if 
the business is complicated. For example, purchasing a business that 
manufactures musical instruments makes more sense than purchasing a 
plumbing business that requires plumbing know-how and a few tools to 

320
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
start up. Unless you’ve built musical instruments before and understand 
the intricacies of the production process, starting such a business from 
scratch is quite risky and perhaps foolhardy. (However, purchasing an 
existing plumbing business may still make sense if, for example, you 
don’t want to build a stable of customers from scratch.)
 
✓ You reduce risk. Although investing in something with a solid track 
record is still far from a sure thing, your risk may be significantly lower 
than the risk involved in a start-up. After a business has an operating 
history and offers a product or service with a demonstrated market, 
some of the risk in the company is removed. Looking at historic financial 
statements also helps you make more accurate financial forecasts than 
you could make with a start-up venture.
 
✓ You enhance your ability to attract investor or lender money. You 
should have less difficulty raising money from investors and lenders for 
your existing business than with a start-up. Attracting most investors to 
something that’s more than an idea is easier. And for the amount that 
they invest, investors demand a smaller piece of an existing business 
than they would with an investment in an idea.
 
✓ You want to enter a business where buying an existing business is 
your only ticket in. You can enter some businesses — such as bottlers 
or car dealerships — only through your purchase of a business that 
already exists.
 
✓ You can find businesses where you can add value. Some entrepreneurs 
who start businesses don’t see the potential for growth or don’t want 
to grow their business — they may be burned out, content with their 
current profit, or simply ready to retire. Finding businesses where the 
potential exists to improve operating efficiency and to expand into new 
markets isn’t too hard. Relative to investing in stocks or real estate (see 
Parts II and III), finding small companies that are undervalued relative to 
the potential that they can offer is easier for a business-minded person.
 
 Just because you think you see potential to improve a business, don’t 
pay a high price based on your high expectations. You can be wrong — 
you may be looking at the business through rose-coloured glasses. Even 
if you’re correct about the potential, don’t pay the current owner for the 
hard work and ingenuity you’ll bring to the business if you purchase it. 
Offer a fair price based on the value of the business now — we explain 
how to figure this value in the section “Evaluating a Small Business,” 
later in this chapter.
Understanding the Drawbacks of Buying
Just as everyone doesn’t enjoy running or cooking, some people don’t enjoy 
the negatives that come with buying an existing business. If the following 
issues don’t turn you off, purchasing an existing business may be right for you:

321
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
 
✓ You buy the baggage. When you buy an existing business, the bad 
comes with the good, and all businesses include their share of the 
bad. The business may employ problem employees, for example, or it 
may have a less-than-stellar reputation in the marketplace. Even if the 
employees are good, they and the company culture may not mesh with 
where you want to take the company in the future.
 
 Do you have the ability to motivate people to change — or to fire them 
if they don’t? Do you have the patience to work at improving the compa-
ny’s products and reputation? You need these types of skills and traits 
to run and add value to a company. Some people enjoy and thrive on 
such challenges, and others find such pressures hard to swallow. Think 
back on your other work experiences for information about what chal-
lenges you’ve tackled and how you felt about them.
 
✓ You need to do a lot of inspection. If you think that buying a company 
is easier than starting one, think again. You must know what you’re 
buying before you buy. So you need to do a thorough inspection, per-
form due diligence, kick the tires, or whatever you want to call it. For 
example, you need to rip apart financial statements to ascertain whether 
the company is really as profitable as it appears and to determine its 
financial health.
 
 After you close the deal and the cheques and/or money are transferred, 
you can’t change your mind. Unless a seller commits fraud or lies (which 
is difficult and costly for a buyer to prove legally), it’s “buyer beware” 
about the quality of the business you’re buying. In “Evaluating a Small 
Business,” later in this chapter, we cover the homework you need to do 
before you buy.
 
✓ You need more capital. Existing businesses have value, which is why 
you generally need more money to buy a business than to start one. If 
you’re short of cash, starting a company is generally a lower-cost path.
 
✓ Lower risk means lower returns. If you purchase a good business and 
run it well, you can make decent money. In some cases, you can make 
a lot of money. But you generally have less upside and potential for hit-
ting it really big than with a business you start. Those who have built 
the greatest wealth from small businesses are generally those who have 
started them rather than those who bought existing ones.
 
✓ You don’t get the satisfaction of creating a business. Whether for their 
ego or their psyche, entrepreneurs who build their own businesses get a 
different experience than those who buy someone else’s enterprise. You 
can make your mark on a business you buy, but doing so takes a number 
of years. Even then, the business is never completely your own creation.

322
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Prerequisites to Buying a Business
Not everyone is cut out to succeed when buying an existing business. Even if 
you have sufficient funds for the purchase, you may be blind to a whole host 
of problems and pitfalls and can end up losing your entire investment.
Conversely, some people with little money for buying a business succeed 
wildly. You can purchase a good small business with little or, in rare cases, 
no money down. So what, then, are the traits common to people who suc-
cessfully buy and operate an existing small business?
Business experience
First, you should have business experience and background. If you were 
an economics or business major in university and you took accounting and 
other quantitatively oriented courses, you’re off to a good start.
 
Even better than academic learning is work experience in the type of business 
that you want to buy. If you want to run a restaurant, go work in one. Consider 
the experience as paid on-the-job training for running your own restaurant.
If you’ve worked as a consultant on business management issues with a vari-
ety of industries, you also have a good background. However, the danger 
in having done only consulting is that you’re usually not on the front lines, 
where most of the serious operational business issues arise.
Should none of the previous examples apply to you, we won’t say that 
you’re doomed to fail if you buy a business, but we will say that the odds 
are against you.
 
If you don’t have business experience, you’ll likely do far better in your first 
business venture after some remedial work. Get some hands-on experience, 
which is more valuable than any degree or credential you can earn through 
course work. There’s no substitute for the real-life experiences of marketing 
to and interacting with customers, grappling with financial statements, deal-
ing with competitive threats, and doing the business of business. However, we 
don’t endorse skipping academic course work. You may, in fact, be required 
to get a credential to be able to do the work you want to do. If you don’t need 
a specific credential, taking selected courses and reading good business books 
(we recommend some in Chapter 18) can boost your knowledge.

323
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
Financial resources
To purchase a business, as with real estate, you need to make a down pay-
ment on the purchase price. In most cases, you must put down 25 to 30 
percent. Bankers and business sellers who make loans to business buyers 
normally require such down payments to protect their loan. Small-business 
buyers who make sizable down payments are less likely to walk away from a 
loan obligation if the business gets into financial trouble.
 
If you lack sufficient capital for a down payment, try asking family or friends to 
invest. You can also set your sights on a less expensive business or seek busi-
ness owners willing to accept a smaller down payment. If you can find a busi-
ness for sale whose owner wants less than 20 percent down, you may be on 
to something good. Be careful, though, because an owner who accepts such 
a small down payment may have a difficult time selling because of problems 
inherent in the business or because the business is overpriced.
Sometimes you can purchase existing small businesses with a loan from the 
selling owner. Also, check for loans with banks or credit unions in your area 
that specialize in small-business loans. (See Chapter 14 for other financing

Focusing Your Search 
for a Business to Buy
Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky, finding a good business to buy takes a 
great deal of time. If you spend time outside of your work hours, finding a 
quality business right for you to buy can easily take a year or two. Even if you 
can afford to look full time, finding and closing on a business can still take 
you many months.
 
Above all else, it pays to be persistent, patient, and willing to spend time 
on things that don’t lead immediately to results. You must be willing to sort 
through some rubbish. If you require immediate gratification in terms of com-
pleting a deal, you can make yourself miserable in your search or rush into a 
bad deal.
You’re going to end up spinning your wheels (and likely end up with the 
wrong type of business for yourself) unless you set some boundaries for your 
business search. You don’t need to be rigid or to precisely define every detail 
of the business you want to purchase, but you do need to set some param-
eters so you can start laying the groundwork to purchase.

Each person has unique shopping criteria. The following list exemplifies some 
useful ones to narrow your search:
 
✓ Size/purchase price: The money you have available to invest in a busi-
ness determines the size of business that you can afford. As a rough 
rule, figure that you can afford to pay a purchase price of about three 
times the amount of cash you have earmarked for the business. For 
example, if you have $50,000 in the till, you should look at buying a busi-
ness for about $150,000. Because many business sellers overprice their 
businesses, you can probably look at businesses listed at a price above 
$150,000, perhaps as high as $200,000.
 
✓ Location: If you’re already rooted and don’t want to move or deal with 
a long commute, the business’s location further narrows the field. 
Although you may be willing to look at a broader territory, maybe even 
nationally if you’re willing to relocate, evaluating businesses long-
distance is difficult and costly. Unless you want a highly specialized 
type of company, try to keep your business search local.
 
✓ Industry: Industry-specific expertise you want to use in the business you 
buy can help whittle the pool of businesses down further. If you don’t 
have industry-specific expertise, we highly recommend that you focus 
on some specific niches in industries that interest you or that you know 
something about. Focusing on an industry helps you conduct a more 
thorough search and find higher-quality companies. The industry knowl-
edge you accumulate in your search process can pay big dividends 
during your years of ownership in the business.
 
 If you have a hard time brainstorming about specific industries, use this 
trick to jump-start your creativity — take a walk through the Yellow 
Pages! Many business types known to exist in your area are listed 
alphabetically. You also may want to buy a business in a sector that is 
experiencing fast growth so that you, too, can ride the wave. Check out 
Profit magazine’s annual list of Canada’s 100 fastest-growing companies. 
In addition, the magazine compiles a list of 50 of the country’s fastest-
growing start-ups, ranked by their two-year growth rate. Also, look at 
Inc. magazine’s annual Inc. 5,000 list of the fastest-growing private com-
panies in the United States.
 
✓ Opportunity to add value: Some buyers want to purchase a business 
with untapped opportunities or problems that need fixing. As with real 
estate, however, many people are happier leaving the fixer-uppers to the 
contractors. Some businesses without major problems can offer signifi-
cant untapped potential.
After you define your shopping criteria, you’re ready to go to the market-
place of businesses for sale. We recommend that you type up your criteria 
on a single page so you can hand it to others who may put you in touch with 

325
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
businesses for sale. The following sections give you the best techniques for 
identifying solid businesses that meet your needs.
Perusing publications
If you’re focused on specific industry sectors, you may be surprised to learn 
that all sorts of specialty newsletters and magazines are out there. Just 
think of the fun you can have reading publications such as Canadian Plastics, 
Alternative Energy Retailer, Welding Canada, Specialty Foods Merchandising, 
Coal Mining Newsletter, or Gas Turbine World! Specialty publications not only 
get you into the thick of an industry, they also advertise businesses for sale 
or business brokers who work in the industry.
 
Conducting literature searches of general interest business publications can 
help you identify articles on your industry of interest. The Reader’s Guide to 
Periodicals and online computer searches can help you find the articles. Web 
sites worth examining include Industry Canada’s (www.gc.ca), the federal 
government’s site for entrepreneurs (www.canadabusiness.ca), as well as 
Profit magazine’s Web site (www.canadianbusiness.com).
A useful U.S. reference publication that you can find in public libraries with 
decent business sections is a two-volume set titled Small Business Sourcebook 
(Gale). Organized alphabetically by industry, this reference contains listings 
of publications, trade associations, and other information sources.
Networking with advisers
 
Speak with accountants, lawyers, bankers, and business consultants who 
specialize in working with small businesses. These advisers are sometimes 
the first to hear of a small-business owner’s desire to sell. Advisers may also 
suggest good businesses that aren’t for sale but whose owners may consider 
selling (see the next section).
Knocking on some doors
Some business owners who haven’t listed their businesses for sale may be 
thinking about selling, so if you approach enough businesses that inter-
est you, you may find some of these not-yet-on-the-market businesses with 
owners interested in selling. You can increase the possibility of finding your 
desired business, and you may get a good deal on such a business because 

326
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
you can negotiate with the seller from the beneficial position of not having to 
compete with other potential buyers.
 
Instead of calling on the phone or literally knocking on the business’s door, 
start your communications by mail. Sending a concise letter of introduction 
explaining what kind of business you’re looking for and what a wonderful 
person you are demonstrates that you’re investing some time in this endeav-
our. Follow up with a call a week or so after you send the letter.
Working with business brokers
Numerous small businesses for sale list their enterprises through business 
brokers. Just as a real estate agent makes a living selling real estate, a busi-
ness broker makes a living selling businesses.
Business brokers generally sell smaller small businesses — those with less 
than $1 million in annual sales. These businesses tend to be family-owned or 
sole proprietorships, such as restaurants, dry cleaners, other retailers, and 
service firms. About half of such small businesses are sold through brokers. 
Most business brokerage firms sell different types of businesses. Some firms, 
however, specialize in one industry or a few industries.
One advantage of working with brokers to buy a business is that a broker 
can expose you to other businesses you may not have considered (a dough-
nut shop, for example, instead of a restaurant). Brokers can also share their 
knowledge with you — like the fact that you need to get up at 4 a.m. to make 
doughnuts. Still want to buy a doughnut shop?
 
The pitfalls of working with brokers are numerous:
 
✓ Commission: Brokers aren’t your business advisers; they’re salespeople. 
That fact doesn’t make them corrupt or dishonest, but it does mean that 
their interests aren’t aligned with yours. Their goal is to do a deal and 
do the deal soon. And the more you pay for your business, the more 
they make. Business brokers typically get paid 10 to 12 percent of the 
sales price of the business. Technically, the seller pays this fee, but as 
with real estate deals done through brokers, the buyer actually pays. 
Remember, if a broker isn’t involved, the seller can sell for a lower price 
and still clear more money, and the buyer is better off, too.
 
✓ Undesirable businesses: Problem businesses are everywhere, but a fair 
number end up with brokers when the owners encounter trouble selling 
on their own.

327
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
 
✓ Packaging: This problem relates to the preceding two. Brokers help not-
so-hot businesses look better than they really are. Doing so may involve 
lying, but more typically, it involves stretching the truth, omitting nega-
tives, and hyping potential. (Owners who sell their business themselves 
may do these things as well.)
 
 You (and your advisers) need to perform the due diligence on a busi-
ness that you may buy. Never, ever trust or use the selling package that 
a broker prepares for a business as your sole source of information. 
Remember: Brokers, as well as sellers, have been known to stretch the 
truth, lie, and commit fraud.
 
✓ Access to limited inventory: Unlike a real estate agent (who can access 
all homes listed with brokers for sale in an area through a shared listing 
service), a business broker can generally tell you only about his office’s 
listings. (Confidentiality is an issue because a shared listing service 
increases the number of people who can find out that a business is for 
sale and the particulars of the sale. This may cause some customers 
to find another company to do business with and may lead some key 
employees to leave as well.)
 
 If you want to work with a business broker, use more than one. Working 
with a larger business brokerage firm or one that specializes in listing 
the type of business you’re looking for can maximize the number of pos-
sible prospects you see.
 
✓ Few licensing requirements: The business brokerage field isn’t tightly 
regulated. The majority of regions have no requirements — anyone can 
hang out a shingle and work as a business broker. Some regions allow 
those with investment dealer licences to operate as business brokers, 
whereas others require real estate licenses.
You can find business brokers in the Yellow Pages under “Business Brokers.” 
Ads for businesses for sale may lead you to a broker as well. You can also 
ask tax, legal, and business consultants for names of good brokers they may 
know. If you find a broker you think you’d like to work with, check references 
from other buyers who have worked with the broker. Be sure that the broker 
works full time and has solid experience. Some business brokers dabble in it 
part time and make a living in other ways.
 
Ask the broker you’re interested in for the names of several buyers of similar 
businesses whom they’ve worked with over the past six months. By narrow-
ing the field to only your particular business interest, the broker can’t just 
refer you to the three best deals of his career. Also, check whether anyone has 
filed complaints against the brokerage with the local Better Business Bureau 
(although the BBB favours member companies more and is less likely to enter-
tain and retain complaints against members) and provincial regulatory depart-
ments (consumer and commercial relations, attorney general, and so on) that 
oversee business brokers.

Considering a Franchise or Multilevel 
Marketing Company
Among the types of businesses that you may buy are franchises and multi-
level marketing companies. Both of these types of businesses offer more of a 
prepackaged and defined system for running a business. Although both types 
may be worth your exploration, significant pitfalls can trip you up, especially 
with multilevel marketing companies.
Finding a franchise
Purchasing a good franchise can be your ticket into the world of small-
business ownership. Some companies expand their locations through selling 
replicas, or franchises, of their business. When you purchase a franchise, you 
buy the local rights for a specified geographic territory to sell the company’s 
products or services under the company’s name and to use the company’s 
system of operation. In addition to an upfront franchisee fee, franchisers also 
typically charge an ongoing royalty.
Franchising makes up a huge part of the business world. Companies that 
franchise — such as McDonald’s, Canadian Tire, Pizza Hut, H&R Block, Grand 
& Toy, Midas Muffler, Second Cup, Century 21 Real Estate, Holiday Inn, Avis, 
Subway, and Foot Locker — account for more than US$1 trillion in sales glob-
ally each year.
Franchise advantages
When you purchase a new franchise, you don’t already have customers — 
just like starting a business, you must find them, although the parent com-
pany should have a track record and multiple locations with customers. (You 
can also purchase existing franchises from owners who want to sell.)
So why would you want to pay a good chunk of money to buy a business 
without customers?
 
✓ Proven business: A company that has been in business for a number of 
years and has successful franchisees proves the demand for the com-
pany’s products and services and shows that the company’s system for 
providing those products and services works. The company has worked 
out the bugs and hopefully solved common problems. As a franchise 
owner, you benefit from and share in the experience that the parent 
company has gained over the years.

329
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
 
✓ Name-brand recognition: Some consumers recognize the company 
name of a larger and successful franchise company and may be more 
inclined to purchase its products and services. Some consumers feel 
more comfortable getting a muffler job done at franchiser Midas Muffler 
rather than hunting around and calling Discount Muffler World or 
Manny’s Muffler Bazaar from a yellow pages listing. The comfort that 
comes from dealing with Midas may stem from the influence of adver-
tisements, recommendations of friends, or your own familiarity with 
Midas’s services, perhaps in another part of the country. Most free-
standing small businesses for sale in a community lack name-brand 
recognition.
 
✓ Centralized purchasing power: You would hope and expect that Midas, 
as a corporation made up of hundreds of locations, buys mufflers at a 
low price — volume purchasing generally leads to bigger discounts. In 
addition to possibly saving franchisees money on supplies, the parent 
company can also take the hassle out of figuring out where and how to 
purchase supplies. Again, most unattached small businesses that you 
could buy won’t offer this advantage, although quality business associa-
tions can provide some of these benefits.
Franchise pitfalls
 
As with purchasing other small businesses, pitfalls abound in buying a fran-
chise. Franchises aren’t for everyone. Here are some common problems that 
may cause you to reconsider buying a franchise:
 
✓ You’re not the franchise type. When you buy a franchise, you buy into 
an established system. People who like structure and following estab-
lished rules and systems adapt more easily to the franchise life. But 
if you’re the creative sort who likes to experiment and change things, 
you may be an unhappy franchisee. Unlike starting your own business, 
where you can get into the game without investing lots of your time and 
money, buying a franchise that you end up not enjoying can make for an 
expensive learning experience.
 
✓ You may be locked in to buying overpriced supplies. Centralized, 
bulk purchasing through the corporate headquarters supposedly saves 
franchisees time and money on supplies and other expenditures. Some 
franchisers, however, take advantage of franchisees through large mark-
ups on proprietary items that franchisees must buy from the franchisers.
 
✓ The franchise is unproven. If the company’s concept hasn’t stood the 
test of time, don’t make yourself a guinea pig. Some franchisers show 
more interest in simply selling franchises to collect the upfront franchise 
money. Reputable franchisers want to help their franchisees succeed so 
they can collect an ongoing royalty from the franchisees’ sales.

330
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
 
✓ The franchise is a pyramid scheme. Unscrupulous, short-term-focused 
business owners sometimes attempt to franchise their businesses and 
sell as many franchises as they can as quickly as possible. Some push 
their franchisees to sell franchises. The business soon focuses on sell-
ing franchises rather than operating a business that sells a product or 
service well. In rare cases, franchisers engage in fraud and sell next to 
nothing, except the hopes of getting rich quick.
Evaluating a franchise
Make sure that you do plenty of homework before you agree to buy a fran-
chise. You may be tempted to cut corners in reviewing a franchise from a 
long-established company. Don’t. You may not be right for the specific fran-
chise, or perhaps the “successful” company has mostly been good at keeping 
problems under wraps.
In “Evaluating a Small Business,” later in this chapter, we explain the home-
work you should complete prior to buying an existing business. Read that 
section, especially if you want to purchase an existing franchise from another 
franchisee.
Work-from-home “opportunities”
“We made $18,269.56 in just 21/2 weeks! 
Remarkable, home-based business! We do 
over 90 percent of the work for you! Free info: 
800-555-8975.”
“You can be earning $4,000 to $10,000 each 
month in less than 30 days! We’ll even help you 
hire agents to do the work for you . . . FREE!”
You can find lots of ad copy like this, especially 
in magazines that small-business owners and 
wannabe small-business owners read. In most 
cases, these ads come from grossly overhyped 
multilevel marketing companies. In other ads, no 
legitimate company exists; instead, a person (or 
two or three) simply tries to sell you some “infor-
mation” that explains the business opportunity. 
This information may cost several hundred 
dollars or more. Such packages end up being 
worthless marketing propaganda and rarely 
provide useful information that you couldn’t find 
at a far lower cost or no cost at all.
Never buy into anything promoted in these sorts 
of ads that companies (or people) pitch to you 
through the mail or over the phone.

331
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
Considering a multilevel 
marketing company
 
A twist, and in most cases a bad one, on the franchising idea is multilevel 
marketing (MLM) companies. Sometimes known as network companies, MLMs 
can be thought of as a poor person’s franchise. We know dozens of people 
who have been sorely disappointed with the money and time they’ve spent 
on MLMs.
 
In companies that use multilevel marketing, representatives who work as inde-
pendent contractors solicit customers as well as recruit new representatives, 
known in the industry as your downline. For those weary of traditional jobs, 
the appeal of multilevel marketing is obvious. You can work at home, part 
time if you want. You have no employees. You don’t need any experience. Yet 
you’re told you can still make big bucks ($10,000, $25,000, $50,000, or more 
per month). If your parents raised you right, however, you should be skeptical 
of deals like these.
A big problem to watch out for is the business equivalent of the pyramid 
scheme — businesses that exist to sign up other people. Beware MLM com-
panies that advocate that you “Sell directly to those that you have direct 
influence over. The system works great because you don’t need to resell 
month after month. It’s an opportunity for anybody — it’s up to them how 
much work they want to put into it.”
 
Any MLM examination should start with the company’s product or service. 
How does its product or service stack up to the competition on price and 
quality? Contact the Better Business Bureau in the city where the MLM com-
pany is headquartered to see what kinds of complaints are on file.
 
The bottom line on any network marketing “opportunity” is to remember that 
it’s a job. No company is going to pay you a lot of money for little work. As 
with any other small-business venture, if you hope to earn a decent income, 
multilevel marketing opportunities require at least three to five years of low 
income to build up your business. Most people who pay to buy into networks 
make little money, and many quit and move on.
Also, think twice before you sign up relatives, friends, and co-workers — 
often the first people whom network marketers encourage you to sell to. A 
danger in doing business with those people whom you have influence over is 
that you put your reputation and integrity on the line. You could be putting 
your friendships and family relations on the line as well.

332
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
 
Do your homework and remember that due diligence requires digging for facts 
and talking to people who don’t have a bias or reason to sell to you. Do the 
same homework that we recommend for franchises in the “Evaluating a Small 
Business” section, later in this chapter. Be skeptical of multilevel marketing 
systems, unless the company has a long track record and many people who 
are happy. Assume that an MLM company isn’t worth pursuing until your 
extensive due diligence proves otherwise.
Quality multilevel marketing companies make sense for people who really 
believe in and want to sell a particular product or service and don’t want 
to or can’t tie up a lot of money buying a franchise or other business. Just 
remember to check out the MLM company, and realize that you won’t get 
rich in a hurry, or probably ever.
Quality multilevel marketing companies 
are the exception
A number of network companies have achieved 
success over the years. Amway, Herbalife, 
and Mary Kay have stood the test of time and 
achieved significant size. Amway founders 
Richard De Vos and Jay Van Andel achieved 
multibillionaire status.
Not all multilevel companies are created equal, 
and few are worth a look. However, Mary 
Kay, which sells primarily makeup and skin 
care products, is an example of a successful 
network company with a 30-plus year history. 
Mary Kay has hundreds of thousands of sales 
representatives and does business worldwide. 
Although not shy about the decent money 
that its more successful salespeople make, 
Mary Kay doesn’t hype the income potential. 
According to the company, the top 50 percent of 
local Canadian sales directors earn anywhere 
from under $20,000 to over $100,000 per year, 
but this income comes after many years of hard 
work. Mary Kay rewards top sellers with gifts, 
such as the famous pink Cadillac.
The ingredients for Mary Kay’s success include 
competitive pricing, personal attention, and 
social interaction, which many stores don’t or 
can’t offer their customers. “We make shop-
ping and life fun . . . we make people look and 
feel good,” says Mary Gentry, one of Mary 
Kay’s sales directors.
Mary Kay encourages prospective Mary Kay 
reps to try the products first and then host a 
group before they sign up and fork over the 
$150 to purchase a showcase of items to sell. To 
maximize sales, the company encourages Mary 
Kay representatives to keep a ready inventory 
because customers tend to buy more when 
products are immediately available. If reps want 
out of the business, they can sell their inventory 
back to the company at 90 cents on the dollar 
originally paid, a good sign that the company 
stands behind its product.

333
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
Evaluating a Small Business
If you put in many hours, you may eventually come across a business that 
interests and intrigues you so much that you consider purchasing it. As with 
purchasing a piece of real estate, major hurdles stand between you and own-
ership of the business. You need to inspect what you want to buy, negotiate a 
deal, and finalize a contract — done correctly, these processes take a lot 
of time.
Doing due diligence
The Canadian legal system presumes a person is innocent until a court finds 
that person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When you purchase a busi-
ness, however, you must assume that the selling business owner is guilty of 
making the business appear better than what it is (and possibly lying) until 
you prove otherwise.
We don’t want to sound cynical, but a business owner can use more than a 
few tricks to make a business look more profitable, financially healthier, and 
more desirable than it really is. You can’t decide how much inspection or due 
diligence to conduct on a business based on your gut-level feeling.
 
Because you can’t guess what hidden surprises exist in a business, you must 
dig for them. Until you prove to yourself beyond a reasonable doubt that 
these surprises don’t exist, don’t go through with a business purchase.
When you find a business that you think you want to purchase, you abso-
lutely, positively must do your homework before you buy. However, just as 
with purchasing a home, you don’t want to expend buckets of money and 
time on detailed inspections until you can reach an agreement with the seller. 
What if you deal with a seller who is unrealistic about what the business is 
worth? You need to perform the most serious, time-consuming, and costly 
due diligence after you have an accepted offer to purchase a business. Make 
such inspections a contingency in your purchase contract.
Ultimately, if you’re going to buy a business, you need to follow a plan simi-
lar to, but likely shorter than, the business plan we present in Chapter 13. 
Addressing such issues in a plan goes a long way toward helping you perform 
your due diligence.
 
Following are some additional questions you need to answer about a business 
you’re contemplating purchasing. (Address as many of the questions as pos-
sible before you make your offer.)

334
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
 
✓ Why is the owner selling? Ask the owner or the owner’s advisers why 
the owner wants to sell and why now. The answers may shed insight 
on the owner’s motivations and need to sell. Some owners want to bail 
when they see things getting worse.
 
✓ What is the value of the assets you want to buy? This value includes 
not only equipment but also “soft” assets, such as the firm’s name and 
reputation with customers and suppliers, customer lists, patents, and so 
on. Interview key employees, customers, suppliers, advisers, and com-
petitors. Ask key customers and key employees whether they would still 
be loyal to the business if you took it over.
 
✓ What do the financial statements reveal? Search for the same things 
that you would look for in a company whose stock you’re consider-
ing purchasing. (See Chapter 6 for how to read financial statements 
and what to look for.) Don’t take the financial statements at face value 
simply because they’re audited. The accountant who did the audit may 
be incompetent or chummy with the seller.
 
 One way to check for shenanigans is to ask the seller for a copy of 
the business’s tax returns. Owners are more likely to try to minimize 
reported revenue and maximize expenses on their tax return to keep 
from paying more tax. After you have an accepted purchase offer, 
Questioning profits
Don’t blindly take the profit from the bottom 
line of a business’s financial statement as the 
gospel. As part of your due diligence, ask a tax 
adviser to perform an audit after you negotiate 
a deal.
Even if the financial statements of a business 
are accurate, you (and your tax adviser) must 
still look for subtle problems that can make the 
profits of the business appear better than they 
truly are. The issues that we tell you to look 
for in Chapter 6, when you analyze the finan-
cial statements of public companies that issue 
stock, also apply to evaluating the financial 
statements of small companies.
If necessary, factor out one-time events from 
the profit analysis. For example, if the business 
last year received an unusually large order that 
is unlikely to be repeated and hasn’t been the 
norm in the past, subtract this amount from the 
profitability analysis. Also, examine the owner’s 
salary to see if it’s low for the field. Owners can 
reduce their draw to a minimum or pay family 
members less than fair market salaries to pump 
up the profitability of their company in the years 
before they sell.
Also examine whether the rent or mortgage 
expense may change when you buy the busi-
ness. Consider what will happen to profits when 
you factor in your expected rent or mortgage 
costs.

335
 Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
ask a tax adviser experienced in such matters to do an audit (see the 
“Questioning profits” sidebar in this chapter for more information).
 
✓ If the company leases its space, what does the lease contract say? A 
soon-to-expire lease at a low rate can ruin a business’s profit margins. 
With a retail business, the ability to maintain a good location is also 
vital. Check comparables — that is, what other similar locations lease 
for — to see whether the current lease rate is fair, and talk to the build-
ing owner to discover his plans for the building. Ask for and review (with 
the help of a legal adviser) the current owner’s lease contract.
 
✓ What liabilities, including those that may be hidden “off” the balance 
sheet, are you buying with a business? Limit liabilities, such as environ-
mental contaminations, through a contract. Conduct legal searches for 
liens, litigation, and tax problems.
 
✓ What does a background check turn up on the owners and key 
employees? Do they have good business experience, or do they have 
criminal records and a trail of unpaid debts?
Determining a business’s value
 
After you find what you think is a good business and do your homework, 
you’re ready to make an offer. Negotiating takes time and patience. Unless 
you’re legally savvy, find a lawyer who focuses her practice on small-business 
dealings. Have a lawyer review and work with your contract. Also consider 
obtaining input from a qualified tax adviser.
Good advisers can help you inspect what you’re buying and look for red flags 
in the company’s financial statements. Advisers can also help structure the 
purchase to protect what you’re buying and to gain maximum tax benefits. If 
you work with a business broker, use a lawyer and accountant as well.
 
The price a business is listed for is often in excess — sometimes grossly so — 
of the business’s true worth. Look at what similar businesses have sold for 
as a starting point for valuing a business you want to buy. Smart homebuyers 
or real estate investors look at comparable properties when they’re ready to 
make an offer.
 
When you look at sales of comparable businesses, figure the multiple of earn-
ings these businesses sold for. In Chapter 5, we discuss how the price/earnings 
ratio works for evaluating the value of larger, publicly traded companies. 
Because they’re less well established and riskier from an investment stand-
point, small, privately held businesses sell for a lower multiple of earnings 
than comparable, but larger, companies.

336
Part IV: Savouring Small Business 
Some advisers and business brokers advocate using a multiple of revenue to 
determine the value of a business. Revenue is a poor proxy for profitability: 
Two businesses in the same field can have identical revenue yet quite differ-
ent profitability because of how well they’re run, the pricing of their products 
and services, and the types of customers they attract.
In addition to looking at the sales price of other businesses relative to earn-
ings, you can also consider the value of a company’s assets. The so-called 
book value of a company’s assets is what the assets are worth per the compa-
ny’s balance sheet. Check these figures to ensure that their asset values are 
correct. Another, more conservative way to value such assets is to consider 
the liquidation/replacement cost.

Internet site, using software, watching television, or listen-
ing to the radio, you need to know how to evaluate what’s 
worth considering and what to ignore.

▶ Overcoming information and advice overload
▶ Evaluating investing resources
I
n the past, finding financial information was much simpler, largely because 
the available resources were limited. You could subscribe to publications 
such as Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine for general money issues and 
a local big-city newspaper for daily stock prices. The hard-core investor had 
The Globe and Mail with its “Report on Business,” the National Post with its 
“Financial Post” section, or The Wall Street Journal delivered daily.
Times have changed, though. Today’s investor faces information overload. 
Radio, television, magazines, newspapers, books, the Internet, family, friends, 
neighbours, and cabdrivers — everywhere you turn, someone is offering 
investing opinions, tips, and advice. You can’t pick up a newspaper or maga-
zine or turn on the television or radio without bumping into articles, stories, 
segments, and entire programs devoted to investment issues.
Chosen wisely, the best investing resources can further your investment 
knowledge and enable you to make better decisions. Because investment 
information and advice is so widespread, and constantly growing, know-
ing how to sift through it is just as important as finding out what the best 
resources are today. Throughout the rest of the book, we name the best 
investment resources that we’re familiar with, but in this chapter, we explain 
how you can separate the good from the mediocre and awful.
Dealing with Information Overload
Early in the year 2000, one of Eric’s clients, Roseanne, called him in a near 
panic. “Eric, I’m not satisfied with my investments. Why are so many of my 
friends doubling and tripling their money in technology stocks, and my 

340
Part V: Investing Resources 
mutual funds are going nowhere? Everywhere I turn, people are talking about 
these high-growth companies. I want my piece of the pie, too!” Eric explained 
to her that many of her diversified mutual funds held some technology 
stocks as well as stocks in many other industries. He also reminded her that 
because she was nearing 50 years of age, she had a healthy helping of bonds 
in her portfolio as well.
She urged Eric to put her money in some technology stocks and technology-
focused funds, but he stood his ground. He further encouraged her to read 
this book wherein we highlighted technology stocks as a bubble waiting to 
burst (see Chapter 5). We’re glad to say that Roseanne followed Eric’s advice, 
and now, years later, she is, too. During the severe stock market decline 
in the early 2000s, technology stocks got clobbered, but other market seg-
ments (such as bonds and value-oriented stocks) actually increased in value. 
(Even by the late 2000s, tech stocks were nowhere near attaining their prior 
levels — the NASDAQ index has been trading at half or less than the highs it 
reached in 2000.)
A major reason that so many people were talking about making money with 
technology stocks was that so many media outlets (radio, television, Web 
sites, and so on) were talking about these investments and other personal 
money management issues around the clock. Why is everybody in the media 
and publishing world putting out investing information? Has money become 
that much more complicated over the years? Are there simply more media 
and publishing executives who want to help us?
The following list explains some of the reasons that investing has become 
such a hot topic:
 
✓ Communications options are expanding. Over the past generation, the 
number of television channels has mushroomed as a result of cable tele-
vision. Flip through your cable channels at any hour of the day, and you 
see infomercials that promise to make you a real estate tycoon or stock 
market day trader in your spare time. The explosion of the Internet has 
introduced a whole new medium. Now, at a relatively low cost, anybody 
can publish a Web page.
 
 The accessibility of these communications media allows just about 
anyone with an animated personality and a few bucks to appear to be an 
expert. These newer communications options are primarily structured 
around selling advertising rather than offering quality content.
 
✓ Economic change breeds uncertainty. Global competition and tech-
nological advances are causing most industries to undergo dramatic 
changes in much shorter periods of time. Although jobs are relatively 

341
 Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources
plentiful for many with particular training and skills, fear of job loss and 
financial instability runs high. Economic change and widespread cyni-
cism about the ability of the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension 
Plan to provide a reasonable retirement income to baby boomers has 
also caused many to seek investment guidance.
 
✓ Investment choices and responsibilities are increasing. More 
employees are forced to take responsibility for saving money for their 
retirement and deciding how to invest that money. In the past, more 
employers offered pension plans. In these plans, the employer set aside 
money on behalf of employees and retained a pension manager who 
decided how to invest it. All the employees had to do was learn the level 
of benefits that they had earned and when they could begin drawing a 
monthly cheque.
 
 With today’s retirement plans, such as RRSPs and companies’ money-
purchase pension plans, employees need to educate themselves about 
how much money they need to save and how to invest it. In addition to 
mastering retirement planning and investment allocation, individuals 
face a dizzying number of financial products, such as the tens of thou-
sands of mutual funds that are on the market.
 
✓ Our society is too money focused. The pages of tabloid papers and 
magazines are filled with highly paid movie and sports celebrities and 
wealthy corporate executives. Other warning signs abound for a society 
that too often cares more about money than people and human relation-
ships. Some people view hiring someone else to raise their children as 
a luxury of wealth. Others spend tens of thousands of dollars on fancy, 
financed cars that require years of work to pay off. People don’t spend 
enough time with our children and then are puzzled why the teen sui-
cide rate has tripled in the past two generations.
Read the next section to find out how you can filter out the best information 
and advice and skip the rest.
Separating Financial Fact from Fiction
Just because more sources offer investing advice doesn’t mean that you 
should read, listen to, or watch much of it. In this section, we offer prescrip-
tions for how to intelligently choose among all the available financial informa-
tion sources.

Understanding how advertising corrupts
 
The first rule for maximizing your chances of finding the best investing infor-
mation and advice is to recognize that there are no free lunches. Too many 
people get sucked into supposedly free resources.
The Internet is packed with scores of “free” investing sites. Turn on your 
television or radio and you come across mountains of “free” stuff. Of course, 
someone is paying for all this “free” content, and it’s all there for some 
reason. Most of the free Internet sites are run by investment companies or 
someone else with something to sell. What these sites give away is nothing 
but subtle and not-so-subtle advertising for whatever products and services 
they sell. Advertising also foots the bill in the vast majority of cases involving 
free investment advice on TV and radio.
As we discuss in Chapter 18, many investing and personal finance books 
aren’t free from subtly veiled advertising aims, either. Some authors choose 
to write books that are the equivalent of an infomercial for something else — 
such as high-priced seminars — that the “author” really wants to sell. Such 
writers aren’t interested in educating and helping you as much as they are 
seeking to sell you something. So, for example, an author might write about 
how complicated the investing markets are and some indicators he follows to 
time investments. However, at the end of such a book, the author might say 
that investing is too complicated to do on your own and that you really need 
a personal investment manager — which, to no great surprise, the author 
happens to be.
 
Whether in print or on the Internet, television, or radio — and whether it’s 
overt or subtle — advertising often compromises the quality of the investment 
advice it accompanies.
We won’t say that you can’t find some useful investment resources in media 
with lots of advertising. You can find some good investing programs on radio 
and television and some helpful investing sites on the Internet. However, 
these resources are the exception to the rule that where there’s a lot of 
advertising, there’s little valuable information and advice. Likewise, just 
because magazines and newspapers have quite a bit of advertising doesn’t 
mean that some of their columnists and articles aren’t worthy of your time.
In the following sections, we outline the problems that advertising can cause 
within all the media outlets.
Influencing content
Many organizations, such as newspaper and magazine publishers and radio 
and television stations that accept ads, say that their ad departments are 

343
 Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources
separate from their editorial departments. The truth, however, is that in most 
of these organizations, advertisers wield influence over the content. At a 
minimum, the editorial environment must be perceived as conducive to the 
sale of the advertiser’s product.
The stock market cable television channels, for example, carry many ads 
from brokers catering to investors who pick and trade their own stocks. 
Furthermore, such stations carry ads from firms that purport to teach you 
how to make big bucks day trading (see Chapter 5). Not surprisingly, such 
stations offer many “news” segments on their shows that cater to stock trad-
ers and condone and endorse foolish strategies, such as day trading, instead 
of condemning them. Instead of asking themselves what’s in the best inter-
ests of their viewers, listeners, and readers, executives at too many media 
and publishing firms ask what will attract attention and advertisers.
Corrupting content
In most organizations, advertisers can have a direct and adulterating influ-
ence on editorial content. Specifically, some media organizations and pub-
lishers simply won’t say anything negative about a major advertiser or will 
highlight and praise investment companies that are big advertisers.
More than a few media outlets have attempted to edit out critical comments 
that we’ve made about companies with lousy products that turned out to be 
their advertisers. Some editors simply say that they don’t want to bite the 
hand that feeds them. Others are less candid about why they remove such 
criticism. The bottom line is still the same: Advertisers’ influence squashes 
freedom of speech and, more importantly, prevents readers, viewers, and lis-
teners from getting the truth and best advice. (By the way, we don’t write for 
organizations that edit our work in such a fashion.)
Producing low-quality content
Because of the previously mentioned reasons and an overall lack of concern 
for the value of information and advice, some investing resources cut cor-
ners on the quality of their content. Because consumers often pay nothing or 
next to nothing for many investment resources, the media have an incentive 
to sell advertising space and not to hire high-quality writers who can offer 
sound advice to readers.
Recognizing quality resources
With the tremendous increase in the coverage of investing and other per-
sonal money issues, more and more journalists are writing about increas-
ingly technical issues — often in areas in which they have no expertise. 

344
Part V: Investing Resources 
(This is true in traditional print publications as well as in the so-called blogo-
sphere online.) Some of these writers provide good information and advice. 
Unfortunately, some dish out bad advice. In fields such as medicine or the 
law, you wouldn’t be so willing to take advice from non-experts. Why should 
you care any less about your money?
 
How can you know what’s good and whom you can trust? Although we can 
suggest resources that we hold in high regard (and do so throughout this 
book, especially in Chapters 17, 18, and 19), we recognize that you may 
encounter many different investment resources and you need to understand 
how to tell the best from the rest. The answer to the question, dear reader, 
rests in educating thyself. The more knowledgeable you are about both sound 
and flawed investment strategies, the better able you are to tell good from not-
so-good or even truly awful investment resources.
The best thing to do when you encounter a financial magazine, newspaper, 
Web site, or other resource for the first time is to investigate it. The following 
sections suggest some investigative work you should do before you take any-
one’s investment advice.
Following the money
All things being equal, you have a greater chance of finding quality content 
when subscription fees account for the bulk of a company’s revenue, and 
advertising accounts for little or none of the revenue. This generalization, of 
course, is just that — a generalization. Some publications that derive a rea-
sonable portion of their revenues from advertising have some good columns 
and content. Conversely, some relatively ad-free sources aren’t very good.
Figuring out their philosophy and agenda
Readers of our books can clearly understand our philosophies about invest-
ing. We advocate buying and holding, not trading and gambling. We explain 
how to build wealth through proven vehicles, including stocks, real estate, 
and small-business ownership. Our guiding beliefs are clearly detailed on the 
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book.
 
Unfortunately, many publications and programs don’t make it as easy for you 
to see or hear their operating beliefs. You may have to do some homework. 
For example, with a radio program, you probably have to listen to at least por-
tions of several shows to get a sense of the host’s investment philosophies. 
Warning signs include publications and programs that make investing sound 
overly complicated and that imply or say you won’t succeed or do as well if 
you don’t hire a financial adviser or follow your investments like a hawk.

345
 Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources
Considering whether the information is constructive
Just about everywhere you turn these days — radio, television, and the 
Internet — you can get up-to-the-minute updates on financial markets around 
the globe. Although most investors have a natural curiosity about how their 
investments are doing, from our experience, the constant barrage of updates 
causes a loss of focus on the big picture. In many cases, publishing and media 
companies report what we call the “noise” rather than the news of the day. 
Some companies are far worse about doing so than others.
 
Over the next week, take a close look at how you spend your time keeping up 
with financial news and other information. Do the programs and publications 
that you most heavily use really help you better understand and map out 
sound investment strategies, or do they end up confusing, overwhelming, and 
paralyzing you with bits and pieces of contradictory and often hyped noise? 
We’re not saying that you should tune these resources out completely, but we 
are saying that you should devote less time to the noise of the day and more 
time to self-education. How can you do that? Read a few good books (a topic 
that we discuss in detail in Chapter 18).
Considering their qualifications
Examine the backgrounds, including professional work experience and edu-
cation credentials, of a resource’s writers, hosts, and/or anchors. If such 
information isn’t given or easily found, that’s usually a red flag. People with 
something to hide, or a lack of something significantly redeeming to say 
about themselves, usually don’t promote their backgrounds.
 
Of course, just because someone seems to have a relatively impressive back-
ground doesn’t mean that she has your best interests in mind or has honestly 
presented her qualifications. For example, Forbes journalist William P. Barrett 
was skeptical of financial author Suze Orman’s biographical and business 
claims. He investigated and presented a sobering review of Orman’s stated 
credentials and qualifications in Forbes magazine — revealing that they were 
largely exaggerated. A writer for the San Francisco Chronicle later substanti-
ated this fact.
So what’s the lesson to be learned from this story? You can’t accept stated 
credentials and qualifications at face value, for the simple reason that some 
people don’t tell the truth. You can increase your chances of being tipped 
off to hucksters by being skeptical. In fact, Barrett started his investigation 
of Orman because of the sheer outrageousness of the number of new clients 
that Orman claimed to be getting each year.

In This Chapter
▶ Sifting through financial magazines and newspapers
▶ Surveying radio and television programs
▶ Steering clear of most investment newsletters
A
ll the news that’s fit to print or broadcast — in newspapers, magazines, 
and newsletters, and on radio and television programs — inundates 
us with investing information and advice. In this chapter, we explain what 
to look for — and what to look out for — when you tune in to these media 
sources in the hopes of investing better.
In Print: Magazines and Newspapers
Visit a newsstand and you find many investing publications as well as general 
interest publications with investing columns. We’ve written investing articles 
for various magazines and newspapers. Some of the experiences have been 
enjoyable, others okay, and a few miserable. The best publications and edi-
tors we’ve written for take seriously their responsibility to provide quality 
information and advice to their readers.
Taking the scribes to task
In this section, we discuss the problems with magazine and newspaper 
investment articles.

348
Part V: Investing Resources 
Highlighting hype and horror
Whenever the stock market suffers a sharp decline, many in the media bring 
out the gloom and doom. Front-page headlines such as “The Beginning of 
the End” torment investors about holding on to their stocks. An avalanche of 
such articles, like that seen in late 2002 and early 2003, often coincides with 
a bottoming stock market. When the stock and real estate markets slid in the 
late 2000s, scores of “the sky is falling” pieces similarly populated the pages. 
At the end of 2008, a cursory glance at the headlines might have made you 
think investing in the stock market was truly a thing of the past.
Another particularly popular subject for such reporting is the cost of a 
university education. (See, you can write a sentence about the cost of edu-
cation without including the word skyrocketing.) Scores of articles horrify 
parents with estimates of the expected costs associated with sending Junior 
to campus. The typical advice: Start saving and investing early so you don’t 
have to tell Junior that you can’t afford to send him to university.
 
The sky-high-cost-of-post-secondary-education stories typify another failing of 
the horror stories. The horror is the story, and the accompanying advice can 
be shortsighted. Completely overlooked and ignored are the tax and financial 
aid consequences of the recommended investment strategies. For example, if 
parents don’t take advantage of tax-deductible retirement plans and instead 
save outside them, they pay more in taxes. Sound investing decisions require 
a holistic approach that acknowledges that people have limited money and 
must make these sorts of trade-offs.
Offering poor advice
To sell their publications, magazines and newspapers sometimes entice read-
ers with promises of high returns. This can easily lead to crummy advice.
Consider the gaffe made by a Money magazine piece titled “Where to Get 
Safe, High Yields.” The title itself should have been a red flag: It’s impossible 
to find a safe high yield. To get high yields, you must be willing to accept 
more risk. In the Money article, three of the recommended investments were 
limited partnerships (LPs) sold through commission-based advisers. These 
products’ high commissions and ongoing fees doomed even the luckiest of 
investors to mediocre or dismal investment returns.
The Money article even asserted that investors could earn annual returns as 
high as 18 percent on some LPs. Students of the financial markets know that 
the best ownership investments, such as stocks and real estate, return no 
more than 10 to 12 percent per year over the long haul. To expect more is to 
hold unrealistic expectations.

349
 Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television
Quoting experts who are not
Historically, one way that journalists have attempted to overcome technical 
gaps in their knowledge is to interview and quote financial experts. Although 
this may add to the accuracy and quality of a story, journalists who aren’t 
experts themselves have difficulty telling qualified experts from hacks. (See 
Chapter 16 for a discussion of examining the qualifications of writers who 
offer up financial guidance.)
 
One glaring example of this phenomenon that continues to amaze us is how 
many newspaper and magazine financial writers quote unproven advice from 
investment newsletter writers. As we discuss in the section “Investment 
Newsletters,” later in this chapter, the predictive advice of many newsletter 
writers is often wrong and causes investors to earn lower returns and missed 
investment gains due to frequent trading than if they simply bought and 
held. Journalists who simply parrot this type of information and provide an 
endorsement that unqualified sources are “experts” do readers an immense 
disservice.
 
In some ways, what’s worse than quoting unqualified experts is when financial 
writers start to believe they themselves can predict the future with only a cur-
sory investigation or explanation. Consider the Globe and Mail columnist who 
advised in April 2000 — just a few weeks into the eventual collapse of the high 
tech sector — that “the correct way to think of Cisco, Nortel et al. is as tech 
blue chips, not much different than banks, merchandisers and manufacturers. 
These are essential stocks that investors and money managers will flock to for 
the foreseeable future.”
Even in October 2000, the same columnist said Nortel was still a “great 
company” and commented that “Nortel could go lower, or it could rebound 
quickly. Long term, it’s hard to imagine a company with brighter business 
prospects, but that’s just one opinion.”
One opinion, indeed! Nortel’s shares, of course, would go on to fall to as low 
as $0.67, and in early 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy.
Focusing on noise and minutiae
Daily financial press writers also contribute to today’s shortsighted invest-
ment environment and encourage readers to adopt similarly misguided out-
looks. It’s common for daily newspaper charts to show the stock market’s 
movements at five-minute intervals throughout the previous day. This focus 
on the noise of the day causes nervous investors to make panicked, emotion-
ally based decisions, such as deciding to sell after major stock market falls.

350
Part V: Investing Resources 
Of course, the daily print media aren’t the only ones chronicling the minu-
tiae. As we discuss elsewhere, other media, including television, radio, and 
the Internet, cause many investors to lose sight of the long term and the big 
picture.
 
The short length of newspaper and magazine articles can easily lead writers 
to oversimplify complex issues and offer flawed advice. For example, some 
pieces on mutual funds focus on a fund’s returns and investment philoso-
phies, devoting little, if any, space to the risks or tax consequences of invest-
ing in recommended funds.
Making the most of periodicals
 
So what should you do if you want to find out more about investing but don’t 
want to be overloaded with information? Educate yourself and be selective. If 
you’re considering subscribing to financial publications, go to the library first 
and review some old issues. Were the information and advice useful and error 
free? The more you know, the easier it is to separate the wheat from the chaff.
Shy away from publications that purport to be able to predict the 
future — few people can, and those who can are usually busy managing 
money. Unfortunately, as the financial markets got more volatile in the late 
1990s and early 2000s, and then again in the late 2000s, we witnessed more 
and more publications promoting columnists and headlines that attempted 
to prognosticate the future.
 
Read bylines and biographies and get to know writers’ strengths and weak-
nesses. Ditto for the entire publication. Any writer or publisher can make mis-
takes. Some make many more than others — follow their advice at your own 
peril. Start by evaluating advice in the areas that you know the most about. 
For example, if you’re interested in investing in RIM or Intel and are reason-
ably familiar with the computer industry, find out what the publications say 
about technology investments.
And remember that you’re not going to outfox the financial markets, because 
they’re reasonably efficient (see Chapter 4). Spend your time seeking informa-
tion and advice that help you flesh out your goals and develop a plan rather 
than trolling for the next hot stock tip or worrying about short-term trends.
Radio and Television Programs
As you move from the world of magazines and newspapers to radio and tele-
vision, the entertainment component usually increases. In this section, we 
highlight some common problems with radio and television programs and 
offer some recommendations for the better programs.

351
 Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television
Looking at problems with radio 
and television programs
We’ve been guests on hundreds of radio and television programs. Just as 
Dorothy discovered in The Wizard of Oz, seeing how things work behind the 
scenes tends to deglamorize these mediums. Here are the main problems 
we’ve discovered from our years observing radio and television.
You often get what you pay for
Some of the worst financial advice is brought to you, not surprisingly, for 
“free.” Because listeners don’t pay for money and investing shows on radio 
or television, advertising often drives who and what gets on the air, as we 
discuss in Chapter 16. But we’ve found that some of the worst offenders are 
local radio advice programs.
Some of these shows are “hosted” by a person who is nothing more than a 
financial salesperson. That person’s first, and sometimes only, motivation 
for wanting to do the show is to pick up clients. Many local radio investing 
programs are hosted by a local investment dealer (who usually calls himself 
a financial consultant or planner). A dealer who reels in just one big fish a 
month — a person with, say, $300,000 to invest — can generate commissions 
totalling $15,000 by selling investments with a 5 percent commission.
But radio suffers from more than dealers trolling for new clients, as evi-
denced by the case of Sonny Bloch, a New York radio personality who was 
indicted for fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United 
States found that Bloch was receiving kickbacks from investment brokers for 
endorsing some pretty crummy investment products on his nationally syndi-
cated radio show. The SEC also filed a complaint against Bloch for defrauding 
investors of millions of dollars to supposedly purchase some radio stations. 
Instead, according to the SEC, Bloch and his wife used hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars to purchase a condominium. Partners in a precious metals 
firm (DeAngelis Brothers Collectibles) that Bloch regularly endorsed on the 
air were arrested for theft and ended up in bankruptcy.
 
We know from personal experience what too many radio stations look for in 
the way of hosts for financial programs. The host’s integrity, knowledge, and 
lack of conflict of interest don’t matter. Willingness to work for next to nothing 
helps: One radio station program director said she liked the broker who was 
hosting a financial talk show because the broker was willing to work for so 
little compensation from the radio station. Never mind the fact that the broker 
rarely gave useful advice and was obviously trolling for new clients. That 
didn’t matter to the program director, who said, “We’re in the entertainment 
business.”

352

Information and hype overload
At 9:30 a.m. EST, the Toronto and New York stock exchanges open, and 
transactions start streaming across the bottom of television screens tuned 
to financial cable stations. Changes in the major market indexes — the TSX 
Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ 
index — also flash on the screen. In fact, these indexes are updated almost 
every five seconds on the screen. Far more exciting than a political race or 
sporting event, this event never ends and offers constant change and excite-
ment. Even after the markets close, reporting of still-open overseas markets 
continues. The performance of futures of stock market indexes then appears 
on-screen.
 
All of this reporting and data don’t make us better investors. Although the 
conventionally accepted notion is that this information overload levels the 
playing field for the individual investor, we know too many investors who 
make emotionally based decisions prodded by all this noise, prognostication, 
opinion, and hearsay.
Poor method of guest selection
Some journalists, often in an effort to overcome their own lack of knowledge, 
like to interview “experts.” A classic example of this problem is the media 
exposure that author Charles Givens used to receive. Givens became a dar-
ling of the media and the public following unprecedented, consecutive three-
day appearances on NBC’s Today show. Givens regularly held court on the 
talk show circuit with the likes of Larry King and Oprah Winfrey.
The Givens case highlights some of the media’s inability to distinguish 
between good and bad experts. It’s relatively easy for the financially sophis-
ticated to see the dangerous, oversimplified, and biased advice that Givens 
offers in his books. In his first best-seller, Wealth Without Risk, Givens rec-
ommended investing in limited partnerships and provided a phone number 
and address of a firm, Delta Capital Corp. in Florida, where readers could 
buy the partnerships. Those who bought these products ended up paying 
hefty sales commissions and owning investments worth half or less of their 
original value. Besides the problematic partnerships he recommended, court 
proceedings against Givens in a number of states uncovered that he owned a 
major share of Delta Capital.
 
Other investing advice from Givens that gives pause: In his chapters on invest-
ing, he said that the average yearly return you’ll earn investing in mutual funds 
will be 25 percent or 30 percent. The reality: An investor would be fortunate to 
earn half of these inflated returns.

353
 Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television
So how did Givens get on all these programs? He had a shrewd publicist, and 
the show producers either didn’t read his books and/or were themselves 
financially illiterate. Talk shows and many reporters often don’t take the time 
to check out people like Givens. Most of the time, the books are never read. 
Producers, who themselves usually don’t know much about investing, often 
decide to put someone on the air on the basis of a press kit or a call from a 
publicist.
Slim pickings in Canada
Unfortunately, Canada lacks solid and dependable radio and television pro-
gramming about investing. The recession in the late 2000s took what were 
already slim pickings and reduced the field to next to nothing. As advertis-
ers slashed spending, television networks scaled back programming even 
further. Unfortunately, unless investment shows bring in large audiences and 
ad dollars, it’s unlikely we’ll see any change in the near future. Simply put, we 
don’t have a large enough population for a sufficient critical mass to support 
good programming on investing or small business.
 
One of the dangers of business and investing programs is that the entertain-
ment component can overshadow common sense. The best example of this in 
Canada is Dragon’s Den, adapted from a Japanese series by the CBC (as well as 
the BBC in the United Kingdom). On the program, small-business owners and 
would-be entrepreneurs have a few minutes to make a pitch for funding to five 
wealthy businesspeople, the so-called dragons. Although the program can be 
entertaining, its premise involves the dragons’ making a decision to invest in a 
matter of minutes, with scant details. If you’re considering investing in a small 
business, you shouldn’t make an offer without spending many hours if not 
days turning the proposal inside out. At the same time, it’s never wise to agree 
to a partnership of this kind without getting to know the background and per-
sonality of the people involved.
 
Just as the economy was collapsing in the late 2000s, CBC Newsworld 
launched a new program called Fortune Hunters. The program’s host, Diane 
Buckner, was a host for Venture, a worthwhile program on the trials and tri-
umphs of small-business owners. (Sadly, after more than two decades, the 
show was cancelled in 2007.) In contrast, Fortune Hunters focuses on “hot 
trends” and the entrepreneurs who are trying to find ways to turn them into 
profitable businesses. Fortune Hunters offers insights into how to think criti-
cally about an idea for a business, in part due to the comments of the pro-
gram’s experts on concepts from Canada and around the world.

Investment Newsletters
Particularly in the newsletter business, prognosticators fill your mailbox with 
promotional material making outrageous claims about their returns. Private 
money managers, not subject to the same scrutiny and auditing requirements 
as mutual funds, can do the same.
 
Be especially wary of any newsletters making claims of high returns. Stephen 
Leeb’s Personal Finance newsletter, for example, claims that he has developed 
a brilliant proprietary model, which he calls the “Master Key Indicator.” His 
model supposedly has predicted the last 28 upturns in the market in a row 
without a single miss. The odds of doing this, according to Leeb, are more 
than 268 million to 1! The ad goes on to claim that Leeb’s “Master Key” market-
timing system could have turned a $10,000 investment over 12 years into $39.1 
million, a return of 390,000 percent!
Turns out that this outrageous claim was based on backtesting, looking back 
over historic returns and creating “what if” scenarios. In other words, Leeb 
didn’t turn anyone’s $10,000 into $39 million. Much too late after that ad 
appeared, the SEC finally charged Leeb with false advertising. Leeb settled 
out of court for a mere $60,000 fine (far less than he cost investors).
According to the Hulbert Financial Digest, the worst investment newsletters 
have underperformed the market averages by dozens of percentage points; 
some would even have caused you to lose money during a decade when the 
financial markets performed extraordinarily well. U.S. newsletter purveyor 
Joe Granville, for example, has long been known for making outrageous and 
extreme stock market predictions and is often quoted in financial publica-
tions. He claims to have the number-one-rated newsletter — omitting to men-
tion that it was number one for one year only (in 1989). Over the subsequent 
decade — one of the best decades ever for the stock market (with U.S. stocks 
more than quadrupling in value) — followers of Granville’s advice lost 99 per-
cent of their investments!
 
Be highly suspicious of past investment performance claims made by invest-
ment newsletters. Don’t believe a track record unless a reputable account-
ing firm with experience doing such audits has audited it. In order for you to 
make sound investing choices, you don’t need predictions and soothsayers. 
If you choose to follow these and you’re lucky, little harm will be done. But 
more often than not, you can lose lots of money by following their predictions. 
Stay far away from publications that purport to be able to tell what’s going to 
happen next. No one has a crystal ball.

The best investment publications can assist you with research and ideas. 
For individual stock selection, please see our recommended resources in 
Chapter 6.
 
If you’re looking for ongoing advice and commentary, select newsletters 
that have a conservative, long-term, and anti–crystal ball philosophy. The 
best newsletters will admit outright that they cannot — and will not — try to 
predict just which stock or fund will serve up the next investing home run. 
Instead, they see their role as reinforcing sound investing fundamentals, pro-
viding useful background and analysis, and informing readers of significant 
changes or news in the areas they cover. One example of a Canadian newslet-
ter that focuses on stocks in this manner is The Investment Reporter, published 
weekly by MPL Communications. Another choice is The Successful Investor, 
which is published monthly. Visit www.thesuccessfulinvestor.com for 
more information.
The Canadian Mutual Fund Adviser, also from MPL, provides good long-term 
advice on mutual funds coupled with a decidedly realistic and grounded view 
of the markets in general.

Selecting the Best 
Investment Books
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing that some books advertise more than they educate
▶ Being skeptical about authors’ claimed returns
▶ Presenting our favourite investing books
O
ver the years, we’ve read hundreds of investing and financial books. We 
hope you haven’t subjected yourself to this task!
 
Although most books have something to offer, too many investing books are 
burdened with biased, wrongheaded advice and misinformation. As a non-
expert, you may have a hard time sifting through the heap for the tidbits of 
treasure. The bad stuff can pollute your otherwise intelligent thinking and 
cause you to make investing mistakes that millions before you have made.
We hope we’re not the first people to tell you not to believe everything you 
read. Publishing is no different from any other business — companies are in 
it to make money. As with other industries, the short-sighted desire to reap 
quick profits causes some companies to publish content that seems attrac-
tive in the short term but is toxic to readers in the long term. In this chapter, 
we help you sift through the confusion to find books worth reading.
Beware of Infomercial Books
 
The worst books tend to confuse more than they convey. Why would an 
author want to do that? Well, some authors have an incentive to make things 
complicated and mysterious. Their agenda may be to sell you a high-priced 
newsletter or persuade you to turn your money over to them to manage.

358
Part V: Investing Resources 
Here’s what one book “author” said: “Royalties, schmoyalties . . . I write books 
to hook people into my monthly newsletter. I can make $185 per year off of a 
$195 newsletter sale. You can’t do that with a book.” You sure can’t. However, 
this salesman isn’t satisfied to just turn out books that are short on informa-
tion and advice but long on pitches to keep up with the latest market develop-
ments through his newsletter. When you subscribe to his newsletter, you’re 
told that the financial markets are so complicated and change so rapidly that 
the newsletter is really no substitute for using his money-management service!
 
The worst books steer you toward purchasing a crummy investment product 
that the author has a vested interest in selling you. Unfortunately, most pub-
lishers don’t do their homework to check out prospective authors. They don’t 
care what the author is up to, or whether the author is really an expert on the 
topic, as long as she’s willing and able to write and promote a saleable book. 
Authors who run around the country conducting seminars and making public-
ity appearances are a plus to the publisher.
As a cautionary tale, consider a fellow called Wade Cook. In his books and 
seminar promotional materials, Wade Cook claimed to be able to teach 
people how to earn monthly returns of 20 percent or more (that’s right — 
not yearly but monthly!) by using his stock market investing strategies.
Cook’s self-published best-selling books were short on specifics and were 
largely infomercials for his high-priced seminars. Cook’s get-rich-quick invest-
ment seminars — which cost a whopping $4,695 — had been so successful 
at attracting attendees that Cook’s company, Profit Financial Corporation, 
went public and generated more than $100 million in revenues annually! Cook 
wasn’t shy about promising people they could get rich quick without much 
effort. Here’s a passage from his book Stock Market Miracles:
I want millions of dollars and I don’t want to have to work a 9 to 5 job 
to get them. Boy, that’s a conundrum. It’s almost impossible to work a 
typical American job, with average income and accumulate millions. 
Yes, in 40 to 50 years maybe, but who wants to wait that long? That’s the 
rub — accomplishing the task of having millions without having to work for 
millions.
You see my method is simple. I want to use a small amount of money — 
risk capital if you will — to generate cash flow which will exponentially 
generate more income.
Cook promised his followers several hundred percent annualized returns by 
teaching them how to successfully gamble (not invest) in the stock market. 
Cook’s “techniques” included trading in and out of stocks and options on 
stocks after short holding periods of weeks, days, or even hours.

359
 Chapter 18: Selecting the Best Investment Books
Cook’s trading strategies were loosely based upon technical analysis — that 
is, examining a stock’s price movements and volume history through chart-
ing. (See Chapter 6 for more details on the foolishness of technical analy-
sis.) Cook’s investment seminar, which was offered in cities throughout the 
country, was marketed to folks like this: “If you aren’t getting 20 percent per 
month, or 300 percent annualized returns on your investments, you need to 
be there.”
Steven Thomas, a truck driver, went to a seminar with his wife so both of 
them could follow and implement Cook’s strategies. In addition to spending 
$4,695 on the seminar, they also spent another $2,000 on audiotapes and 
videotapes. Six months later, Steven spent $1,500 on a paging system from 
Cook’s company. The results: Thomas eventually lost $36,000 on investments 
made following Cook’s strategies, which he borrowed against his home’s 
equity. “I saw this as an opportunity to quit my job and just invest in the 
stock market,” says Thomas. “This has had a terrible impact on my family, 
and I’m super-depressed.”
Of course, if Cook had indeed earned the 300 percent annual returns his 
seminars claimed to be able to teach the masses how to achieve, he would 
have, in about a decade, become the world’s wealthiest individual if he had 
invested just $1 million of the income he supposedly earned in real estate. 
Look out, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett! Any investor starting with just 
$10,000 would vault to the top of the list of the world’s wealthiest people in 
about 15 years if Cook’s teachings really worked!
So how did Cook get his start in the investing world? Here’s what his Web 
site said:
He was a taxicab driver in the ’70s. Borrowing $500 from his father, Wade 
Cook started buying real estate. His innovative ideas and gutsy follow-
through enabled him to turn that $500 into several million. But that’s nothing 
compared with what he’s doing on Wall Street. Starting with $1,300, using 
his “Rolling Rock” and “Range Rider” methods, he’s showing students how 
to create millions.
Why is Wade so smart? He says he’s “street smart.” What he discovered 
driving a cab changed his life forever. While his fellow cabbies were out 
looking for the big runs, Wade was taking every little run he could find — 
$4 here, $5 here. You see it costs $2 just to get into a cab (something called 
a meter drop) even if you only go two blocks. At the end of a month, Wade 
made three times what every other taxicab driver made. Now, Wade applies 
his “meter drop” technique to his stock market investment business — 
making a ton of money on a lot of little deals.

360
Part V: Investing Resources 
Although Cook’s investment return expectations were completely unrealistic, 
he got away with claiming hyped and undocumented returns for many years 
because he didn’t manage money for others. In the United States, seminar 
promoters and newsletter writers face no SEC scrutiny of their inflated per-
formance claims or what they do in their seminars as long as no securities 
laws are violated. The SEC refers to such organizations as nonregulated 
entities.
Of course, Cook wasn’t the first person to profit in this fashion. Numerous 
other seminar promoters and authors (some are discussed later in this chap-
ter) have made big bucks as well, including the Beardstown investment club, 
which couldn’t document its supposedly market-beating returns of 23-plus 
percent per year (see the next section for details). In addition to puffed-up 
expected stock market returns, there’s more to Cook’s past than simply 
driving a taxi. According to Smart Money magazine, Cook’s dubious business 
practices had him in trouble throughout the ’80s. At the end of his real estate 
seminars, which touted that average people could become millionaires by 
buying property with little money down, Cook began peddling stock in his 
own business ventures.
By 1990, state securities regulators in six states — Missouri, Utah, Minnesota, 
Illinois, Oregon, and Arizona — issued Cook cease-and-desist orders for sell-
ing securities without a license, selling unregistered securities, and omitting 
material facts — like the fact that he had declared bankruptcy in 1987. In fact, 
Arizona charged that Cook had duped $390,841 out of 150 investors by sell-
ing unregistered securities, funnelling $48,000 of that money into a Scottsdale 
home purchase and federal income tax payments. The state ordered him to 
pay back the money and slapped him with a $150,000 penalty.
Cook answered by filing bankruptcy (again). Cook then moved back to his 
home state of Washington, where he didn’t lie low for long. His new company, 
Profit Financial Corporation, became wildly successful by selling his Wall 
Street Workshop seminars and publishing his two stock-picking books. The 
attorneys general of several states sought millions of dollars in consumer 
refunds and sued the company. The states alleged the company lied about its 
investment track record. (Now that’s a big surprise — this company claimed 
you would make 300 percent per year in stocks!) Cook’s company settled 
the blizzard of state and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuits against 
his firm by agreeing to accurately disclose its trading record in future pro-
motions and to give refunds to customers who were misled by past inflated 
return claims.

361
 Chapter 18: Selecting the Best Investment Books
Although Profit Financial Corporation was a public company, SEC documents 
indicated that it wasn’t exactly shareholder friendly. Cook set up a rather 
clever business structure whereby the public company (of which he is the 
majority owner) was required to pay him for the right to print his words and 
teach his methods. This enabled Cook to funnel much of the revenue stream 
directly into his pockets before it ever got to the shareholders. According to 
SEC filings, Cook’s total corporate compensation in one year exceeded $8 mil-
lion! According to a report by Bloomberg News, Cook’s firm lost a whopping 
89 percent of its own money trading in 2000. As Deb Bortner, director of the 
Washington State Securities Division and president of the North American 
Securities Administrators Association, observed, “Either Wade is unable to 
follow his own system, which he claims is simple to follow, or the system 
doesn’t work.”
And if there weren’t enough unsavoury aspects to Cook’s financial dealings, 
Cook was sentenced in 2007 to more than seven years in federal prison for 
tax evasion, filing false tax returns, and obstructing a tax investigation, and 
was ordered to pay nearly $4 million in additional taxes.
 
The moral of the story: Be highly skeptical and suspicious of investing books 
that direct you to high-priced seminars and other expensive products and ser-
vices from the author. The best investing books, which we recommend later in 
this chapter, seek to instruct and educate.
Ignore Unaudited Performance Claims
 
Book authors avoid careful scrutiny of claims of especially high returns. But if 
a performance claim hasn’t been independently audited, don’t believe it.
Remember also that the stock market, over the long term, provides annual-
ized returns of about 10 percent. View skeptically any prognosticator or 
author claiming substantially higher returns that sound too good to be true.
Some book publishers are happy to look the other way or even to solicit and 
encourage great boasts that they use in the packaging to sell books. Consider 
these two examples: The Beardstown Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide: 
How We Beat the Stock Market — and How You Can, Too and The Whiz Kid of 
Wall Street’s Investment Guide by Matt Seto.
The Beardstown investment club claimed a whopping 23.4 percent annual 
return since the club’s inception in 1983. In the book, the authors advocated 

362
Part V: Investing Resources 
forming an investment club, pooling your money, and using a simple stock 
selection method to beat the pants off the market and the suspendered man-
agers of mutual funds. The bulk of this book walked readers through how this 
investment club evaluated and selected individual stocks.
As for Seto’s book, it boasted, “Matt Seto manages a portfolio that consis-
tently outperforms 99 percent of all mutual fund managers . . . and returns an 
annual average of 34 percent.” In his book, this 17-year-old investing genius 
told readers to forget bonds, real estate, and mutual funds and grow rich by 
investing entirely in individual stocks.
 
Each of these books made performance claims that were prominently dis-
played and marketed. The returns of the Beardstown club and Seto, versus 
the market averages, would have placed them shoulder to shoulder with the 
legendary Peter Lynch, of the now famous Fidelity Magellan fund, and Warren 
Buffett, an investor whom Peter Lynch described as “the Greatest Investor 
of them all.” Problem is, neither book contained information on how these 
investment gurus calculated their returns, nor were the authors able to sub-
stantiate their claimed returns when asked to.
When Eric first wrote about the Beardstown book for The San Francisco 
Examiner, he offered to work with an accounting firm to calculate the club’s 
returns if the club supplied the necessary information. Eric asked the same of 
Seto when he read his book. Neither of these authors could supply the docu-
mentation to prove their claims, and they backpedalled when pressed.
Initially, the Beardstown club said it would send the information, but months 
passed, and it never arrived. The club’s media spokesperson then told Eric 
that the club has “chosen not to make our return an issue. . . . we’re not out 
to be bragging.” This statement was surprising, given the claims prominently 
plastered all over the book.
A later piece in Chicago magazine proved that although the Beardstown 
investment club claimed 23 percent per year returns versus 14 percent for 
the market, the club actually tremendously underperformed the market 
and earned only 9 percent per year. The publisher of the Beardstown book, 
Buena Vista Publishing (which was doing business as Hyperion and Seth 
Godin Productions), was ultimately sued. The book publisher settled the 
lawsuit in 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, buyers of the Beardstown 
investment club’s books, audiotapes, or videotapes received certificates that 
could be redeemed for other books published by Hyperion.
Do you think the Beardstown ladies would have gotten their book deal 
(and landed on best-seller lists) if the facts had been known? Seto, likewise, 
couldn’t prove his claim of an astounding 34 percent return.

Investing and Business 
Books Worth Reading
Exceptional investing books — ones that are readable, educational, and 
insightful — are rare. Some of the better investment and business books are 
technical in nature and are written by career investment folks, so don’t be 
surprised if they require more than one read. Make the investment of time; 
it’ll pay big dividends (and capital gains!). Following are our picks for books 
that are worth the trouble of tracking down and reading.
A Random Walk Down Wall Street
 
Now in its ninth edition, A Random Walk Down Wall Street (Norton), by Burton 
Malkiel, is a classic that was first published in 1973. Malkiel is an entertaining 
and intelligent writer. Drawing from examples from this century and others, 
Malkiel teaches how speculative bubbles (frenzied buying) and fear and greed, 
as well as economic and corporate fundamentals, can move the financial 
markets.
One fundamental premise of his book is that the financial markets can’t 
be predicted, especially in the short term. Common sense confirms this 
premise: If someone could figure out a system to forecast the markets and 
make a fortune, then that person wouldn’t waste time writing a book, publish-
ing a newsletter, and so on. Malkiel, in fact, is one of the pioneers and propo-
nents of index mutual funds, which simply invest in a relatively fixed basket 
of securities in order to track the overall market performance rather than to 
attempt to beat it. (See Chapter 8 to find out about index funds and how to 
use them.)
Needless to say, many Bay Street types aren’t enamoured of this book. As 
Malkiel says, the very term random walk is considered an “obscenity.” But 
Malkiel presents a mountain of compelling arguments and data to support his 
case that most Wall Street firms and their investment research aren’t worthy 
of an investor’s hard-earned money. Malkiel explains how to look at some 
common-sense indicators, such as whether the stock and bond markets are 
fairly valued and your own personal goals and desire to take risk, to develop 
a thoughtful and successful investment plan. Instead of trying to predict the 
future, Malkiel explains how the level of risk an investor accepts with invest-
ments will ultimately determine future returns.

Money Logic
 
Should you invest in this stock or that mutual fund? If you choose mutual 
funds, should it be fund X or fund Y? And does paying the extra management 
fees on segregated funds that guarantee you your principal back after a set 
number of years make financial sense? Money Logic: Financial Strategies for the 
Smart Investor (Stoddart), written by Moshe A. Milevsky with Michael Posner, 
tackles these and other common investment quandaries with thoughtful 
discussion.
Although the book is out of print, it’s worthwhile tracking down a copy or 
borrowing one from your local library. Milevsky, who teaches risk manage-
ment at York University, uses historical data and mathematical logic to offer 
practical advice on what information to focus on in order to make sound 
choices. Among the common concerns he addresses are how to assess the 
value that managers bring to funds, whether the guarantee of getting your 
principal back after a certain number of years is worth the extra management 
expense fees charged by segregated funds, and why and how much interna-
tional diversification is a good idea.
Stocks for the Long Run
 
Finance professor Jeremy J. Siegel loves investing data, especially examin-
ing it over long time periods. In Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide 
to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies, 4th Edition 
(McGraw-Hill), Siegel presents an analysis of U.S. stock and bond returns since 
1802! The book is packed with charts and graphs, some of which you won’t 
readily comprehend unless you’re the analytic, graphical sort. Even so, Siegel 
provides comprehensive discussion of the worldwide financial markets as well 
as how the economic environment affects stocks. The book focuses on stock 
market investing, although it also discusses bonds if for no other reason than 
to compare their returns and risk to stocks.
Canadian Small Business Kit For Dummies
 
Many small businesses fail because of a lack of upfront planning. Sure, we may 
have a bias towards the books with a bright yellow cover. That said, Canadian 
Small Business Kit For Dummies (Wiley) can help you to think your idea 
through, and lay a strong foundation to raise your odds of succeeding. The 
authors explain the differences between being a sole proprietorship and incor-
porating, and point to possible benefits and problems. The included CD-ROM 
contains many common business forms.

 Chapter 18: Selecting the Best Investment Books
Built to Last and Good to Great
 
Some people may think that Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary 
Companies (HarperCollins) is just for the small number of people who want 
to build a large company. However, the book, written by management con-
sultant James Collins and Stanford Business School Professor Jerry Porras, 
is an excellent book for all entrepreneurs and people who work in leadership 
positions in companies, as well as people interested in investing in individual 
stocks. Rarely does a great book make it to the business best-seller lists, but 
Built to Last did.
The book presents the findings from an extensive six years’ worth of 
research into what’s behind the success of companies such as 3M, Boeing, 
Ford, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Sony, and Wal-Mart, all of which have 
achieved great success in their respective industries over many years. The 
average company in the Collins and Porras study was founded in 1897. In 
all, the authors tracked 18 extraordinary companies (referred to as the gold-
medal winners in their respective industries) and compared the traits of 
these companies with those of similarly long-lived but less successful peer 
companies (in the same industries).
Collins and Porras’s findings not only yield insight into how to build or iden-
tify a great business in which to invest but also destroy some commonly 
held myths. For example, some people feel that a great idea is behind every 
great company. This concept is wrong, and in fact, according to the authors’ 
research, companies founded on the basis of a great idea can lead to focusing 
on the idea rather than laying the groundwork for building a great company. 
Sony’s founder, for example, wrote a nine-page philosophical prospectus 
setting the stage for this great company, yet he had few product ideas in his 
firm’s early days. Early products, such as a rice cooker, failed miserably.
 
Great, visionary companies are rigid and unyielding when it comes to respect-
ing their core ideologies and principles. On the other hand, such companies 
tinker and experiment to stimulate positive change and innovation. And 
despite their often-stunning financial success, great companies usually have 
an aspiration higher than or equal to maximizing profits: fulfilling a purpose 
and being driven by values. This book is packed with insights, information, 
and examples, so don’t expect to absorb all of its contents in one reading.
Collins subsequently wrote another outstanding book, Good to Great: Why 
Some Companies Make the Leap . . . And Others Don’t (HarperCollins), which 
he calls the prequel to Built to Last. In Good to Great, Collins presents the 
engaging and insightful results of another long-term study of numerous com-
panies that over time moved from being average companies to outstanding 
companies. As with Built to Last, this newer book can assist readers not only 
with managing their own small businesses but also with selecting companies 
to invest in.

Investigating Internet and 
Software Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing investing software
▶ Recognizing Internet pitfalls and opportunities
▶ Finding the best investing Web sites
T
housands of investing software packages and Web sites claim to enable 
you to more easily make profitable investments. As with most other 
advertising claims, the reality of using your computer for investing and other 
tasks falls short of the promises and the hype.
 
In this chapter, we show you ways that your computer may help you with 
your investing challenges and chores. Throughout this discussion, however, 
please remember several important caveats:
 
✓ Some highly successful investors don’t use their computers (or they use 
them infrequently) to deal with their investments.
 
✓ You may subject yourself to information overload and spend a fair 
amount of money without seeing many benefits if you don’t choose 
wisely.
 
✓ Don’t believe everything you read, especially in the online world, where 
filters and editors are often absent. (Of course, as we discuss elsewhere in 
this book, filters and editors don’t guarantee that you’ll find quality invest-
ment advice and information when you read financial publications.)

Part V: Investing Resources 
Evaluating Investment Software
Good investment software should be user-friendly and provide quality infor-
mation for making sound decisions. Software that helps you make personal 
investment decisions also needs to provide, if applicable, well-founded 
advice.
 
Which software is best for you depends on what you’re trying to accomplish, 
as well as your level of investment knowledge and computer savvy. Software 
can help you with a variety of investment tasks, from tracking your invest-
ments to researching, planning, and placing trades through your computer (a 
topic that we discuss in Chapter 9). The following sections help you find the 
best software for your needs.
Investment-tracking software
Software that can help you with investment tracking falls into one of two 
main groups:
 
✓ Personal finance software that also includes investment-tracking 
capabilities
 
✓ Software that focuses exclusively on investment tracking
 
The broader personal finance packages such as Quicken and Microsoft Money 
are more user-friendly and are probably more familiar if you already use these 
packages’ other features (such as a bill-paying feature).
In the following sections, we outline what we see as the advantages and dis-
advantages of using tracking software based on your needs and offer a few 
alternative approaches to tracking your investments.
The benefits
Investment-tracking software offers a number of positive features that may 
appeal to you:
 
✓ Organization: One of the best benefits of these packages is that using 
them can help you get organized. If you enter your investments into the 
program, the software can help you make sure that you don’t lose track 
of your holdings. Of course, if your home burns to the ground and you 
don’t have a backup copy of your files or software off-site, you have to 
start your documentation from scratch.

369
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
 
✓ At-a-glance access: In addition to organizing all of your investment 
information in one place, investment software allows you to track origi-
nal purchase price, current market values, and rates of return on your 
investments. If you have accounts at numerous investment firms, using 
software can reduce some of the complications involved in tracking your 
investing kingdom.
 
✓ Overall return data: People usually know their GIC and bond yields, but 
ask most people investing in individual stocks and bonds what the total 
return was on their entire portfolio, and at best, you’ll get a guess. It’s 
the rare person who can quote you total returns or tell you whether her 
returns are on pace to reach her future financial goals. If someone does 
know her investments’ returns, she probably doesn’t know whether that 
return is good, bad, or otherwise. Feel good having made 22 percent 
on your portfolio of stocks last year? Maybe you wouldn’t if an index of 
comparable stocks was up 35 percent over the same period.
 
 Investment-tracking software can be more useful for stock traders. In 
our experience, stock traders, the people who would most benefit from 
using these programs, often don’t track their overall returns. If they did, 
they could calculate the benefit (or lack thereof) of all their trading.
The drawbacks
Many software makers produce programs that claim to solve investment-
tracking quandaries. (Numerous financial Web sites offer tracking tools as 
well.) However, investment-tracking software isn’t a painless panacea for 
investors who want to track their investments and returns.
Many people buy these programs thinking that the programs will, after a 
small investment of time, simplify their investment lives. Our review of many 
investment-tracking packages suggests that you should be prepared to make 
a substantial time commitment to find out how to use them and should know 
that other, less high-tech alternatives may be more efficient and enlighten-
ing. Also know that a good portion of program users tire of entering all the 
required data and then feel guilty for falling behind.
If you want to see what your investment returns have been over the years, 
be aware that entering historic data from your account statements (if you 
can find them) is a time-consuming process, regardless of which package 
you use. To calculate your returns, you generally need to enter what’s known 
as the adjusted cost base of each new investment that you make as well as 
all your reinvestments of dividends, interest, and capital gains distributions 
(such as those made on mutual funds). Ugh!

The alternatives
 
If you’re not into data entry, here are some alternative routes to consider:
 
✓ Organization: Keeping a current copy of each of your investment 
statements in a binder or file folder can accomplish the same result of 
organizing all of your holdings.
 
✓ At-a-glance access: Investment software can track all the facts and 
figures for all of your investments — purchase price, market value, 
rates of return, and so on. But you can accomplish the same things by 
consolidating your investments at one investment company. (See our 
discussion of discount brokers in Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Overall return data: You can easily estimate the return of your overall 
portfolio by using an old-fashioned paper and pencil. Simply weight 
the return of each investment by the portion of your portfolio that’s 
invested in it. For example, with a simple portfolio equally divided 
between two investments that returned 10 percent and 20 percent, 
respectively, your overall portfolio return would be 15 percent (10 × 
0.50 + 20 × 0.50 = 15). If you’re not adding to or taking money from a 
portfolio, you can simply compare the portfolio’s value at year end to 
the prior year end.
People who make investments at various times throughout the year and want 
to know what their actual returns were during the year can use software to get 
answers. Unless you’re a frequent trader and are trying to measure the suc-
cess of your trading, knowing the exact returns based on the precise dates that 
you fed money into investments has limited value. This fact is especially true if 
you’re a regular, dollar-cost-averaging investor (see Chapter 3). Also know that 
increasing numbers of investment companies are providing personal return 
data via their Web site and/or on account statements.
And if you’re a buy-and-hold mutual fund investor, a path that we find great 
value in, tracking software gives you limited benefits because of the time 
that entering your data requires. Mutual funds and many other published 
resources tell you what a fund’s total return was for the past year, so you 
don’t need to enter every dividend and capital gain distribution.
Investment research software
Investment research software packages usually separate investment beginners 
(and others who don’t want to spend a lot of their time managing their money) 
from those who enjoy wallowing in data and conducting primary research. If 
you already have a plan in mind and just want to get on with investing, then go 
for it! But even if you don’t want to conduct more specific research, some of 
the packages that we discuss in this section can also help you conduct online 
investment transactions and track an investment’s performance.

371
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
You may have the problems of sifting through too much data and differentiat-
ing the best from the mediocre and the downright awful. And unless cost is 
no object, you need to make sure that you don’t spend too much of your loot 
simply accessing the information.
Before you plunge into the data jungle and try to become the next Peter 
Cundill or Warren Buffett and pick individual stocks, be honest about your 
Understanding how software calculates returns
Most software programs calculate returns in 
one of two ways. First, the programs can cal-
culate your effective or “internal” rate of return 
(IRR) by comparing the original amounts you 
invested to the current market value. Of those 
programs that we’ve tested that calculate 
IRR — and some don’t — the results were accu-
rate. After you calculate your returns, knowing 
how they compare with relevant market aver-
ages would be nice. Unfortunately, not all pro-
grams allow you to compare your performance 
to various market indexes.
The tax or cost-basis method is the second 
way software may calculate your returns. All 
the packages that we’ve reviewed calculate 
your adjusted cost base for accounting pur-
poses. Your adjusted cost base is your origi-
nal investment plus reinvested dividends and 
capital gains, for which you have already paid 
taxes in a non-retirement account. To get an 
accurate adjusted cost base, you need to key 
in all of your investments, including reinvested 
distributions. Time-starved investors can take 
solace in the fact that most investment compa-
nies, particularly larger mutual fund providers, 
provide adjusted cost base information for you 
upon request or when you sell an investment.
Some packages provide only this adjusted 
cost base information and don’t report actual 
returns. Adjusted cost base reports make your 
returns look less generous because reinvested 
distributions increase your original investment 
and seemingly reduce your returns. We know 
from experience that investors often look at 
adjusted cost base reports and assume that 
the reports tell them what their investment 
returns are. This happens partly because of the 
adjusted cost base reports’ misleading names, 
such as “investment performance” or “invest-
ment analysis.”
The difference between the rate of return using 
the adjusted cost base and IRR methods is 
generally substantial. For the data used in our 
research, the adjusted cost base method soft-
ware calculated a 2.7 percent annual return, 
and the IRR method software calculated a 13 
percent annual return. The actual portfolio’s 
total return was 13 percent, but an investor 
using a software package that calculates only 
adjusted cost base is led to believe that her 
profit was just 2.7 percent (which is correct for 
tax purposes only for a non-retirement plan).
Is all this calculation method mumbo jumbo too 
technical for your taste? Because they already 
have the data on your accounts, more invest-
ment firms can and hopefully someday will be 
able to send you your account’s performance 
numbers. To date, surprisingly few investment 
firms provide personal investment returns.

372
Part V: Investing Resources 
reasons for wanting to research. Some investors fool themselves into believ-
ing that their research will help them beat the markets. Few investors, even 
so-called professionals, ever do. Witness the fact that over long time periods 
(ten-plus years), mutual funds that invest in a market index, such as the 
Toronto Stock Exchange Composite, outperform about three-quarters of their 
actively managed peers thanks to the index fund’s lower operating expenses 
(see Chapter 8).
Researching individual securities
 
If you like to invest in individual securities, the Canadian Shareowners 
Association Stock Selection Guide software (about $200) helps you research 
individual companies. You can enter the data yourself or purchase it in elec-
tronic form from the association. The association has information on over 
6,000 Canadian and U.S. companies.
The data, available on CD or online, costs about $230 annually for unlimited 
downloads. You can also choose to have the data mailed out to you on disc 
every two months for slightly more. You can order the software and data by 
calling the Canadian Shareowners Association at 800-268-6881, or by visit-
ing its Web site at www.shareowner.com. We discuss the association in 
more detail in Chapter 6. Another good option is the Value Line Investment 
Analyzer, which helps you research individual stocks using the data that the 
Value Line Investment Survey provides (as we discuss in Chapter 6). This 
software package lets you sift through Value Line’s data efficiently. You can 
also use it to track your stock portfolio.
A two-month introductory offer for Value Line’s software costs US$75 (US$95 
for the “Plus Edition,” which also tracks small- and medium-company stocks), 
and an annual subscription costs US$598 for monthly updates (US$995 for 
the more comprehensive version). The software is available from Value Line 
at 800-654-0508 or by visiting its Web site at www.valueline.com.
Morningstar, which is better known for its mutual fund information, has 
followed in Value Line’s footsteps in providing lots of data on individual 
stocks. Morningstar’s Principia for Stocks has data and features equivalent 
to what Value Line’s Plus Edition offers. This program is intended for those 
with in-depth knowledge of how to analyze stocks and is most definitely not 
for beginners. An annual subscription to Principia for Stocks with monthly 
updates costs US$675. You can reach Morningstar at 800-735-0700 or visit its 
Web site at www.morningstar.ca. Morningstar offers a number of ways to 
tap in to the more basic stock data it collects through its Web site, which we 
discuss in the next section.

Researching ETFs and mutual funds
 
For ETFs and mutual funds, ShareOwner, Morningstar, and Value Line all pub-
lish a number of software packages. These packages are geared toward more 
sophisticated investors who understand mutual funds and how to select them.

Investigating Internet Resources
As people interested in managing their money surf the Internet, thousands of 
Web sites have sprung up to meet the demand. Although the low barriers to 
entry in the online world make it easy for scammers and incompetents to flog 
their wares and flawed advice, this medium can offer some helpful resources 
if you know where to look and how to discern the good from the not-so-good.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shutters numerous online 
scams, such as the one that bilked investors out of more than $3.5 million by 
promising to double investors’ money in four months in a fictitious security 
they called “prime bank.”
 
Although you may be smart enough to avoid offers that promise pie in the sky, 
you’re far more likely to fall for unsound financial advice, which is in abun-
dance online. You can find plenty of self-serving advertorial content and bad 
advice online, so you should be wary and cautious. The next section offers 
tips for evaluating Internet resources.
Evaluating online resources
Fraud and bad financial advice existed long before the Internet ever came 
around. The SEC describes online scams as “new medium, same message.” 
The tips in the following sections can help you find the nuggets of helpful 
online advice and avoid the land mines.
Checking out agendas
Get an idea of who’s behind a site before you trust its information. When nav-
igating the Internet for investment purposes, remember that financial service 
companies that want to sell you something erect the vast majority of sites. 
Thus, the “free” entrance fee to these sites is driven by companies wanting 
you to buy what they’re selling.

374
Part V: Investing Resources 
Some sites go to extraordinary lengths — including providing lots of informa-
tion and advice and attempting to conceal the identity of the company that 
runs the site — to disguise their agendas. Therefore, don’t turn to the Web 
for advice or opinions, which usually aren’t objective. Approach online finan-
cial calculators with skepticism. Most are simplistic and biased.
 
Many Web sites have icons that you can click to see some background on the 
site’s sponsor and to find out whether the site solicits potential advertisers. 
With a simple click, you can quickly see that a site purporting to be a refer-
ence service of the best small-company stocks in which to invest may be 
nothing more than an online Yellow Pages of companies that paid the site an 
advertising fee. Look for sites that exercise quality control in what they post 
and use sensible screening criteria for outside information or companies 
they list.
Just because every Tom, Dick, and Jane can easily and at relatively low cost 
set up an Internet site doesn’t mean that their Web sites and advice are 
worthy of your time. Not surprisingly, the financial companies with reputa-
tions for integrity offline are the ones that offer some of the best integrity 
online. For example, as we discuss later in this chapter, the leading and most 
investor-friendly investment companies often have the best education-
oriented Web sites.
Soliciting grassroots customer feedback
The Internet can be a useful place to do consumer research. The more 
enlightening message board conversations that we’ve encountered start with 
someone asking what others thought about particular financial service firms, 
such as investment dealers. If you’re investigating a certain financial service, 
the Internet can be an efficient way to get feedback from other people who 
have experience dealing with that firm.
 
To find a dozen people offline who have done business with a given firm, 
you’d probably have to speak with hundreds of people. Online, finding cus-
tomers is a snap. Those who feel wronged by a particular firm are more than 
willing to share their gripes through sites such as www.PlanetFeedback.
com. As in the offline world, though, don’t believe everything you hear, and 
watch out for employees of a given firm who post flattering comments about 
their firms and dis the competition.
Verifying advice and information offline
 
Enhance the value of the online information you gather by verifying it else-
where. You can do some fact checking both online and offline. For example, if 
you’re contemplating the purchase of some stock based on financial data you 
read on an investing site, first check out those numbers at the library or at one 
of the Web sites we recommend later in this chapter.

375
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
Lots of Internet investment advice (and most of the scams) focus on smaller 
companies and investment start-ups; unfortunately, these are often the most 
difficult businesses to locate information about. In the United States, the SEC 
requires companies that are raising less than $1 million to file a Form D. To 
inquire whether a company has filed Form D, call the SEC’s Office of Investor 
Education and Advocacy at 202-551-8090 or send an e-mail to publicinfo@
sec.gov. Also check with the province’s or state’s securities regulator. For 
contact information for provincial and state regulators, you may call the North 
American Securities Administrators Association at 202-737-0900 or visit its Web 
site at www.nasaa.org/QuickLinks/ContactYourRegulator.cfm.
And if something does sound too good to be true, check out and possibly 
report your concerns to Internet fraud-fighting organization sites. In addi-
tion to the SEC’s Web site, check out the National Association of Securities 
Dealers Regulation Web site (www.nasdr.com) and the National Consumers 
League’s Fraud Information Center (www.fraud.org; 800-876-7060).
Unfortunately, here in Canada, we are now only starting discussions about 
having a national body overseeing the securities industry. Worse, our regula-
tory system is a patchwork, with a mix of federal and provincial bodies over-
seeing different aspects of the financial services and securities industries.
 
A good starting place for digging up information is the Ontario Securities 
Commission Web site at www.osc.gov.on.ca, as well as the regulators of 
the other provinces.
The best investment Web sites
Although you can live without the Internet and not suffer any financial or 
educational consequences, the quality of what’s on the Internet is gradually 
improving, and a handful of sites are setting a high standard.
 
In addition to the consumer advocacy sites that we recommend earlier in this 
chapter, here are our top picks for investing sites worthy of your online time:
 
✓ CorporateInformation.com is owned and operated by Wright Investors’ 
Services, which, in addition to managing money for affluent individu-
als, also publishes comprehensive reports on thousands of companies 
around the globe. Those wanting to do Web-based stock research will 
also enjoy the many links to other Internet investing information and 
research sites. This site also provides plenty of current business news.
 
✓ CXO Advisory’s excellent Web site (www.cxoadvisory.com) was cre-
ated and is run by Steve LeCompte. In addition to tracking macroeco-
nomic measures (such as corporate earnings, inflation rates, and so on) 

376
Part V: Investing Resources 
that affect stock prices, CXO Advisory also tracks the performance of 
numerous gurus’ and pundits’ stock market calls. For example, you can 
see how accurate prominent radio talk show hosts, television commen-
tators, magazine and online columnists, and others have been with their 
public stock market predictions.
 
 What we especially like about this site is that LeCompte isn’t selling 
anything that would create a conflict of interest. He’s a superb and 
detail-oriented analyst who enjoys doing and providing interesting stock 
market research. The more we’ve used his site, the more we’ve enjoyed 
it (comics included from his daughter) and found it useful.
 
✓ Globeinvestor.com covers most publicly traded stocks in both Canada 
and the United States. It’s easy to get a quick snapshot of a company’s 
stock, including a chart of its historical prices going back five years. 
You can also access quarterly and annual financial results, sift through 
the press releases archive, and search current news from The Globe 
and Mail. Like other good sites, globeinvestor.com makes intelligent 
use of technology by allowing you to search out stocks according to the 
price and company financial information you specify. If you’re looking 
for undervalued stocks, for instance, you can search for stocks trading 
below a certain price/earnings level, or stocks whose prices dropped by 
60 percent in the last year but that have started to recover. As well, you 
can sift companies according to how they’re growing in terms of profits, 
sales, and earnings.
 
✓ Globefund.com, a companion site to GlobeInvestor, is a straightforward 
and easy-to-navigate site for researching and screening funds. You can 
chart funds, compare them with others, look up ratings, and sift the 
Canadian fund world for those funds that meet your needs. In addition 
to profiles of funds and fund companies, you can look up data from the 
Globe’s 15-year fund review. This is an excellent resource, because look-
ing at a fund’s year-by-year performance for a decade and a half can offer 
you lots of insights into a fund’s behaviours and up and down markets.
 
✓ Morningstar is the behemoth of the mutual fund data business, with a 
Web site (www.morningstar.ca) that provides information and tools 
for mutual fund and stock research. In addition to providing more data on 
funds and stocks than you could ever possibly digest, this site includes 
short, insightful articles that are useful to more educated investors.
 
✓ The St. Louis Federal Reserve (www.research.stlouisfed.org) is 
the place to be for those who enjoy analyzing economic data. In addition 
to sometimes heady articles such as “Pandemic Economics: The 1918 
Influenza and Its Modern-Day Implications,” this site provides a treasure 
trove of current economic data along with graphs. The long-term graphs 
are particularly useful in providing folks with the often missing long-
term perspective in our daily diet of news.

377
 Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
 
 For example, we had to laugh the other day when we saw a headline 
online that screamed “U.S. Dollar at Record Low.” The article only men-
tioned the euro, and it never pointed out that the euro only came into 
existence in 1999! In fact, when you compare the U.S. dollar to a broad 
basket of other currencies represented by our trading partners, the 
U.S. dollar is still more than double the value it was a generation ago. 
Anyone can see this fact for themselves by examining the trade weighted 
exchange index (TWEXBMTH) on the St. Louis Fed site. (According to 
the site, the index is “a weighted average of the foreign exchange value 
of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of a broad group of major U.S. 
trading partners. Broad currency index includes the Euro Area, Canada, 
Japan, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Hong 
Kong, Malaysia, Brazil, Switzerland, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, 
Indonesia, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Sweden, Argentina, 
Venezuela, Chile, and Colombia.”)
 
✓ Sedar.com is an excellent one-stop shop for the many different docu-
ments that publicly traded Canadian companies and mutual funds must 
file. The information at Sedar (which stands for System for Electronic 
Document Analysis and Retrieval) is made available by the Canadian 
Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Depository for 
Securities (CDS).
Look who’s talking
If you’re at a cocktail party and you receive 
investing information and advice from some-
one you’ve just met, check him out to deter-
mine how much credence you should give to 
his words. And no matter how wise he seems, 
you shouldn’t judge him on the basis of just one 
conversation.
In the online world, you need to do the same, 
but you may have greater difficulty determin-
ing who’s doing the talking and why. On some 
Internet sites, visitors may post comments and 
opinions on message boards (the online equiva-
lent of a big bulletin board).
As the National Association of Securities 
Dealers (NASD) says on its Web site, “In most 
instances, there is simply no way to uncover 
someone’s true identity. Are you getting infor-
mation from a broker, short seller, corporate 
insider, amateur investor, or stock touter?” 
You have to use a little induction and a lot of 
intuition. Start by discounting any advice from 
online posters who are totally anonymous. 
Pseudonyms are common online, and some 
salespeople try to hide their true identities.
Among the more popular message boards on 
the Internet are those where people debate 
and discuss the prospects for individual stocks. 
The postings play fast and loose with the facts. 
“Investors need to understand that, although 
they may be reading honest conversations, 
they could just as easily be looking at the work 
of a corporate insider, stock promoter, or short 
seller using an alias to deceive the unsuspect-
ing or to manipulate the market,” says the NASD 
Regulation unit.

 If you’re researching individual companies, you can find via this Web 
site all the corporate reports — annual reports and the like — that we 
discuss in Chapter 6. (Alternatively, of course, you may call the indi-
vidual companies that interest you and have them mail you the desired 
material.) All the files are in PDF format, meaning they each have to 
open in their own window, and scrolling can be a chore.
 
✓ U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) holds the annual and 
quarterly reports for all U.S. publicly held companies at its Web site 
(www.sec.gov).
 
 The SEC site isn’t pretty, and searching the Electronic Data Gathering, 
Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) database can be challenging, 
especially for the novice investor. But if you’re tenacious, you may find 
something that’s hard to come by on the Web these days: cold, hard 
facts and no spin.
Online investing geniuses?
Nowhere will you find more self-proclaimed 
investing geniuses than online. Here are some 
important perspectives and lessons to keep in 
mind as you surf the Web:
 ✓ Beware of promises of easy riches. To 
deter investors from mutual funds, one Web 
site says of its stock picking, “We hope to 
have put you in position to nearly double 
the S&P 500 . . . it’ll demand little research 
per year, and present you little, if any, long-
term risk.” If investing were that easy, we’d 
all be rich! And as any professional money 
manager knows first-hand, successfully 
managing a portfolio of individual stocks 
takes time, not just a few hours per year.
 ✓ Beware of bloated performance claims. 
Not surprisingly, many online investing 
pundits hype claimed returns from their 
investment recommendations. If you can’t 
independently verify a performance claim, 
don’t believe it. Also, keep in mind that even 
if performance numbers are indeed accu-
rate, calculated returns often overlook 
trading commissions and taxes (which can 
be especially high for sites that advocate 
selling investments after holding them for 
less than one year).
 ✓ Successful investing doesn’t require fol-
lowing the market closely. Buying and 
holding index or other quality mutual funds 
for many years doesn’t take much review 
time — perhaps as little as an hour once 
per year to read the fund’s annual report. 
The daily and even minute-by-minute track-
ing of stock prices on many sites causes 
investors to lose sight of the long term and 
the big picture (although it draws more visi-
tors to the site, which satisfies advertisers 
and enriches the site owners).
The bottom line? Be skeptical of financial 
prognosticators, online or off. Like politicians, 
they’re out to make themselves look as good as 
possible, taking credit when things go well and 
blaming external forces when they don’t. For an 
independent assessment of a supposed guru’s 
investment picks, check out CXO Advisory, dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter, and Hulbert’s 
Financial Digest. See Chapter 17 for more about 
investment newsletters.

Part VI
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens contains shorter chapters, each 
including about ten items on important investing top-
ics that don’t quite fit elsewhere in the book. The topics in 
this part cover the psychological issues to overcome to 
be a successful investor, what you need to know when 
you’re considering selling an investment, and advice for 
investing during a down market.

Chapter 20
Ten Investing Obstacles 
to Conquer
In This Chapter
▶ Putting your faith in experts
▶ Letting your emotions guide your investment decisions
▶ Giving up when the market takes a plunge
▶ Ignoring your financial big picture
Just as with raising children or in one’s career, “success” with personal 
investing is in the eye of the beholder. In our work as financial instructors 
and writers, we’ve come to define successful investors as people who, with 
a modest commitment of time, develop an investment plan to accomplish 
financial and personal goals and earn returns commensurate with the risk 
they’re willing to accept.
In this chapter, we point out ten common obstacles that may keep you from 
fully realizing your financial goals, and we share tips and advice for 
overcoming those obstacles on the road to investing success.
Trusting Authority
Some investors assume that an adviser is competent and ethical if she has a
lofty title (financial consultant, vice president, and so on), dresses well, and 
works in a snazzy office. Such accessories are often indicators of salespeople — 
not objective advisers — who recommend investments that will earn them 
big commissions that come out of your investment dollars.
Additionally, if you put too much trust in an adviser, you may not research 
and monitor your investments as carefully as you should. Figuring that Mr. 
Vice President is an expert, some investors go along without ever questioning 
his advice or watching what’s going on with their investments.

382
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
You should also question authority elsewhere in the investment busi-
ness. Too many investors blindly follow analysts’ stock recommendations 
without considering the many conflicts of interest that such investment 
dealer employees have. Investment dealer analysts are often cheerleaders 
for buying various companies’ stocks because their firms are courting the 
business of new stock and bond issuance of the same companies. And just 
because a big-name accounting firm has blessed a company’s financial state-
ments (Nortel) or a company’s CEO says everything is fine (Bear Stearns) 
doesn’t make a firm’s financial statements accurate or its conditions sound.
 
You can’t possibly evaluate the competence and agenda of someone you hire 
until you understand the lay of the land. You can’t possibly know for sure that 
an analyst’s report or a professional service firm’s recommendation or approval 
of a company is worth the paper it’s printed upon. Read good publications (see 
Part V) on the topic to master the jargon and figure out how to evaluate 
investments. Seek independent second opinions before you act on someone’s 
recommendations. If you’re in the market for a investment adviser, be sure to 
read Chapter 9.
Getting Swept Up by Euphoria
Feeling strength and safety in numbers, some investors are lured into buying 
hot stocks and sectors (for example, industries like technology, health care, 
biotechnology, retail, and so on) after major price increases. Psychologically, 
it’s reassuring to buy into something that’s going up and gaining accolades. 
The obvious danger with this practice is buying into investments selling at 
inflated prices that too soon deflate.
In North American stock markets, by the late 1990s investors were getting 
spoiled with gains year after year in excess of the historic average annual 
return of 9 to 10 percent. Numerous surveys conducted during this period 
showed that many investors expected to earn returns in the range of 15 to 
20 percent annually, nearly double the historic average. As always happens, 
though, after a period of excessively high returns such as those of the 1990s — 
which were fuelled by the tech bubble — returns were below average in the 
subsequent period beginning in 2000 (and were quite negative in the early 
2000s). During the market slump in the early 2000s, real estate–related stocks 
continued to do well; some folks mistakenly believed that the housing sector 
was immune to setbacks and were surprised by the slump in that sector in 
the late 2000s.
For many years, Tony has written a column for The Globe and Mail’s “Report 
on Business” about the investing approach, philosophy, and experiences of 
Canadians. Called “Me and My Money,” the column looks at how different 

383
 Chapter 20: Ten Investing Obstacles to Conquer 
people — from homemakers to bus drivers to engineers — decide what to 
invest in, and why.
He also asks them to pick one great investment move, and one really bad 
mistake. As to what led to their “worst move,” many investors blame it on 
the same general error: “I didn’t know anything about it, but everybody was 
saying it was going to go higher!” And what did they have to say about their 
best investment move? Typically, it’s an investment they understood, had 
reasonable expectations for, and invested in for the long term!
 
Develop an overall allocation among various investments (especially diversi-
fied mutual funds), and don’t make knee-jerk decisions to change your alloca-
tion based on what the latest hot sectors are. If anything, de-emphasize or 
avoid stocks and sectors that are at the top of the performance charts. Think 
back to the last time you went bargain shopping for a consumer item — you 
looked for value, not high prices. See Chapter 5 to find out how to spot good 
values in the financial markets and speculative bubbles to avoid.
Being Overconfident
As we discuss in Part V, newsletters, books, and even some financial peri-
odicals lead investors to believe that you can be the next Peter Cundill or 
Warren Buffett if you follow a simple stock-picking system. The advent of the 
Internet and online trading capabilities has spawned a whole new generation 
of short-term (sometimes even same-day) traders.
In our work, we’ve come across plenty of people who lost a lot of money 
after they had an early winner and had attributed that early success to 
their investing genius. These folks usually wake up to the fact that no one is 
blessed with supernatural ability to pick winning investments only after great 
and humbling losses.
 
If you have the speculative bug, earmark a small portion of your portfolio (no 
more than 10 to 20 percent) for more aggressive investments. See Chapter 5 
for more information on questions to help you decide whether you or some-
one you know has a gambling problem.
Giving Up When Things Look Bleak
Inexperienced or nervous investors may be tempted to bail out when it 
appears that an investment isn’t always profitable and enjoyable. Some inves-
tors dump falling investments precisely at the times when they should be 

384

doing the reverse — buying more. Whenever the stock market drops more 
than a few percentage points in a short period, it attracts a lot of attention, 
which then leads to concern, anxiety, and in some cases, panic. Corrections 
in excess of 10 percent, such as happened throughout 2007, 2008, and 2009, 
lead to all sorts of hand wringing and gloom-and-doom talk.
Investing always involves uncertainty. Many people forget this, especially 
during good economic times. We find that investors are more likely to feel 
more comfortable with riskier investments, such as stocks, when they recog-
nize that all investments carry uncertainty and risk — just in different forms.
 
History has repeatedly proved that continuing to buy stocks during down 
markets increases your long-term returns. The worst thing you can do in a 
slumping market is to throw in the towel.
Unfortunately, the short-term focus that the media so often takes causes 
some investors to worry that their investments are in shambles during the 
inevitable bumps in the road. As we discuss in Part V, the media are often 
to blame because they hype short-term events and blow those events out of 
proportion to captivate viewers and listeners. Leading up to the huge col-
lapse of the stock market in the fall of 2008, for example, you would have 
been hard-pressed to find any warning signs of the coming collapse in the 
papers or on business television. And when the markets plummeted, head-
lines and TV reporters couldn’t get enough of telling readers and viewers 
how bad things had become due to the credit crisis.
History has shown that financial markets recover; recovery is just a question 
of time. If you invest for the long term, then the last six weeks — or even the 
last couple of years — is a short period. Plus, countless studies demonstrate 
that no one can predict the future, so you gain little from trying to base your 
investment plans on predictions. In fact, you can lose more money by trying 
to time the markets.
Larger-than-normal market declines hold a significant danger for investors: 
They may encourage decision making that’s based on emotion rather than 
logic. Just ask anyone who sold after the stock market collapsed in 1987 — 
the stock markets dropped over 30 percent in a matter of weeks in the fall of 
that year. Since then, even with the significant drop in 2008 of over 40 
percent — stock markets have still risen threefold!
 
Investors who can’t withstand the volatility of riskier growth-oriented invest-
ments, such as stocks, may be better off not investing in such vehicles to 
begin with. Examining your returns over longer periods helps you keep the 
proper perspective. If a short-term downdraft in your investments depresses 
you, avoid tracking your investment values closely. Also, consider investing 
in highly diversified, less-volatile funds that hold stocks worldwide as well as 
bonds (see Chapter 8).

 Chapter 20: Ten Investing Obstacles to Conquer 
Refusing to Accept a Loss
Although some investors realize that they can’t withstand losses, and then sell 
at the first signs of trouble, other investors find that selling a losing investment 
is so painful and unpleasant that they continue to hold a poorly performing 
investment, despite the investment’s poor future prospects. Psychological 
research backs this up — people find the pain of accepting a given loss twice 
as intense as the pleasure of accepting a gain of equal magnitude.
 
Analyze your lagging investments to identify why they perform poorly. If a 
given investment is down because similar ones are also in decline, hold on to 
it. However, if something is inherently wrong with the investment — such as 
high fees or poor management — make taking the loss more palatable by 
remembering two things:
 
✓ If your investment is not in an RRSP or other tax-protected plan, you can 
use the loss to offset the tax you would otherwise have to pay on profits 
you’ve made on other investments.
 
✓ Consider the “opportunity cost” of continuing to keep your money in a 
lousy investment — that is, what returns can you get in the future if you 
switch to a “better” investment?
Overmonitoring Your Investments
The investment world seems so risky and fraught with pitfalls that some 
people believe that closely watching an investment can help alert them to 
impending danger. “The constant tracking is not unlike the attempt to relieve 
anxiety by fingering worry beads. Yet paradoxically, it can increase emotional 
distress because it requires a constant state of vigilance,” says psychologist 
Dr. Paul Minsky.
In our work, we see that investors who are the most anxious about their 
investments and most likely to make impulsive trading decisions are the ones 
who watch their holdings too closely, especially those who monitor prices 
daily. The proliferation of Internet sites and stock market cable television 
programs offering up-to-the-minute quotations gives these investors even 
more temptation to overmonitor investments.
 
Restrict your “diet” of financial information and advice. Quality is far more 
important than quantity. Watching the daily price gyrations of investments is 
akin to eating too much junk food — doing so may satisfy your short-term 
cravings but at the cost of your long-term health. Remember that the goal of 
the minute-by-minute market “updates” is not to help you make more money, 

386
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
but to help media companies sell more advertising. If you invest in diversified 
mutual funds (see Chapter 8), you really don’t need to examine your fund’s 
performance more than once or twice per year. An ideal time to review your 
funds is when you receive their annual or semi-annual reports. Although many 
investors track their funds daily or weekly, far fewer read their annual reports. 
Reading these reports can help you keep a long-term perspective and gain 
some understanding of why your funds perform as they do and how they com-
pare to major market averages.
Being Unclear about Your Goals
Investing is more complicated than simply setting your financial goals 
(see Chapter 3) and choosing solid investments to help you achieve them. 
Awareness and understanding of the less tangible issues can maximize your 
chances for investing success.
 
In addition to considering your goals in a traditional sense (such as when you 
want to retire and how much of your kids’ university costs you want to pay), 
before you invest, you should also consider what you want and don’t want to 
get from the investment process. Do you treat investing as a hobby or simply 
as another one of life’s tasks, such as maintaining your home? Do you enjoy 
the intellectual challenge of picking your own stocks? Don’t just ponder these 
questions on your own; discuss them with family members, too — after all, 
you’re all going to have to live with your decisions and investment results.
Ignoring Your Real Financial Problems
We know plenty of high-income earners, including more than a few who earn 
six figures annually, who have little to invest. Some of these people have 
high-interest debt outstanding on credit cards and auto loans, yet they spend 
endless hours researching and tracking investments.
We also know many people who built significant personal wealth despite having 
modest-paying jobs. The difference: the ability to live within their means.
If you don’t earn a high income, you may be tempted to think that you can’t 
save. Even if you are a high-income earner, you may think that you can hit an 
investment home run to accomplish your goals or that you can save more if 
you can bump up your income. This way of thinking justifies spending most 
of what you earn and saving little now. Investing is far more exciting than 
examining your spending and making cutbacks. If you need help coming 
up with more money to invest, see the latest edition of our book Personal 
Finance For Canadians For Dummies (published by Wiley).

Overemphasizing Certain Risks
Saving money is only half the battle. The other half is making your money 
grow. Over long time periods, earning just a few percent more makes a big 
difference in the size of your nest egg. Earning inflation-beating returns is 
easy to do if you’re willing to invest in stocks, real estate, and small busi-
nesses. Figure 20-1 shows you how much more money you’ll have in 25 years 
if you can earn investment returns that are greater than the rate of inflation 
(which has been averaging about 3 percent).

As we discuss in Chapter 2, ownership investments (stocks, real estate, and 
small business) have historically generated returns greater than the inflation 
rate by 6 percent or more, while lending investments (savings accounts 
and bonds) tend to generate returns of only 1 to 2 percent above inflation. 
However, some investors keep too much of their money in lending invest-
ments out of fear of holding an investment that can fall greatly in value. 
Although ownership investments can plunge in value, you need to keep in 
mind that inflation and taxes eat away at your lending investment balances.
Believing in Gurus
Stock market declines, like earthquakes, bring all sorts of prognosticators, 
soothsayers, and self-anointed gurus out of the woodwork, particularly among 
those in the investment community, such as newsletter writers, who have 
something to sell. The words may vary, but the underlying message doesn’t: “If 
you had been following my sage advice, you’d be much better off now.”

388
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
People spend far too much of their precious time and money in pursuit of a 
guru who can tell them when and what to buy and sell. Peter Lynch, the former 
manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, amassed one of the best long-term stock 
market investing track records. His stock-picking ability allowed him to beat 
the market averages by just a few percent per year. However, even he says that 
you can’t time the markets, and he acknowledges knowing many pundits who 
have correctly predicted the future course of the stock market “once in a row”!
Clearly, in the world of investing, the most successful investors earn much 
better returns than the worst ones. But what may surprise you is that you 
can end up much closer to the top of the investing performance heap than 
the bottom if you follow some relatively simple rules, such as regularly 
saving and investing in low-cost growth investments. In fact, by doing so you 
can beat many of the full-time investment professionals.

Chapter 21
Ten Things to Consider When 
You’re Selling an Investment
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding your investment goals and other big-picture issues
▶ Selling for the right reasons
▶ Factoring taxes into your profit
▶ Finding a reliable adviser
You can and should hold good investments for years and decades. Each 
year, people sell trillions of dollars’ worth of investments. Our experience 
speaking with people about their investments suggests that too many people 
sell for the wrong reasons and hold on to investments that they should sell. 
In this chapter, we highlight important issues to consider when you 
contemplate selling your investments.
Remembering Your Preferences 
and Goals
 
If your life has changed since the last time you took a good look at your invest-
ment portfolio (or you’ve inherited investments), your current portfolio may 
no longer make sense for you. We generally recommend that you review your 
holdings once a year. Don’t make quick decisions about selling — take your time 
and be sure that you understand tax and other ramifications before you sell.
The time it takes you to manage your portfolio, for example, is a vital matter 
if you’re starved for time or weary of managing time-consuming investments. 
Leo, for example, loved to research, track, and trade individual stocks — 
until his daughter was born. Then Leo realized how many hours his hobby 

390
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
was taking away from his family, and that realization put his priorities into 
perspective. Leo now invests in time-friendly mutual funds and doesn’t follow 
them like a hawk.
In contrast, Mary loves investing in real estate because she enjoys the challenge 
of researching, selecting, and managing her properties. She works in a job where 
she has to put up with lots of controlling, stressed-out bosses. For Mary, real 
estate isn’t just a profitable investment; it’s also a way of expressing herself and 
growing personally.
Maintaining Balance in Your Portfolio
A good reason to sell an investment is to allow you to better diversify your 
portfolio. Suppose that before reading this book, you purchased a restaurant 
stock every time you read about one, or even just ate in one in which you’d 
enjoyed the cooking! Now your portfolio resembles several bad strip malls, 
and restaurant stocks comprise 80 percent of your holdings. Or maybe, 
through your job, you’ve accumulated such a hefty chunk of stock in your 
employer that this one stock now overwhelms the rest of your investments.
It’s time for you to diversify. Sell off some of the holdings you have too much 
of and invest the proceeds in solid investments, such as those that we recom-
mend in this book. If you think your employer’s stock is going to be a supe-
rior investment, holding a big chunk is your gamble. At a minimum, review 
Chapter 6 to see how to evaluate a particular stock. But remember to con-
sider the consequences if you’re wrong about your employer’s stock.
 
Conservative investors often keep too much of their money in bank accounts, 
GICs, and the like. Read Chapter 3 to come up with an overall investment 
strategy that fits with the rest of your personal financial situation.
Deciding Which Investments Are Keepers
Often, people are tempted to sell an investment for the wrong reasons. One 
natural human tendency is to want to sell investments that have declined in 
value. Some people fear a further fall, and they don’t want to be affiliated with 
a loser, especially when money is involved. We think this reaction resembles 
the phenomenon of piling into the lifeboats when a ship springs a leak.
 
Step back, take some deep breaths, and examine the merits of the investment 
you’re considering selling. If an investment is otherwise still sound, why bail 
out when prices are down and a sale is going on? What are you going to do 
with the money? If anything, you should be contemplating buying more of 

391
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When You’re Selling an Investment
such an investment. Don’t make a decision to sell based on your current emo-
tional response, especially to recent news events. If bad news has recently hit, 
it’s already old news. Don’t base your investment holdings on such transitory 
events.
Use the criteria for finding good investments in this book to evaluate the 
worthiness of your current holdings. If an investment is fundamentally sound, 
don’t sell it.
 
A better reason to sell an investment is that it comes with high fees relative to 
comparable investments. For example, if you own a bond mutual fund that is 
socking it to you with fees of 2 percent per year or more, check out Chapter 8 
to discover high-performing, lower-cost funds.
Tuning In to the Tax Consequences
When you sell investments that you hold outside a tax-sheltered retirement 
plan, such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), taxes should be 
one factor in your decision. (See Chapter 3 to find out about tax rates that 
apply to the sale of an investment as well as to the distributions that invest-
ments make.) If the investments are inside a retirement plan or other account 
or plan that’s sheltered from taxation, taxes aren’t an issue unless you’re 
withdrawing funds from the plan.
 
Just because you pay tax on a profit from selling an investment that’s not 
inside a tax-sheltered plan or account doesn’t mean that you should avoid sell-
ing. With real estate you live in, you can often avoid paying taxes on the profit 
you make (see Chapters 10 and 11). With stocks and mutual funds, things get a 
little more complex.
Figuring Out What Shares Cost
If you’re selling stock, your capital gain is simply the difference between what 
you receive less what you paid when you bought the investment, along with 
any fees or commission. The purchase cost, plus any extra fees you incur 
when buying and selling it, is called the adjusted cost base. If you’ve bought 
shares in the same company at different times — and at different prices — 
you’ll need to do a little math to calculate your adjusted cost base. Each 
time you make another purchase of the same investment, you have to add 
together your total number of shares or units and divide them by your total 
cost to that point to come up with an average.

392
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Say you bought 1,000 shares of Bombardier for $5 a share including any com-
missions. Now suppose the stock rose to $6 and you bought another 1,000 at 
$6 a share including associated costs. You would now own 2,000 shares for a 
total cost of $11,000. Here’s how to determine your adjusted cost base:
(Initial purchase + commissions/fees)
Total number of shares/units
+ (Subsequent purchase price + commissions/fees
Or, to apply it to the example:
$5,000 + $6,000
2,000
= $5.50
Selling Investments with Hefty Profits
Of course, no one likes to pay taxes, but if an investment you own has appre-
ciated in value, someday you’ll have to pay tax when you sell it. Capital gains 
tax applies when you sell an investment at a higher price than you paid for 
it. As we explain in Chapter 3, your capital gains tax rate is different from the 
tax rate you pay on ordinary income (such as from employment earnings or 
interest on bank savings accounts).
Odds are, the longer you’ve held securities such as stocks, the greater the 
capital gains you’ll have, because stocks tend to appreciate over time. If all 
your assets have appreciated greatly, you may resist selling to avoid taxes. 
However, if you need money for a major purchase, sell what you need and 
pay the tax. Even if you’re in the highest marginal tax bracket, your tax rate 
on those profits is only about 23 percent, so you’ll have lots left. Before you 
sell, however, do some rough figuring to make sure that you’ll have enough 
money left to accomplish what you want.
 
If you hold a number of assets, in order to diversify and meet your other finan-
cial goals, give preference to selling your largest holdings with the smallest 
capital gains. If you have some securities that have profits and some that have 
losses, you can sell some of each to offset the profits with the losses.
Cutting Your (Securities) Losses
Perhaps you own some turkeys in your portfolio. If you need to raise cash for 
some particular reason, you may consider selling some securities at a loss. 
You can use these losses to offset gains you’ve made — or will make in the 
future — on the sale of other securities.

393
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When You’re Selling an Investment
Your actual loss when it comes to the tax department is the difference 
between what you paid for the investment — the adjusted cost base — and 
what you received when you sold it, after deducting commissions and other 
fees involved in selling.
Just as you take half of any capital gain before calculating any taxes due, 
you can use only one-half of your loss to offset these taxable capital gains. 
However, if you can’t use some or all of your allowable capital losses in a 
given year, it’s not wasted. In general, you can’t use capital losses to reduce 
ordinary income. But you can apply a capital loss against taxable capital 
gains you had in any of the three prior years. You can also carry the allow-
able capital loss forward indefinitely, and use it to offset taxable capital gains 
in any future year. The current amount of allowable capital losses that you 
have yet to apply against taxable capital gains is known as your net capital 
losses.
If you own a security that has ceased trading and appears worthless (or 
you’ve made a loan that hasn’t been repaid), you can likely deduct this loss. 
Peruse the latest edition of Tax Tips For Canadians for Dummies (Wiley) for 
more information on what losses are deductible and how to claim these 
losses on your annual tax return.
Selling Investments with Unknown Costs
You may not know what some investments originally cost you or the person 
who bought them and later gave them to you. If you can’t find that original 
statement, start by calling the firm where the investment was purchased. 
Whether it’s an investment dealer or mutual fund company, the company 
should be able to send you copies of old account statements, although you 
may have to pay a small fee for this service.
Also, increasing numbers of investment firms, especially mutual fund compa-
nies, can tell you upon the sale of an investment what its original cost was. 
The cost generally calculated is the average cost for the shares you pur-
chased. See Tax Tips For Canadians For Dummies for more ideas of what to do 
when original records aren’t available for other assets, such as real estate.
Recognizing Dealer Differences
If you’re selling securities such as stocks and bonds, you need to know that 
some dealers charge more — in some cases, lots more — to sell. Even if the 
securities you want to sell currently reside at a high-cost investment dealer, 

394
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
you can transfer them to a discount dealer. See Chapter 9 to read about the 
different types of investment dealers and how to select the best one for your 
situation.
Finding a Trustworthy Financial Adviser
You aren’t stupid. Before you picked up this book, you may have considered 
yourself an investing dummy. We didn’t, and we still don’t, but hopefully you 
feel less like a dummy after reading this book. If you delegate your invest-
ment decision making to an adviser, you’re likely to be disappointed.
 
Few financial advisers offer objective and knowledgeable advice. Unfortunately, 
if you’re grappling with a selling decision, finding a competent and impartial 
financial adviser to help with the decision is about as difficult as finding a 
politician who doesn’t accept special-interest money. Most financial consul-
tants work on commission, which can cloud their judgment. And among the 
minority of fee-based advisers, a good number manage money, which creates 
other conflicts of interest. The more money you give them to invest and manage, 
the more money these advisers make. If you need advice about whether to sell 
some investments, consider turning to a tax or financial adviser who works on 
an hourly basis.

Ten Tips for Investing in 
a Down Market
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping a level head amid the doom and gloom
▶ Identifying and fixing flaws in your portfolio
▶ Understanding why value stocks have less downside risk
U
nless there’s a lot of other breaking news, sharp drops in the stock 
market make headlines — stock market gyrations are great media 
fodder. Every day the market environment is different, and new stocks are 
plunging and rising. And now, with more individuals holding stocks through 
company and personal retirement plans, the media has a captive, concerned 
audience. In this chapter, we discuss how to maximize your chances for 
investing success when stocks take a turn for the worse.
Don’t Panic
No one enjoys turning on the car radio, clicking the television set on, or 
logging on to the Internet and getting this news: “Stocks plunge. The 
Toronto Stock Exchange plummeted 800 points today.”
Don’t panic — it’s just one day’s events. Just because a home burned to the 
ground recently in your town and the news is being broadcast over all the 
local media, you probably wouldn’t start living on the street out of fear of 
being at home during a fire. But you might take some sensible precautions, 
such as installing smoke alarms and repairing any malfunctioning appliances 
that might cause a fire, to ensure that your home isn’t likely to become the 
next fire department statistic. Likewise, don’t shun stocks, which produce 
terrific long-term returns, just because of the down periods. As we discuss 
in Chapter 2, risk and return go hand in hand. If you want wealth-building 

396
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
investments that provide superior long-term returns, you must be willing to 
accept risk (that is, volatility and down periods).
Although other wealth-building investments, such as real estate and small 
businesses, go through significant declines, you generally see few headlines 
on their daily price movements. A good reason for this is that no one reports 
on the pricing of real estate and small businesses minute by minute every 
business day, as is done with stock prices.
Keep Your Portfolio’s Perspective in Mind
If you follow our advice, your portfolio will consist of diversified stock hold-
ings, including some international stocks, preferably through mutual funds, 
along with some bonds.
Consider the perspective of one investor during the summer of 2002 when 
the stock market was dropping precipitously. “I just saw that the S&P 500 is 
now down 28 percent so far this year, and the NASDAQ is down 34 percent,” 
he commented, with the not unusual follow-up question: “Should I sell?”
He was quite surprised to find that, after some number crunching, his portfolio 
of stocks and bonds was down just 8 percent for the year. Now, mind you, 
we’re not trying to minimize or trivialize the fact that this investor had lost 
money so far that year. However, he overlooked the fact that the bonds in his 
portfolio had actually increased in value, as had some of his stock funds that 
were invested in value-oriented stocks. Please see Chapter 8 for tips on how 
to build a diversified mutual fund portfolio.
View Major Declines as Sales
 
Unlike retail stores, which experience bigger-than-normal crowds when prices 
are reduced, fewer investors, especially individual investors, want to buy 
stocks after they’ve suffered a sharp decline. When stock prices decline, don’t 
get swept up in the pessimism. View declines as the financial markets having a 
sale on stocks. Stocks usually bottom when pessimism reaches a peak. The 
reason: Those who were motivated to sell have done so, and the major selling 
has exhausted itself.
Now, we’re not saying you should randomly buy just any stock after a decline. 
For example, as we discuss in Part II, we’re not advocates of buying individual 
stocks, especially a collection of stocks focused in the same industry (such as 
technology or auto manufacturing). When technology stocks started declining 

397
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Investing in a Down Market 
in 2000, some investors made the mistake of buying more of them after prices 
dropped 10 or 20 percent. Unfortunately, what such “buy on the dip” investors 
didn’t realize was that the technology stocks that they were buying were still 
grossly overpriced when measured by price/earnings ratios and other
valuation measures (see Chapter 5).
 
You’re best off buying stocks gradually over time through well-managed, 
diversified mutual funds (see Chapter 8). When the broad stock market suffers 
a substantial decline and stocks are at reduced prices — on sale — you can 
step up your buying.
Identify Your Portfolio’s Problems
Stock market declines can be effective at quickly exposing problems with 
your portfolio. For example, when technology stocks tumbled in the early 
2000s, we started getting questions from investors who had loaded up on 
these stocks and wanted to know what they should do with their holdings. 
Many of these investors kept thinking about how much more their technol-
ogy stocks were worth at their peak before the decline set in.
Our advice was to acknowledge the huge risk these investors were clearly 
taking by putting so many eggs in one basket. We also highlighted the dan-
gers of chasing after a hot sector, and pointed out that what is a hot sector 
today often becomes tomorrow’s laggard.
In addition to poorly diversified portfolios, a declining stock market can also 
expose the high fees you may be paying on your investments. Fewer investors 
care about getting whacked with fees amounting to, say, 2 percent annually 
when they’re making 20 percent year after year. But after a few years of low or 
negative returns, such high fees become quite painful and more obvious.
Avoid Growth Stocks If You 
Get Queasy Easily
In a sustained stock market slide (bear market), the stocks that get clobbered 
the most tend to be the ones that were most overpriced from the period of 
the previous market rise (bull market). Like fads such as hula hoops, pet 
rocks, and Cabbage Patch dolls, in each bull market, particular types of 
growth stocks, such as Internet companies or biotechnology companies, can 
be especially hot.

398
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Predicting the duration and magnitude of a bear market is nearly impossible. 
Consequently, wouldn’t it make sense to focus your stock investing on those 
stocks that produce solid long-term returns and that tend to decline less in a 
major market decline? So-called value stocks tend to be among the safer types 
of stocks to hold during a bear market. Value stocks generally have less down-
side risk because they typically pay higher dividends and have relatively 
greater underlying asset values in comparison to their stock valuations.
As has happened in some past bear markets, numerous value-oriented stocks 
actually appreciated during the bear market in the early 2000s. Please see 
Chapter 8 for our discussion of the different types of stocks and mutual funds 
that practice value stock investing.
Tune Out Negative, Hyped Media
When the stock market is crumbling, such as the huge declines seen in late 2008 
and early 2009, subjecting yourself to a daily diet of bad news and conflicting 
opinions about what to do next makes most investors do the wrong things. 
When major stock markets are really getting clobbered, it’s not unusual to find 
people saying something along these lines: “It seems that the civilized world 
as we know it is coming to an end. We have all this tension and conflict in the 
Middle East, there’s a war in Afghanistan, no one can believe company financial 
statements, the market keeps falling, and stocks are just too risky to hold. All I 
keep hearing is bad news when I turn on my television or go online. Shouldn’t I 
just sell my stocks and buy something else?”
If you find yourself saying something similar, as a friend of Tony’s did when 
the markets cratered in 2008, our advice is simple: Stop watching and focus-
ing on bad news. Just like a steady diet of junk food is bad for your physical 
health, a continuous stream of negative, hyped news is bad for your financial 
health. In our observation, dwelling on bad news doesn’t do such great things 
for people’s emotional health, either.
 
Conflict is always occurring somewhere in the world. The business world will 
always have unethical and corrupt company executives. Holding stocks 
always carries risk. That’s why those who see the glass as half full and who 
see the positive and not just the negative build wealth by holding stocks, real 
estate, and small business over the long term.

399
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Investing in a Down Market 
Ignore Large Point Declines — 
Consider the Percentages
It drives us crazy when the news media show a one-day chart of a major 
stock market index, such as the Toronto Stock Exchange Composite, on a day 
when the index drops a large number of points. In recent years, 200- and 300-
point drops in the TSX happened fairly frequently.
 
Look at the percentage decline in an index rather than at a point decline. 
Although 200 to 300 points sounds like a horrendous drop, such a drop 
amounts to a move of about 2 to 3 percent. No one likes losing that portion 
of their wealth invested in stocks in one day, but the percentage of change 
sounds less horrifying than the point change.
Don’t Believe You Need a Rich Dad 
to Be a Successful Investor
A young man wrote to Eric about an interview that he had read about the 
Rich Dad, Poor Dad series, by author Robert Kiyosaki. In the interview, 
Kiyosaki said that the rich are different from the rest of us because “They 
teach their children how to be rich. . . . These get-rich techniques include 
investing with leverage . . . and staying away from mutual funds . . . which are 
way too risky.”
The young man came from a humble background and had been salting money 
away in mutual funds through his company’s retirement plan. But he thought 
that he might be doomed to a lifetime of poverty after reading what the Rich 
Dad guru had to say. Here’s what we say.
We’ve known plenty of people over the years who came from non-wealthy 
families who built substantial wealth by living within their means and by 
investing in the three wealth-building assets that we focus on in this book: 
stocks, real estate, and small business.
With regard to mutual funds and retirement savings plans, in addition to his 
saying that they are way too risky, Kiyosaki also says, “Those vehicles are 
only good for about 20 percent of the population, people making $100,000 
or more.” We couldn’t disagree more. In fact, our experience is that mutual 
funds are tailor-made for non-wealthy people who don’t have the assets to 
properly create a diversified portfolio themselves.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Kiyosaki also says that he doesn’t like mutual funds because “Mutual funds 
have got no insurance from a stock market crash. To me, that’s sad, and I 
am concerned.” As we discuss in Parts I and II of this book, the best way to 
reduce the risk of investing in stocks is to diversify your holdings, not only in 
a variety of stocks, but also in other investments that don’t move in tandem 
with the stock market.
Kiyosaki claims that he invests with the benefit of insurance when investing 
in real estate. He says, “My banker requires me to have insurance from cata-
strophic losses.” This is a nonsensical comparison because such an insur-
ance policy would cover losses from say, a fire, but not a decline in market 
value of the real estate due to overall market conditions. Interestingly, 
Kiyosaki followers got clobbered by shunning stocks, which rose sharply in 
the mid-2000s, and piling into real estate, which levelled off and then dropped 
sharply in most areas.
(Re)Read Chapters 4 and 5
When the going gets tough in the stock market, you can easily lose perspec-
tive. Even if you’ve already read them, please go back and read Chapters 4 
and 5 again. These chapters explain how the stock market works and what 
influences stock prices in the short term versus the longer term. Be sure 
that you have the long-term perspective that you need to succeed with stock 
investing and that you really understand how the financial markets work.
Talk to People Who Care about You
Life’s challenging events can be humbling and sometimes depressing. 
Holding an investment that’s dropped a lot in value — whether it’s a stock, 
mutual fund, real estate, or small business — is one such event. But you 
don’t have to carry the burden yourself. Talk about your feelings with some-
one who understands and cares about you. Be clear about and communicate 
what you’re seeking — empathy, good listening, a sounding board, or advice.
