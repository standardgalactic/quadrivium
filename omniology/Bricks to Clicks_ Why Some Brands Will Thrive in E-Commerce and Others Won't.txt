Acknowledgments
Writing a book is a challenging undertaking, but building a company is an even 
more challenging one. In undertaking both efforts, I have been truly humbled 
by the ideas, support, and help from our employees, clients, investors, advisers, 
friends, and family. Neither this book nor my company, Content Analytics, 
would have been possible without you.
Far too many of you have helped in more ways than I can count for me 
to list you all here. To all of you: thank you. I have learned so much from 
your involvement with Content Analytics and am deeply grateful for your 
willingness to share your deep business knowledge, profound insights, and 
creativity. Thank you to Mark Stamps for his technical review and to the 
team at Apress for their hard work in making this book a reality.
I would especially like to thank my beautiful and inspiring wife, Nicole, for 
all of her help and support.

Introduction
As the founder and CEO of Content Analytics, the “Control Center for 
eCommerce,” I’ve been privileged to work firsthand with the world’s largest 
brands and retailers as they navigate the shift from bricks to clicks. Our clients 
span a diverse set of verticals, from P&G, Clorox, and PepsiCo in consumer 
packaged goods (CPG) to Levi’s in apparel, Samsung and Energizer in electron-
ics, Mattel in toys, Walmart in retail, and many more.
In the process, we’ve developed an innovative new approach that helps our 
clients succeed online. Instead of dozens of different point solutions or a 
mishmash of homegrown spreadsheets and folders that are hard to manage, 
we bring a comprehensive, end-to-end solution for analytics (business intel-
ligence), content management, and reporting to e-commerce.
Some of our clients start out using just one alert or report, such as an out-of-
stock alert or a competitive price report. Others make a few content updates 
to improve their online product presence. As their e-commerce businesses 
expand, our platform future-proofs them, enabling them to scale their insights 
and operations at the same time.
Every day we learn from our clients about their challenges and opportunities. 
We update our software, training, and best practices to reflect their input and 
our own knowledge about how best to succeed in the fast-paced and highly 
competitive world of e-commerce.
In this book, I share my key learnings about what makes companies successful 
in navigating the shift from in-store to online—from bricks to clicks. It’s a tran-
sition that’s been years in the making, but it’s one that has taken on renewed 
urgency now that e-commerce represents more than 10 percent of U.S. retail 
purchasing and is the fastest-growing business segment for most suppliers and 
retailers.
You will learn about the following:
• 
How the most successful brands and retailers are trans-
forming their organizations to address the challenges of 
e-commerce—and how they’re leveraging e-commerce 
to drive organizational transformation

xiv
Introduction
• 
How to bring new, high-potential technology platforms 
into your company with low risk
• 
How computerized algorithms are disrupting traditional 
channel management and how you can regain some of 
the control those algorithms have taken away
• 
Key e-commerce metrics and how to go about measur-
ing them
• 
How to manage your brand online and ensure brand 
integrity for your products across many different retail 
customers
• 
How the most successful companies are navigating the 
transition from in-store to online—companies I call the 
bricks-to-clicks companies
This book is not a guide on how to set up your own e-commerce store or 
how to make money in your spare time selling items online. This book is the 
story of how industry leaders are transforming their organizations—and the 
associated processes and technologies these organizations depend on—to be 
leaders in e-commerce. Think of it as good to great for e-commerce. I hope you 
enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Transforming 
the Organization
“If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of change on the 
inside, the end is near.”
—Jack Welch
Truth be told, I didn’t realize it was a sales meeting until it was all over. We 
were in one of those non-descript-looking conference rooms—long table, 
Aeron chairs, and a lot of very serious-looking people, most of whom I didn’t 
know. They asked a lot of questions. Where were we based? How many 
people did we have? How would our platform operate on a large scale?
I looked around the room. They were nodding at each other, trading messages 
through thin air. But which way was the meeting going? Did they like what they 
saw? Were they going to throw me out and laugh about it afterward?
And then, suddenly, it was over. Thanks for coming in. Nice to meet you. Hope 
to see you again. After most of the people had filed out, the guy who had 
brought me in to present turned to me. This was the moment, I thought. The 
moment when he’s going to say no.
But instead he said, “How do you feel about doing a pilot? Can you send us a 
statement of work?” I breathed a small sigh of relief. Man, I thought, we might 
just make it. Because I wasn’t sitting in any conference room. I was sitting in a 
conference room at Walmart.com, the e-commerce arm of the world’s largest 
retailer.

Looking back over the past three years, the engagements that have been most 
successful for our clients have started with meetings not unlike the one we 
had that day. Granted, our slides have gotten a little more polished. We’ve 
built a comprehensive platform—the “Control Center for eCommerce”—
used by the biggest retailers and brands in the world. And we’ve grown in 
scale, analyzing more than 500 million products instead of the 5,000 for that 
first meeting at Walmart.com.
But our premise remains the same. Share compelling insight with our clients 
that they can’t get anywhere else. Find alignment on vision. Work together to 
deliver solutions that help our clients transition from in-store to online.
We call the organizations that are navigating this transition most successfully 
bricks-to-clicks companies. Typically, they are doing less than 20 percent of their 
sales online but want to do more.
The Bricks-to-Clicks Companies
Here’s what the bricks-to-clicks companies are doing well:
• 
The bricks-to-clicks companies experiment obsessively. 
They don’t try just one approach. They try many 
different approaches in parallel. E-commerce is a world 
of experimentation.
• 
The bricks-to-clicks companies adapt quickly. One supplier 
we work with theorized that sales from third-party sellers—
marketplace sellers—might be eating into their growth. 
They immediately had us implement a new capability so 
they could measure the impact of marketplace sales on their 
first-party business. It turned out they were exactly right and 
now they have the data to prove it.
• 
The bricks-to-clicks companies view growth in e-commerce 
as a long-term trend that is not going away. Just a few 
years ago when we were first talking to clients about 
Content Analytics, some told us that the time still wasn’t 
right for e-commerce—especially in areas like grocery—
because there simply wasn’t enough money being spent 
on it to move the needle. Now we meet with directors 
and executives at these same companies whose jobs are 
dedicated to e-commerce. Many have built entire teams to 
address the specific needs of e-commerce.

• 
The bricks-to-clicks companies apply technology so 
they can scale. Many of the clients we work with were 
trying to do brand audits, brand content updates, and 
other activities manually, one product at a time. They’ve 
found that those processes simply don’t scale. What’s 
more, they consume an enormous amount of time of 
the personnel tasked with marketing, merchandising, and 
sales. They’ve brought in technology to help them scale 
up and to free their valuable people to do the jobs they 
came to do.
• 
The bricks-to-clicks companies reduce their cycle times 
so they can operate at Internet speed. One supplier we 
work with told us they were used to getting a static 
brand audit once per year. Another supplier told us they 
were used to updating the content that showcases their 
products on retailer web sites once per year. Since they 
began working with us, both of these clients have used 
technology to accelerate their cycle times and are now 
able to receive brand audits, out-of-stock reports, and 
pricing reports and update their content on a daily basis.
• 
The bricks-to-clicks companies use e-commerce to reinvent 
their workflows, processes, platforms, and organizations. 
They see that a decade from now, e-commerce will have 
transformed not only the online shopping experience but 
the in-store shopping experience as well.
Partnering with the World’s Largest Company
That is only half the story. The other half of the story—the theme that has 
emerged from three years of working with Walmart, P&G, Clorox, Levi’s, 
Mattel, Samsung, and many other of the world’s leading brands—is that thought 
leaders at bricks-to-clicks companies not only have the vision required to 
see the future of e-commerce but also have the interest and ability to build 
consensus across their organizations that organizational transformation is 
required to compete in that future e-commerce world.
It is one thing for an individual to take an interest in our product and what it 
can do to help our clients operate in the world of e-commerce. It is another 
thing altogether for a group of individuals within an organization to agree to 
bring us and our platform in to help them drive that transformation, not just 
internally but across all their suppliers as well.

Chapter 1 | Transforming the Organization

That brings me back to that pivotal meeting at Walmart. As I walked out of 
the building that day, I realized two things. First, we were about to have the 
world’s largest retailer as our first paying customer. Second, we had better 
get to work building out our software platform to support immense scale. 
Providing insights for 5,000 products was one thing. Doing so for 5 million of 
them—and pretty soon 50 million of them—was going to be a much bigger, 
bet-the-company kind of challenge.
At the time, I was too excited to understand the implications of the meeting. 
But looking back I can see that Walmart did an amazing thing that day. They 
partnered with an early-stage company to accelerate getting the insights 
they needed. They did something that is difficult for even the nimblest of 
companies—they took a risk.
These days, now that we have a number of market-leading customers, things 
are different. But back then, partnering with us as an early-stage startup was 
no small feat. As the old saying goes, “No one ever got fired for buying from 
IBM.” Partnering with us meant getting us onboarded as a vendor, carving out 
time to meet with us on a regular basis, and convincing company leadership 
that we could deliver value not found anywhere else.
Over the years, people have asked me if it’s hard selling to large companies. 
The answer is that it’s not hard as long as we truly view our internal sponsors 
as partners.
Many startup founders come out of meetings with potential corporate 
sponsors wondering why their sponsors are so tough on them. They’re so 
tough because the questions they’re asking us are the same questions their 
peers, leadership teams, and procurement teams are going to ask them. Better 
that our sponsors ask us the tough questions early in the process so we can 
be prepared for them when they arise rather than waiting until someone else 
asks them and takes us out of contention later. A big part of our job is to build 
innovative technology that will help our customers beat their competition. 
But an even bigger part of our job is to help our customers bring those new 
capabilities into their organizations.
The next nine months were some of the toughest I’ve ever faced as a startup 
founder. First, we had to get through procurement at Walmart—that was the 
easy part. Second, we had to make our analytics platform work for millions 
of products, day in, day out. Third, we had to present all the data we were 
gathering in an easy-to-use and compelling way. That turned out to be the 
biggest challenge of all.
I met with people from Walmart almost every week. I made it a point to go 
in person because the best feedback came from these weekly conversations. 
Over the years, I have continued to meet with customers to get product 
feedback like this in person. Simply put, there is nothing like it.

As a buyer, any startup you work with will value the money you pay them. 
Money from customers is the best form of financing. After all, it doesn’t 
require a startup founder to give up any equity. And there’s nothing like a 
paying customer to help convince investors to invest! But equally valuable is 
the time that you as a buyer invest with a startup you’ve partnered with to 
provide input on product direction.
In customer meetings, I’m constantly taking notes on my smartphone, so much 
so that one of our customers once said, “If Dave writes it in his phone, it’s 
going to make it into the product in just a few weeks.” These days of course 
I’m careful to tell customers that I’m not busy doing e-mail or texting—I’m 
writing down their product feedback so I can get it back to our product team!
During the nine months of getting our platform to scale, we had some 
incredibly stressful weeks. For whatever reason, I got in the habit of wearing 
white dress shirts to my Walmart meetings. Our team always knew when I 
was going over to see Walmart before I told them. They could tell by the 
white dress shirt. Even our customers at Walmart found it amusing. One of 
them jokingly asked me if I owned any other dress shirts. I had to admit that 
my closet was full of white dress shirts!
The biggest challenge was preparing for the weekly meetings. To be ready for 
the meetings, we had to collect, analyze, and display the product data. Again, 
that’s not so hard to do for 5,000 products. But it was harder than we thought 
to do for millions and millions of products. Sometimes we’d get stuck in the 
data collection stage, other times in the analysis stage. A lot of the issues we 
faced stemmed from trying to move large amounts of data from one location 
to another. It turned out that a seemingly simple process took a lot longer 
than expected, until we made a key technical breakthrough that allowed us to 
leave all the data where it was and not move it around. From there on out, we 
were in good shape.
But just when we thought we had done everything we needed to do, we came 
across an even bigger challenge: how to communicate the insights we were 
generating in a form that the buyers, merchants, and merchant assistants at 
Walmart could act on.
■
■Note  When it comes to analytics, gathering the data is a challenge. But delivering insights in 
a way that business users can act on—that’s an even bigger challenge.
Showing these users row after row of output data simply wasn’t going to cut 
it. Instead, we needed to summarize the results in a compelling visual fashion. 
Only after that should we deliver the detailed action items.

Chapter 1 | Transforming the Organization

It was from that need that our Content Health audits, now the standard in 
the industry, were born (Figure 1-1). Content Health audits show our users, 
at a glance, how they’re doing and where their biggest opportunities are for 
improvement.
Expanding Our Reach
A company like Walmart is so large that frequently people from different 
groups or divisions rarely have a chance to interact with each other in 
person. Speaking of himself and his colleague, another vice president, a vice 
president at Walmart once told me, “Dave, we don’t meet up nearly as much 
as we should. You’re giving us a rare opportunity to get together and share 
ideas.” Put another way, the adoption and expansion within the organization 
of a new technology platform—especially one that is used for high-level 
key performance indicator (KPI) reporting—can be a key mechanism for 
individuals and even entire groups within large companies to collaborate.
In the case of Walmart, our product brings together colleagues from marketing, 
merchandising, buying, and technology development. For a long time, I thought 
the main purpose and benefit of expanding our reach within another company 
was so that we could drive more revenue. Only more recently did I come to 
understand that there is a larger benefit to the “land and expand” strategy.
Figure 1-1.  Content Analytics Content Health audit

The more the usage of a product expands within a company, the more valuable 
that product becomes to the company using it—not just to the company 
selling it. There is an efficiency of scale that occurs when large companies use 
a platform throughout their organization. Looked at another way, adopting a 
technology platform is a form of building consensus. Regardless of the individual 
value any one user derives from the platform, the organization as a whole has 
determined there is sufficient common value to adopt the platform across 
multiple groups. This is how internal expansion works within a company.
External expansion can be equally as important. In the fall of 2014, after we 
had raised our Series A round of financing, I drove up to Napa from our office 
in the SoMa district of San Francisco to see one of our angel investors, Joe 
Schoendorf. Joe had been a very successful partner for many years at venture 
capital firm Accel Partners (famous for putting early money into Facebook), 
and his wife Nancy Schoendorf had been a partner and managing director at 
Mohr Davidow Ventures with many successful investments herself. That day 
I had a specific topic I wanted to discuss with Joe and Nancy: how we could 
expand our target market.
In the heat of being excited about the insights our technology platform could 
bring to a retailer like Walmart, we had discovered (as should perhaps have 
been obvious earlier in the process) that the market for selling software to 
retailers was not that big. In fact, many of them seemed to be fast going out of 
business, with constant reminders of the ineffectiveness of their legacy brick-
and-mortar model in the form of headline-catching store closings numbering 
in the hundreds per retailer. Macy’s, Kohl’s, JCPenney—none was immune 
from the pressure of e-commerce.
Before his career as a venture capitalist, Joe had long before been a brand 
manager. As I told him about all the insights our analytics platform could 
provide, from out-of-stock to pricing data and from marketing metrics to 
competitive insight, Joe came to an interesting conclusion. Our biggest market, 
he observed, was not the retailers themselves but the hundreds of thousands 
of suppliers that made up their ecosystem. The Procter & Gambles, the 
Cloroxes, the Levi’s—there were far more of those companies than there were 
big retailers. What we were building, Joe observed, was not just an analytics 
platform but a complete brand management platform for e-commerce. We 
were providing the kind of insight brand managers had always wanted but 
found so difficult to get their hands on because of the challenges of gathering 
in-store shopping data.
But the Web was different. With the Web, instead of having to send tens of 
thousands of people into stores to gather pricing, inventory, and placement 
information, we could automate all that data collection with software. Not 
only that, but we could do it quickly, reliably, and at immense scale.

Chapter 1 | Transforming the Organization

From there was born the idea for the end-to-end platform that our product 
has become: the “Control Center for eCommerce.” We would offer analytics, 
content management, and reporting with a road map for capabilities such as 
listings management and dynamic pricing down the line.
■
■Note  Content Analytics provides an end-to-end platform for analytics, content management, 
and reporting in e-commerce.
I left our lunch realizing we had two markets to go after—retailers and 
suppliers. The more retailers we secured as customers, the more suppliers 
we would get, and the more suppliers we got as customers, the more likely it 
was that any given retailer would want to work with us. As I headed back to 
San Francisco, I felt invigorated. It would turn out that as big an opportunity as 
selling to retailers was, expanding to suppliers was even bigger.
Our product lent itself particularly well to this kind of external expansion. 
That’s because our Content Health reporting system identifies opportunities 
where suppliers can improve their online product presence.
As a result, buyers at retailers are inclined to share the Content Health reports 
with their suppliers so their suppliers know where they need to improve. On 
the one hand, we can provide sitewide analytics to our retail customers; on 
the other hand, we can drill down to a specific supplier and provide insight 
into how that supplier is doing relative to its peers and which specific items 
can be improved and how.
At our supplier customers, “land and expand” works in much the same 
way. We often start with just a few users—from shopper marketing, sales, 
supply chain, or e-commerce management. In some cases, our supplier users 
come from retailer-specific teams within their companies. These teams sell 
to and support their retail partners such as Amazon, Walmart, Jet, Target, 
and others. In other cases, our users have a more global function, managing 
e-commerce across two, three, or even as many as ten, twenty, or more 
retail partners.
Sometimes we’ll solve a specific point problem, such as an issue with 
out-of-stock items. Other times, we’ll provide a comprehensive business 
Dashboard (shown in Figure 1-2) that covers all of a company’s e-commerce 
metrics and allows users to drill down in specific areas, such as pricing or 
content health.

If we start with the broad Dashboard, we often find ourselves expanding to 
users who focus on specific functional areas, such as supply chain management. 
If we start out solving a specific issue, we later find customers asking us if 
we can help them solve other challenges, such as measuring price volatility 
or content health. Either case means an expansion—a growing consensus 
within the supplier that even though the benefit from our product to any one 
individual may be different, there is agreement that there is overall benefit to 
the customer across multiple users (and therefore across multiple groups).
This kind of cross-group adoption of our product (and any technology 
product, for that matter) is crucially important both for the company making 
the product and for the company using it. It means there is consensus on 
creating change within the organization.
Figure 1-2. The Dashboard

Chapter 1 | Transforming the Organization

Of course, there are many retailers that our suppliers sell through but don’t 
have time to interact with regularly on a one-on-one basis. In fact, specialty 
independent retailers (SIRs) are the fastest-growing segment of the retailer 
part of e-commerce.
Suppliers like Levi’s want not just to report on their performance across 
these retailers but also to improve the way their brands are represented 
across these retailers. They want to ensure that these retailers are showing 
the current images, product descriptions, and videos possible. Yet at the same 
time, they don’t have the resources necessary to deliver updated content to 
every single one of these retailers.
Once again, technology to the rescue. In this case, our suppliers introduce us 
to their retailer partners, to whom we can then deliver comprehensive, up-to-
date content directly from the suppliers, further increasing the network effect. 
Our Master Catalog is a comprehensive, cloud-based product information 
management (PIM) system that stores brand content and delivers that content 
to retailers in the form they expect. Not only do our supplier clients build 
consensus and drive change internally, but they also drive change externally. 
No matter which side of the table you’re on, the model is a powerful one.
But what about when the use of products does not expand internally (and 
externally, when it makes sense)? In that case, customers need to evaluate 
two possible causes. First, there is the possibility that the product in question 
is simply not a good product. Users find it difficult to use or it isn’t delivering 
on the functionality it promised. Second, lack of usage expansion can be a 
signal that the company has failed to reach consensus that change is needed 
or that the right stakeholders weren’t involved early enough in the purchase 
process. In such cases, the product often needs to be re-bought, with the right 
stakeholders involved from the get-go.
Reducing Risk in Technology Adoption
One way some customers have reduced the risk associated with adopting 
a new technology platform like ours is to run low-cost pilots to try us out. 
Procter & Gamble (P&G), for example, first evaluated our product during 
a three-month pilot focused on reducing out-of-stock rates. Although our 
product was still relatively early in its development, our sponsor had the 
vision to see its potential. During the pilot, not only did P&G’s in-stock rates 
improve, we were also able to deliver increased visibility to help them identify 
the possible sources of issues causing products to go out of stock.
Although some prospects ask us to do free pilots, paid pilots nearly always 
produce better results. That’s because clients take paid pilots more seriously 
than free pilots. On our end, it means we know a client is serious about doing 
business with us, assuming things go well during the pilot. A paid pilot also

helps with prioritization—anything paid is going to get a higher priority than 
something that’s free. Paid means that both sides have made a commitment 
to the pilot. The customer is paying and expects value in return; we’re getting 
paid and expect to deliver on that value.
Paid pilots are also a great consensus-building mechanism for our clients. In 
most larger organizations, paying for something means that at least a few 
other people have to get involved, whether that’s a manager, a vice president, 
or a team.
Of course, many clients choose to skip the pilot altogether and go directly 
to a purchase. The way our platform works, it’s possible for us to load actual 
client product information and analytics into our platform with no integration 
on the client’s part. In fact, this was one of my underlying requirements for the 
platform—that we be able to go into initial client meetings with data preloaded.
At a previous company that I started, I had experienced the pain involved for 
both us and the customer when we had to perform months of integration 
work up front before we could deliver any value. I vowed at Content Analytics 
that we would put neither our customers nor ourselves through that kind of 
pain. This in and of itself is another form of risk reduction: enabling customers 
to get value from a new technology in a matter of days or even hours rather 
than months or years.
■
■Note  One of the key innovations in our platform approach is that we can be up and running in 
a matter of days—rather than in months or years.
This innovation, the ability to get up and running and deliver immediate value, 
turned out to be one of the key selling points of our platform when we went 
in to pitch to a major apparel maker.
Ironically, we were late to the party. In the summer of 2015, I had been asked 
to be the keynote speaker at an e-commerce event in San Francisco. One of 
the attendees at that event, a business development executive for a major 
consulting firm, came up to me afterward and suggested that we partner, 
specifically in the area of e-commerce. It made complete sense. We would 
supply the technology platform, and the consulting partner would supply the 
services and ongoing project management.
Just a few days later, our contact told me he had a great opportunity for us 
with a local apparel retailer (one of the world’s largest). A director at the 
company was looking for a way to report on key e-commerce metrics. He 
was relatively far down the path in the vendor selection process but was 
interested in seeing what we could provide. We would be talking with him the 
next morning. With little time to prepare, we pulled together a set of slides 
and a demo with a comprehensive analysis of the company’s products.

Chapter 1 | Transforming the Organization
12
When I later asked the director what had caused him to choose our solution 
over the competition, he told me point blank that it was the speed with which 
we could deliver value. They’d been working on the integration required for 
a competitor’s solution for almost a year. In contrast, we were able to deliver 
value on a day’s notice. If there’s one thing that reduces risk even more than a 
pilot, it’s seeing insights about your own products live in our platform during 
a first meeting.
Customer-Driven Development Model
When it comes to making a purchase decision that has the potential to 
transform the way your organization operates, it’s important to ask yourself 
what kind of buyer you are. Some of our buyers are pioneers—they see 
the future of e-commerce and want to bring in the necessary technology to 
support it. Others are entrepreneurs within large corporations—they simply 
want to contribute some of their hard-won knowledge to help a startup 
grow. And still others are proven operators, trying to solve a set of problems 
they’ve had for a long time—tracking down missing inventory or storing brand 
content that’s located in a million different places in a centralized location.
None of our customers fits one profile alone. Many want to be involved in 
some way with a startup while getting the capabilities they need to solve 
their immediate business needs. All understand the requirement to build 
consensus within their organizations. They see our platform as a centralized 
control center that will truly help them improve their business operations. 
And they’re not shy about telling us what they think should be on our product 
road map and when.
So much of what we do involves listening to our customers’ explanations of 
how their businesses operate—and how they could operate more efficiently—
and then building the software that makes more efficient operation possible. 
I often feel when we have a successful client engagement that our software 
platform is the last thing we sell. What customers really buy is our ability 
to understand their needs, translate those into execution, and solve their 
problems quickly. We happen to sell them a license to some software so we 
can get paid. But what they buy is an entire operating model that helps them 
solve their business challenges.
This kind of customer-driven development (CDD) model requires an 
immense investment of time and effort on our part with our customers. But 
without it we would not have the kind of comprehensive “Control Center for 
eCommerce” that we have today. Of course, it’s a two-way street. When we 
come up with a new idea for a product capability or spot a new trend in the 
industry, our existing customers are the first to hear about it.

Operating at Web Speed
Quite often, our customers know they want to change the speed at which 
they operate, but their biggest challenge is: how? When I asked one of our 
sponsors at P&G how often he was used to getting certain reports about 
the health of his brand, he showed me a PDF report file that had been put 
together by hand. “We get this once a year,” he said. He wanted to get an 
updated version of the report every single day.
Many of our clients have become the captains of their categories (that is, 
the number-one player in their category) through decades of investment of 
capital and human resources in the offline world. Their brands are known the 
world over. The strategy worked because in the brick-and-mortar world, it 
was the ability to buy out the shelf and apply capital and human resources to 
building brand value that mattered most. Speed was simply not the number-
one factor that determined a brand’s success, and the systems that allowed 
brands to operate internally and to connect brands with their retail partners 
demonstrated as much.
In the e-commerce world, speed is everything. Millions of new products 
become available for sale online every day. The digital shelf changes from 
minute to minute.
Companies can and are taking immediate action to boost share of voice, 
increase product visibility, and respond to changes in product availability. The 
days of waiting until the end of the quarter or the end of the year to make a 
change are over. In e-commerce, every second counts.
While we’re not the only company that can help our clients operate at web 
speed, our customers have told us that we are one of the few. For us to 
help our customers operate at web speed, we have to operate at web speed 
ourselves. To do that, we rely on a certain set of web operating principles.
• 
Deliver new product capabilities in weeks, rather than in 
the typical enterprise cycle of quarters or years.
• 
Deliver data insights and brand updates in seconds, 
minutes, or hours, rather than in weeks, months, or years.
• 
Operate at unparalleled scale, providing insight and brand 
management capabilities equally effectively across billions 
of items as we do across hundreds of items.
• 
Use a modern, cloud-based technology stack that 
supports scaling up compute resources on demand.
• 
Combine many sources of data into one comprehensive 
view, rather than operating as another silo within 
organizations that are already heavily siloed.

Chapter 1 | Transforming the Organization
14
• 
Meet the needs of our individual users while delivering 
a platform that provides value across our clients’ entire 
organizations.
• 
Use a customer-driven design approach so we build real, 
practical solutions, rather than spending months in the 
back room building software that no one will ever use.
These principles that make up the core of our organization are the very same 
principles we bring to the companies we work with.
In many cases, our clients have had new ideas about how their businesses 
should operate for years—they simply haven’t been able to find a partner to 
work with that can deliver on those ideas. To every partnership, our clients 
bring their domain knowledge and expertise; we bring our proven technology 
execution capability. In our minds, it is an unparalleled focus on the CDD 
model and a proven ability to execute that our clients should be looking for 
when choosing a technology partner. If one thing holds true in the web era of 
commerce, it is that new capabilities are constantly emerging. As a result, it’s 
not enough for buyers to partner with technology vendors who can solve the 
needs of today. They must partner with buyers who can solve the needs of 
today and rapidly iterate to solve the needs of tomorrow.
Stop the Meeting
Early on in our work with a director and his team at one supplier, we were 
reporting on average review rating and review counts. The director knew his 
company had an issue with reviews on a particular retailer but hadn’t been 
able to pinpoint the exact issue. What our reports showed was that only 
a certain segment of the supplier’s product assortment had an issue. This 
segment of the assortment not only had a limited number of reviews but also 
had low ratings—few reviews with low ratings is not a good combination.
We had one of those moments I love to talk about—our customer exclaimed, 
“Stop the meeting! I know what to do!” He immediately contacted the team at 
his company responsible for reviews. That team updated the company’s review 
syndication approach. Almost immediately, the supplier started receiving a 
more representative mix of reviews and a larger quantity of reviews.
What was happening? The supplier has both a direct retail site (that is, a site 
where they sell direct to consumers) and a thriving wholesale business. For 
this part of the supplier’s assortment, shoppers were writing large numbers 
of reviews and almost all of them positive reviews at that. But most of those 
reviews were being sent to the retailer’s retail site. The small number of 
remaining negative reviews were being syndicated via the supplier’s review 
syndication network, producing an artificially negative perspective on an 
otherwise great product.

15
At Content Analytics, we live for these “stop the meeting” moments when we 
deliver an insight so valuable to a supplier or retailer that they’re able to take 
immediate action. This is just one small example of how we partner with our 
clients to help them transform their businesses.
Summary
People often ask me why I started Content Analytics. My first response is 
normally that I was looking for an opportunity at the intersection of Big Data 
and a rapidly growing market. In building and delivering the world’s foremost 
“Control Center for eCommerce,” I have found that intersection.
Yet it is the intersection of our software platform with our customers’ business 
needs that has proven even more rewarding. In building Content Analytics, I’ve 
had the privilege of getting to know and work with leaders inside some of 
the world’s most innovative brands—both large and small. That interaction 
has enabled us to build software that solves real, pressing business challenges.
One of the biggest challenges facing brands today, of course, is an increasing 
loss of control. Consumers are taking comparison shopping to a new level 
from the convenience of their mobile phones, while computer algorithms 
are exerting ever more control over the digital shelf. How can brands regain 
control? We’ll take a look at the answer to that question in the next chapter.

Regaining 
Control
“The reason it seems that price is all your customers care about is that 
you haven’t given them anything else to care about.”
—Seth Godin
Product, price, promotion, and place—the four Ps of marketing. These 
fundamentals have been hammered into our brains by marketing experts, 
business school professors, and branding agencies for decades.
If we could control the four Ps, we could control the path to purchase. For 
years, it worked. Brands used these elements to execute their category 
management strategies and own the market.
But then came e-commerce and everything changed. Seemingly overnight, 
brands lost the control they had worked so hard to gain.
Algorithms replaced planograms, content replaced the physical experience 
of in-store shopping, same-day delivery replaced a trip to the store, and daily 
execution replaced annual product cycles.
Many of our clients have invested billions of dollars and many years of their 
people’s time developing their market positions and internal expertise in 
the brick-and-mortar world. Although e-commerce has been around for a 
while, it is only in the last couple of years that it has become a large enough

part of their revenue streams to merit dedicated time and effort. And now,  
many brands feel not only that e-commerce is critical, they’ve realized they’re 
behind and need to catch up.
The Rise of Content
Today’s consumers are interacting less and less with physical products before 
they make a purchase decision. As a result, compelling content matters a 
lot more. The image or video on an item page on Amazon.com, Jet.com, or 
Walmart.com may be the only visual a consumer looks at before making a 
purchase decision.
■
■Note  Today’s consumers are interacting less with physical products before making a purchase 
decision. Online content matters a whole lot more.
The role of category managers, responsible historically for designing the 
optimal product mix, layout, and pricing for large sections of physical stores, is 
changing. Algorithms are playing a bigger role in determining which products 
appear where and when. And speed matters more than ever. Companies used 
to making product marketing updates once a quarter or once a year simply 
aren’t executing fast enough to keep up with the speed of e-commerce.
How much is your brand integrity worth to you? One supplier we work with 
spends nearly $3 billion a year globally to design, market, and promote their 
brand. Three billion. Yet all too often when the consumer goes to purchase 
one of this company’s products online, they have a subpar experience. Despite 
all the money this supplier has invested in promoting awareness of their 
brand and driving consumers to buy their products, the company’s products 
are not presented effectively online. The item pages for the company’s 
products on their retailer partner sites suffer from having outdated product 
images, low-resolution images that prevent shoppers from zooming in to get 
a better look at the products, and only one or two images—and sometimes 
no images at all.
Of course, this company has conducted brand audits. A group of people in the 
company’s e-commerce team has the thankless task of going to each product 
page on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, and any number of other 
sites and noting the issues in a spreadsheet. Among the many challenges this 
supplier faces in conducting such an audit is that the people responsible for 
doing the audit simply cannot get to all the products. When they do get to 
those products, they have to figure out which content to compare to and 
whether the content on the retailer’s site matches up or not.

Bricks to Clicks
19
The audit process is so time-consuming that they can complete a full brand 
audit only once every five or six months—if the supplier can even audit their 
entire catalog. With thousands and thousands of items and more items being 
introduced every quarter, it’s virtually impossible for the supplier’s team 
to deliver comprehensive brand audits with high quality, at scale. And the 
supplier faces a further challenge—how to get the audits done faster. Ideally, 
the supplier wants audits done on a weekly basis.
That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Even if the content is great, what about 
inventory levels? Is the product in stock? Is the data that describes the product 
accurate? Is it priced right relative to the competition? And who’s selling the 
item—the retailer or a third-party marketplace seller?
Findability and Shopability
These factors together describe the shopability of an item. These are a few of 
the many factors a supplier must get right, for every item, for there to be a 
high likelihood that shoppers will buy an item once they find it.
That begs the question—what about a product’s findability? When a consumer 
types “jeans” or “batteries” or “diapers” into the search box on Google, 
Amazon.com, Walmart.com, or any other retailer site, whose products show 
up first? The only way to know for sure is to type those same search terms in 
and see what results come up. But it’s nearly impossible to do that at scale, for 
every relevant search term, every day of the year, by hand.
In the brick-and-mortar world, suppliers spent months designing planograms 
with their retail partners, then months more rolling them out, and then months 
after that sending thousands of people in to walk the aisles and see whether 
the shelves matched the planogram.
The difference with e-commerce is one of speed and scale. Instead of the shelf 
changing every few months, the shelf changes every day, if not every hour or 
every minute. Instead of living in a universe of tens or hundreds of thousands 
of items, suppliers are living in a world of billions of items. That’s why when 
you look at categories in e-commerce, often the best-selling items in those 
categories are from smaller brands that you’ve never heard of.
Those brands are leveraging leading-edge techniques to optimize their products 
for sale online. They apply search engine optimization (SEO) approaches 
to ensure they have the most discoverable product titles, descriptions, and 
keywords possible. They take care to use a large quantity of high-resolution 
images. They follow up with customers directly to get feedback and address 
any issues—before a negative review gets written. If a negative review does 
still get written, they use tools such as Content Analytics to make sure they 
are alerted to it immediately so they can take action right away.

A Generational Change
Today we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in the way consumers buy products. 
Spending billions of dollars worked great in an era when what mattered was 
brand recognition as the consumer walked down the aisle and selected a 
product to buy. Sufficient brand recognition combined with products from 
that brand being placed right and in stock resulted in a purchase.
In an algorithmic era, brand recognition still matters, but it isn’t enough. If a 
seller you’ve never heard of does the work to optimize their product listing 
for sale, that seller’s product is going to show up first in the search results—
the online equivalent of being placed at eye level. Even a brand that has spent 
nearly $3 billion on brand marketing won’t survive long if competitor products 
are consistently showing up first in the search results.
The trend is only growing. Online spending is dramatically on the rise. Nearly 
70 percent of Americans now shop online at least monthly, with 33 percent 
shopping online every week.1 Incredible growth in e-commerce drove U.S. 
web sales up to $341.7 billion in 2015 from half of that just five years earlier. 
E-commerce accounted for a whopping 60.4 percent of total retail sales 
growth in 2015.2
For the consumer, online shopping is as much or more about convenience as 
it is about price. “Parents with children at home are more likely to be weekly 
online shoppers, driven by the combination of a greater need for supplies for 
their larger households and limited time for shopping in their busy schedules,” 
says Billy Hulkower, senior technology analyst at Mintel.
The impact on traditional retail is noticeable. One need not look far to see 
news of malls closing and retail stores being shuttered. Retail analyst Jan 
Kniffen expects one-third of malls to close in the coming years, taking the 
count of enclosed malls from 1,100 down to 700.3
Simply put, the millennial generation shops differently. Some 70 percent of 
shopping experiences now begin on a mobile device. Advances in mobile 
technology mean bigger screens and higher-resolution displays. Product videos 
need to play as well on a mobile device connected to a carrier network as on 
a desktop computer with a large screen. Comparison guides need to be easy 
to view on a small screen and on a big screen. One small image and an all-caps 
product name taken from an inventory management system simply won’t cut 
it anymore. Today’s shoppers expect a lot more.

Retailers are innovating out of necessity. Amazon now has more than  
70 million members in the Amazon Prime program. Prime is essentially the 
decades-old membership club concept taken online. It solves two fundamental 
problems for the consumer: the cost of shipping and the desire to receive a 
purchased product as quickly as possible.
For Amazon, Prime creates an incredibly loyal shopper base. Although it was a 
loss leader for Amazon at the start, Prime may be one of the best investments 
Amazon has ever made. Shoppers who sign up for the annual program are 
far less likely to shop elsewhere when the time comes to make a purchase 
decision. For Amazon, the Prime program means billions of dollars in up-front 
cash, which can be used for infrastructure investments, logistics improvements, 
and generating additional scale efficiencies.
To help it compete, Walmart purchased two-year-old e-commerce startup 
Jet.com and hired its CEO, Marc Lore, to run both Walmart.com and Jet.com.
Marketplaces
Retailers continue to experiment heavily with marketplaces. Best Buy recently 
shuttered its marketplace program, while Walmart continues to expand its 
marketplace program with the goal of having the largest assortment of products 
possible online. Of the 480 million items listed for sale on Amazon.com,  
more than 470 million are marketplace items. Retailers who adopt marketplace 
programs can scale their assortment much faster than their non-marketplace-
enabled counterparts. The risk, however, is that it is much harder to ensure 
quality, product authenticity, and a best-in-class customer experience.
Our bricks-to-clicks clients are learning as much as they can about online 
marketplaces. Through the data our platform collects, we’re able to give our 
first-party seller clients unique insights into sales performance on marketplace 
platforms, including Amazon, Walmart, Jet, and eBay, among others. Bricks-to-
clicks clients closely monitor their ownership of the Buy Box—the button 
on the item page that determines which seller the sale will go to when the 
shopper clicks the “add to cart” button. We can tell these clients how often 
they’re winning the Buy Box and, when they aren’t, why they aren’t.
Marketplaces provide an interesting opportunity for online retailers because 
retailers carry no direct inventory for marketplace sales. By expanding their 
assortment, they can ensure that products are in stock more often, they can 
capture more long-tail searches (searches for products that are purchased 
less frequently), and they can appeal to a broader range of shoppers by selling 
unique products that may not be available anywhere else. Meanwhile, ­third-
party sellers get to take advantage of the shopper volume and brand marketing 
power of the large retail platforms.

Chapter 2 | Regaining Control
22
When we first started working with bricks-to-clicks clients, many of them 
were losing control in the marketplace. Some felt that marketplace sales were 
simply “not their problem.” If marketplace sellers priced items too high or too 
low, used incorrect images, or published poor product descriptions, that was 
their problem. The attitude of the direct (first party, known as 1P) sellers was 
that they were losing control—and either didn’t care or couldn’t do anything 
about it.
But over time, our bricks-to-clicks clients have evolved their strategy to take 
control back. With careful monitoring of marketplace sellers, they can go 
back to their retailer partners with input on content quality and pricing of 
products sold by third-party sellers. If third-party sellers provide poor product 
descriptions or inaccurate images, that leads to a bad overall site experience 
for the shopper, which in turn leads to a higher likelihood the sale will go 
somewhere else. What’s more, products with inaccurate information—such 
as inaccurate technical specifications—lead to higher rates of return and 
dilution of brand equity. Therefore, retailers and suppliers must work together 
to ensure that regardless of who supplies the product and marketing content, 
the shopper experience is a good one.
Our bricks-to-clicks clients are also reasserting control through a better 
organizational approach to e-commerce. Upstart online-only sellers have 
dedicated their entire companies to optimizing their online sales. But lower-
performing bricks companies have relegated e-commerce to a one-person 
team or assigned it as part of the existing responsibilities of national sales or 
marketing managers who are already overworked and understaffed. Higher-
performing bricks-to-clicks companies such as P&G, Clorox, and Levi’s have 
implemented dedicated e-commerce staff both at the national/global level and 
within their individual retailer sales teams.
A Focus on Scale
Although many factors contribute to success in e-commerce, one consistent 
theme across the highest-performing bricks-to-clicks companies has emerged: 
an unparalleled focus on scale. They are constantly looking for ways to 
automate, streamline, and scale their operations because they know that  
10 percent of total sales coming from e-commerce is just the tip of the iceberg. 
With more than 60 percent of growth in retail coming from e-commerce, they 
know that their existing systems and processes simply won’t scale to meet 
the size and speed of e-commerce. They are getting ahead of the curve by 
learning as much as they can and getting new technologies and processes in 
place while they’re still relatively early in the scaling cycle.

Bricks to Clicks
23
The bricks-to-clicks companies implement scalability in three forms.
• 
Scalable insight
• 
Scalable organization
• 
Scalable action
Scalable insight means having the data necessary to make informed decisions 
across the entire enterprise. Scalable organization means implementing an 
organizational structure that supports the fast-growing needs of e-commerce. 
Scalable action means being able to take action at scale—automating complex 
processes so they can be run automatically and reliably.
We help our clients overcome the multiple Big Data challenges they face when 
trying to gain scalable insight. First, they have data stored in separate systems 
and in separate parts of the organization. Inventory information is in one 
system, while assortment is in another. Dimensions and regulatory information 
reside with supply chain, while product titles, images, and descriptions reside 
with marketing.
They want to aggregate all that data and present it in one place but find it 
increasingly hard to do so. Second, a significant portion of the data our clients 
need to operate their businesses is available on the Web, but they have no 
easy way to collect, aggregate, and present it. When they try to aggregate that 
data manually, they run into issues of data reliability and resource constraints. 
Third, the legacy business intelligence (BI) systems some of our clients do 
have were not built for the unique needs of e-commerce.
■
■Note  Manual approaches to data collection and reporting don’t deliver the speed and scale 
required for e-commerce.
Many of those BI systems were designed to be generic analysis and presentation 
tools. They can’t trigger an alert when key events occur, such as a product 
going out of stock or a price changing. They can present the data only after 
the fact—too late to be useful. Moreover, those systems that were designed 
for retail were not designed for e-commerce. They are costly and difficult to 
customize, and many still require on-premise software, making it difficult to 
update them quickly to keep up with the dynamic nature of e-commerce.

Chapter 2 | Regaining Control
24
Business Dashboard
The bricks-to-clicks companies implement the Content Analytics e-commerce 
Dashboard to gain insight into their e-commerce business metrics. They 
customize the Dashboard to their specific key performance indicators (KPIs), 
bake in business rules like share of voice targets, and report to their leadership 
about progress on the KPIs they’ve defined. Integrated goal planning enables 
them to set goals right within the Dashboard and track their progress toward 
reaching those goals.
Using our Dashboard, our clients are able to track changes on an hourly, daily, 
and monthly basis. They can review their comps on a month-over-month, 
quarter-over-quarter, and year-over-year basis. They gain the business insight 
they need for annual planning while at the same time being able to spot sudden 
market shifts and respond accordingly. Many of our clients use the Dashboard 
for their year beginning meetings (YBMs) and quarterly business reviews 
(QBRs) with their retailer partners while also using the same Dashboard for 
their daily and weekly internal sales and brand management meetings.
Because the Dashboard is extensible, we’ve worked with our supplier 
customers to add in more key metrics over time, incorporating not just 
online metrics but in-store metrics as well. By aggregating previously disparate 
sources of information into one easy-to-access interface, we’ve given our 
clients a single place to measure their business performance end to end. As 
one supplier put it, the Content Analytics Dashboard is “the control center 
for our entire business operation—both in-store and online.”
Competitive Insight
Bricks companies have for years analyzed the competition—many through 
very manual processes. Bricks-to-clicks companies are using automation 
to understand how their products are performing across multiple retailers 
(internal competition) and how they’re performing against the competition 
(external competition).
Figure 2-1 shows an example of the Content Analytics Competitive Insights 
Dashboard.

Bricks to Clicks

We’ll drill into how bricks-to-clicks companies are gaining competitive insight 
in more detail later in the book.
Product Information Management
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers don’t stop there. The bricks-to-clicks suppliers 
implement a Dashboard that tells them how they’re doing. But they go a step 
further—they implement a cloud-based product information management 
(PIM) system to store their brand assets for easy access and updating.
In the case of Content Analytics, that is our Master Catalog, which not only 
stores brand assets but also outputs prepopulated forms necessary to update 
content on retailer sites. In some cases, the system even goes a step further, 
updating content directly on the retailer sites, without the supplier having to 
deal with any forms in the middle. Product names, descriptions, images, videos, 
and item attribute data are all stored within the Master Catalog PIM and 
easily updated via automatically generated templates or direct connections to 
retailer web sites.
Why has this capability to store and update brand assets become so important 
for the bricks-to-clicks companies? The answer is: content at scale.
For today’s shopper, content matters more than ever before. Shoppers are 
interacting with physical products far less before making purchase decisions. 
They’re interacting with images, videos, product descriptions, and online

reviews a whole lot more. Given this, the ability to find, manage, and update 
brand content has taken on a whole new level of importance. In the chapters 
ahead, we’ll take a detailed look at how to set up a PIM system that will meet 
your needs in e-commerce. But first, let’s look at the kind of content you’ll 
want to make sure every single one of your products has.
High-Quality Content: What to Look For
A number of vendors, including Content Analytics, will create web-optimized 
product descriptions and web-friendly product names along with high-
resolution images and videos for you.
Product names, descriptions, and images are referred to as core content—they 
appear “above the fold” on item pages on retailer web sites, and they’re what 
search engines like Google use to generate their results. Here’s what to look 
for in core content:
• 
Multiple high-resolution images, with a minimum 
resolution of at least 1000x1000, preferably 3000x3000.
• 
Product descriptions of at least 150 words in length 
containing your brand name, the name of the product, 
keywords that identify your product, and unique content 
that has not been used elsewhere.
• 
Product names that include fully spelled out words and 
your brand name. To work best on mobile devices as well 
as desktop browsers, product names should be less than 
70 characters in length; longer product names often don’t 
display well on mobile devices.
• 
For international manufacturers, the ability for content 
creators to create content in your country. Rather than 
having to ship your items to a U.S. location, some content 
creators can receive your product samples locally in vir-
tually any country. Such support can significantly reduce 
online time to market for your items.
In addition to the content itself, look for vendors that can create content 
directly in the form your retailer partners require. That means the following:
• 
Images named properly according to retailer-specific 
instructions
• 
Content populated in retailer-specific item/content 
maintenance forms, portals, or interfaces

Bricks to Clicks
27
Bricks-to-clicks companies are coupling best-in-class content creation with 
modern, cloud-based PIM platforms to manage and organize their brand 
content. For example, the Content Analytics system can do the following:
• 
Output content maintenance forms and images in the 
necessary template format and naming conventions 
required by Amazon, Walmart, Target, and many other 
retailers
• 
Provide web links (URLs) for images and videos for 
retailers that require those to be used in your submissions
• 
Check to ensure that images meet the minimum size/
resolution requirements and image file type for each 
retailer
• 
Check to ensure that videos meet the proper video 
type requirements (e.g., MP4) and automatically convert 
between desktop and mobile videos so that your product 
videos will play well on both desktop and mobile devices
• 
Resize images so the exact image you submit is what 
appears on the retailer site (rather than hoping retailers 
will crop your images the way you want them)
• 
Import your content from many different sources such 
as CSV, XLSX, and XML files as well as from a variety of 
digital asset management systems
• 
Convert that content to retailer-required formats and 
between different formats (so if you have all your images 
named according to Amazon’s requirements, the system 
can convert those images so they’re ready for delivery to 
Walmart and Target as well)
• 
Alert you when the content you’ve submitted has gone 
live on a retailer web site or, if it has not gone live, within 
a specified period of time
• 
Store your content in one centralized location for easy 
access
• 
Show you a history of the content you’ve created and 
delivered to your retailer partners
In addition to core content, you may also want to invest in enhanced content 
(also known as rich media) to further showcase your products online.
Enhanced content includes media such as videos, 360-degree views, how-to 
guides, and PDFs. Amazon.com (where rich media is known as A+ content) and 
Walmart.com support enhanced content natively, meaning that no third-party 

Chapter 2 | Regaining Control
28
rich-media-specific solution (such as Webcollage or SellPoints) is required 
to add rich media to your item pages on those retailers. While enhanced 
content may not help get more visitors to your products’ item pages, it has 
been shown to drive significantly higher conversion rates once shoppers do 
land on your product’s page.
The largest bricks-to-clicks suppliers also partner with retailers to create 
brand-specific custom landing pages. Big sites like Amazon.com and Walmart.
com will create custom pages to showcase your brand and its products. 
Amazon, for example, will create showcase pages in the form of A+ content 
customized specifically for your brand. That can be a great way to educate 
consumers about new products or new technologies. Walmart.com and 
Samsclub.com will both create custom pages to highlight your products and 
their benefits. These kinds of pages are especially important if you’re bringing 
a new offering to market that you’ll need to educate shoppers about, such as 
curved televisions or a new line of specially formulated cosmetics.
All that said, core content is what will drive more visits to your item pages. 
Google and the search boxes on retailer web sites use core content to figure 
out which items to display in search results by evaluating the product names, 
descriptions, and attribute data. And core content is what appears “above 
the fold” (that is, without the user having to scroll the web page) when users 
browse to your items. Thus, it’s critical to get core content right or the rest 
of what appears on your item’s landing page won’t matter.
Sponsored Products
If there’s one more area that brands are using to take back control, it’s paid 
media on retailer web sites. When improving your content and increasing 
your sales through organic approaches isn’t enough and you want to take 
things a step further, you can invest in paid media.
On Amazon.com, suppliers can directly purchase ads that will appear on 
the retailer’s web site via Amazon’s Sponsored Products offering. Similar to 
Google AdWords, Amazon’s Sponsored Products offering is a keyword-based 
advertising mechanism. You simply create ads and input the relevant keywords 
for which you want your ads to show up. Ads don’t cost you anything until a 
shopper clicks them. Sponsored Products can help boost sales when organic 
improvement isn’t enough. The nice thing about Sponsored Products is that 
it works with both larger agency and brands as well as in self-serve form for 
smaller sellers.
On Walmart.com, suppliers can buy ads through Google AdWords (rather 
than directly on Walmart.com) or through Triad Retail Media, a media agency. 
Many suppliers work with Triad to execute sponsored content campaigns and 
to include sponsored products above the organic search results. Similar to 

Bricks to Clicks
29
Amazon Sponsored Products, such placements can greatly help boost sales. 
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers employ a combination of organic (content) and paid 
(advertising) approaches to drive the most visits to their products.
This has an interesting effect: in online retail, the more units a product sells, 
the higher it appears in the search results. That’s because sales are one of the 
key elements that factor into how high an item is ranked in on-site search 
results. The more an item sells, the higher it is likely to rank, so long as it is 
a relevant item—as determined by matching between the keywords and the 
product content. Think of it like getting a book on the New York Times’ best-
seller list. Getting a book on the list is extremely hard, but in a sort of virtuous 
cycle, once a book gets on the list, it’s likely to sell more copies because of the 
increased visibility it gets from being on the list. That’s a lot like the way search 
results work on retailer sites—getting on page 1 of the results is hard, but by 
virtue of being on page 1, an item receives a lot more visibility and therefore 
receives more sales.
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers have found that it’s worth the investment in paid 
media to boost sales of their items. The higher an item is ranked, the higher 
it’s likely to stay ranked. For items that are on page 2 or 3 of search results, 
bricks-to-clicks suppliers have found it worthwhile to invest in paid media as 
a quick way to boost the rankings of their items.
Summary
So far we’ve taken a look at how the bricks-to-clicks companies are taking 
back control through three primary mechanisms—scalable insight, scalable 
people, and scalable action—so that they can operate at the speed and scale 
e-commerce requires.
Next up, we’ll look at how to build out your e-commerce Dashboard and the 
key metrics to track to optimize your business for e-commerce success.

First Insight,

“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”
—Peter Drucker
One afternoon in late 2015 I was visiting with some executives from a large 
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company at their office about 20 minutes 
down the road from Walmart’s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, 
Arkansas. This company had become one of our early brand clients in the 
spring of that year, using our product to help reduce their out-of-stock rates 
on Walmart.com.
The meeting got off to a rocky start. I had trouble getting on the company’s 
Wi-Fi network. Plus, I had been using my phone’s map to help me navigate to 
their office and had used up the battery. I was getting worried that I wouldn’t 
have much to show. The thought crossed my mind that I might have traveled 
almost 2,000 miles just to have the meeting cut short because of technical issues.
Fortunately, one of the account managers in the room helped me out. He set 
me up with a connection to the hotspot on his phone. I breathed a sigh of 
relief, and a few minutes later I had a bunch of reports pulled up on my screen.
Back then, our reports didn’t have the streamlined, business-focused interface 
that our customers have come to know and love. We were monitoring all kinds 
of key performance indicators, from content health to pricing and from share 
of search to share of shelf, but I was showing the results as literally hundreds

32
of rows of data. After a few minutes of reading through these tables of data 
with me and nodding diplomatically, one of their senior executives went to the 
whiteboard. It would turn out to be a pivotal moment in our company’s history.
He drew on the whiteboard a chart at the top with a set of boxes below, each 
box representing a key metric he wanted us to measure. If we could update 
those metrics every day, he said, and present them in the form of a Dashboard 
with color-coded cards and trend analysis baked into the charts, that would be 
invaluable to him. It would be something he and his team could report across 
the organization, and it would give him insight into his business much faster 
than the static reports he was receiving at that time.
There in front of me was the Dashboard we had been wanting to build but had 
had a hard time envisioning. It was right before Thanksgiving. I asked him if we 
could come back and see him after building the Dashboard to get his feedback 
on it. He laughed and said sure thing. On the flight home, I wireframed the 
Dashboard and wrote a bunch of notes about it for our user interface designer 
and product manager. Early the next week it was over to our engineering team 
for development. Our team worked through the holidays, and just under eight 
weeks later the Content Analytics Dashboard was live in production. We 
finally had the Dashboard that clients had been asking for.
Since then, many of our clients have provided invaluable input into the design 
and evolution of the Dashboard. The Dashboard is now used by Clorox, 
L’Oréal, Mattel, Samsung, and many other market leaders. We’ve made it easy 
to configure so that business goals specific to each supplier can be baked in 
and metrics that aren’t relevant for a category, such as minimum advertised 
price (MAP), can be taken out. The Dashboard is truly a product capability 
that was designed by suppliers for suppliers. All we did was write the software.
Dashboard Overview—SPARCS
The purpose of the Content Analytics Dashboard is to be the control center 
for all your retail-related business activities, both online and offline. The 
Dashboard supports the display and analysis of sales and inventory data, share 
of voice, content quality, and a host of other key performance indicators (KPIs).
The Dashboard provides insight into six key areas that we call SPARCS.
Sales
Pricing
Assortment and availability
Ratings and reviews
Content
Shelf and search

The Dashboard can show you a snapshot in time to tell you how you did 
yesterday (see Figure 3-1). It can also chart time-series data so you can see 
your data trended over time. It can help you answer questions such as how 
am I doing this week compared with last week? How am I doing this month 
relative to last month?
It can also show you how you’re doing on one retailer site relative to another 
or how two brands are doing relative to each other. If you market two different 
brands of shampoo, for example, you might want to see how their performance 
compares across the different metrics or average their performance so you 
can see how you’re doing in the shampoo category overall.
Figure 3-1. The Dashboard

Chapter 3 | First Insight, Then Action
34
The Dashboard supports alerting so you proactively can get notified of urgent 
issues (say, when products go out of stock) and receive regular status updates 
(such as how your sales performance this week compares to your sales 
performance last week) direct to your inbox.
A great Dashboard brings together many different data sources—from retailer 
data feeds to supplier-provided data to data crawled from the Web (the true 
shopper view of your products)—all in one place. And that’s exactly what the 
Content Analytics Dashboard provides.
The Dashboard comes set up with a default configuration, but we normally 
work closely with clients to configure their Dashboard for their specific 
needs. We also provide regular updates based on customer, market, and 
feature changes. The Dashboard supports multiple retailers, including 
Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, and many more. You can look 
at your performance on one retailer or group them together to get a 
rolled-up view. This is helpful when you want to create, say, a region-
specific group of retailers.
The Dashboard supports threshold color-coding, making it easy to see at a 
glance which metrics are literally in the red versus in the green. Underlying the 
Dashboard are a series of detailed reports called Insights Reports that let you 
drill down into every area the Dashboard supports, from out-of-stock issues 
to MAP violations to share of shelf and share of search.
Tied to the Insights Reports are comprehensive alerts. Alerts notify you when 
a threshold is passed (sales are above or below a certain level, for example) or 
simply provide a daily update to your inbox (here’s how you did on share of 
shelf this week compared with last week). The benefit of alerts is that they’re 
a proactive way to notify you when something needs your attention or when 
there’s an update you need to know about.
The Dashboard comes in two views.
• 
A roll-up view with charting at the top and summary 
cards for each reporting segment below
• 
A detailed view with charting at the top and individual 
cards for every metric reported on
It’s easy to toggle between the two views.
We’re also able to develop custom views of the Dashboard based on supplier-
specific requirements. For custom Dashboards, we typically use much of the 
same data (although new data can always be incorporated) but present the 
data in the supplier-requested layout and format. Now let’s look at each of the 
key metrics that the Dashboard reports on.

Bricks to Clicks
35
Your Content Analytics Score
Your Content Analytics score rolls up all the component metrics on your 
Dashboard into one overall score. You can use this metric to track your 
performance over time as well as to compare performance across retailers, 
groups of retailers, and regions. You can also chart your Content Analytics 
score for trend analysis. We’ll spend the rest of this chapter drilling into the 
component metrics that make up this score, why those metrics matter, and 
how to use them.
Sales Reporting
The Content Analytics platform supports integrated sales reporting. You can 
see your sales data alongside all your other key business metrics.
We’ve found that a lot of clients use separate services, tools, or homegrown 
spreadsheets and charts to do sales reporting. This approach makes it hard 
to see everything in one place. It also creates a lot of unnecessary work for 
suppliers who need to load in data and maintain specialized reports. What’s 
more, because sales data comes in different formats for each retailer, suppliers 
must convert each retailer’s sales data into a format their tools or custom 
spreadsheets can handle.
Content Analytics simplifies the entire sales reporting process. We retrieve 
sales data from retailers and internal systems, perform the necessary 
conversions, and display the sales data directly in the Content Analytics 
Dashboard.
■
■Note  Content Analytics simplifies the entire reporting process by bringing many different data 
sources together into one easy-to-use interface.
You can view sales metrics alongside your other key business metrics such 
as share of voice, content health, in-stock reporting, and ratings and reviews 
summary data. So if you run a campaign to improve content health, increase 
reviews, or reduce out-of-stock products, you can easily see the impact of that 
campaign right on your Dashboard.
We can also estimate what your sales will be for the entire week or month 
based on current sales data. We can present that projection in an easy-to-
digest visual form available on both your desktop and your mobile device—so 
it’s easy to see how you’re likely to do for the week (and if you need to make 
any immediate adjustments) even while you’re on the go. It’s a lot easier than 
trying to open an Excel sheet with a bunch of hidden rows and columns from 
your smartphone!

36
Pricing
Keeping tabs on prices is important anywhere, but it’s especially important 
online, where price comparisons are so easy to do. Retailers employ dynamic 
pricing algorithms that re-price items automatically to keep prices competitive 
with other retailers. Just like automated trading algorithms in the stock market, 
sometimes these algorithms get out of whack and raise prices too high or 
drop them too low.
Other times, third-party sellers come in and sell a product at a price lower 
than a retail site’s direct price. Conversely, if a retailer runs out of an item, 
marketplace sellers come in and charge a much higher price, creating 
disenchanted customers and lost sales.
The Pricing + MAP report provides ongoing price tracking. It can report on 
prices on a weekly, daily, or hourly basis. It provides a history of the most recent 
changes (Figure 3-2). You can easily export the history for detailed analysis.
Figure 3-2.  Price change history for an individual product
You can also export the price changes for all products in the report, giving you 
comprehensive pricing data to inform future pricing strategies. The Pricing + 
Map report supports built-in charting capabilities, giving you easy access to a 
visual representation of price changes over time (Figure 3-3).

Bricks to Clicks
37
The system can even track prices across multiple retailers. This can help you 
understand which retailer is driving price changes and how different retailers 
are pricing your products. If one retailer is consistently pricing much lower 
or much higher than the competition, there may be a problem in the channel.
■
■Note  The Price Movement alert is a great way to see which products are changing in price. By 
default, products are included in the alert when they’ve changed by more than 5 percent, but it’s 
easy to change the threshold to meet your needs.
MAP Violations
The minimum advertised price is the lowest price a retailer may advertise a 
supplier’s product at. According to the Small Business Administration, “Under 
typical MAP agreements, online retailers can’t ‘display’ any prices that fall 
below the MAP price.”1 (Note that once a product is added to the shopping 
cart, however, the retailer can sell it for a lower price—because the shopping 
cart is not considered advertising space.) Although suppliers have agreements 
with retailers not to advertise below the agreed upon minimum price, many 
retailers violate that policy.
Suppliers need a mechanism to check for MAP violations on a regular basis and 
enforce MAP policy if needed. The Dashboard can report on the percentage 
1https://www.sba.gov/blogs/how-minimum-advertised-pricing-impacts-your-
retail-or-online-stores-marketing-efforts
Figure 3-3.  Pricing chart showing price changes over time

Chapter 3 | First Insight, Then Action
38
of products on a retailer’s site that are being advertised in violation of the 
MAP pricing agreement. The supplier provides us with a list of product IDs 
(such as UPCs) and the corresponding MAP prices. Our system then checks 
each of those products, typically on a daily basis, to see whether the advertised 
price is below the MAP price. It calculates the percentage of products that 
are being advertised at below the MAP price and displays that percentage on 
the Dashboard. The user can click to see and download the specific list of 
products that are violating the MAP price.
MAP price violation information is also available as an alert; suppliers can 
receive alerts in their inboxes with a list of products that are below MAP, 
by how much, and what the MAP and actual advertised prices are. The 
combination of alerts and the Dashboard means that suppliers can get notified 
right away when there’s a pricing problem, and they can track pricing status 
over time via the Dashboard. Enforcing MAP pricing is a separate issue. We’ll 
cover that in detail in the next chapter when we discuss how to use the drill-
down reports that underlie each of the Dashboard metrics.
MAP violations are hard to track if you’re not constantly on the lookout for 
them. It’s virtually impossible to do, even if you have only a few products for 
sale online. New sellers are constantly coming and going. Third parties selling 
below MAP are one of the primary reasons that suppliers lose the Buy Box. 
The other reason is when their products go out of stock. MAP reporting helps 
with the former; out-of-stock reporting helps with the latter.
In addition to MAP reporting directly on the Dashboard, the detailed MAP 
violations can give you insight into every single one of your products. Simply 
upload your list of products and their MAP prices, and the system will 
automatically start reporting on them, showing you which products are for 
sale below the MAP price (Figure 3-4) on a given retailer’s web site.
Alerts are flexible, so you can set them to be sent only if the price falls below 
the MAP price by a certain percent or absolute value threshold.
Figure 3-4.  MAP Violations report

Authorized Resellers Report
Hand in hand with MAP reporting goes the Authorized Resellers report. This 
report indicates which resellers are authorized and which are not, along with 
the corresponding price at which the reseller is selling the product.
With this report, the system identifies those third-party marketplace sellers 
on sites such as Amazon and Walmart that are not authorized to sell your 
products.
The Authorized Resellers report is easy to set up. Simply upload your list of 
authorized resellers and the system will automatically check the marketplace 
sellers against that list to identify those that are authorized and those that 
aren’t. This makes it easy to identify unauthorized resellers and talk with your 
retailer partners about them.
Price Visibility
In the area of pricing, one other element that bricks-to-clicks suppliers want 
to track, at least in certain categories, is price visibility. Price visibility is a 
measure of how many of the supplier’s products on a given retailer’s site 
require the supplier to add the product to the cart to see the price.
Some retailers use the “add this item to cart to see the price” approach to 
get around MAP pricing. They can’t advertise the lower price they really want 
to advertise because of MAP agreements, and by not showing the price at all, 
the theory goes, they don’t risk scaring shoppers away with a price that’s too 
high. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers dislike the “hidden price” approach for two 
reasons. First, it’s used to circumvent MAP. Second, they believe it reduces the 
likelihood that a shopper will make a purchase. If shoppers, who are now laser 
focused on price because of the ease with which they can comparison shop 
across different sites, can’t see the price of a product, they’re unlikely to go to 
the extra effort of adding the item to the cart to see the item’s price.
If they monitored only MAP violations, suppliers would be alerted only to 
those products that the retailer is advertising below the MAP price. By also 
monitoring products for which no price is shown (price visibility), bricks-
to-clicks suppliers get a complete picture of how retailers are selling their 
products, including those products for which no price is advertised. The 
combination of price visibility and MAP violation metrics gives bricks-to-clicks 
suppliers the comprehensive view they require.

The Content Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive out-of-stock, inven-
tory, and Buy Box reporting.

Out of Stock
When we talk about in stock and out of stock, we’re referring to what the 
retailer’s web site says is in or out of stock. This data comes directly from 
crawling the retailer’s site—that is, going to an item page on the site and 
seeing whether the site shows the item as in or out of stock. That can include 
looking at all the variants of a given product in its different sizes, colors, and 
models.
Crawled data is the true shopper view. It’s as if you had a person on your 
team go to an item page and check a product’s status, by hand, and write 
down the result and then repeat that process for every product you care 
about. Without crawled data, you’re flying blind; you really have no idea what 
shoppers are seeing when they go to a web site and try to find and buy your 
products.
In addition to providing the true shopper view, the other great thing about 
automating the collection and reporting of out-of-stock data is that it requires 
no integration. We simply load your product list, start crawling those products, 
and can very quickly tell you which products are available for purchase and 
which aren’t, every day, day in and day out. Even better, you no longer have to 
go to a given web site manually to check those products—you can get an e-mail 
alert delivered right to your inbox to tell you which products are out of stock.
Out-of-stock data is reported on the Dashboard as a percentage and can 
be easily toggled between displaying in-stock and out-of-stock data as the 
displayed value.
One CPG client we work with has implemented the innovative concept of a 
never-out-of-stock list. That means that none of the products on the never-
out-of-stock list should ever be out of stock. They should always be available 
for shoppers to purchase.
That begs the question—why do products go out of stock at all? The reason 
is often subtle changes in item configurations. In one instance, products that 
should be set to auto-replenish don’t get reordered. The cause can be a 
system glitch, human oversight, or an unexpected run on a product. As an 
example, if an item had a specific end date set when it was originally set up, 
the marketer wants the product to keep on selling but does not update the 
end date, and that end date passes, then the product goes out of stock. It’s no 
longer available for purchase even though the company selling it wants it to be.
Another example is when a product gets unexpected visibility, causing faster 
than expected sales of a given product. In physical stores, product layouts are 
planned well in advance based on long-standing models. Products are placed 
on shelves based on the layouts, and then the shelf layouts remain static. If 
you’ve ever walked down an aisle after there’s been a run on a particular 
product, you’ve seen empty shelf space—quite often prime shelf space located 
at eye level.

Bricks to Clicks
41
Online, in contrast, shelf space is almost always fully used. If a product that was 
located in the first position for a particular search result, like “television,” sells 
out, that product’s pole position is immediately taken by the next product, 
and that product’s position is taken by the next product, and so on. So in 
our example, if three extremely highly ranked televisions sell out and your 
television was previously ranked fourth, all of a sudden your television is 
ranked first.
Simply by virtue of being ranked first for a given search result, all of a sudden 
your product will receive a lot more sales. That’s great news in the short term 
because a product that might not have generated a lot of sales will generate a 
huge amount of sales. The flip side is that your product will suddenly sell out—
unexpectedly—and you may not learn about the product being out of stock 
for days, weeks, or even months. Suddenly that product that was generating 
more sales is instead causing a shortfall in revenue because it’s out of stock!
As a supplier, you might not find out about this issue for days or weeks. The 
name of the game in e-commerce is speed. If you receive, let’s say, a weekly 
download regarding the number of items of inventory your retailer partner 
has on hand, you’re not only running blind but also missing out on millions of 
dollars in sales. The alerts give you immediate notification when something is 
not right; the Dashboard lets you track your metrics over time so you can see 
how things are trending—and how you’re doing in reaching your overall goals.
Out-of-stock reporting can be extremely nuanced. Unlike in-store stock 
reporting, where a product is either on the shelf or not, products can be in 
varying states of out of stock online. For example, for an omnichannel retailer, 
a product might not be available for delivery but may be available for pickup 
in the store, or vice versa. We work closely with clients to determine exactly 
what out of stock means for them and then calculate percentage (and flag 
specific items) on that basis.
Buy Box Ownership
The Buy Box is the box on a retailer’s web site where a shopper can click to 
add an item to their shopping cart. On both Amazon.com and Walmart.com, 
this is recognizable as the Add to Cart button. Because both sites support 
multiple sellers for each item, sellers can compete for the Buy Box. The web 
site itself can be the seller when the user clicks the Add to Cart button. That 
means the shopper is buying directly from the web site, such as Amazon or 
Walmart. Or, the seller can be a third-party seller. Third-party sellers are 
sellers like BJ’s Electronics for electronics, Wayfair for furniture, and many 
others. In this case, the sale goes to the third-party seller. (These sellers often 
sell direct on their own e-commerce web sites in addition to selling as a 
marketplace seller on Amazon or Walmart.)

Many large suppliers organize their business units/revenue streams by retailer. 
For example, a large electronics supplier might segment revenue by Amazon, 
Walmart, Best Buy, Home Depot, and a number of long-tail retailers. Therefore, 
they are interested to know how often they are owning the Buy Box (that 
is, the site itself is the direct seller of the product to the shopper) on a given 
site. If a supplier/the retailer site owned the Buy Box for a particular item only 
75 percent of the time, that would mean that one or more third-party sellers 
owned the Buy Box the other 25 percent of the time. That’s 25 percent of 
sales that are being made by another channel that are not counting toward the 
revenue of the first-party channel, such as Amazon or Walmart.
Third-party sales can be great for smaller marketplace sellers who are selling 
their own products through the marketplace. But for big brands it’s another 
story. Instead of only the retailer taking some of the margin (in exchange for 
selling the product to the shopper), both the retailer and the marketplace 
seller are taking a cut of the action. So, not only are the supplier’s retailer 
sales teams not getting compensated for their efforts, the company overall is 
losing out on margin.
The root cause of losing the Buy Box is typically either price or out-of-stock 
issues (or both). If a first-party (1P) seller’s price is higher than a marketplace 
(3P) seller, the 3P seller will win the Buy Box. Similarly, if the retailer sells out 
of a given product and the product is available only from 3P sellers, one of 
those sellers—the one with the lowest price—is going to win the Buy Box. 
So, it’s critically important to track ownership of the Buy Box on sites like 
Amazon and Walmart that support marketplace sellers.
Losing the Buy Box a large portion of the time is often indicative of a bigger 
problem in a supplier’s business. If third parties are constantly undercutting the 
supplier on price, that means they’re not adhering to their pricing agreements 
with the supplier or they’ve found another source of the product that enables 
them to sell at a lower price. Alternatively, if a supplier is losing the Buy Box 
because their products keep going out of stock, that means the retailer isn’t 
stocking enough of their product and they need to discuss with their buyer 
keeping more product in stock. Either way, bricks-to-clicks suppliers track 
their Buy Box percentages daily so they know if they have a problem and can 
take action to correct it.
Assortment
Assortment goes hand in hand with out-of-stock reporting. When suppliers 
think about an assortment measure on the Dashboard, what they’re usually 
looking to understand is how many of the products that they think should be 
carried on a given site are actually carried on that site. It’s not a measure of 
whether those products are in or out of stock. It’s a measure of whether the 
retailer is carrying those products at all.

Bricks to Clicks
43
When might there be a disconnect between what a supplier thinks their 
assortment is on a site and what it is? There are a few potential scenarios. 
First, an item might never have been set up. A retailer agreed to carry the 
item, the supplier agreed to sell it to the retailer, but the item never made it 
through item setup. Perhaps it never got submitted to be set up. Or perhaps 
it was submitted but there was a problem with the setup information. Or 
perhaps there’s a technical issue with the site—the item is there but because 
of a technical glitch, it’s just not showing up in the results.
For the assortment measure, we receive a specific list of products from the 
supplier and then compare that with the items available on the site. Bricks-to-
clicks suppliers are adamant about ensuring that the products that should be 
available on a retailer’s site actually are.
Ratings and Reviews
More than half of online purchasers read reviews before making a buying 
decision.2 Ratings and reviews are critical measures of how much (or how 
little) shoppers like an individual product—and taken together they are good 
measures of how happy consumers are with a brand. Ratings and reviews can 
also be an early indicator of a product issue. If a product that has typically 
had four-star and better reviews suddenly receives a lot of one- and two-star 
reviews, that often indicates there’s a production, packaging, or shipping issue 
that the brand needs to correct quickly.
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers carefully monitor reviews of their products, both as 
a measure of overall consumer happiness with their brand but also to know 
quickly whether they have an issue. When it comes to ratings and reviews, 
we typically measure two key metrics: the number of reviews and the star 
rating. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers want to see at least one review and ideally at 
least 21 reviews for every single product. One measure we track is review-
coverage percentage, meaning the percent of a supplier’s products that have 
at least one review. We also track ratings: bricks-to-clicks suppliers want to 
see an average of four stars or better for their products on a one to five scale. 
Any lower than that and shoppers are unhappy with their products.
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers want to be able to track and be alerted to the 
following:
• 
New negative reviews—so they can take action quickly
• 
Products that have low review counts—so they can look 
at ways to increase review counts
2https://www.internetretailer.com/2016/03/11/more-online-shoppers-read- 
reviews-buying

Chapter 3 | First Insight, Then Action
44
• 
Products that are being reviewed especially well—so they 
can identify patterns and trends that may help with other 
products
The Product Ratings report (shown in Figure 3-5) provides detailed reporting 
on which products are doing well when it comes to reviews and where the 
opportunity is.
When launching new products, some large bricks-to-clicks suppliers leverage 
review campaigns to gain reviews for their products. On Amazon.com, this program 
is known as Amazon Vine. Most other sites don’t have authorized reviewer 
programs like Amazon does, but companies such as BzzAgent, a word-of-mouth 
marketing company, will run review campaigns using a network of consumers who 
review products in exchange for receiving those products for free.
Especially when launching new products, it’s helpful to be able to track 
improvement in reviews for specific products over time. That’s exactly the 
kind of reporting that the Ratings Trends report provides. It’s especially useful 
because you can see not only how your overall review counts are changing 
but how they’re changing at each rating level.

Content Health
Another key area we measure is related to the health of your online product 
content. We’ve spent a lot of time discussing content in previous chapters—
the Dashboard rolls up that information into a few key content metrics that 
you can track on an ongoing basis.
Content health is important because it’s a measure of how well your items are 
presented online on the individual item pages. If an item page for your product 
has no image, for example, in the best case, shoppers aren’t going to have the 
information they need to evaluate the item, and in the worst case, shoppers 
are going to mistakenly think the physical item has a problem or is out of 
stock. Either way, a missing image, poor image, or lack of multiple images is bad 
for your brand and your items.
We factor a variety of individual measures into the overall content health 
score. We normally split the content health score into the percentage of 
items with high-priority issues, medium-priority issues, and items that are 
missing enhanced content.
We can also look at criteria such as the following:
• 
Does the primary image for an item, as displayed on a 
retailer’s site, match the master primary image that the 
supplier has provided? (A master image can be an image 
we received from the supplier; it can also be imagery on 
another retailer site where a provider thinks they have 
especially strong content.)
• 
What percentage of the secondary/alternate images on a 
retailer match the master images that the supplier wants 
to see displayed for that item?
• 
What percent of items contain at least one keyword in 
the product title for the category or subcategory that the 
item is in? For example, does a diapers item contain the 
word diaper in the product title?
• 
What percent of items contain at least one keyword in 
the product description for the category or subcategory 
that the item is in? Similarly, for a diaper item, is the word 
diaper mentioned in the product description?

Chapter 3 | First Insight, Then Action
46
Ultimately we roll up these metrics into a score (which can be calculated 
with no weighting or with extra weighting given to certain factors), and that 
becomes the supplier’s content health score.
Figure 3-6 shows an example Content Health report. The score inside the 
circle indicates the overall health of your items. You can click any row to see 
the specific items on which you should take action. Content Health reports 
can be customized by business segment, product list, department and category 
and generated for virtually any retailer.
If you have multiple product lines, brands, or business segments, you can split 
them up into different lists, and you can select multiple lists to see how you’re 
doing on content health across the board.
Within the Content Health report, we group items by issue type: high priority, 
medium priority, and those items that are in good content health. The system 
is set up with a default set of rules, based on our extensive experience with 
retailers and suppliers, that determine how issues are classified and the 
importance of any given issue. Those rules can be easily configured based 
on specific requirements. For example, if you want to increase the minimum 
threshold for the number of images or make videos a requirement to get a 
good content health score, it’s easy to do (Table 3-1). It’s also easy to configure 
rules specifically for each retailer, such as if you want to adhere to a certain 
minimum image count on Amazon.com but a different minimum image count 
on Walmart.com.
Figure 3-6.  Content Health report

Bricks to Clicks

High-priority issues typically refer to elements such as missing images and 
product descriptions that are less than 25 words in length. That’s because 
these are essential. If an item is missing an image or has just a couple of words 
for a description, it’s not going to do well in the search results, and even if a 
shopper does find it, they’re not likely to buy it because of the poor quality of 
the content. (All thresholds are customizable.)
Medium-priority issues refer to content segments such as the number of 
images, whether those images are high-resolution images (so they can be 
zoomed in), whether the descriptions are sufficiently long (not just meeting 
the minimum requirements), and whether the items include enhanced content 
such as videos.
As part of content health, we can also measure factors such as whether an item 
page includes enriched content or has videos, 360 views, or PDFs embedded 
directly on the page. These metrics factor into the Rich Media card.
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers track, at a minimum, the percentage of their items 
with high-priority issues and then work diligently to get that percentage down 
as low as possible.
Table 3-1.  Content Health Best Practices
Segment
Best Practice
Rationale
Images
3 or more high-resolution 
images
When a customer can see a clear picture 
of the product they’re planning to 
purchase, it significantly increases their 
willingness to buy.
Product description 150 words or more
Longer descriptions are better—they 
help with search engine listings and 
provide more information to customers 
to inform purchase decisions.
Product title
50 to 70 characters
Titles longer than 70 characters are 
hard to read on mobile devices. Titles 
less than 25 characters are often missing 
critical information.
Enhanced content
At least 1 piece of 
enhanced content
Videos, PDFs, and comparison tables have 
been shown to increase conversion rates.
Reviews
21 or more reviews
More reviews increase conversion rates. 
Products benefit the most once they 
receive at least 21 reviews.

Share of Shelf
Share of shelf and share of search appear on the Dashboard in the Search 
and Shelf section. Think of the last time you shopped for a new television 
online. There are two ways you could have gotten to the set of products you 
were interested in evaluating. One way was to use site navigation, first clicking 
Electronics, then clicking Televisions, and then maybe even drilling down into 
a hot new area like “4K TVs.” From there you would have seen results on a 
shelf page, a page specific to a department/category/subcategory in the site’s 
hierarchy. Shelf pages refer to pages that shoppers navigate to, typically using 
the left navigation bar on a retailer’s web site.
Your share of shelf refers to the percentage of the items on the digital shelf 
that belong to your brand or your company. Suppose that when you browsed 
to that television page there were 20 total results on the first page, and that 
of those 20 results, five belonged to your brand. Therefore, your share of shelf 
would be 5 out of 20, or 25 percent.
Now suppose that there are separate shelf pages for televisions, portable 
televisions, high-definition televisions, and curved televisions. In this case, to 
measure your share of shelf, we calculate your share for each individual shelf 
page and then average those together to produce your overall share of shelf 
measure. The Dashboard can still display your share for each individual page, 
but at a high level you’re probably more interested in knowing first how you’re 
doing across the broader set of shelf pages and then drilling down into the 
details. This overall percentage is your share of shelf.
We can even run this calculation for shelf pages across multiple web sites, 
say Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, and Bestbuy.com, to calculate 
your share of shelf for televisions across all four sites. We can compare this 
measure with your offline share, with a specific goal you’ve set or both. And 
we can trend this over time to show you whether your share is improving, 
staying the same, or getting worse. We can also look at a more granular 
analysis of shelf results, looking at, say, only the first three positions, the first 
ten positions, the first page, or the first few pages of results. Most clients want 
their share of shelf to be based on the first page of results or on the first three 
or first ten results only.
Based on your share, we might suggest changes to your content or the 
addition of a paid campaign to supplement your position in the shelf results. 
But the first step is doing what leading bricks-to-clicks suppliers do, which 
is to track your share on at least one retailer site, followed by tracking your 
share across multiple sites so you can see how your share compares across 
retail channels.

Bricks to Clicks
49
Share of Search
The other way you could have gotten to a set of televisions to evaluate is by 
typing, say, “4K televisions” into the search box on the retailer’s web site. This 
would have produced a set of results related to that search term. Put simply, 
instead of navigating, you would have been searching, using a search term, 
much like you might search for something in a search engine like Google.
If you don’t have a meaningful share of search results, shoppers will never 
see your products. Statistics show that products in the first three search 
positions for any given search receive more than 60 percent of all clicks.3 
Comprehensive share of search reporting includes tracking for at least a few 
dozen search terms (in the case of televisions, that might include terms like 
“televisions,” “TVs,” “4K TVs,” “UHD TVs,” “curved TVs,” and so on). More 
typically, share of search tracking is done based on hundreds of search terms 
for a segment (such as televisions, tablets, mobile phones, and appliances).
As with share of shelf, we can always look at share for individual search terms, 
but we usually start by looking at share of search across a large group of 
search terms first. We can evaluate just the first three search results, the 
first ten results, the entire first page, or multiple pages. Most clients have us 
measure share for the first ten results or the first page. By monitoring share of 
search, we can often spot valuable opportunities, such as products that should 
be showing up on the first page of search results but aren’t.
Right on the Dashboard you can turn over the cards and see your share of 
search for each search term that makes up your overall score. That lets you 
know right away where you’re doing well and where you need to invest.
Like out-of-stock reporting, share of search and share of shelf have nuances 
to the way they’re measured. For example, suppose that when a shopper 
searches for “diapers” on a site that supports both first-party and third-party 
(marketplace) sellers, should items in the results that are only available from 
marketplace sellers be counted in the share of shelf and share of search 
results?
Or, should only 1P items be counted? Some brands (or, more specifically, some 
teams at those brands) want to see results only for 1P items. 3P sales for a big 
brand don’t count toward the sales for the retailer team at a given brand, like 
the Walmart.com team or the Amazon.com team. Therefore, they only want 
1P results to be included in their share calculations. But at other brands we 
work with, they feel that any item that matches their brand, whether it comes 
from a 3P seller or is sold directly by the site itself, should be included.

Chapter 3 | First Insight, Then Action
50
We refer to the brand-based share calculations as just that: brand-based share. 
We refer to the alternate way of calculating share as list-based share because 
the calculations are based on a specific list of products.
Both approaches are valid. Most bricks-to-clicks retailers have a view on 
which approach they’d prefer us to present on their Dashboard. In some 
cases, they’ve asked us to include cards for both sets of calculations so they 
compare and track both sets of results.
While the Dashboard provides roll-up reporting of your search terms, the 
Insights Share of Search report provides detailed reporting for your search 
terms. It shows you not only your own share but your competitors’ share as 
well. You can easily see how many and which keywords your products are 
ranking for.
■
■Note  Rankings refers to the number of desired items appearing in search results for a given 
keyword. Rankings are also referred to as placements.
You can do a one-time export or create regularly scheduled exports. 
Scheduled exports are especially useful for large data exports that need to 
be generated on a regular basis. You can chart your share of search for easy 
viewing. As an example, bar chart mode (Figure 3-7) provides a snapshot in 
time, while trend analysis view makes it easy to see how you’re doing over the 
course of a given time period.
Figure 3-7.  Share of search snapshot view

Bricks to Clicks
51
You can easily export any of the charts (as well as the raw data) for inclusion 
in presentations and business reports.
Taxonomy
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers segment the view of their data in the Dashboard 
in several ways. Smaller suppliers stick with lists of items called product lists. 
These are simply lists of URLs, where each URL corresponds to an item 
page on a retailer’s web site. Examples of lists are Spring 2017 Collection, 
Televisions, Top 300 Items, and so on. Lists are the easiest way to organize 
products on the Dashboard. Lists of URLs can be easily generated from UPC 
codes, tool IDs (in the case of Walmart.com), ASINs (in the case of Amazon), 
TCINs (in the case of Target), and other codes and IDs.
Companies with multiple divisions or business units often use a more 
comprehensive taxonomy approach for their Dashboard. The taxonomy can 
be broken down by department, category, subcategory, and brand, and search 
terms for share of search can be associated with specific groups within the 
taxonomy (such as diaper-related keywords for diaper brands and shaving-
related keywords for shaving brands). Taxonomy views are especially helpful 
for understanding how a business unit is doing and performing comparisons 
across business units. Managers can quickly identify, for example, which brands 
have the biggest opportunity for improvement and focus their efforts on 
those brands.
Custom Dashboards
Based on our work with suppliers, we’ve developed a comprehensive Dashboard 
that is now used by category captains like P&G, L’Oréal, Samsung, Levi’s, Mattel, 
Clorox, and many others. The development of the Dashboard has been a true 
collaboration with our suppliers, with them providing ongoing input into the 
metrics they care about and the way they want to see key data presented 
(both on the Dashboard and in alerts).
That said, some suppliers want custom views of the Dashboard that are 
specific to their business. As an example, one supplier we work with has 
developed their own internal methodology for reporting on some of the key 
metrics we’ve discussed through this chapter. They rolled the metrics up into 
a group of key categories with one card for each metric. And, they have 
a unique overall score calculation based on the component metrics they’ve 
selected as relevant to their business. We developed their custom Dashboard 
for them, based on our existing capabilities, in about a month.

Chapter 3 | First Insight, Then Action
52
Other suppliers have specific time requirements. As an example, one supplier 
we work with reports to their leadership team first thing Monday morning. 
They use Saturdays as the benchmark for the week, so we gather and generate 
their reports for them on Saturdays. During the week, we still collect all the 
day-to-day data, but the data they report on is from our Saturday run.
Global View
Global bricks-to-clicks suppliers require a global view of their business. 
That’s why our Dashboard supports global reporting across many different 
countries. Being global not only means we collect performance data on many 
retailer web sites across the globe but also means that we can present that 
data in the Dashboard.
Using the Dashboard, you can look at data for one individual retailer site, for 
all the sites within a country, for all the countries in a region, and across the 
entire globe. We can roll up the results and show the average, or you can 
compare two sites, countries, or regions side by side.
Heatmaps
Throughout this chapter we’ve covered many different reporting segments. 
Charting is useful for trend analysis, but another visual presentation format—
the heatmap—is even more useful for understanding performance across 
your business. Suppose you want to see the performance of all your business 
segments on a retailer according to each key performance indicator. Using our 
built-in heatmap support we can show you all your brands side by side and 
how they’re each doing for a particular reporting segment.
Without a heatmap, you’d have to go through each brand and note the brand’s 
performance for each relevant segment. Using the heatmap you can quickly 
pinpoint which brands are doing well and where there are opportunities for 
improvement.
External Reporting
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers not only use the Dashboard for internal reporting 
but for external reporting as well. Many of our suppliers bring the Dashboard 
to their buyer meetings and use the Dashboard for year beginning meetings 
(YBMs) and quarterly business reviews (QBRs). This lets them highlight 
specific areas where the supplier is outperforming—and areas where they 
would like the retailer to improve.

Bricks to Clicks
53
For example, in the Walmart ecosystem, there is a special focus on delivering 
high-quality content. Some suppliers started out with poor content health 
(missing images, few images, or poor image quality) often because they 
traditionally sold in-store only. They’ve since made a concerted effort to 
improve their content, and their content health scores have improved as a 
result. They want to highlight this progress—tracked over time for context—
to their buyer.
In another example, a supplier might want to show a buyer that the buyer 
needs to order more products on a regular basis. If the supplier’s out-of-stock 
rate has remained steady over the course of several months or quarters, the 
buyer needs to know about it. Showing a trended analysis of out-of-stock rates 
to a buyer is a powerful way to help convince the buyer that they need to be 
placing bigger orders and stocking more inventory of the supplier’s product.
Summary
This chapter covered the many metrics that bricks-to-clicks suppliers are 
tracking and optimizing to get the most sales for their business. Not only do 
bricks-to-clicks suppliers use the Dashboard to report on their e-commerce 
metrics, they also use it to report on in-store sales performance so that they 
can have all their data in one place. They’ve made it the control center for 
their business operations.
Combined with this, they’ve configured alerts (or had us configure alerts for 
them) to let them know when they urgently need to take action (such as 
when products go out of stock) and so they can receive performance updates 
straight in their inboxes. The bricks-to-clicks suppliers have recognized that 
having a Dashboard enables them to do the following:
• 
Understand the key metrics that matter to their business 
in one place, including consolidating multiple sources of 
data (web, retailer, and internal) and data across multiple 
retailers and regions
• 
Get a snapshot of business performance and view trend 
analysis
• 
Easily see where there are opportunities for improvement
• 
Set business goals and use the Dashboard to manage 
them
• 
Report to their leadership on business performance
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers that use the Content Analytics system not only can 
gain insight into their business but can also take action to improve, producing 
meaningful improvements in sales as a result.

“Content Analytics gives us the tools to make sure we’re not just watching, 
but instead are leading the charge.”
—Mattel
Supplier Case Study
In 2016, using the Content Analytics platform, bricks-to-clicks supplier Mattel 
had their single best year ever on Walmart.com. They increased their ship-
ments to Walmart.com 39 percent over the previous year. That was more 
than five times better than the industry average of 7 percent predicted by 
research firm NPD. As Mattel put it, “We’ve never seen numbers like this 
before.”

Chapter 4 | Confront the New Path to Purchase
56
Mattel is one of the world’s largest toy makers, with nearly $6 billion in annual 
revenue.
Rewind just a few months. Mattel saw a tremendous opportunity. They could 
see that e-commerce was growing. And they knew that a successful omnichan-
nel activation approach would need to be at the center of their go-forward 
strategy.
■
■Note  By using the Content Analytics platform, Mattel achieved more than five times better 
sales performance than the industry average.
At the same time, Mattel was faced with tremendous complexity. They were 
selling thousands of items across multiple channels. They needed a way to 
track and improve pricing, out-of-stock rates, and online product presence. 
They needed a complete solution that would give them end-to-end control. 
They found it in the Content Analytics platform, which fit seamlessly with the 
company’s focus on best-in-class omnichannel management. Mattel realized 
immediate success for a number of their original objectives.
• 
Improving content health
• 
Improving out-of-stock rates
• 
Owning the Buy Box
Here’s how they did it—and how you can too, whether you’re just getting 
started in e-commerce or already have hundreds or even thousands of items 
for sale online.
Improving Content Health
Mattel’s first step with their new set of e-commerce tools was to go after what 
they identified early as a key obstacle: content quality. Improving the quality of 
their content would provide a significant impact quickly, leading to more sales. 
They used Content Health reports to identify products where they needed to 
optimize titles and product descriptions, add search-optimized keywords, and 
add or improve photos and videos. They leveraged the editing capability built 
in to the Content Analytics platform to make the content updates. Based on 
this work, they steadily improved until they achieved perfect content health 
scores, which they continue to monitor and maintain.
Content Analytics Content Health reports have become the standard in the 
industry because of their highly actionable nature. They provide you with 
the exact information you need to improve the content quality of your item 
pages.

Bricks to Clicks
57
Improving Out-of-Stock Rates
Mattel’s second step was to reduce out-of-stock rates. Mattel used a 
­combination of out-of-stock reports and alerts to identify out-of-stock issues 
and take action when they occurred. Using the reports and alerts, they were 
able to reduce their reaction time by five days. As a result, they improved  
their out-of-stock rates for the Mattel Girl’s assortment from 43.7 percent 
to 16.3 percent.
Figure 4-1 shows a sample Out of Stock alert.
As with other alerts, you can configure Out of Stock alerts to be sent just to 
yourself or to multiple people within your organization. That way everyone 
responsible for addressing supply chain and inventory issues can get notified 
at the same time.
Owning the Buy Box
Mattel’s third step was to make sure they were owning the Buy Box as often 
as possible. On Amazon.com and Walmart.com, when a seller wins the Buy 
Box, that seller becomes the default seller that captures the sale when a shop-
per adds the item to their shopping cart. If a seller prices an item higher than 
other sellers or is out of stock on an item, that seller will lose the Buy Box.  
Figure 4-1.  Out of Stock alert

Chapter 4 | Confront the New Path to Purchase
58
First-party suppliers are constantly competing to win the Buy Box with 
­marketplace sellers who sell the same item. So when a Mattel item went 
out of stock, a third-party (marketplace) seller would win the Buy Box. The 
result was overpriced purchases (which Mattel did not capture the additional  
revenue from) or abandoned sales. This loss of control was destroying value 
for both the retailer and Mattel.
Mattel used the Content Analytics pricing tools to receive notifications when 
prices went too high. They were able to notify their retail buyer who would 
adjust the prices back down to maintain ownership of the Buy Box, resulting 
in more direct sales for the retailer and Mattel.
Whenever the Buy Box went to a third-party seller, Mattel received an alert 
from the Content Analytics system. From these alerts, Mattel stumbled on a 
breakthrough. They decided to set up Mattel as a marketplace seller so they 
could be a third-party seller themselves for the same items in the Walmart.
com marketplace. Thus, the “Mattel Shop” was born, demonstrating Mattel’s 
innovative approach as a bricks-to-clicks supplier.
When a Mattel item was out of stock on Walmart.com (direct), the Mattel 
Shop kicked in as a third-party seller to secure the Buy Box. This preserved 
brand equity, maintained control over the customer experience, and captured 
the customer as a Walmart-sourced transaction. What’s more, in the first 
month of operating the Mattel Shop as a marketplace seller, Mattel captured 
an additional $1.6 million in sales.
Mattel was careful to leave the Mattel Shop pricing just above Walmart.com’s 
own direct pricing. That way, Mattel never took the Buy Box away from the 
retailer and there was no cannibalization of direct sales.
Futures
Mattel has established four clear goals for their go-to market efforts.
• 
Achieve long-term omnichannel success
• 
Improve reporting and the supply chain to support 
omnichannel integration
• 
Integrate processes to improve channel management and 
communication
• 
Optimize the mobile shopping experience for research 
and conversion
Among the traditional bricks suppliers and retailers we work with, omnichan-
nel is one of their top priorities. It has to be. For the first time ever, ­according 
to a joint UPS and Comscore study, shoppers are doing more of their 
­shopping online than in stores, with more than 50 percent of purchases now

made online.1 When it comes to the next generation of shoppers, millenni-
als, the percent purchasing online is even higher, with millennials now making  
54 ­percent of their purchases online. Online purchasing is here to stay, and 
suppliers and retailers alike are eager to get it right.
A study of 46,000 shoppers shows that omnichannel merchandising does 
work. Omnichannel shoppers spend more than their single-channel coun-
terparts, with omnichannel participants in the study spending 4 percent in 
stores and 10 percent online.2 Omnichannel shoppers are also more loyal, 
logging “23 percent more repeat shopping trips” within six months after an 
omnichannel shopping experience.
Even historically online-only retailer Amazon.com is getting in on the act with 
the introduction of Amazon Go stores. Amazon Go is Amazon’s next-­generation  
in-store shopping experience—with no checkout process. What makes Amazon 
Go different than most (all?) stores is that the store automatically figures out 
which items a consumer has taken from the shelf.3 The technology to track con-
sumer behavior in stores (such as identifying specific walking paths through the 
store) has been around for some time. But this is the first an association is being 
made between an individual consumer action (taking an item off the shelf) and 
an item. Typically consumer actions are aggregated into more general models 
that are used to improve store and shelf layouts.
While the first-ever Amazon Go store (which so far is available only to 
Amazon employees) shows a promising picture of the store of the future, 
many suppliers and retailers are concerned with the here and now of today’s 
omnichannel experience.
The retailer ultimately controls the physical store experience. Yet suppliers 
have a great deal of control over the digital experience that accompanies that 
in-store experience, as well as the reporting that goes with the omnichannel 
experience.
Often when people talk about omnichannel, they mean the combination of  
in-store and online. But with always-connected mobile devices and an increas-
ing propensity toward shopping on those devices, mobile should be con-
sidered an important channel in its own right in the omnichannel equation. 
Purchasing on smartphones continues to increase year over year, and some 
63 percent of millennials now make purchases on their mobile devices. Now 
that bricks-to-clicks suppliers like Mattel have succeeded in achieving many of 
their core e-commerce optimization goals, their next step will be to optimize 
their omnichannel experience, across in-store, desktop, and mobile.

Retailer Case Study
Switching gears to the retailer side of the house, inventory optimization is 
one of the most frequent challenges we help with—and one of the most com-
mon issues we find. One retailer we work with had an ongoing issue around 
missing inventory. This isn’t inventory that was lost or stolen; it was inventory 
that their inventory feed said was there, but then that inventory mysteriously 
did not appear on their web site. What was going on? Where was the missing 
inventory?
In contrast to out-of-stock reporting, when we talk about inventory, we’re 
typically referring to a data feed or inventory status file we’re receiving directly 
from a retailer or supplier’s inventory management system. (In the supplier’s 
case, this normally applies to cases where the supplier is fulfilling the product 
directly, such as drop-ship vendors or marketplace sellers.) Inventory data 
usually comes from a back-end inventory management system that tracks 
how many units of inventory are on hand for every item.
On the surface, it seems like inventory feed data and the in-stock/out-of-stock 
status as reported on a retailer’s web site should be identical. Yet suppliers 
and retailers know all too well that this is often not the case.
I’ve gone into more than one prospect meeting thinking this is the one. This is 
the meeting where they’re going to tell me that they simply don’t need out-of-
stock reporting—that they’ve got it covered. But I’ve never had that meeting. 
More often than not, I’ll go into a prospect meeting armed with a fresh out-of-
stock report (the true shopper view of things) only to hear someone exclaim, 
“Wait, I thought those products were in stock!”
A complex combination of retailer system settings, physical product sources, 
and time-of-day issues determine whether products are shown as in stock or 
out of stock on a retailer’s web site.
To help solve the problem, the first thing we did was set up a daily inventory 
data feed from the retailer’s inventory system (in their case, GSI Commerce) 
to us. There was no complex integration—simply a data dump to us from 
their inventory system. We then started crawling the same items on their 
site. From there we could immediately tell there was a big difference between 
what their inventory system was reporting was available and what their web 
site was showing shoppers was available for purchase.
More importantly, we could tell exactly which products were being reported 
differently in the inventory system compared with what was displayed on 
the retailer’s web site. Previously, the retailer only knew that they had a big 
problem: there was a large quantity of inventory mysteriously missing, but they 
couldn’t tell which products were the issue.

Bricks to Clicks
61
Armed with the information about which specific products were different 
between the inventory system and the web site, the retailer has been able to 
track down the missing items. In all, we’ve helped the retailer find more than 
60,000 units of inventory per month that should have been for sale on their 
web site but weren’t—millions of dollars in inventory that otherwise would 
not have been for sale. In the process, we’ve also helped the retailer improve 
overall customer satisfaction because there’s nothing more frustrating for a 
customer to find the item page for a product they want to buy only to dis-
cover that it’s out of stock. Or perhaps it’s more frustrating for a retailer to 
have the product a shopper wants to buy on hand and not be able to sell it 
to them.
As you can see, this intersection between retailer or supplier-provided data 
and web-crawled data is a powerful one. When we bring together multiple 
sources of data in this way, we can create meaningful new insights for our cli-
ents that weren’t available from the data when it was delivered separately—if 
it was delivered at all.
Leadership Opportunities
For many suppliers and retailers, e-commerce simply wasn’t a big enough 
channel to invest in—until suddenly it was. As a result, many bricks retail-
ers and suppliers waited too long to stake out leadership positions in the 
e-commerce space. Yet there are still many opportunities.
Here’s how a few of our supplier clients are taking leadership positions in 
their respective verticals:

Steps to E-commerce Leadership
Based on our work, we’ve identified four key steps to establishing leadership 
in e-commerce.
1.	 Be present online.
2.	 Use metrics to drive rapid, continuous improvement 
cycles.
3.	 Adopt a minimum viable product (MVP) approach.
4.	 Embrace the new path to purchase.
Be Present Online
The first step—being present online—may seem simple and obvious, yet many 
prospects we talk with are still establishing their presence online. When we 
analyzed the item pages of one large processed food maker on a few of their 
main retailers, we found that their items were for sale online. That was seem-
ingly good news, except that the food maker was not a direct seller of any 
of their items. As a result, third parties (marketplace sellers) were listing 
the company’s items for sale on Amazon and Walmart. The company had no 
­control over their brand/product presence.
Their products were being sold at all kinds of different prices, completely 
unrelated to what a shopper would expect to pay for the same items in a 
store. The imagery that most of the marketplace sellers used was poor—low-
resolution images that did not do justice to the products and were often of 
lower quality than the images on the supplier’s own brand site. Plus, the sup-
plier’s products were not optimized for maximum visibility in search on the 
retailers’ web sites.

Bricks to Clicks
63
When we first talked with this supplier, we realized that they were not yet 
at the optimization stage. They were at the initialization stage—getting their 
products online. To get products online, bricks-to-clicks suppliers follow a 
few key steps.
1.	 Identify the products they want to get online.
2.	 Set up those items.
3.	 Create best-in-class content for those items.
To help new suppliers get started, we often show them examples of the fol-
lowing: content health audits for best-in-class e-commerce suppliers, fully 
optimized item pages containing great content, and fully built out e-commerce 
reporting Dashboards. This quickly gives new suppliers a sense of what win-
ning will look like.
Of course, being present doesn’t end with having items for sale on retailer 
web sites. It’s also important to have a great brand site, filled with compel-
ling content. That means putting high-resolution images, optimized product 
descriptions, and videos not just on your retailer partners’ web sites but on 
your own brand site. Fortunately, the Content Analytics platform not only can 
provide reports and recommendations for your retailer product presence 
but can do so for your brand site (if you have one) too. Once you are set up 
as a direct supplier to your e-commerce retail channels and you have a fully 
built-out brand site, you’re in a much better position to control—or at least 
influence—your brand presence online.
Use Metrics to Drive Rapid, Continuous 
­Improvement Cycles
Many of our suppliers use the reporting metrics we provide to drive improve-
ment at the individual, department, company, and partner levels. Metrics are 
typically used to motivate behavior.
• 
Internal measurement: Heatmaps enable you to compare 
performance across departments and brands within your 
company, helping you to manage and optimize your entire 
portfolio. Cross-retailer heatmaps let you see where you 
have opportunities to improve across retailers, which is 
especially useful when you have sales teams that sell to 
specific retailers.
• 
External measurement: Suppliers use the Content Analytics 
Competitive Insights module to evaluate external com-
petition. This module supports brand groups. Each group 

Chapter 4 | Confront the New Path to Purchase
64
can have a primary brand—your brand and the competi-
tor brands. Bricks-to-clicks clients who are managing a 
portfolio set up multiple brand groups so they can check 
on each brand.
• 
Time-based measurement: Suppliers use time-based com-
petition, with both internal and external metrics, to moti-
vate performance. Suppliers want to make sure their 
products continue to perform well over time—and they 
ideally want to see metrics continue to improve from one 
measurement period (e.g., week, month, quarter, or year) 
to the next.
• 
Objective measurement: Bricks-to-clicks suppliers want 
to be best-in-class. The Content Analytics platform has 
built-in criteria that we’ve developed based on industry 
best practices and ongoing statistical analysis. Suppliers 
measure themselves against these criteria to make sure 
they are adhering to these best practices.
• 
Bricks-and-clicks measurement: Bricks-to-clicks suppli-
ers want to match or beat their in-store market share 
numbers, which they have been investing in for years. 
Therefore, they often use their in-store numbers as the 
benchmark for their digital share of shelf and share of 
search measurements.
Just as important as the metrics themselves, however, is how bricks-to-clicks 
suppliers put these metrics to work. One key approach across many success-
ful bricks-to-clicks suppliers is widespread, internal reporting done on a regu-
lar cadence. For some suppliers that means every day; for others, every week. 
Regardless of the frequency, the consistency of measurement and distribution 
of the resulting metrics is core to their approach.
By “reporting” internally on their key e-commerce metrics, our suppliers drive 
awareness of the importance of e-commerce within the organization. From 
there, they drive awareness around the importance of what the metrics them-
selves are measuring such as content quality, placements, inventory, pricing, 
and, ultimately, sales. By contrasting areas they’re doing well in with areas in 
which they need to improve, bricks-to-clicks suppliers demonstrate progress 
while also making the case for further investment. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers 
create a culture of continuous improvement through ongoing measurement, 
awareness generation, and business optimization.
■
■Note  In e-commerce, continuous improvement cycles times are fast—measured in days or 
weeks instead of months or years.

Bricks to Clicks
65
Haven’t many suppliers developed continuous improvement programs in 
the past? Yes, they have. What’s different in e-commerce is that continuous 
improvement cycle times are dramatically faster. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers 
move their businesses to a daily or weekly continuous improvement cycle 
from a quarterly or annual cycle.
With faster cycle times comes a greater ability to respond to exceptions. 
There’s no need for a product to stay out of stock for long when inven-
tory can be sourced from multiple locations, even multiple sellers. Prices can 
be adjusted in near real time. Broken or incorrect product imagery can be 
updated in minutes if not seconds.
The key to such a high level of responsiveness is being able to respond to 
these kinds of exceptions quickly. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers who implement a 
platform like Content Analytics get notified about exceptions and are able to 
manage them efficiently.
Adopt an MVP Approach
The Lean Startup movement took hold several years ago in Silicon Valley, in 
the midst of the financial crisis. We’ve found that the most nimble bricks-to-
clicks players have adopted this model in their entry into e-commerce. One of 
the core principles of the Lean Startup movement is the concept of minimum 
viable product. An MVP is “that version of a new product that allows a team 
to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with 
the least effort.”4 It is not a cheaper version of your actual product but rather 
a deliverable that enables you to collect the maximum amount of learning.5
How does this concept translate to leadership in e-commerce? Many clients 
we talk with have been trained to accept (unfortunately) long development 
cycles, heavy IT investment, and months or years of up-front implementation 
time before they can take action. Over the years, they’ve had to buy the entire 
system even though they really just wanted to run a few simple experiments.
When it comes to e-commerce, the MVP approach means being able to gather 
the maximum learning about what will work best for you in e-commerce 
with the least amount of effort—and to do so as quickly as possible. Because 
e-commerce is moving so quickly, our clients can’t afford to spend months or 
years determining their strategy. They need to act quickly.

about-smart-learning/

Chapter 4 | Confront the New Path to Purchase
66
Here are a few examples:
• 
One of our suppliers focuses on optimizing a list of 300 key  
products. Although we have their full product set of 
thousands of products loaded into our system, by mak-
ing a concerted effort on the top 300 products, they’ve 
achieved improvement in out-of-stock rates and content 
quality very rapidly.
• 
Another global supplier we work with started out by 
optimizing just 15 items in the grocery category. That 
may not seem like a lot, but at a company that does nearly 
$30 billion in revenue annually, changes are often consid-
ered only if they’re going to move the needle by at least a 
billion dollars. MVP allowed the company to do maximum 
learning with minimum risk.
• 
A third supplier we work with started out wanting to 
answer the question, could they improve their in-stock 
rates using our platform? Like other clients, they consid-
ered a boil-the-ocean approach but ultimately felt that if 
they could improve in one area, they could learn how to 
improve in others. Our work with them has continued in 
a similar way over time, running additional small e-com-
merce experiments to streamline their workflows and 
free them up to focus on selling to their customers—the 
retailers.
These are just a few of the many examples of how suppliers are using the 
MVP model to learn in e-commerce. The MVP approach provides them not 
only with a rapid learning process but with the ability to run multiple “experi-
ments” in parallel.
Just as our bricks-to-clicks clients adopt an MVP approach to learning and 
experimentation, they also adopt an all-in approach to e-commerce execution 
based on that learning. They then continue to use the experiments to tune 
their full-scale effort, using the learning to figure out where to double down 
and where to cut back.
Embrace the New Path to Purchase
Whether you’re a small supplier with a few dozen products to sell online or a 
large supplier with tens or even hundreds of thousands of products, embracing 
the new path to purchase is key. With brick-and-mortar stores, among the hard-
est parts of selling were convincing a retailer to carry your product and then 
figuring out how to supply enough inventory so shoppers could see that prod-
uct on the shelf—or many shelves because there were many physical stores.

Today, nearly anyone can become a seller. You can make a traditional arrange-
ment with the retailer, with the retailer stocking and shipping your products. 
You can also sell through marketplaces on Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Overstock, 
and others, or you can get set up as a drop-ship vendor (DSV).
Like marketplaces, DSV programs have changed the seller landscape, making 
it easier for smaller and newer sellers to act as virtual first-party sellers on 
large web sites like Amazon and Walmart. Typically, getting items through item 
setup as a DSV is easier and faster than making it through a true first-party 
setup process. With both marketplace and drop-ship approaches, consumers 
typically receive the product direct from the seller. But with marketplace sales, 
the seller controls the price (not the retailer), and the fact that the sale is 
coming from a marketplace seller is made clear on the site via “sold by” text 
indicating who the marketplace seller is.
■
■Note  With marketplace sales, the seller sets the price, and the retailer takes a fee for the sale. 
With DSV sales, the retailer prices and sells the item, recognizing revenue for the full price of the 
product and later remitting the wholesale price to the supplier.
With DSV sales, the retailer prices and sells the item, with the full revenue for 
the item going to the retailer and then the retailer remitting the wholesale 
price of the product to the seller later. In a marketplace sale, the retailer takes 
a fee for the sale.6 Regardless of approach, the process of getting online and 
selling items is much simpler and faster with e-commerce than it was in the 
brick-and-mortar world.
While listing and selling has gotten easier with e-commerce, the path to pur-
chase has become more complex. With brick-and-mortar stores, you sourced 
the product, stocked it, got it carried, and drove demand, in large part through 
advertising.
With e-commerce, the process doesn’t start when the consumer enters a 
store, and it doesn’t stop once the consumer makes a purchase. The “path to 
purchase” is much more extensive. With e-commerce you’re engaging in an 
ongoing dialogue with the consumer, one that is shaped through price, digital 
product presence, social influence, and delivery.
Consumers do research online—even if they purchase in-store. They read 
reviews, check social media, talk to their friends, and build a view on the items 
and brands they want to purchase. Both online and in-store they continue 
to research right up until the moment of purchase. And they remain highly

connected, with more than 90 percent of consumers using their smartphones 
while in store.7
Returns are also vastly different online than in stores. Online, a whopping  
30 percent or more of all products ordered are returned as compared with 
8.89 percent of products purchased in stores. Return rates are even higher 
during holiday periods, with return rates reaching as high as 50 percent. With 
almost 50 percent of retailers now offering free returns and 79 percent of 
consumers stating a desire for free return shipping, returns are getting easier.8
Unlike in-store returns, which have never been the easiest process in the 
world, e-commerce returns are easy. A prepaid return label often comes 
included with the original shipping box, and consumers are not against check-
ing prices even after receiving their item and returning it if they find a better 
price elsewhere. Discount promotions can also play a factor. If a product is 
cheaper today than it was yesterday, shoppers can easily swap out the product 
for the same product at a lower price.9
Among other reasons shoppers cite for returning items is that the prod-
uct they received doesn’t look like the one they ordered online—or they’ve 
received the wrong product. What’s more, if a product arrives late, doesn’t 
fit (in the case of apparel), or doesn’t meet expectations in some other way, 
shoppers are inclined to give a low rating and write a negative review, and this 
negative review becomes associated with the product, whether the issue was 
truly the seller’s fault or not.
All of these factors—more sellers competing for the same path to purchase, 
a greater number of products available, lower switching costs, and more 
informed shoppers—mean that the path to purchase is more complex online 
than in stores. With e-commerce, it’s no longer a one-size-fits-all path to 
purchase. It’s a sophisticated, customized path to purchase that requires long-
term, ongoing engagement with shoppers.
Our bricks-to-clicks suppliers invest heavily in delivering the best path to 
purchase possible with their largest retail partners. But they’re also finding 
ways to measure and optimize their brand and product presence across the 
long tail of hundreds, if not thousands, of specialty independent retailers, one 
of the fastest-growing segments of the retail market.10 That kind of scale can 
be achieved only with a technology platform like Content Analytics that can

­provide reporting, manage content, and deliver brand integrity across the 
many retailers that suppliers don’t have the capacity to support on a one-to-
one basis. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers are truly embracing—and leading—this 
new and highly sophisticated path to purchase.
Summary
The first shopping mall opened in 1956 in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of the 
Twin Cities. Since then we have seen the emergence of e-commerce in the 
mid-1990s and now the seemingly overnight shift in purchasing behavior from 
in-store to online. The Internet has played a big part, and so too has the wide-
spread adoption of mobile devices and low-cost shipping.
The next generation of shoppers is inherently digital and always connected, 
creating a more nuanced and significantly more complex path to purchase 
than ever before. Although the landscape is evolving rapidly, and in many cases 
because the landscape is evolving rapidly, nimble suppliers, who are open to 
rapid experimentation, can quickly make the transition from bricks to clicks. 
In the process, they can maintain, regain, and even establish long-term market 
leadership positions.

“Content is king.”
—Bill Gates
After many months of discussion, I was sitting with the senior vice president of 
e-commerce at the New York offices of one of the world’s largest consumer 
packaged goods (CPG) companies. The goal of the meeting was to figure out 
whether our platform (called the Master Catalog) would meet their needs 
for a product information management (PIM) system. Their images, videos, 
product descriptions, and other brand content files were spread across 
local hard drives, Google Drive, file servers, and legacy content management 
systems. It was everywhere—and nowhere.
It felt like I was in for a job interview and this was the make-or-break session. 
That’s because that’s exactly what it was: a job interview. The senior vice 
president was testing me personally to see how I would handle his questions. 
He was also interviewing our company as a potential vendor to see what kind 
of partner we would be to him and his company.
This was not just any senior vice president. He had been personally recruited 
from Amazon.com by another executive at the company. My plan was to tell 
him what I knew and to be candid about anything I didn’t know. That was the 
only shot I had at surviving a meeting with one of the leading authorities on 
e-commerce. I was more than a little nervous.

Senior executives know they can play a meeting with us as a potential vendor 
in one of two ways. They can play the power move—a big conference room 
with a long table and having the assistant show us in, making us wait, and, when 
they do arrive, catching us off guard by telling us they’re short on time. They 
can also choose not to say anything during an entire meeting, which is a lot 
harder on us than asking us tough questions that we can respond to.
The other way they can play it is to put us at ease. They come in, shake our 
hands, and spend a couple minutes on small talk, even though we know they’re 
far too busy to spend time on small talk. They may step out for a minute or 
two if they notice we need extra time to get set up—pretending that they 
forgot something when we know they’re just being gracious. When executives 
choose this approach, we know we absolutely must bring our A game. If they 
don’t feel the need to make us uncomfortable and nervous by pulling a series 
of power moves, you can bet they know their stuff.
We also expect that two things will happen in this second scenario. They’re 
going to ask us some very direct, tough questions, and we’re going to have a 
discussion, not a sales meeting. I’ve found that this second approach is the one 
that most bricks-to-clicks executives use to get the most value out of us as a 
vendor. They know that if they put us at ease and discuss their needs and our 
capabilities, we are going to want to work for them—and work hard.
They know that as product people, there’s nothing we want more than to 
hear great ideas and to build those ideas into a software product that meets 
their needs. They may even lay out some seemingly impossible challenges—not  
just because they want those challenges solved but because they know we live 
to solve them. Their goal isn’t just to get us interested because they’re paying 
us; their goal is to hook us by presenting us with interesting problems that 
will challenge us. They can put a lot of tough terms into a contract, or they 
can simply challenge us to solve the hardest problems they can come up with, 
knowing that once we’re hooked, we’re going to work like crazy to provide a 
solution.
Bricks-to-clicks executives choose the latter. It’s a form of soft power, and of 
course it works. As technologists, we’re suckers for solving challenging, large-
scale problems. That’s exactly the kind of meeting this was: a huge opportunity 
with a ton of challenges.
One of the final questions of the day was this: “Would you replace our existing 
system right away, or would you try to work with it?” Without thinking 
twice about it I answered, “I’d work with your existing system, until we have 
everything in place that you need in our system for you to feel comfortable 
turning your existing system off.”

Bringing In a New PIM System
There was a long period of silence after that while the SVP thought about 
my answer. I wasn’t sure if the answer I had given him was the one he 
wanted to hear, but I knew it was the right approach. He asked me why I had 
given him that answer. Other vendors he’d talked to were going to require 
him to replace their existing system completely on day 1 and commit to 
a heavy up-front implementation investment lasting six to nine months.  
(Of course, that approach is better for the vendor because the customer is 
then locked into the vendor’s platform—no matter how over budget and 
over time it runs.)
To me, the “rip-and-replace” approach was a complete nonstarter and was 
the old-school, decades-old enterprise software way of doing things. It simply 
didn’t mesh with our vision for ourselves, our customers, or e-commerce. If 
we were going to tell our customers that e-commerce was all about speed 
and scale, we couldn’t just talk the talk—we had to walk the walk. Here are 
the reasons I gave the SVP for going with our “work with your existing system 
until you’re ready to switch” approach:
• 
Legacy systems often have a lot of hidden, undocumented 
functionality—nuanced workflows and features that 
have been developed over many years. Users may not 
even be aware of these capabilities (silent data export 
jobs running as background tasks, for example) until they 
stop working. Suddenly switching them off can cause a lot 
more pain than it’s worth.
• 
By working with existing systems, we would leave him 
in full control. He could always fall back on his existing 
system until his team completed the switchover.
• 
It’s a less risky approach. Because we would run side by 
side with his existing system, he could adopt parts of our 
platform to start, such as content storage and syndication, 
and adopt other parts such as analytics later.
• 
We would be up and running and delivering value in days 
instead of months or years.
• 
Ripping out the legacy system would be a political 
challenge, one not worth fighting given all the other 
efforts the company had going on. By leaving the existing 
system in place, our SVP would take the heat off the 
situation.

74
Of course, leaving the existing system in place for a time also carried some 
risks. There was the possibility that the company’s users wouldn’t switch to 
the new system. Customers have told us that our platform is so much more 
flexible and easy to use than their internally developed or legacy solutions 
that I felt confident his users would want to switch over as quickly as possible.
We would have to synchronize with the customer’s legacy system until the 
switch was complete. That meant more work for us but lower risk for the 
customer.
As it turned out, the answer I gave the SVP (and many other clients finding 
themselves in a similar situation) was the right one. I still have the voicemail 
he left me a few weeks later telling me that they’d decided to go with us as 
their platform of choice.
In a replacement scenario like the one discussed, our approach is to work 
with a client’s existing systems and to get things up and running in days or 
weeks, not months or years. E-commerce is all about speed of execution. 
The bricks-to-clicks companies aren’t just trying to sell more products faster; 
they’re investing in systems and suppliers that operate at the speed and with 
the agility that e-commerce requires.
Product Information Management for 
E-commerce
When your products are mainly sold in stores, the approach to managing the 
content for those items, at least as it relates to your in-store presence, is fairly 
well understood. You (or an agency) take one photograph of the item, create 
a name for the item that goes into an inventory management system, and 
populate an item setup form, and you’re done. Whatever product name and 
image you provided at the time of item setup is good enough. That’s because 
the primary marketing for your item happens in the store—via the product 
and its packaging. There’s little need for a comprehensive set of images and 
what’s referred to as “romance” copy for the product description because 
the shopper will interact with the item directly. Packaging, advertising, in-store 
displays, product tags, and coupons are therefore the most effective ways to 
market and sell the product—in the store.
Suppliers that sell only a few products online have much the same mentality. 
Whatever they provide during item setup is sufficient, or if they do need to 
make a content update, they can do it via the retailer’s portal or via their 
buyer. But this begs two important questions.
First, who will create the content for the item? Second, how will they keep 
track of what content they’ve created, when it was submitted, where it was 
submitted (if they sell on multiple retailers), and whether it has gone live on 
the retailer’s site? It’s no big deal to manage content if you’re talking about 

Bricks to Clicks

a few items with one image and a product name each. But once you have 
multiple images per item and extensive product descriptions across more 
than one retailer web site, the problem becomes exponentially harder to 
deal with.
That’s where a good PIM system can make a big difference. And unlike PIM 
systems of old—from enterprise stalwarts like SAP and IBM—PIM systems 
today are available to every supplier, large or small, with pricing to match. 
Even a supplier with only a few items will be well served by having those 
items stored in a modern PIM that can organize the content and generate 
the necessary update forms or connect directly to retailer systems to update 
content. What’s more, modern PIM systems, designed for the needs of 
e-commerce, can directly output content update forms in the format required 
by retailers and in some cases connect directly to retailer systems to make 
immediate updates.
One of the biggest challenges in managing content without a PIM is that 
the text content (product descriptions and product name) and images and 
videos need to be stored separately. Images and videos can’t be embedded 
into spreadsheets that contain content. Moreover, spreadsheets weren’t 
designed to make editing of lengthy text, complete with bulleted lists and 
bolded phrases, easy. They were designed for numbers and formulas. Today’s 
PIMs make it easy to edit, preview, and update content—and to revise that 
content if the need arises.
Another value bricks-to-clicks suppliers are seeing from adopting modern 
PIM systems is integrated workflow capabilities. Workflows can be as simple 
as “save as draft,” allowing a copy editor to work on content but not submit 
it until it’s completely ready. Or workflows can be more sophisticated, routing 
content requests to external agencies and multiple internal departments such 
as marketing and legal, prior to submission. Advanced PIM systems, such as 
the Content Analytics platform, can analyze content before it’s submitted and 
figure out whether it’s optimized to deliver the most sales. They can also 
maintain an audit log of changes in case there is ever a question about who 
made a content change and when.
Existing Approaches—and Why They’re 
Doomed to Fail
In working with many different suppliers, we’ve found that existing approaches 
for content and content management fall into the following general categories:
• 
Limited or no e-commerce brand assets: These suppliers 
have been focused primarily on brick-and-mortar sales 
where multiple high-resolution images and high-quality, 
optimized product descriptions simply weren’t necessary.

Chapter 5 | Activate Your Brand Content
76
• 
No systemized approach: Brand assets are stored on local 
hard drives, Dropbox, or Google Drive.
• 
Legacy systems or custom systems: Brand assets are 
stored in legacy, typically on-premise solutions not 
designed for the specific needs of e-commerce. These 
systems are expensive to maintain and don’t support 
the many different retailer templates required by today’s 
e-commerce web sites.
Let’s take a look at each of these approaches in turn.
Limited or No E-commerce Brand Assets
It is not at all uncommon for us to work with suppliers who start with nothing 
more than a product name from an inventory management system and a poor-
quality, low-resolution product image. For years, this content plus the attribute 
data required for initial item setup, such as dimensions, weight, and warranty 
information, have been all that’s required. The only people who looked at these 
product names and poor-quality images were inventory managers, buyers, and 
sellers. Shoppers themselves never saw these names and images because they 
interacted with the physical product itself—in the store. High-quality imagery, 
descriptive product names, and detailed product descriptions simply weren’t 
needed.
But now these same products are being carried for sale online. And shoppers 
faced with a low-resolution, hard-to-make-out image combined with a product 
name intended for an inventory management system rather than a consumer 
are all too quick to click away to another product.
■
■Note  High-quality content increases conversion rates and reduces return rates because 
customers receive the product they expect to receive.
Even worse, sometimes a shopper will go ahead and buy a product anyway, 
only to find out upon receiving it that it isn’t the product she wanted. That just 
results in costly returns for the retailer. Multiple high-resolution images and a 
clear product description make it a lot easier for a shopper to know whether 
they’re buying the product they really want.
What’s more, suppliers today are up against extremely sophisticated online 
sellers—sellers who use descriptive product names that are likely to match 
the most popular online searches, high-resolution product imagery that makes 
their products stand out, and detailed product descriptions that not only help 
make their products discoverable in search results but also make it easy for 
shoppers to understand all the features and capabilities of their products.

77
Content matters even for those products that are listed online but can only 
be bought in-store. Often the consumer’s first impression of a product is 
made during research done online. If a product looks bad online, it reduces 
the likelihood a shopper will buy it in the store. One product with bad content 
can tarnish a shopper’s entire image of a brand, not just of that one product.
Plus, the universe of products that can be bought only in stores is getting ever 
smaller. Particularly in grocery, many items previously available only in stores 
are now available for purchase online. Services like Amazon Fresh, Peapod, and 
Walmart Home Grocery are making online grocery purchases much more 
prevalent than they have been historically. Consumers are demanding the 
convenience, and retailers are competing to deliver it.
Put another way, high-quality imagery, product names, and product descrip-
tions are no longer just for an exclusive few. They’re a business requirement.  
The days of one low-resolution image and product names like “SDLS STRWBRY 
JAM 4OZ” suitable only for inventory management systems are over.  
The problem with product names like these is that if a shopper searches for 
“strawberry jam,” your product won’t appear in the search results. The abbre-
viated product name has the effect of hiding your item from the digital shelf.
Your item may also be missing key attribute data needed to appear in relevant 
e-commerce search results. For example, if you’re selling a shirt and a user 
searches for “blue cotton dress shirt” but your item as stored at the retailer 
does not include the color or fabric type attributes, it may not show up in the 
search results. Systems like the Content Analytics Master Catalog not only 
store your items but also check to make sure that all your attribute data is 
complete—and then submit the complete data set to your retail partners.
No Systematized Approach
In both the largest and smallest suppliers, we find companies that have brand 
assets scattered all over. Sometimes this happens because suppliers haven’t 
had the need to submit more than one image and a product name during 
the item setup process. Other times, suppliers have been selling via only one 
retailer and haven’t had to deal with the challenges of delivering content to 
multiple retailers. Still other suppliers have content in multiple countries, with 
items stored one way in one location and another way somewhere else. But 
one of the biggest reasons of all is that until recently, product content didn’t 
matter as much as it does now. With e-commerce, content has taken on a 
whole new level of importance.
Some of the challenges with no systematized approach to content management 
and publication are that it’s hard to do the following:
• 
Find brand assets when you need them
• 
Know which brand assets are current and which ones are 
out of date

Chapter 5 | Activate Your Brand Content
78
• 
Keep track of what you’ve updated where and when
• 
Know which version of a spreadsheet contains the most 
up-to-date product content
• 
Execute changes quickly
• 
Maintain continuity across personnel changes
• 
Update content efficiently across multiple retailers
• 
Name images and videos properly for submission
• 
Ensure your content meets retailer requirements and 
won’t be rejected
Every client we work with on content management has benefited from having a 
centralized place to store and manage brand assets. Content updates are faster 
and easier, branding is more consistent, and companies save untold hours by 
not having to deal with the nuances (and pain) of image file naming and item 
maintenance templates. Many clients we work with have literally freed up weeks 
of employee time by using our platform to manage their product content.
Legacy and Custom Systems
Legacy systems are only marginally better than no systematized approach, and 
sometimes they’re worse. That’s because many legacy systems were designed 
without a core focus on e-commerce. For example, while working with one 
large CPG company, we found that the company was using IBM WebSphere, a 
relatively generic system used for storing data.
The following are the challenges the company faced:
• 
The system had not been updated in several years. It 
had gotten far out of sync with the company’s product 
information management and e-commerce needs. The 
company was afraid to make any changes to the system 
out of fear that it would break and no one would know 
how to repair it.
• 
The system had no support for easily adding new output 
templates and retailer-specific image file names. The 
company was stuck with two static templates that had 
been developed years earlier.
• 
The system could not upload content directly to major 
retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. As a result, 
the company’s employees and agency partner had to 
manually generate content maintenance forms and image 
file names and then perform time-consuming and error-
prone manual content uploads.

79
• 
The system had no support for bulk image, description, 
and title updates across multiple products.
• 
The system had no mechanism for generating URLs for 
images and videos to be used in submissions to retailers 
when required.
• 
The system lacked flexibility. The company’s content 
workflow had changed over the years, and the system 
could not adjust. As an example, the system lacked the 
ability to have an external agency create and update 
content and an internal company employee sign off on 
that content.
• 
The system could not be easily customized—expensive 
and time-consuming custom consulting work was 
required to make any enhancements.
• 
The system lacked a mechanism for detecting whether 
and when product content had gone live on a retailer’s 
web site and notifying the supplier whether content had 
not gone live.
• 
The system could not easily scale to support many 
different retailer sites.
Another company we work with was using a combination of a third-party 
media storage system that had first been developed over a decade earlier, 
spreadsheets, and e-mails to store and update their content. The challenges 
with this approach were as follows:
• 
The existing system lacked the ruleset and conversion 
capabilities to output images consistent with retailer-
specific naming conventions.
• 
The existing system lacked the e-commerce capabilities 
needed to store, manage, and publish complete product 
content, including product names and descriptions.
• 
The company ended up with images in one place, content 
in another, and a lot of manual labor to convert and deliver 
images, videos, and content to their retail partners.
In some cases, the supplier expected its retailers to retrieve content from a 
web-based publication location; in other cases, employees at the supplier had 
to become familiar with each retailer-specific portal and requirements and 
remember to upload the necessary content.

Chapter 5 | Activate Your Brand Content
80
The supplier’s existing systems had no automated cross-retailer brand auditing 
capability. So even after going to tremendous effort to get the very latest 
product content to its retail partners, the supplier’s team had to perform yet 
another manual process to audit each retailer—and then redeliver any missing 
content and repeat the cycle.
Working closely with this supplier and their existing systems, we automated 
much of the processes detailed earlier, with minimal effort on the part of the 
supplier. Via Content Analytics, the supplier now has an end-to-end system in 
place for updating and auditing brand content—complete with reports that 
tell the supplier which images and videos on each retailer are consistent with 
its master images and videos and which ones are missing or out of date. The 
supplier also has a centralized location for storing product content. Content 
Analytics acts as the system of record for product content, making multiple 
and confusing versions of spreadsheets unnecessary.
A third large CPG we work with had developed a custom internal system 
for storing brand content. Although well-intentioned, it suffered from many 
similar issues to the solution described earlier.
• 
Expensive to maintain.
• 
Slow development cycles. The company had invested 
about three years in building the system but during that 
time had implemented only about half of the promised 
capabilities.
• 
Designed to support only one output format (GS1 XML), 
lacking the flexibility to support many different formats.
• 
No direct connection to retailer systems, so content 
updates could be done only through a cumbersome 
exchange of e-mails to buyers. Attachments often got 
lost in the process or updates that were supposed to go 
through quickly took months to happen.
• 
Unable to keep pace with market changes. During the 
time the company was developing the system, the market 
continued to evolve, with new retailers such as Jet coming 
online and existing retailers adding new capabilities. As an 
example, Walmart added new capabilities including direct 
API integration with native rich media support (meaning 
that rich media such as videos can be added to Walmart.
com pages without the use of rich media providers such 
as Webcollage or SellPoints).

Product Information Management Done Right
There is another way. Imagine a cloud-based, lightweight, easy-to-implement 
PIM system. It can pull brand content from the Web, existing internal systems, 
or traditional content storage vendors. It can export in multiple formats. It can 
store multiple kinds of brand assets, including product descriptions, images, 
videos, PDFs, and comprehensive attribute data. And it supports built-in 
workflow mechanisms so you can route items for editing, review, approval, 
and submission. Finally, content can be easily accessible (if desired) to your 
partners (such as the long tail of specialty independent retailers) if you want 
them to be able to retrieve the latest brand content from you.
Let’s first imagine that you just need to get a few items updated on one of 
your retail partners. That is the starting point for many of our bricks-to-clicks 
clients. Either we’ve identified, via a content health audit, some opportunities 
for improvement in their items or they’ve identified an internal need to update 
some content. These are possible reasons for needing to update content:
• 
Product naming: Your marketing team has updated product 
naming conventions after items have already gone live, 
and you want to get those changes live on the Web. Some 
reasons for changing product naming conventions are 
to improve consistency across product lines, to reduce 
customer confusion around a new technology, and to 
align the names of products that were acquired from 
another company with the acquirer’s branding standards.
• 
Packaging update: The UPC of an item hasn’t changed, but 
the packaging has. With old imagery on the retailer’s site, 
the shopper will order the item and then get an item 
delivered that looks different. Even though it’s in fact the 
right product, there’s a good chance they’ll return the 
item because the product they received looks different 
than the product they ordered.
• 
Compliance/legal: An item has incorrect wording that needs  
to be corrected (like the word organic when a product is 
not actually organic).
• 
Marketing optimization: The content on the retailer site 
is the same content as everywhere else and the supplier 
wants to have different content on different retail 
channels. On the surface, this seems to fly in the face of 
brand consistency. But for some suppliers it makes a lot 
of sense. Search engines such as Google penalize sites 
for having duplicate content and reward them for having 
unique content. But what’s the win for the supplier?

Chapter 5 | Activate Your Brand Content
82
Suppose that a supplier has a few major competitors who 
sell fairly similar products in a market—batteries, sham-
poo, diapers, televisions, and mobile phone accessories are 
all good examples. If the supplier sends the same content 
to Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, Jet.com, and 
other sites, only one of those sites is going to rank high 
in the Google search results for an item. The rest of the 
search results are going to be taken by competitors selling 
similar products (but with different content).
But if the supplier provides unique content for an item to 
each of those retail channels, the search engines will reward 
them for it, with a strong likelihood of ranking some or all 
of those items high in the search results. The supplier will 
effectively be able to shut out the competitor from the 
page 1 search results for a given item. Ultimately, perhaps 
the supplier doesn’t care on which web site a shopper 
makes the sale, but the supplier does care that the shopper 
bought their brand and not the competition. That’s why it’s 
so important to be able to manage content—and multiple 
versions of content for the same item.
• 
Content testing: The most advanced bricks-to-clicks sup-
pliers do a sort of A/B testing on their content even if the 
retailer’s web site or API doesn’t directly support it. For 
example, the Content Analytics system supports loading 
multiple primary images for a given item, and it will auto-
matically rotate through those images over a given time 
period. The supplier can evaluate which content is corre-
lated with the item performing better.
• 
Content improvement: A lot of bricks-to-clicks retailers talk 
about improving the top of the funnel. They’re referring 
to the quality of content that is ingested into their 
e-commerce site at the time an item is originally set up. 
If only they could get a full set of high-quality images and 
product descriptions up front.
This is an excellent idea. But what happens in practice, 
when suppliers are submitting items for item setup, is that 
those suppliers have only one priority—getting the items 
into the item setup pipeline as quickly as possible. The 
sooner they get the items into the item setup workflow, 
the sooner the items are going to be live on the retailer’s 
site. However, high-quality content is often not available at 

Bricks to Clicks
83
the time that item setup forms get submitted. In fact, items 
may be sent to the retailer for item setup and in parallel 
sent off to an agency or the retailer’s own internal studio  
for content creation. This means that the high-quality 
content has to be added to the item later in the process.
Regardless of a supplier’s reason for needing to update 
content, often the easiest starting point is the supplier’s 
existing content. We’ve had merchants at retailers tell us 
they’ve asked suppliers for updated content only to have 
those suppliers go off and spend months trying to track 
down the content, with little to no success.
Our approach is to make it easy to import existing content, whether that 
content is located in the supplier’s existing internal systems, on the supplier’s 
product pages on the retailer’s web site, or on the supplier’s own corporate 
web site. Once we import the content, it’s easy for a supplier to make 
changes, which we can then quickly submit to the retailer. Our starting point 
is almost always product content—because content is what the shopper sees 
and what can have the most immediate impact on product discovery and 
conversion rates.
If you wait six to nine months or longer to get a complex PIM system in 
place, you’ll miss several key shopping periods and quite possibly the holiday 
shopping season as well. Therefore, it makes the most sense to start with a 
PIM solution that can be up and running in just a few days.
Summary
For suppliers, after their people, their brand is their next most valuable asset. 
Apple. Nike. Pepsi. These are all iconic consumer brands that consumers 
have grown to recognize and trust over the years. If these companies don’t 
centralize the storage and management of their content and ensure brand 
integrity across all their digital channels, they risk diluting the hard-won value 
of their brand.
While in-store will continue to make up the larger part of their overall sales 
for a few more years, bricks-to-clicks suppliers recognize that online is where 
they have the greatest ability to tell their brand story. It’s also where shoppers 
are going to do their product research and have their first encounter with 
a brand’s products. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers have chosen to invest heavily 
in people and systems that enable them to be leaders in digital, rather than 
playing catchup when it’s too late.

brand ontent management and updates. We’ll examine how by integrating your

“Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have faith in people, 
that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do 
wonderful things with them.”
—Steve Jobs
Fast-forward six months. I was sitting with that same senior vice president 
and his director of content management in the company’s new New York City 
office. They’re now a customer, and we’re working together to implement a 
centralized content storage and publication system for the company’s brand 
assets worldwide, both in-store and online. That means ingesting content 
from multiple data feeds and operating across dozens, potentially hundreds, 
of retailers.
There’s nothing quite like having a big supplier to work with. It’s beneficial to us 
as a startup on so many levels. First, we get to understand a major customer’s 
needs on a global basis. Second, when we go talk with retailers, it’s not just us 
going to talk to them; our customers are often opening up the conversation 
or bringing us to the table.
It’s one thing when we get a meeting with a retailer and say, “You should really 
do this. It will help your business a lot.” It’s another thing when one of our big 
supplier customers, who does 20 or 30 percent of their business through that 
one retailer, contacts the retailer and says, “This is the partner we’ve picked 
to work with on content efforts. Please talk to them.”

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
86
The relationship is beneficial to our supplier customers as well. Instead of 
them having to hire a ton of people to work through the details of content 
delivery and updating at every retailer, we do that for them. Because we’re 
working with multiple large suppliers, we bring a lot of leverage when it comes 
to working with retailers. When we figure out a new process or connect with 
a system at a retailer for one supplier, the same solution immediately works 
for all our other clients.
Also, our customers get the benefit of having features they want in a digital asset 
management solution implemented right away. When the director of content 
management told me that day in New York City about a few features—such 
as automated image conversion—that would make his day-to-day job easier, it 
didn’t take months of planning. I got back to the office, talked to our product 
management team, and the features went live in a matter of weeks.
Although digital asset management and product information management sys-
tems and various retailer networks like GDSN have been around for years, 
e-commerce requires a much faster pace of innovation and a set of features 
that are specific to the needs of today’s bricks-to-clicks suppliers. That is 
exactly what our Master Catalog delivers.
The Master Catalog
The main Master Catalog hosts your items. You can toggle among various 
views that are more image-based and more list-based. The search box in the 
upper right lets you quickly find a specific item using a UPC, retailer-specific 
ID, product name, or other identifying information. You can also search for 
multiple IDs to filter to a subset of items.

Bricks to Clicks
87
Each item has associated with it the product name, ID, product description 
data, images, videos, and other content, if applicable.
The Tension: Brand Integrity vs. Content 
Uniqueness
There are two different, sometimes competing, strategies for managing con-
tent in e-commerce. For bricks suppliers, brand integrity is job 1. They want 
the same images, the same brand messaging, and the same content every-
where. They want a shopper to see the same thing on Amazon that they see 
on Walmart and everywhere else.
But there’s an issue with that approach. Retailers don’t want the same product 
content that’s available everywhere else. That’s because when it comes to 
showing up in search engines such as Google, content uniqueness matters a 
lot. Whoever gets content published and indexed in the search engines first 
becomes the authority for that content. If Google later discovers the same 
content on another site, not only does it not consider that site an authority, 
but it penalizes that site for having duplicate content. Brands face a natural 
tension in working with their retail partners: whether to deliver the same 
content to all of them or to customize content for each of them.
Figure 6-1. The Master Catalog interface

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
88
The good news is that the way our Master Catalog is designed, we support 
both approaches. The Master Data tab allows a brand to store all their master 
content. The individual retailer tabs allow a brand to use the same content 
as from their Master Data tab or customize the content for a specific retailer.
We recommend that bricks-to-clicks retailers use the same imagery wher-
ever possible across their brands (easy visual recognition for the shopper) 
but provide unique product descriptions for their key items, at least for their 
highest-volume retail partners.
Our Approach
In the fall of 2015, a merchant from Walmart.com had me come in to pres-
ent at a supplier summit. A supplier summit is exactly what you’d expect—a 
roomful of suppliers looking to learn as much as they possibly can about 
selling more effectively on Walmart.com. During the summit, I showed our 
Content Health reports and immediately got interest from a number of sup-
pliers in the room looking to get Content Health reports for their own items.
We met with each supplier in turn. Every one of them was excited to receive 
their report. But they all asked virtually the same question: how can we update 
our items?
Historically, they had updated their items in one of two ways. Either they 
would send an Excel spreadsheet with their content changes to their buyer 
(who would receive hundreds if not thousands of such forms over the course 
of a month) or they would work with Kwikee or ARS, two companies that 
had been working with Walmart for years to try to get their content updated.
The challenge was, these companies had been set up primarily as agencies 
(services companies), and as Walmart’s assortment expanded, their turn-
around time for updating content got slower. We had suppliers tell us that 
it often took as much as six to eight weeks to get their content updated. 
Important selling events like holidays would come and go and the content for 
these suppliers would still be incorrect.
Fortunately, we had a solution. Because we had been reporting content health 
scores internally, we had also developed a way to manage and deliver updated 
content to Walmart’s systems from Walmart’s internal teams. Almost over-
night we expanded this capability to suppliers. Instead of taking weeks or 
months to go live, supplier content was going live in a matter of minutes. They 
were overjoyed.
It helped that we already had their content loaded in our system. To generate 
their content health audits, we were crawling and analyzing their items on the 
retailer’s web site. They didn’t have to track down all their content internally.

They didn’t need to get us access to internal feeds. And we didn’t need to 
spend months integrating with their internal systems.
Suppliers could immediately come in and make edits and add more images, 
which we then pushed to the site. And by making the edits through us, we had 
a history of what changes they’d made and when. We could even correlate 
their updates with improvements in sales.
That same design principle—make it easy to get up and running and update 
content fast—has remained core to our approach as we’ve continued to evolve 
and expand our Master Catalog. We also never believed we could come in and 
“rip and replace” existing solutions that our suppliers have already invested in. 
Our approach has always been to coexist with these solutions until our clients 
are ready to make the switch.
Smaller suppliers often ask us if they can benefit from the Master Catalog as 
well. Or should they try to update content through a supplier-specific por-
tal? The short answer is yes, you should store your content in a centralized 
repository, whether that’s our Master Catalog or another system. These are 
a few of the reasons to use the Master Catalog:
• 
Easy access to history of what content was updated  
and when
• 
Audit log of who made the content changes
• 
Automatic checking for correct image resolutions
• 
Alerts when content for your items changes on a retail-
er’s web site
• 
Easy identification of products that haven’t been optimized
• 
Ease of use when updating content across multiple 
retailers
• 
Automatic image conversion
• 
Automatic conversion between desktop and mobile 
video formats
A centralized place to store and find imagery and videos also means that sup-
pliers can do the following:
• 
Easily access content for advertising and marketing 
campaigns
• 
Ensure brand integrity by using the same image and video 
assets everywhere
Of course, there are many more capabilities, but those are some of the ones 
our clients cite most frequently.

Supplier Engagement
Retailers often ask us if we get engagement from suppliers in updating their 
content. They’re skeptical that suppliers will improve their content or want to 
add more images or change the descriptions.
It turns out that once you give suppliers a little bit of direct control over 
their brand image and the way their items are represented on a site, they will 
engage, and many of them quite actively. We’ve had suppliers upload thou-
sands of images every week so they could test different images. If for any 
reason a content update doesn’t go live, suppliers will call and e-mail us until 
we make sure that the update does go live. So to all those skeptical retailers 
out there, I recommend empowering your suppliers. Many of them will engage 
actively in helping to improve their item content.
Editing Existing Items
One major benefit of the Content Analytics Master Catalog is that it’s easy to 
get started. There’s no software to install because the system is hosted in the 
cloud. We can load content from virtually any source. And we can even edit 
content that already exists on a retailer you sell on.
For example, if you sell a lot of items on Walmart.com, we can crawl your 
items on Walmart.com. We can then analyze those items and generate a 
content health score, including identifying specific actions you should take to 
improve each item. We import the product content (including product name, 
description, and imagery) into the Master Catalog. You can click the item and 
make edits directly to it. Once you’re ready, we submit the updated content to 
the retailer (or output the retailer-specific content template).
We then check the retailer site on a regular basis to identify content that 
has not gone live or instances where the retailer has chosen to use different 
descriptions or imagery than those that the supplier provided.
Figure 6-2. The content crawling, editing, and reporting process
What’s also compelling about this approach is that we can crawl a manufac-
turer’s own brand site to import their content. From there, it’s just a question 

Bricks to Clicks
91
of us crawling that content and submitting it to their retail partners in the 
necessary formats.
Content Feeds
The other way to load content into the Master Catalog is via content feeds. 
Content feeds can be virtually any kind of data source such as XML, XLSX, or 
CSV files. The Master Catalog also supports application programming inter-
faces (APIs). These can be used to fetch content from external systems or for 
external systems to connect directly into the Master Catalog—either to push 
content to the system or to retrieve content from it.
By design, this approach makes it easy to interface with legacy content man-
agement systems (CMSs) such as SAP Hybris and IBM WebSphere. For those 
companies with homegrown CMSs, we can easily build converters to import 
content from virtually any feed type that those systems already output.
Many clients we work with are looking to switch off these legacy systems. But 
making the switch is not an overnight process. In this case, we first import 
data from their existing system. As an example, one large consumer packaged 
goods (CPG) company we work with has created its own internal e-commerce 
content library. As it turned out, they were already doing regularly scheduled 
exports of their content to various other systems they interface with. All they 
needed to do to send us their content was to replicate one of their existing 
feeds and send it to us Bottom line—no matter where your content resides, 
we can typically import it into the Master Catalog in a matter of a few days, 
either as a one-time import or as an ongoing daily or weekly import.
Content Upload
Finally, end users can easily bulk import text, image, and video content right 
from the Master Catalog user interface. Simply select the template type that 
is being imported, drag and drop the file or select it from the local file system, 
and the system will quickly import the text content for the associated items.
The bulk image import works in much the same way. Users can drag and drop 
a zip file containing images onto the pop-up and the system will automatically 
associate those images with the correct products. Suppliers often have images 
already named in the required Amazon, Walmart, or Jet naming format. The 
system will use the UPC or ASIN embedded in the image file names to associ-
ate the images with the corresponding items. In addition, it will automatically 
notify you about any images that do not meet the specified retailer’s minimum 
image requirements. That prevents you from wasting time submitting incor-
rectly sized images to a retailer and waiting for their approval process, only to 
have the images later rejected.

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
92
List Management
To figure out which items are yours, either we can crawl a web site looking 
for items that belong to your brand (or brands) or you can provide us with a 
specific list or lists of items. Lists can come in the form of URLs, UPCs, ASINs 
for Amazon, TCINs for Target, tool IDs for Walmart, or an ID that is specific 
to another retailer site. To avoid any confusion, the best option is to create a 
list using URLs.
We can also populate the Master Catalog item lists from internal feeds or 
content exports. One major electronics retailer we work with provides us 
with a regular export of their internal “road map” list of items. Our system 
parses their list and populates the Content Health reports, Dashboard, and 
Master Catalog with their most up-to-date lists. The great thing about this 
approach is that the list management becomes automated; there’s no need for 
the supplier to manually update lists.
Another way of managing Master Catalog lists is by having us populate the 
Master Catalog from a retailer item list export. In the Walmart ecosystem, 
for example, suppliers can export a list of items from Retail Link. Our system 
natively supports import and list creation based on Retail Link exports.
The leading bricks-to-clicks suppliers often start out with the crawl plus edit 
approach. Later they move to the feed-based approach where we’re receiving 
item lists and content from them. Then ultimately, they maintain their retailer-
specific item lists and content directly in our system.
Modifying an Item
It’s easy to update items one at a time or in bulk.
Edit Content
To edit an item, you simply click that item. A pop-up appears (Figure 6-3) that 
enables you to change the text content, update it, or add images and videos. 
You can even put in the URL of a video, and the system will automatically 
retrieve that video and store it in the catalog.

Bricks to Clicks
93
Manage Media
In the pop-up, on the Manage Media tab, it’s easy to view existing images and vid-
eos associated with your item. You can upload media from your computer, from 
web sites (by pasting in URLs), or through the Add From Library functionality. 
Often, a supplier will want to add the same image (such as a logo or other com-
mon image) to a large number of items. The Library stores those commonly used 
images for easy access. The system will automatically check uploaded images and 
videos to make sure they meet the minimum requirements for delivery to the 
retailer.
Attributes
The Attributes tab is used to edit detailed attribute data for a given item. The 
system supports attribute definitions for multiple retailers as well as mappings 
between retailers. So while not every field is the same, we can often translate 
mappings from one retailer to another using our existing mapping support. 
Attributes include information such as whether there’s a warranty, what gender 
an item is for (often used in apparel), what age range an item is for (often used 
in toys), and so on. The attributes change based on the category you select.
Figure 6-3. The Edit Content pop-up

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
94
If we’re creating the items in your catalog based on crawling one of the retailers 
you sell on, we can often figure out the category and some of the attributes 
based on the crawled data so you don’t have to start from scratch. Alternatively, 
we can import attributes from an Excel spreadsheet or from a data feed you 
provide, so you don’t need to configure attributes manually for each item. 
Moreover, for content updates only (versus new-item setup), typically very few 
attributes are required—often just the brand name. Many other attributes tend 
to be optional.
Compare with Live
Suppliers often want to know how the content in the Master Catalog com-
pares with what’s live on the retailer web site. The Compare with Live tab 
shows you the content that’s on the retailer’s web site side by side with the 
content for the same item in the Master Catalog. Built-in image matching 
identifies whether the images are the same or different in both places and 
whether there are any differences in the description text or title for an item. 
Simply look for the green check boxes, which indicate that content is matched 
or red Xs, which indicates that it isn’t. The overall Master Catalog supports a 
summary view of this information, which we’ll talk about in a little bit.
SmartLabel Support
The content edit pop-up also supports a SmartLabel tab, which is useful for 
grocery items. SmartLabel is a Grocery Association Industry initiative. It’s an 
online nutrition label that provides comprehensive nutrition information to 
consumers. The Content Analytics SmartLabel solution is directly integrated 
with the Master Catalog, so it pulls in existing attribute and other data if that 
information is already in the Master Catalog. Suppliers have to add only a 
small amount of supplemental information to complete the label information 
for each product.
SmartLabel is a fully hosted solution; once the data is in the Master Catalog, 
the consumer-friendly pages are automatically available on the Web. Suppliers 
don’t need to worry about a complex implementation process, coding HTML 
pages, or converting nutrition label images into data—the Content Analytics 
SmartLabel solution handles all of that automatically.
Options
You can easily go from one item to the next using the left and right arrows. 
By clicking the Options button, you can gain access to a variety of data export 
capabilities, allowing you to export the content for a specific item in CSV or 
XML format for text and a variety of image and video formats for media. If 

Bricks to Clicks
95
there are multiple images, they’ll be downloaded in a zip file, and the images 
will automatically be named according to the retailer’s naming convention if 
there is one.
Image Conversion and Resizing
The Master Catalog supports built-in image conversion from one format to 
another. That means if you upload images in, say, JPEG format, you can down-
load them in PNG or TIF format, and vice versa. The Master Catalog also 
supports image resizing and cropping. There’s no need for external image 
processing tools or complex converters.
Video Support
The Master Catalog makes it easy to fetch videos from the Web or your 
local computer, store those videos, and publish them to retailers. To fetch 
a YouTube video, for example, just paste in the URL of a YouTube video and 
the Master Catalog will fetch it. Then you can easily publish it to retailers like 
Walmart.com.
The Master Catalog can also automatically generate mobile videos from 
desktop videos. Most sites that support videos on their item pages prefer 
that you submit both video formats. That’s because desktop videos, which 
are large, high-resolution video files, take a while to play and suffer from 
starts and stops when played over mobile networks. Videos that have been 
specially optimized for mobile devices load faster and play smoothly. With the 
Master Catalog, you don’t have to generate these mobile videos yourself—
the Master Catalog will do that automatically for you.
Content Health
Content health reporting is built directly into the Master Catalog. That makes 
it easy to know where to focus your content improvement efforts.
Every item receives a content health score. You can easily see what you need 
to do to improve an item. When you edit and save an item, the content health 
conditions for an item and the item’s score are immediately recalculated. You 
can also sort the items in the Master Catalog by highest or lowest score—say, 
for example, if you want to work on items with the lowest content health 
score first.
You can easily filter the Master Catalog display by the conditions affecting your 
item, as shown in Figure 6-9. This comes in handy in several cases. If you have 
an imagery team that works on images and a copyediting team that works on 

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
96
product descriptions, they can filter the items by their area of focus and work 
on just the relevant items. Alternatively, if you have, for example, a big push to 
improve image counts, you can filter to just those items with low image counts.
Content Syndication
Perhaps one of the most powerful features of the Master Catalog is its inte-
grated content syndication capabilities. Right from the Master Catalog you 
can publish content to Walmart, Amazon, Target, and other retailers. The 
Master Catalog supports API integrations, portal integrations, and retailer-
specific template exports.
What’s the difference between the three types of retailer syndication support?
• 
API integration: We connect directly to a retailer’s com-
puter-to-computer interface to deliver content to the 
retailer.
• 
Portal integration: We log in to the retailer’s portal and 
upload imagery and content directly to the portal.
• 
Automated content template publishing: Some retail-
ers don’t yet have APIs or web portals yet still want to 
receive updated content from suppliers. For these retail-
ers, we automatically output your content from the 
Master Catalog in the XLSX or CSV file template format 
required by that retailer. We then e-mail the fully popu-
lated template to the appropriate contact or e-mail alias 
at the retailer (or you can do so).
API integrations are optimal because they’re a direct interface between our 
system and the retailer. For example, we were one of the first providers to 
support the Walmart.com Content API. In many cases, content submitted 
through the API is published live on Walmart.com in a matter of seconds. 
The other approaches described still get the job done effectively, but in those 
cases the turnaround time on the retailer’s end to get content live tends to 
be slower. Amazon.com typically takes a couple of days to process content 
submissions, for example.
Regardless of how we deliver content to a retailer, you gain the following ben-
efits from using the Master Catalog to publish your content:
• 
No need to learn individual retailer system
• 
Automatic output of content with the correct file format, 
file naming, and content templates
• 
Easy to push content updates to many retailers at once

Edit History
In addition to the benefits described earlier, the Master Catalog provides you 
with a complete audit log of content changes and submissions. The system 
records when edits were made, which edits were made, and by whom. This 
information is available on the Edit History tab.
There are several reasons it’s important to track changes. First, if you’re edit-
ing many products, it’s easy to lose track of which products you’ve updated 
and submitted to which retailers. If you’re running a campaign, you want to 
make sure content updates are done in time. Second, in the event an incor-
rect edit is made, it’s helpful to be able to go back and understand who made 
the edit and when—and if any other products had incorrect edits around the 
same time.
Mobile Catalog
We designed the mobile catalog (Figure 6-4) to provide an on-the-go view of the 
items in your Master Catalog. It’s useful in all sorts of scenarios—such as when 
your salespeople meet with buyers or when your marketing and agency people 
are browsing through imagery and videos to use for an upcoming campaign.
Figure 6-4.  Mobile catalog

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
98
The mobile catalog also provides the basis for the read-only, partner-acces-
sible view of the Master Catalog. For example, if you want to make all your 
imagery, videos, and product descriptions available to your suppliers and other 
partners to download, you can simply toggle a switch in the Master Catalog 
and your products are available on the Web.
That makes it easy for long-tail retailers to access the same high-quality imag-
ery and video content you provide to larger retailers like Amazon, Walmart, 
and Target. So if you don’t have the time or bandwidth to deliver content 
to the hundreds or thousands of retailers that carry your products, you can 
make it easy for them to download that content from you instead.
Brand Audit
Suppliers often want to understand brand integrity across their entire prod-
uct line and across multiple sites. They have questions like these: Are different 
retailers using different primary images, outdated images, or low-resolution 
images? What about the rest of an item’s media—are there multiple images? 
Are they up to date? Are there videos on sites that support that media type?
These are all questions that could be answered through extensive manual 
work. The brand audit automates the process of collecting all this information, 
performing the necessary comparisons, and generating the results.
The brand audit and Compare with Live view both support sophisticated 
image-matching capabilities. For example, you can configure whether you 
want images that are the same other than their dimensions to be considered 
matched. Often we receive very high-resolution images from suppliers (say 
3000x3000 pixels), but the retailer sites display those images at 2000x2000 
or a lower resolution. If we were to only consider the images matched if the 
image dimensions were the same, a lot of images that are matched (other 
than resolution) would be considered unmatched. That’s why we built in the 
capability to consider images matched even if the retailer’s version of an image 
has been resized. Of course, it’s easy to turn this capability off if you want only 
exact matches to be considered.
Some clients have taken the brand audit a step further, with a heavy focus on 
brand media integrity. One leading apparel maker challenged us to build a cus-
tom version of the brand audit that could detect front, back, and side images 
and size/scale charts and determine whether videos on retailer sites matched 
those the company had developed. The company was concerned that retail-
ers were using out-of-date imagery and videos on their web sites—and they 
were right.

Bricks to Clicks
99
We identified a number of cases of out-of-date imagery, missing size/scale 
charts, and incorrect videos. The apparel maker had previously been perform-
ing these painstaking audits manually, consuming untold numbers of hours that 
could otherwise have been invested in brand development or sales. Unlike the 
manual approach, which took weeks to execute, our programmatic approach 
is fully automated. That means we can run a full brand audit on multiple 
retailer sites across the entire product assortment every quarter (or more 
often, if requested).
Google Manufacturer Center
As of 2016, some 55 percent of online shoppers now start their product 
searches on Amazon.com, a 25 percent increase from 2015 when only 44 
percent of shoppers started their searches on Amazon. At the same time, the 
number of shoppers who started their product searches on Google dropped 
from 34 percent to 28 percent.1 As a result, Google is eager to improve its 
product search experience since it makes money from the ads that appear 
next to online product search results.
To support a great product search experience, Google created Google 
Manufacturer Center (GMC). It’s a free tool that lets manufacturers upload 
product content so their products appear in the most compelling way pos-
sible in Google search results. As with most online tools, however, there’s a 
catch. To send product content to Google, manufacturers need to output 
their product catalogs in the format that Google requires.
Our Master Catalog has built-in GMC support. GMC requires product con-
tent be delivered in the form of TSV or XML files. These files must contain 
properly formatted product IDs, URLs to your product imagery, and your 
product content. We’ve included a subset of a sample XML file here so you 
can see what it looks like:

Of course, you wouldn’t want to generate this kind of file manually. Master 
Catalog generates these types of XML files automatically and then connects 
directly to Google’s API to publish your product content. As a result, you can 
ensure you have great product content not just on Amazon, Walmart, and 
other major retailer web sites, but on Google as well.
Content Futures
As more shoppers begin their shopping journeys online, high-quality product 
content is becoming ever more important. The content that showcases your 
product online in many cases is the only way that potential buyers of your 
products will interact with your products before they make a purchase deci-
sion. So, where is content headed over the next few years?
For many years, retailers relied on content syndication networks such as 
Webcollage and Sellpoints. These third-party providers supplied web page 
plug-ins to retailers that allowed them to display videos, PDFs, and other 
rich content to shoppers. But recently we have noticed a shift away from this 
approach to a native content approach. Retailers and suppliers cite several 
reasons for this change in approach.

Bricks to Clicks
101
Core content, that is, content that is shown “above the fold” on an item page, 
has received a much higher focus in recent years. There’s little point in deliv-
ering rich content that appears below the fold if a product is missing imagery, 
has low-resolution images, or has a poor product description above the fold. 
These legacy third-party providers don’t store and update core content.
Embedded content served up by plug-ins does not help with search engine 
optimization. Because the content from these third parties is served up by 
special proprietary viewers, that content is not indexed by the search engines.
Retailers want to deliver a differentiated experience. The third-party provid-
ers syndicate the same content to every retailer they work with. As a result, 
retailers that work with them get the same content their competitors are 
getting.
Today’s retailers want unique content (for search engine optimization), and 
they want to establish themselves as content authorities in their space. It’s 
hard to do that when you’re using the same content everyone else is. To that 
end, Amazon uses its own rich media content called A+ content. Walmart 
now natively supports videos and other rich media directly through its con-
tent API. Other retailers are likely to follow suit.
Long term, retailers will develop or buy algorithmic systems that combine 
content from different sources in an attempt to deliver the best content for 
each item. They will invest in A/B testing to see which page variations, product 
descriptions, and product imagery result in the highest conversion rates.
The challenge, of course, is that best is a subjective measure. Suppliers may 
feel that one visual and textual representation of their product is the best 
for their brand and for shoppers, while retailer testing may indicate that a 
different representation is better. Regardless, nimble bricks-to-clicks retail-
ers (and their pure-play e-commerce counterparts) are going to experiment, 
employing software algorithms in an attempt to deliver the best (and highest-
converting) shopping experience possible. Although e-commerce is in many 
ways different than in-store retail, the two have at least one thing in com-
mon—every point of margin counts.
Summary
Content management has evolved rapidly for us as a line of business. We’re 
fortunate to have some of the world’s largest brands as our customers—and 
to be able to bring the capabilities they’ve encouraged us to implement not 
just to them but to the many small and midsize suppliers we work with as well.
The Master Catalog provides an effective way to store, manage, publish, and 
audit your content across multiple retailers and is specifically designed to 
meet the needs of e-commerce. Yet as suppliers see how easy it is to use 

Chapter 6 | Using the Master Catalog
102
for e-commerce, they are expanding their use of it to store all their digital 
media assets for both online and offline use. This highlights one thing that 
is common across many of our bricks-to-clicks clients: they frequently use 
e-commerce as a driver of innovation within their companies. Although many 
of their in-store businesses are still far larger than their online businesses, 
they see e-commerce as highly disruptive to the way they’ve done business in 
decades past. The bricks-to-clicks suppliers are leveraging that disruption to 
reimagine how they manage, audit, and optimize their brand experiences not 
just online but offline as well.
Although there are many approaches to content management for e-commerce, 
the Master Catalog is the platform that leading brands have standardized on. 
From ingesting brand content to storing it and then delivering that content to 
a multitude of different channels, the Master Catalog makes it easy for bricks-
to-clicks suppliers to deliver a best-in-class brand experience.

The Retailer 
Challenge (and 
Opportunity)
“The challenge of the retail business is the human condition. We’re only 
as good as the moment, that fragile moment when we please or hopefully 
don’t disappoint the customer.”
—Howard Schultz
Partnering to Win in E-commerce
Over the past few years in e-commerce, we’ve helped develop e-commerce 
strategies not just for the world’s largest brands but also for the world’s larg-
est retailers. Some retailers we read about every day in the news—but not 
for the reasons we’d like. They’re closing store after store, taking hundreds of 
millions if not billions of dollars of writedowns in the process. These retailers 
have been too slow to recognize and respond to rapidly changing shopper 
behavior.
These shoppers are highly mobile, big on convenience, and heavily influenced 
by what they read online. They’re distrusting of paid advertising and quick 
to shop around if they think they can find a cheaper price elsewhere. It’s not

Chapter 7 | The Retailer Challenge (and Opportunity)
104
that they’re not loyal—they’re simply looking for the best value for the best 
product, and they’re armed with a lot more information than shoppers of the 
past. They’re in control of the buying process like no consumer has ever been 
before.
The millennial consumer is truly the “me” generation. Millennials have prod-
ucts delivered to them instead of them going to pick up the products. To go 
somewhere, millennials summon an Uber when they want one—and pretty 
soon that Uber will be a self-driving car. Millennials expect to be able to buy 
products and return them if they don’t fit, don’t meet their needs, or aren’t 
as advertised, no questions asked. Millennials expect everything to be mobile 
ready. In fact, some 70 percent of purchases today start on a mobile device.
And yet there is a way to work with this consumer—by becoming the consumer’s 
best and most trusted source of information. Information is important not only 
for today’s consumer but also for the search engines and search algorithms by 
which many of today’s products live and die. With this context in mind, we turn 
to what you can do to balance things out, while putting yourself in an even better 
position to serve the demanding millennial consumer.
The biggest difference we see between bricks retailers and their bricks-to-
clicks counterparts is the extent to which bricks-to-clicks retailers have 
empowered their suppliers. By modernizing supplier portals, making it easier 
to set up new items and update item content, and giving suppliers more con-
trol over the shipping and selling process, the bricks-to-clicks retailers have 
truly partnered with their suppliers to enable a better customer experience.
Supplier Portals
When it came to product content management and syndication, we originally 
worked with large numbers of suppliers to help them update their content 
on Walmart.com. Helping Walmart suppliers update their product content 
was a natural extension of the reporting we were providing them. Almost 
without fail, when we would tell a supplier on a call where their opportunities 
for improvement were, they would ask us for help in updating their content.
Before working with us, some suppliers were experiencing delays of two to 
four months when trying to update their product content. With our system, 
suppliers have been able to update their content in a matter of seconds.
At the same time, suppliers were asking us for help updating their content 
across multiple retailers. The differences in image formats, content require-
ments, and update templates made multiretailer content updates an incredibly 
slow and painful process.
As we continued to build out support for more and more retailers, how-
ever, we noticed that these retailers lacked modern supplier portals. Many 
of them relied on Excel spreadsheets attached to e-mails from suppliers to 

Bricks to Clicks

­buyers, some required images to be uploaded to legacy FTP servers, and oth-
ers received XML feeds from various content sources but the content that 
came with these feeds had to be manually copied over from one system to 
another. This resulted in extremely slow update times and occasionally lost 
imagery and content. One retailer even required suppliers to provide physical 
CDs with images on them to make image updates.
The reality is that many of the systems retailers run on were not built with the 
idea that there would be numerous and frequent updates to products once 
they were set up.
■
■Note  Many of the systems retailers run on were not built with the idea that there would be 
frequent updates to product content. A great supplier portal coexists with these existing systems to 
make it easy for retailers to receive high-quality content on a regular basis from their supplier base.
In a bricks-only world, items went through an item setup process, appeared 
on the store shelf, and got marked down until they were sold. The idea that 
these items would have a virtual presence and that a supplier could change 
the branding for an item “in flight” was completely foreign to these legacy sys-
tems. What’s more, these systems were not designed for speed. When these 
systems were implemented, companies ran on annual planning cycles and pre-
pared their items for market many quarters if not years ahead. Competitors 
operating via drop-ship models where new products come and go all the time 
did not yet exist.
The bricks-to-clicks retailers are putting modern supplier portals in place. 
They recognize how important it is to help their suppliers operate quickly and 
be partners in delivering up-to-date and compelling content online.
The retailer version of our Master Catalog and content health reporting  
system—built to handle hundreds of millions of items—helps retailers who want  
to accelerate their transition from bricks to clicks. The solution is a fully hosted, 
cloud-based supplier portal for web-based item setup, ongoing item mainte-
nance, and content updates. Think of it as Amazon Vendor Central in a box. 
It makes it easy for suppliers to deliver updated imagery and content to the 
retailer with no change needed on the retailer’s part to their existing systems.
From Actionable Data to Organizational Action
One of the biggest opportunities we’ve encountered in helping bricks-to-
clicks retailers is finding innovative ways to make large quantities of data 
actionable. Buried in the data are dozens if not hundreds of opportunities for 
improvement. The challenge is unlocking those opportunities in an action-
able manner.

Chapter 7 | The Retailer Challenge (and Opportunity)
106
One director we work with at a large retailer had joined the retailer from a 
large technology company. There he had to mobilize the organization to drive 
improvement in the company’s online performance. This challenge was not 
unlike the one we faced at the retailer in getting the organization to focus on 
and improve the health of its online content. Product pages needed to have 
multiple high-quality images, high-quality product descriptions, and mobile-
friendly titles. The organization had to do this at scale across tens of millions 
of items.
The director shared two key insights with us. First, we had to present the data 
in a compelling, actionable manner. Second, it wasn’t enough to make the data 
actionable. We had to get the organization to take action on the data.
The first thing the director had us do was take all our content health report-
ing data for every single item on the web site and roll it up into a sitewide 
heatmap.
The heatmap is broken up by content health segment (imagery, videos, product 
descriptions, and the like) and by department. This way the retailer’s leadership 
can easily see where there are opportunities for improvement, which depart-
ments are hitting their content health goals, and which weren’t. No department 
head wants to have the most red area in the heatmap at a weekly or monthly 
review. By presenting all the departments side by side via the monthly heatmap, 
the department heads compete to have the best content health scores. Yet this 
bricks-to-clicks retailer took things one step further. The retailer made content 
health scores a key element of merchant goals.
We knew the approach was working the day the merchants in a meeting at 
the retailer’s offices asked us how they could improve their content health 
scores. They cared because they were a goal for them.
Talk about organizational transformation for e-commerce. The director’s 
approach drove change across the entire organization. The key steps were 
incredibly effective.
1.	 Get the right reporting in place.
2.	 Consistently report on the data.
3.	 Tie employee goals to improvements in metrics.
The result? We have seen double-digit sales increases for those who have 
adopted this methodology.
Pricing and Inventory
In addition to providing retailers with content health reporting, Content 
Analytics also delivers comprehensive pricing and inventory insights. Retailers 
use our solutions to alert their buyers when products go out of stock.  

Bricks to Clicks
107
They use our pricing reports to see how their top items are priced relative to 
the competition and whether any adjustments are needed.
Even retailers employing dynamic pricing algorithms often need to make manual 
adjustments to their top-selling items. Our reporting and alerting capabilities 
give category managers the key information they need, right when they need it.
Assortment
Assortment is another important area of focus for bricks-to-clicks retailers. 
Here we see two distinct trends: a focus on a specific niche in the market 
or a drive to carry as many products as possible. Those retailers looking 
to increase their assortment are primarily doing so through marketplaces. 
Marketplaces allow third-party sellers to sell directly to shoppers while taking 
advantage of the consumer reach, brand recognition, and platform capabilities 
of the retailer.
In the marketplace model, retailers take a cut of the action, typically between 
6 percent and as much as 25 percent. In the bricks world, our suppliers typi-
cally act as the category managers for their retailers. Bricks retailers simply 
don’t have the same kind of insight into e-commerce assortment as they do 
into store assortment. This is usually because their supplier partners haven’t 
dedicated the extensive category management resources to e-commerce that 
they have to in-store. Retailers often aren’t willing to pay for separate or addi-
tional category management resources in e-commerce. The other reason is 
that some retailer teams believe that the best approach to category manage-
ment in e-commerce is an algorithmic one: feed the computers enough data, 
and the results will follow.
The challenge is that increasing assortment requires three key elements.
• 
Identifying the assortment to be added
• 
Getting the assortment online
• 
Ensuring the new assortment has quality content so that 
the products appear in search results and deliver conver-
sions once shoppers land on the item pages
Pure-play e-commerce retailers such as Jet, Wayfair, and Zulily have brought a 
number of unique innovations to assortment expansion. Table 7-1 highlights 
a few of these different approaches and their corresponding pros and cons.

As we look to the future of e-commerce, we expect to continue to see evolv-
ing retailer business models. First-party sales, flash sales, marketplaces, and 
drop-shipping programs will all be part of the equation. More innovations are 
sure to come.
Item Setup
Streamlining the item setup process may be one of the least talked about yet 
more important aspects of delivering a robust online product assortment. 
Item setup continues to be a challenge for many traditional bricks retailers. 
We’ve seen retailers have as many as 800 or more individual forms for item 
setup. This often leads to confusion with suppliers and results in all kinds of 
data errors, further slowing down the process. Bricks-to-clicks retailers are 
making a concerted effort to improve their item setup process.
By getting new items online faster, bricks-to-clicks retailers start selling sooner. 
They also become the content authority for those items, which in turn pro-
duces better search engine rankings.
Many item setup forms are still Excel-based templates with complex macros 
built in for data validation. At Content Analytics, we’re helping bricks-to-clicks 
retailers move their entire item setup processes online. We still support the 
Excel forms, but we also provide a complete web-based interface for editing 

Bricks to Clicks
111
and validating item setup information. Retailers that implement this kind of 
approach are empowering their suppliers. They give their suppliers the tools 
they need to perform most data validation up front and make changes as 
needed, thereby streamlining the item setup process.
The most sophisticated bricks-to-clicks retailers are implementing applica-
tion programming interfaces (APIs) that tools vendors can connect to for 
item setup. This gives companies such as Content Analytics the opportunity 
to design and develop streamlined user interfaces and data validation mech-
anisms, while enabling the retailers to maintain standardized programmatic 
interfaces for receiving the data they need.
At Content Analytics, we provide cloud-based APIs for retailers that don’t want or 
don’t have the resources to develop their own item setup API implementations. 
We also provide a complete cloud-based item setup and maintenance system for 
retailers that want a plug-and-play solution.
In parallel with adding more items to their online assortment, it’s also impor-
tant for retailers to ensure that shoppers can find those new items. Often, 
new item pages are effectively invisible to search engines and shoppers alike 
because they lack great content. If item pages don’t have great content, no 
matter how many items a retailer adds, those pages still won’t be highly ranked 
in search engine and on-site (retailer) search results and shoppers won’t be 
able to find them.
Search Engine Optimization
The bricks-to-clicks retailers have a heavy focus on search engine optimiza-
tion (SEO) with very tangible results—more on those results in a little bit. 
First the why.
Their SEO investment is to ensure that their items show up in Google and 
other search engines when shoppers are looking for the items they carry. 
All have dedicated SEO teams who are responsible for managing their SEO 
efforts. SEO efforts require multiple initiatives.
• 
Tracking the retailer’s search rankings in popular search 
engines. Retailers use software such as BrightEdge and 
Content Analytics to track which keywords they rank for 
and how high.
• 
Optimizing item pages so that retailers can improve the 
number that get listed in search results. They do this by 
ensuring that product pages contain high-quality unique 
content, header tags, and alt text for images.

Chapter 7 | The Retailer Challenge (and Opportunity)
112
• 
Reducing the number of outdated item and category 
pages that contain no content, poor content, or duplicate 
content from elsewhere on the site. These kinds of pages 
bring down the overall quality of the site in the eyes of 
Google and reduce the likelihood that even high-quality 
pages will be included in top positions in search results.
• 
Ensuring that search engines can discover all the pages on 
their site. They do this by making sure their sites include 
up-to-date sitemaps to make it easy for search engines to 
find the relevant content on their sites.
The need for unique content highlights a subtle but important tension develop-
ing between suppliers and retailers. Google values unique content. The search 
engine penalizes sites that use duplicate content, considering those sites to be 
less authoritative. If you have too much duplicate content, Google may remove 
your entire site and all the links to its pages from its search results. When two 
sites have the same content, typically the site that publishes its content first is 
considered the original. That means getting item content (especially content 
that comes directly from suppliers and may be used on multiple sites) live on 
the Web quickly is paramount.
Yet suppliers and retailers have differing objectives when it comes to unique 
content. Suppliers typically want the same content everywhere because they 
want to maintain brand integrity. Retailers want unique content so they can 
rank higher in the search engines. And they ultimately decide which content 
appears on their sites. This tension is not likely to be solved anytime soon.
We’ve also seen that bricks-to-clicks retailers undertake their own efforts to 
develop unique content. Since it’s not cost-effective to create unique, opti-
mized content for every item on a site, bricks-to-clicks retailers focus on 
those items that have the potential to drive the most revenue.
What’s changed from in-store to online is location. Retailers are competing 
for the same small slice of search engine real estate.
Some retailers are turning to automated content generation, with mixed 
results. Automated content generation uses templates, natural language pro-
cessing, and product specification data to generate product content. Other 
retailers rely on low-cost outsourcing agencies to produce content, also with 
varying results. Some use a mix of the two. In both cases, the quality of the 
content produced tends to vary greatly.
In the bricks-to-clicks retailers, optimizing the most important items and leav-
ing the rest for suppliers and sellers to deal with is the prevailing strategy. 
That said, we expect continued advances in natural language and hybrid natu-
ral language and human product content generation in the years ahead.

Bricks to Clicks
113
The bricks-to-clicks retailers also ensure that they’re tracking the health of all 
the different types of pages on their site and optimizing content accordingly. 
In addition to tracking and optimizing item pages, they’re also tracking and 
optimizing category pages, so when shoppers perform more general searches 
for terms like “televisions” or “strollers,” the pages on their sites will still 
come up.
The best category pages combine unique copy with algorithmically generated 
product listings. For example, if a retailer wants to push more of a certain 
product, that product will be featured on the corresponding category pages.
The bricks-to-clicks retailers also plan ahead when it comes to their SEO 
efforts. Search engines are crawling and indexing billions of web pages, so it 
takes time for updated results to appear. Plus, it takes time to develop unique 
content. That’s why bricks-to-clicks retailers start optimizing their site con-
tent well in advance of holiday shopping periods and other key events.
At Content Analytics, our goal is to provide retailers with a single place where 
they can find the SEO and content health information they need while also 
enabling them to get updated content from their suppliers.
In the process, we have seen page visits increase by 14 percent or more, and 
sometimes by as much as 30 percent, just by improving item page content. 
Although the investment to see SEO results takes time and dedication, it is 
still one of the most cost-effective and proven ways to drive web site visits.
A/B Testing and Personalization
Getting shoppers to your site is only half the battle. Bricks-to-clicks retailers 
are also employing innovative approaches to increase conversion rates. A/B 
testing is one well-known approach, where retailers evaluate the performance 
of two page layouts to see which one performs better. A portion of shoppers 
see one page, and a portion see another.
We expect some retailers to take this a step further in the future, gathering 
multiple product images and product descriptions from suppliers and sellers 
and A/B testing them to see which combination performs the best.
Interestingly, we’ve seen limited interest in personalization. Since the early 
2000s, startups and large companies alike have invested in e-commerce per-
sonalization but to little avail. Massive data collection efforts, sophisticated 
algorithms, and other approaches showed little advantage over the basic yet 
effective “consumers who bought this also bought that” approach. It turns 
out that as shoppers, we aren’t as different from each other in our shopping 
preferences as we’d like to think. Yet at the same time, we are highly social 
creatures, who take the recommendations and opinions of both friends and 
strangers seriously—which is where ratings and reviews come in.

Chapter 7 | The Retailer Challenge (and Opportunity)
114
Ratings and Reviews
Product ratings and reviews continue to be extremely important in e-com-
merce. Products with one review do better than products with zero reviews, 
but the real tipping point is at 21 reviews. Studies have shown that products 
with 21 or more reviews receive twice as much traffic as products with no 
reviews. After that number, the law of diminishing returns kicks in, and the 
impact of reviews has a lesser effect from there on out.
Reviews can also be a great source of unique content, if managed properly. 
The bricks-to-clicks retailers measure review counts and work directly with 
their suppliers on programs to get their products reviewed. Some third-party 
review programs are available, such as BuzzAgent. Amazon’s Vine program is 
another option, where Amazon provides products to a network of reviewers 
(who receive the products free of charge).
BazaarVoice continues to have, outside of Amazon, the lion’s share of the 
supplier review market because of a strong syndication network that reaches 
hundreds of retailers and because of its tight relationship with Walmart, where 
it is the only review provider currently supported on Walmart.com.
What are the benefits to retailers of supporting their own native review capa-
bility? First, they have more control over the user experience, less integration 
overhead, and no ongoing license fees like they have with a third-party pro-
vider. They can be sure that the reviews displayed on their site are original 
reviews, not reviews that suppliers have syndicated across multiple sites. The 
benefit of syndication, of course, is that a retailer doesn’t need to build up a 
big base of reviews from scratch—it can leverage an existing base of reviews. 
The downside is that the retailer can’t be guaranteed unique review content.
Unique, fresh content continues to become more and more important. As 
a result, the negative impact of using the same nonunique reviews that pub-
lished on other sites is also increasing. Bricks-to-clicks retailers are engaging 
their shopper base to write new reviews rather than relying too heavily on 
syndicated reviews. In the process, they’re building a unique and proprietary 
content asset that will have long-term, differentiated value in the market.
Connecting with the Shopper
The approaches retailers are using to engage with shoppers don’t stop with 
reviews. Retailers are using Q&A sections in their item pages where customers 
can ask (and answer) questions about products. They’re also experimenting with 
capabilities such as real-time chat. Similar to the chat windows now commonly 
available for consumers to get support on a variety of web sites, chat windows 
on e-commerce web sites enable consumers to ask questions and get answers 

Bricks to Clicks
115
in real time. But unlike typical support-style chat windows, the e-commerce chat 
approach lets the consumer connect directly with a brand/supplier representative.
Retail startup Welcome Commerce (formerly known as ChatID) is one com-
pany that’s focused on increasing real-time engagement between brands and 
shoppers through an online chat plug-in. The ChatID plug-in makes it possible 
for retailers to embed chat within the product pages of their web sites so 
shoppers can communicate directly with the brand. Other approaches don’t 
require an actual plug-in, simply a link embedded in an item’s product descrip-
tion that causes a chat window to open—no change on the part of the retailer 
is required.
The biggest challenge with real-time chat is that suppliers must have dedicated 
personnel available to respond to chat requests as they come in. Consumers 
dislike seeing the “real-time chat is not currently available; please leave a mes-
sage” notice when they have the expectation they’re going to get real-time 
help.
The jury is still out on how successful the real-time chat approach will be. 
But the bricks-to-clicks retailers are piloting these kinds of capabilities to 
gauge customer and to give suppliers an opportunity to engage directly with 
shoppers.
Membership and Subscription Models
Bricks-to-clicks retailers are experimenting with membership and subscrip-
tions models—but in most cases not fast enough. No membership service 
has been quite as successful as Amazon Prime. Originally a loss-leader for the 
company when Prime was launched in 2005, Prime has now grown to more 
than 70 million members. The free shipping and guaranteed two-day delivery 
time (and in some cases now even faster delivery time) are benefits too great 
for most shoppers to turn down. A Prime membership also makes consum-
ers—who have already invested $99 in their annual membership—think twice 
about shopping somewhere else.
Other retailers like Sam’s Club and Costco pioneered the membership model, 
but Amazon has been the fastest to drive up its numbers, in large part because 
it was willing to support Prime at a loss when they originally rolled it out.
In the subscription area, Unilever’s billion-dollar purchase of Dollar Shave 
Club highlights the strong demand (in this case by a brand) to get into the 
subscription business and have a more direct connection with the shopper.
Other nontraditional retailers are using subscription models with some suc-
cess as well. Startups Ipsy and Birchbox are generating hundreds of millions of 
dollars in revenue annually each with their cosmetics subscription models. For 
a low fee, shoppers know they’ll receive a package of items they’re sure to like 

Chapter 7 | The Retailer Challenge (and Opportunity)
116
delivered to them every month. These companies may run into challenges as 
they scale because of increasing costs of customer acquisition and retention.
Bricks-to-clicks retailers are also experimenting with rewards models. 
Shoppers accumulate points over time and can redeem those points for future 
discounts or special offers. Retailers like Sephora are using rewards programs 
to generate loyalty and keep customers coming back.
If there is one element in this area that separates bricks-to-clicks retailers from 
the rest, it is the amount of experimentation they’re willing to do to figure out 
what works. Just as bricks retailers experiment with different store formats, 
layouts, and locations, bricks-to-clicks retailers experiment with different sales 
and delivery models to make their customer relationships “stickier.”
Mobile Apps
Along with other retailers, Amazon and Walmart have both rolled out mobile-
specific applications. One of Amazon’s insights was to make it easy for shoppers 
to comparison shop the price of in-store items with online items. The company’s 
unique mobile scanning technology works not only with bar codes but with 
product labels as well.
The big question in this area is how many applications consumers are real-
istically going to interact with on their mobile devices. Although millions of 
mobile applications have been developed, the number that consumers interact 
with on a day-to-day basis is in reality quite small—Messages, Facebook, Uber, 
Maps, and perhaps a banking application or two. Bricks-to-clicks retailers are 
starting with basic mobile applications but face a challenge in making their 
apps compelling enough for shoppers to interact with on a daily basis.
The Omnichannel Experience
If there’s one company that has cracked the code on integrating in-store and 
online it is Apple. The Cupertino company has created an in-store shopping 
environment that delights the customer, with the ability to interact with the 
company’s latest products and get help for existing purchases. The Genius Bar 
is genius. Customers come into the store to get help with an existing piece of 
hardware or software and are likely to walk out with a new purchase in addi-
tion to getting their problem addressed. Apple’s in-store sales representatives, 
with their mobile point-of-sale devices, make it especially easy for shoppers to 
make new purchases.
Playing to the importance of convenience, Apple has also made it easy to order 
online and pick up in store. Walmart has done the same with its pick-up today 
(PUT) model, allowing consumers to see which items are available where. At 

Bricks to Clicks
117
the same time, Google is trying hard to compete, partnering with a variety 
of retailers to roll out same-day delivery of products from those retailers via 
Google Shopping. And now even Amazon is creating its own brick-and-mortar 
stores. Why have consumers go elsewhere to check out physical products 
when the company can keep those consumers inside its own brand?
With all that said, no matter which retailer you look at, delivering a seamless 
omnichannel shopping experience is no easy feat. It requires highly integrated 
supply chains, efficient logistics, and a streamlined customer experience so 
that shoppers don’t have to wait when they arrive at a store to pick up their 
items. As with mobile applications, the bricks-to-clicks retailers will continue 
to experiment in this area as they figure out what works—and what doesn’t.
Grocery: The Next E-commerce Frontier
Online grocery represents a huge market opportunity, yet for many years 
it has seemed just out of reach. Consumers still want to pick out their own 
fruits and vegetables as well as prepared meals—although meal delivery ser-
vices are trying their best to take aim at this segment of the market.
But in the last year, we’ve seen greatly increased demand from our supplier 
clients for analytics and reporting for online grocery across Amazon Fresh, 
Walmart Grocery, and Peapod. We also see key personnel within our supplier 
clients shifting their focus from core e-commerce to grocery.
A combination of three market factors are coming together to drive growth 
in the online grocery space. First, consumers are going through a genera-
tional shift. They are short on time and attention and have an ever-increasing 
expectation of convenience. Second, existing bricks retailers want to combine 
online and offline capabilities. Third, major suppliers are looking to establish 
pole position in the space. Where once these suppliers were taking a “wait 
and see” approach to online grocery, they now want to make sure they don’t 
get left behind as more purchasing moves online. We expect to see bricks-to-
clicks retailers continue to innovate in the online grocery area in the months 
and years ahead.
Competitive Insight
Retailers can never have enough competitive insight. We are seeing an increas-
ing number of requests for competitive reporting. This reporting includes 
pricing and promotion data, assortment information, and evaluations of com-
petitive product content quality and best practices.

Chapter 7 | The Retailer Challenge (and Opportunity)
118
In particular, retailers want to answer the following questions:
• 
Which best-selling products are available on competitor 
sites but not on my site?
• 
Which niche sites are beating us on selection or price?
• 
What promotions are other retailers running, and what is 
the “out the door” price for equivalent items?
• 
How are products are being priced on other sites, and 
are we competitive?
• 
How is the assortment of other retailers changing over 
time?
• 
What is the quality of content for item pages on other 
retailer sites?
• 
What kind of creative, visuals, and messaging are other 
retailers using?
• 
What search terms are competitors ranking for in Google 
and other search engines?
In one example, Jet.com included the prices that Amazon was charging for 
the same product directly on its site so that shoppers could see exactly how 
much they were saving over Amazon by shopping on Jet. By finding items from 
distribution locations closer to the consumer, Jet’s unique pricing algorithm 
delivers more savings to consumers as they add more items to the basket.
In an increasingly competitive market, bricks-to-clicks retailers are asking 
these key questions and using sophisticated technology to give them insight 
into the competitive landscape. Based on this competitive information, they’re 
rapidly evolving their online marketing, pricing, and promotion strategies, 
often in real time.
Bricks-to-clicks retailers use competitive data as an input into algorithmic 
pricing, with pricing algorithms at retailers like Amazon and Walmart dynami-
cally updating prices throughout the day based on the price other retailers 
in the market are charging for a given item. Competitive data is also used as 
an input into strategic initiatives such as assortment expansion—retailers can 
figure out which items they’re missing and prioritize those items to be added 
to their catalogs. In addition, bricks-to-clicks retailers are using competitive 
data for content and attribute validation—checking to see whether they have 
an equivalent or better number of specifications for items in electronics, for 
example, and then creating initiatives to increase their content quality and 
specification counts where necessary.

Specialty Independent Retailers
Another way that retailers are remaining competitive is through specialization. 
To that end, we’re seeing more and more specialty independent retailers spring 
up. These retailers have set up shop online using Shopify or other platforms 
and have typically developed a more targeted way to market to a narrower 
segment of the shopper market. They develop high-quality content, produce 
custom buyer’s guides, and use direct-to-consumer channels such as YouTube 
to drive visits and conversions.
Looked at another way, the market appears to be segmenting into a few big 
mass-market retailers, whose goal is to continue to expand their assortment 
to be as large as possible, and a large number of smaller, specialty retailers 
who have found unique ways to market to their target shoppers. Some bricks-
to-clicks retailers are even implementing narrowly targeted sites as spin-offs 
or spin-ins of their core offerings so that they too can target narrower market 
segments.
We expect to see more compelling content continue to emerge from these 
specialty independent retailers along with highly segmented marketing 
approaches.
Delivery and Drones
No chapter on the future of e-commerce retailers would be complete with-
out a word on “last-mile” delivery. Jeff Bezos stole the limelight when he 
announced that Amazon was exploring Amazon Prime delivery using drones.
At the time, the idea seemed far-fetched. But today it seems much closer to 
reality. In March 2017, Amazon completed its first public U.S. drone delivery, 
“ferrying sunscreen to attendees at an Amazon-hosted conference in Palm 
Springs, California.”1 Drone technology continues to increase in sophistication. 
The cost of the technology keeps coming down. Perhaps most importantly, 
consumers continue to demand faster delivery. Don’t expect it to be too long 
before everyday deliveries are being made by drone.

Summary
In this chapter, we’ve explored the many ways in which bricks-to-clicks 
retailers are partnering with their suppliers to win in e-commerce. These 
approaches include the following:
• 
Rolling out cloud-based item setup and content mainte-
nance portals that make it easy for suppliers to set up 
new items and update content. Retailers get access to 
the best content while still maintaining control over what 
ultimately gets published on their sites.
• 
Developing unique, compelling content to engage their 
shoppers.
• 
Using Content Analytics to measure and improve content 
quality, out-of-stock rates, and pricing, thereby empower-
ing their organizations to deliver more visits and higher 
conversion rates.

The E-commerce 
Flywheel
“Do not spend a dime on advertising until you have spent many dollars 
and hours building page content. I won’t even touch your ad money until 
then.”
—Amazon.com senior buyer
The year was 2009, and Raj Rao and Loran Gutt, two of the leaders tasked with 
running 3M’s eTransformation team, faced a serious problem. The 110-year-
old company, historically the category captain in old-school brick-and-mortar 
departments such as office supplies, home improvement, and kitchen cleaning, 
had done little to digitize its products and get them ready for e-commerce. 
Now they faced a daunting task: how, with a small team, to prioritize and maxi-
mize their returns on e-commerce.
The first thing they did would turn out to be a very smart move indeed. 
They invested heavily in understanding Amazon’s model and flywheel, which 
centered around developing inventory and assortment. They knew 3M wasn’t 
going to be the one creating the digital shelf. Their job would be to maximize 
the real estate that was out there. Although 3M was coming from behind in 
e-commerce, the company had three things going for it: a well-recognized 
brand, a highly effective team that was solely focused on e-commerce, and 
excellent relationships with its retailers.

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
122
One of the first conversations Gutt had with the Amazon merchants was a 
lot like the co-op marketing conversations he had been having with brick-and-
mortar retailers. That’s when the Amazon buyer told him, “I don’t want you 
to spend one dime trying to get people to pages where the customer can’t 
achieve their goal. I want you to spend many hours and many dollars improv-
ing your content and product detail pages.” Otherwise, both 3M and Amazon 
would be throwing good money away. People online make their decisions on 
the quality of the content. If Amazon and 3M spent millions of dollars driving 
shoppers to product pages that looked bad, those shoppers simply wouldn’t 
buy 3M’s products.
“Priming” the Flywheel
The Amazon flywheel, Gutt explained to me, begins with selection. You need 
to have the product available on the site in the first place in order for a shop-
per to find it, let alone buy it. Case in point: Amazon’s expansion from books 
to consumer electronics to home goods. Amazon combines category expan-
sion with global selection.
In the Amazon flywheel, selection comes first. From there, it is about driving 
the consumer experience: quality product content to get your product story 
right coupled with a delivery promise, which is the speed promise.
Building on the Amazon model, Gutt and Rao developed a three-part strategy, 
which I have since coined the e-commerce flywheel. As shown in Figure 8-1, it 
consists of the following:
• 
Product presence
• 
Demand generation
• 
Metrics and analytics

Bricks to Clicks
123
Although metrics and analytics is the third step, we often find that bricks-
to-clicks suppliers will implement some level of metrics and analytics first 
because they want to get a baseline measurement of how they’re doing.
That’s why when we first start working with bricks-to-clicks suppliers we often 
perform a baseline audit with Content Health, Is It Live (checking which items 
from the supplier are live on a retailer’s site), Share of Search/Shelf, and Out of 
Stock reports. This gives the supplier a clear sense of where they’re starting out.
In the rest of this chapter, we’ll take a detailed look at each step of the 
e-commerce flywheel components.
Step 1: Product Presence—Comprehensive 
Product Setup
The bricks-to-clicks suppliers we work with sell through multiple channels. 
By that we don’t just mean online and offline—they’re selling on Amazon, 
Walmart, a few retailers that are specific to their vertical (such as Best Buy 
and B&H Photo for electronics and Macys.com, Kohls.com, and JCPenney.com 
for apparel), and their own brand web site (for example, Samsung.com, Levi.
com and so on).
Figure 8-1. The e-commerce flywheel

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
124
What does comprehensive product setup mean? It means more than filling in an 
“Item Setup” Excel spreadsheet and sending that to a retailer to get your item 
listed and available for sale. It means comprehensive product content of every 
form, on both your brand site (that is, your corporate site like Samsung.com) 
and on the web sites of your online retailers.
Comprehensive product content means the following:
• 
Basic item setup for every product for sale on a retailer’s site
• 
Robust product descriptions
• 
Product descriptions with language that consumers 
search for
• 
Ratings and reviews
• 
Consumer questions answered
• 
Product images
• 
Product videos
• 
Lifestyle images/videos
• 
Product comparison tables
• 
Related item descriptions
• 
Nurture communities of consumers contributing content/ 
building the brand online
• 
A centralized location to store your content
• 
An easy way to output content in the varying formats 
required by different retailers
Because we’ve covered content in detail in previous chapters, we’ll move 
directly to demand generation and analytics.
Step 2: Demand Generation
Once you’ve set up your products and the item pages for those products are 
complete (they have complete product descriptions, multiple high-resolution 
images, a few reviews, and rich content), it’s time to start driving shoppers to 
your item pages. Although retailers do their own search engine optimization, 
paid advertising (search engine marketing), and other forms of promotions, 
as a supplier it is still incumbent on you to drive demand for your product. 
Demand generation comes in a number of forms.
• 
Search engine marketing (SEM)
• 
Search engine optimization (SEO)

Bricks to Clicks
125
• 
E-mail marketing
• 
Social media investment
• 
Targeted banner advertising
• 
Retailer online trade promotions
• 
Retailer brand sites/brand showcases
• 
Direct
How should you prioritize your investment across each of these channels?  
It depends on who you ask.
As of November 2016, according to the Custora E-Commerce Pulse, search 
advertising drove 19 percent of e-commerce purchases in 2016, organic  
(the results below the paid ads) drove 18 percent, and e-mail drove 25 percent.1  
A report by Yotpo, a platform for user-generated e-commerce content, indi-
cated that in 2015, 34 percent of visits came from search, 40 percent came 
from direct, and only 5 percent came from e-mail.2 So, the short answer is that 
you need to invest across all demand generation channels, not just one. Let’s 
explore each type of demand generation one at a time.
Search Engine Marketing
Search engine marketing refers to the advertisements that appear above 
the organic search results in search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. 
Almost anyone can buy these ads and use them to drive visits to their item 
pages—either on their own brand site or on a retailer’s site. But search adver-
tising can be expensive, ranging from five cents per ad at the low end for 
infrequently searched for terms to tens of dollars on the high end.
In some ultra-competitive categories, such as insurance, loans, and mortgages, 
the cost per click (CPC)—that is, the amount an advertiser pays when a con-
sumer clicks an ad—is as much as $54.91 per ad, according to online advertis-
ing firm WordStream.3 Fortunately, while search advertising for grocery items, 
toys, electronics, and apparel isn’t cheap, it’s nowhere near as expensive as 
advertising for some of the categories listed earlier.
In case you’re wondering whether suppliers advertise their own products in 
Google and other search engines, the answer is, yes, they do. As an example, 
in a search for “diapers” on Google in January 2017, the first two paid search 
results were from the sites diapers.com and honest.com, but the next two

e-commerce-traffic-sources/
3www.wordstream.com/articles/most-expensive-keywords

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
126
results were from Pampers.com (P&G) and Huggies.com (Kimberly-Clark). 
While you can’t buy diapers directly on the Pampers.com brand web site, you 
can get lots of helpful information and then click through from the brand web 
site to various online retailers to make the purchase.
Search Engine Optimization
Nearly 20 years after the invention of the online search engine, search engine 
optimization may still be one of the more underappreciated and more cost-
effective forms of marketing around. The results that appear in search engines 
below paid ads are known as organic search results. That’s because they’re 
unpaid, in the sense that marketers don’t pay money to Google to get their 
pages listed in the organic search results the way they do with SEM. However, 
marketers do typically pay agencies to help them optimize their rankings so 
that their items are highly ranked in search results.
Over the years, the algorithms that determine which items rank high in 
Google search results have gotten a lot more sophisticated. They used to look 
primarily at how many other sites linked back to a given site and use that to 
determine the ranking of a page in the search results. The theory was that the 
more sites linked to a given site and the more reputable those sites were, the 
higher the authority of that site and therefore the higher it should appear in 
search results. But over time, as marketers have gotten smarter and as many 
have attempted to game the search results through link building, the search 
engine algorithms have also gotten more sophisticated.
Today’s algorithms take into a variety of factors when determining which 
pages to rank in organic search results. These factors include backlinks, but 
they also include the quality of content, content length, content freshness, 
content relevancy (how relevant is a particular page on a web site for a given 
search term), and uniqueness of content. Other factors relate to keywords—
does the keyword for a given search appear in the title tag, in the description 
tag, and in the h1 tag for a page? A tag is an HTML term referring to the ele-
ments of a web page; a web page is constructed in HTML, and by creating the 
structure of a page a certain way and then populating the tags that make up 
the page properly, you can increase the likelihood that your items will rank 
high in search results.
In fact, Google uses some 200 different factors to determine how to rank a 
particular item in its search results.4 When it comes to organic search results, 
there are two places suppliers need to focus their efforts: their own brand 
site and the sites of the retailers through which they sell. For your own brand 
site, you control the structure, design, and all of the content. Therefore, you 
can fully optimize your site.

Bricks to Clicks
127
When it comes to a retailer’s site, you may not control the structure of the 
site, but you can provide the retailer with a great product title (that includes a 
popular keyword) and great product description content, resulting in the retail-
er’s pages being highly ranked in Google and other search engines. Moreover, 
by providing better content, you’re likely to produce more conversions once 
a shopper does arrive at your item page. We’ll talk about how to track your 
performance in search rankings when discussing step 3, metrics and analytics.
E-mail Marketing
There are multiple ways to use e-mail marketing to reach your customers. 
Although e-mail marketing is primarily used by retailers, it isn’t only for retail-
ers. As a supplier, you can reach out to your customers directly to notify 
them about new product offerings, offer them coupons, and ask them to write 
reviews for your products, as you build up a larger and larger list of custom-
ers over time.
Studies have shown that the most important factor impacting the success 
of e-mail marketing campaigns is the subject line you use in the e-mail.5 You 
can test different subject lines to see which one produces the best results. 
Programs like Mailchimp will let you A/B test multiple subject lines to see 
which one produces the best results.
E-mail marketing is also great for marketplace sellers—contacting recent buy-
ers of your product to ask if they’re happy with their purchase and offering 
help if they aren’t. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers are using this approach success-
fully to reduce negative reviews. They’re able to contact customers and deal 
with any issues before the customer feels a need to write about a bad experi-
ence on the Web. Or if they do write about a bad experience, they’ll often 
include how a supplier resolved their issue (assuming that the supplier did 
resolve their issue), turning a potentially negative review into a success story.
Social Media
A lot of brands these days are focused on social media. Although social  
media seems to account for only 2 percent of shopper visits according to 
research firm Custora,6 it does play an important role in the path to purchase. 
That’s because visits to a product page get attributed to a certain channel only 
if that channel was the last step in the shopper’s path before coming to the 
retailer’s web site. Social media may be more of an “awareness-building vehicle”  
5www.digitalmarketer.com/ecommerce-email-marketing/

traffic-chartoftheday/attachment/retail-ecommerce-orders-traffic-sources-2/

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
128
and less of a “purchase-driving tactic.”7 So, even though social media may not 
lead directly to purchases, you can’t afford to ignore how consumers are talk-
ing about your brand.
For most suppliers, that means having a brand ambassador who’s reading 
social media posts and responding to them. But it doesn’t stop there—it also 
means creating social content to promote awareness of your brand and shar-
ing that content on Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Twitter, and your own site. 
It’s important to be part of the conversation.
Targeted Banner Advertising
In the mix of approaches to driving shoppers to your products, display remains 
an important channel. We see a few common themes among bricks-to-clicks 
suppliers when it comes to display advertising.
• 
They use display ads to showcase specific promotions 
such as free shipping or discounts, along with a call to 
action such as “Buy Now.”
• 
They create targeted banners focused on specific niches 
of their shopper market—men, women, those looking for 
discounts, and so on.
• 
They use dynamic content to include information updated 
in real time such as prices and availability.
• 
They advertise both on relevant third-party sites (where 
shoppers are likely to be doing research) and on retailer 
sites.
• 
They use retargeting to increase brand recognition and 
stay top of mind as the shopper continues through the 
research process and into purchase.
Retailer Online Trade Promotions
According to Acosta Sales & Marketing, a $1.8 billion retail sales and mar-
keting company, trade promotion is a $100 billion industry and represents  
10 percent to 25 percent of gross sales for the typical consumer packaged 
goods (CPG) company.8 As e-commerce continues to grow, bricks-to-clicks 
suppliers are moving more of their trade promotion activities online.

terrible-ecommerce-tactic-or-is-it/
8www.acosta.com/tradepromotion.pdf

Bricks to Clicks
129
Unlike their bricks counterparts, bricks-to-clicks suppliers have dedicated 
e-commerce trade promotion budgets and teams. They use a combination of 
digital coupons, rebates, and other activities to drive consumer demand and 
brand awareness. The very best suppliers combine online trade promotions 
with analytics. They make sure that when they run trade promotions, products 
are in stock, stay in stock, and have great content.
Retailer-Brand Showcases
Retailer brand sites/brand showcases are less well known to many except 
the largest suppliers. Brand showcases are focused on one brand and tell the 
brand’s story through imagery and videos. Multiproduct showcases include 
imagery, video, and a series of specific products for sale. Sophisticated retail-
ers use a mix of static products (hand-selected) and dynamic product feeds 
that are based on pricing, availability, and other drivers to determine which 
products to list on the showcase pages.
Brand showcases are often focused around a specific event such as a holiday, 
a new product launch, a specific brand campaign, or a limited-time offering. 
Combined with other forms of demand generation, they can be an effective 
way to tell a brand’s story and drive product purchase behavior. They align the 
brand and the retailer and give the brand a unique opportunity to showcase 
their products on a retailer’s site with no competitive products/brands to 
distract from the experience.

Recent research indicates that Amazon.com is the starting point for 44 per-
cent of all e-commerce searches.9 That’s not surprising when you consider 
that in the 12 months before May 2016, Amazon.com did $82.2 billion in 
revenue, according to eMarketer and Fortune, while Walmart did $12.5 billion 
in revenue, with other retailers in the single digits.10 As of June 2016, Amazon 
had an estimated 63 million Prime members (making up more than half of the 
online retailer’s customer base), so it makes sense that many of those shop-
pers go directly to Amazon’s web site to start their e-commerce searches 
(Figure 8-2).11

Regardless of which source of traffic makes up the most volume, it’s clear that 
a mix of approaches is required to drive demand for your products.
Step 3: Metrics and Analytics
As you continue to invest in step 2, you’ll want to understand what’s work-
ing the best and reinvest in profitable tactics. Here we’ll explore the various 
types of analytics you need to get in place to understand how your business is 
performing—and where the opportunities are to improve.
• 
Web site analytics
• 
SEO analytics
• 
Retailer-specific analysis (how are we doing on a specific 
retailer?)
• 
Cross-retailer analysis (why is this retailer doing better 
than that one?)
• 
Competitive analysis (how are we doing relative to other 
brands?)
• 
Ongoing product presence and demand generation 
adjustment
Web Site Analytics
Bricks-to-clicks retailers use web site analytics to understand the shopper 
path to purchase on their web site. Suppliers use web site analytics on their 
brand web site to understand shopper visits as well—which products and 
Figure 8-2.  E-commerce sales 12 months to May 2016

Bricks to Clicks
131
information pages are shoppers looking at. The two most common applica-
tions we’ve seen used for web site analytics are Adobe Analytics (formerly 
known as Omniture; Adobe acquired Omniture in 2009) and Google Analytics. 
Both products provide insight into how many visits each page on a web site 
is receiving.
Such analytics programs can also help you segment your pages into differ-
ent groups: high-traffic, low-conversion pages; most visited pages; least visited 
pages; and so on. The Content Analytics platform can import visit data or lists 
of pages that have already been placed into groups. Based on the visits infor-
mation or groups, we can then run content health and SEO audits to under-
stand the specific actions that retailers and suppliers can take to drive more 
traffic to their sites and increase conversion rates.
SEO Analytics
When it comes to SEO, several well-known SEO platforms are available. These 
products provide insight into search engine rankings. Customers have told 
us, however, that such products tend to provide an overwhelming amount of 
data—many reports but too few specific actionable insights.
That’s why, in addition to our built-in content health reporting, Content 
Analytics includes an SEO view of content health. By integrating content 
health and SEO reporting, we make it easy to know which of your item 
pages have the most room for improvement—specifically as it relates to SEO  
(see Figure 8-3).

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
132
Rather than asking our customers to tell us which keywords to check their 
rankings for, we automatically figure out which keywords your products are 
doing well for—and which ones you might want to optimize for to drive 
more traffic. Google and other search engines emphasize unique, high-quality 
content. Content Analytics evaluates your item page content health and your 
SEO rankings and ties the two together so you know exactly what to do to 
improve. The result is more traffic to your pages through better SEO and 
higher conversion rates through higher-quality content on those pages.
Retailer-Specific Analysis
Retailer-specific analysis gives you insight into how you’re doing on a spe-
cific retailer and what you can do to improve. As I’ve mentioned in previous 
chapters, we focus on a core set of metrics, including content quality, share of 
search, share of shelf, ratings and reviews, and assortment/inventory.
We typically help bricks-to-clicks clients with retailer-specific analysis when 
we’re working with a specific retailer team. For example, we’ll start out work-
ing with the Walmart or Amazon team at a particular supplier, providing them 
Figure 8-3.  Combined content health and SEO reporting

Bricks to Clicks
133
with a comprehensive set of capabilities such as e-commerce Dashboards, 
item setup, and content updates.
After perfecting what we’re doing with one team, we’ll then expand across 
the organization to other retailer teams, to a global e-commerce function, 
or both. The benefit of this approach is that our knowledge of the supplier’s 
business goes extremely deep when we initially focus on working with them 
on a specific retailer.
Cross-Retailer Analysis
At other suppliers, we start by immediately providing analytics across mul-
tiple retailers. The benefit of this approach is that the supplier can monitor 
their performance on one retailer versus another. Right away we can pinpoint 
opportunities to improve content, run review outreach programs, and opti-
mize pricing and availability.
We typically see cross-retailer analysis used in three ways.
• 
To understand performance and opportunities for 
improvement across e-commerce channels
• 
To ensure brand integrity (product naming, imagery, and 
videos) across channels
• 
To provide an early-warning system when there might 
be an issue at a specific retailer that the supplier other-
wise wouldn’t know about until too late, such as products 
going out of stock
Individual supplier or brand teams within a larger organization can use the 
same analytics system across the organization, with each team focusing on 
their own area. Regional managers and global e-commerce directors can then 
use the same platform to understand performance across the entire business.
Although suppliers may be able to check a few best-selling products on a 
handful of web sites, they rarely have the time and resources required to 
check all their products across dozens of web sites every day. Automated, 
cross-retailer analytics like the Content Analytics platform can both provide 
that level of insight and provide exception alerting so suppliers are quickly 
notified of any items requiring their attention. Overall this means that suppli-
ers get a lot more leverage across their entire business with the same time 
and human capital investment that they already have.

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
134
Competitive Analysis
Competitive analysis provides bricks-to-clicks suppliers with insight into their 
products in the context of their competitors—on one channel or many. Some 
bricks-to-clicks suppliers have teams dedicated solely to competitive report-
ing, typically focused on market-share metrics and new product development. 
Competitive insights in the context of e-commerce analysis adds another layer 
to this kind of reporting (see Figure 8-4). Now suppliers can understand how 
they stack up on a number of images and videos, length of product descrip-
tions, ratings and reviews, assortment, in-stock rates, and pricing relative to 
the competition.
Figure 8-4.  Competitive insights
Making Adjustments
E-commerce is never a one-and-done area. Unlike in-store where you pro-
duce product packaging and set up a planogram only a few times a year, 
e-commerce is constantly changing. Retailers rapidly bring new shelves online 
and add challenger brands to the mix. Competitors are constantly evolving 
their product presence.
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers implement a proactive approach, with ongoing 
adjustment. They’re continuously updating images to be consistent with the  
latest brand imagery (which reduces return rates—the products that shoppers 

Bricks to Clicks
135
receive match the product images they saw when ordering). They’re adding 
rich content. And they’re making sure they capture as much of the digital shelf 
as possible and that their products stay in stock. All this is possible only with a 
comprehensive technology platform like Content Analytics to support them. 
Without technology, keeping up in e-commerce is a fool’s errand.
The E-commerce Flywheel in Action
While Gutt was at 3M, they grew the business from almost nonexistent to 
an eight-figure business over four years. “The basis for that,” said Gutt, “was 
leaning into the flywheel of product selection and presence.” After doing 
that to satisfaction, the next step was investing intelligently to drive traffic to 
products that were getting early traction through on-site and off-site demand 
generation. Then it was a rinse-and-repeat cycle of analyzing all of that and 
looking for the next opportunities to leverage product presence and demand 
generation and dollars.
The early work that is done to create product presence and demand genera-
tion will bring new sales, pretty much under the radar. You can drive more 
revenue simply by broadening your distribution. But once a channel becomes 
material in size, there’s a tension between internal forces and external retail-
ers related to that growth. After seeing 3M’s presence on Amazon.com, for 
example, 3M’s more traditional retailers started asking the company to match 
the same product presence they had on Amazon on the other retailers.
Online, retailers can iterate the consumer experience quickly. In contrast, 
resetting a planogram in a thousand stores is very challenging. Therefore, the 
ability to be digitally nimble as a brand and a retailer is one of the key charac-
teristics of bricks-to-clicks suppliers and retailers.
• 
They challenge the way things have always been done 
with their brand.
• 
They are open to experimenting with the business model 
and branding/positioning.
The other big takeaway from working with Amazon? The company is obsessed 
with putting the customer at the center of the discussion. Sometimes meeting 
attendees would even leave a chair open as the customer’s seat at the table.
The Omnichannel Challenge
Returning to the genesis of the e-commerce flywheel, I asked Gutt how 
omnichannel retailers can compete in an e-commerce world. His answer: if 
they can truly streamline the omnichannel experience, omnichannel retailers 
have an incredible opportunity to take market leadership positions in consum-
ables, grocery, and many other areas.

There is a split between any purely digital retailer like Jet and Amazon and 
omnichannel retailers. The ones who live and die by the online channel also 
live and die by the quality of the product content they use to drive the right 
shopper experience. That’s because product content is the only way they have 
to provide a shopper with information about a product—other than shipping 
the product to the shopper.
In contrast, an omnichannel retailer can supplement poor investment in the 
digital area with investment in the brick-and-mortar area, at least in the short 
term. The omnichannel retailers have started figuring out how to leverage 
their in-store and online combined presence.
What’s more, suppliers have an increasing concern with having all their digital 
eggs in the Amazon basket and too much of their e-commerce business flow-
ing through one retailer. There are opportunities for suppliers to test prod-
uct presence and demand generation strategies with other retailers online. 
Suppliers can diversify their go-to market, so Amazon doesn’t monopolize 
their fastest-growing channel.
From Store Shelf to Digital Shelf
For many traditional CPG companies and brick-and-mortar brands, the idea 
of the “infinite shelf” is still a new concept. As an example, French’s Mustard 
makes mustard in many variations. But in a traditional brick-and-mortar 
environment, French’s can take the real estate for only a few of those many 
varieties.
But in the online channel, French’s can find and reach a much broader com-
munity of buyers. It can tell its story and attract customers to products that 
might not be mass market. As Gutt pointed out, online, because of the infinite 
shelf, suppliers can really go after many different niches.
What’s more, in e-commerce, growth in a category isn’t a zero-sum game. 
There are many shelves, and they are infinitely long. In contrast, in a store, a 
retailer must trade real estate between product X and product Y. An online 
retailer can maximize traffic for product X and product Y.
But a retailer can create this traffic maximization only with the participation of 
the brand. Both in-store and online, retailers tend to focus on the category, and 
then they invest with the brands that invest with them. But online, retailers are 
more willing to invest with challenger brands that are willing to put the invest-
ment forward. Supporting challenger brands helps retailers create margin.

The Evolving Shopping Model
Looking back over the past 25 years, how has shopping evolved? The number 
of stock keeping units (SKUs) has exploded, and at the same time, people’s 
attention has fragmented.
New suppliers and global suppliers have greatly increased the number of SKUs 
in the market. That explosion around SKUs is happening at the same time that 
people’s attention is fragmenting. As Gutt puts it, 25 years ago you could go 
to Northwestern, they would teach you how to run a media mix model, you 
could take out a few Superbowl ads and a few end caps, and you would abso-
lutely make money. You were good to go.
But now, increasingly every year, less and less of that is true. Now it’s a ­question 
of how well you are telling your brand story in an authentic way and making 
your products discoverable by regular consumers, who are not swayed by the 
last Superbowl ad. Consumers want information, both from the manufacturer 
in the form of online content and from people like themselves through word 
of mouth and online ratings and recommendations.
Today, consumers expect that the manufacturer will provide the information 
they need to make an informed decision about a product. That means more 
than a basic title and a few bullet points.
Consumers have seen some brands do a great job with multiple images, vid-
eos, Q&A, and ratings and reviews. So, they know it can be done.
Those brands that choose not to invest in a comprehensive online product 
presence are looked on with distrust by today’s shoppers. There’s a general 
consumer perception that those suppliers are not providing sufficient infor-
mation to evaluate products from the manufacturer, so perhaps they have 
something to hide.
Delivering best-in-class product presence online is a way of building trust with 
the consumer. There is this idea now that those suppliers that invest in great 
content have nothing to hide—eight product shots for a product are better 
than one.
The Smaller Brand Advantage
The advantage for the smaller brand is much greater in digital than it was ever 
going to be in brick-and-mortar. Unless a small startup brand got lucky, histori-
cally it was hard to get traction with retailers unless you were a big brand or 
a brand-holding company.
One example Gutt pointed to is Alexia Foods, a maker of frozen potatoes. 
They compete against much larger brands like Ore-Ida (Kraft). They have a 
legitimate story to tell around ingredients and products that is much easier to 

Chapter 8 | The E-commerce Flywheel
138
bring to life in a digital environment than in a store. In the digital arena, starting 
with the most basic content available, digital is a new place for the company to 
tell its story and for the consumer to encounter that brand. Since online shelf 
space can be reconfigured all the time, retailers such as Amazon and Walmart 
are eager to bring challenger brands to their shoppers.
On the flip side, smaller (or challenger) brands bear the burden of proof to 
show that their product is better than the established name brand. For the 
consumer to choose to buy from a challenger brand, the challenger has to 
overcome the inertia of what a consumer has been buying for years if not 
generations. Delivering high-quality content presence and finding that niche 
of consumers who resonate with their product is a lot more possible online 
than it ever was in-store.
Summary
Imagine shopping for a new television online. You search and research, arriving 
at the product page for an item you’re potentially interested in, only to find 
that it has a very small image (and only one of them), no reviews, several unan-
swered questions about the tech specs of the product, and no comparisons 
showing how this product relates to other, similar products from the same 
manufacturer.
Yet if you remember right, you got to this item by clicking an advertisement 
you saw on Facebook. That’s odd, you think. Why would a manufacturer spend 
money on ads only to send you to a product page that doesn’t showcase their 
product in a compelling way? Did they make a mistake? Are they trying to hide 
something?
Yet that is exactly what bricks suppliers are doing. In trying to make the jump 
from bricks-to-clicks, they’re spending immense amounts of money on adver-
tising, only to send their potential shoppers to pages that not only don’t per-
form well but have the opposite effect. Bad pages dilute their brand value.
In contrast, bricks-to-clicks suppliers have implemented the e-commerce 
­flywheel, a virtuous cycle of optimizing product presence, demand generation, 
and analytics and insights.
In the previous chapters, we’ve presented the best practices and tools 
­necessary to implement the e-commerce flywheel. In this chapter, we’ve seen 
how all those discrete elements work together to form a comprehensive 
e-commerce strategy. In our next and last chapter we’ll look at what the 
future holds for e-commerce locally, nationally, and globally.

“Pure-play web retailing is not sustainable.”
—Scott Galloway
As they continue to open more pop-up stores, physical book stores, and gro-
cery stores, Amazon.com is continuing to make headlines. At the same time, 
traditional retailers continue to make headlines with numerous store closings. 
On the surface, one seems to be replacing the other. But looking deeper at 
the situation, something more interesting is going on.
First, Amazon wants to sell us more. With e-commerce accounting for  
10 percent of total retail sales, Amazon surely wants a crack at the other 
90 percent. What’s more, although online grocery shopping is continuing to 
expand at a fast rate, it still accounts for only 2 percent of the total U.S. 
­grocery market.1, 2

Second, there’s a question of shipping cost. As free shipping has become stan-
dard in e-commerce, Amazon’s shipping costs have increased by 20 percent 
per year.3 So while free shipping was an effective way to drive rapid customer 
acquisition, the cost of offering it may not be sustainable. Yet it is now a cus-
tomer requirement that would be nearly impossible to take away. Physical 
stores provide an additional opportunity not only to interact with customers 
but also to deliver a reduction in shipping costs; if multiple consumers go to 
a store to pick up their items, Amazon saves money on the cost of shipping 
those items to a customer’s home.
Third is the cost of capital. Amazon’s market capitalization continues to rise 
just as the market caps of brick-and-mortar players like Macy’s continue to 
decline. Saddled with expensive leases and physical real estate, chains such as 
Macy’s and JCPenney have been forced to focus on aggressive cost-cutting, 
while Amazon has continued to invest in its brand, offerings, and technology 
innovation. Amazon is expected to surpass Macy’s as the largest U.S. apparel 
retailer in 2017.4
Fourth, online real estate has gotten more expensive. According to Forrester 
Research, there are now more than 800,000 online stores vying for our wal-
lets.5 All that competition has driven up the cost of customer acquisition.
Fifth, while the traditional mall no longer has the appeal it once had, con-
sumers are demonstrating high interest in new form-factor physical stores, 
such as the Apple Store (now just called Apple).6 Warby Parker, a maker of 
­lower-priced high-end glasses, has opened more than 20 physical stores, after 
starting out as an online-only retailer.
Finally, e-commerce has become a proven way to innovate in retail. Many 
brands and retailers are using e-commerce to modernize and in some cases 
reinvent the retail experience. As an example, Chinese retail juggernaut 
Alibaba recently announced a $2.6 billion deal to take department store chain 
Intime Retail Group Co. private.
The deal opens up more of the large, existing physical retail market to Alibaba 
while enabling the e-commerce leader to experiment more aggressively with 
new retail strategies.7 Other pure-play e-commerce retailers are also opening

stores, including jewelry retailer Blue Nile and apparel maker Bonobos. Both 
cite consumers’ desire to touch and feel the product they are going to buy as 
important reasons to go into a physical store. The other reason, of course, is 
marketing. Flagship stores, like Apple’s in San Francisco’s Union Square, have 
been great for brands that want to continue to increase awareness, connec-
tion, and loyalty with consumers.
In the years ahead, we are likely to see many more physical store closings. Yet 
we may see many new store openings at the same time—just not from tradi-
tional retailers and not in the large-footprint mall form factor that has been 
the norm for retailers like Macy’s and Nordstrom’s. If Amazon’s new stores 
are any indicator, we can expect the physical store experience to start looking 
a lot more like the e-commerce experience than vice versa.
Yet with all that said, e-commerce is where the growth is. Market research 
firm eMarketer sees double-digit growth in North American e-commerce 
continuing at least through 2020.8
At Content Analytics, we are seeing these same trends in our business. Clients 
who were once e-commerce only are now asking us to analyze and report on 
physical and e-commerce retail data. They’re sending us sales data from both 
online and offline channels, supporting our efforts to become the “Control 
Center for Ecommerce,” not just for their online business but for their offline 
business as well. They’re finding that many of the systems they use for physi-
cal retail reporting are slow and outdated compared with the capabilities we 
bring with our modern, cloud-based analytics solution.
The same holds true with content management. Clients who have relied on 
legacy installed software systems, some of which haven’t been updated in 
years, are seeing what we can do in e-commerce and pulling us into their 
entire business, both online and in-store. They want to bring the same agility, 
speed of iteration, and innovation to their physical retail businesses as they 
have brought to their e-commerce businesses.
We’re seeing this happen with suppliers, who are having us manage all of their 
digital brand assets across online and in-store, for example, as well as with 
retailers, who are working with us to link data from their offline and online 
systems so they can better understand how their efforts in e-commerce 
impact what’s happening in their physical stores, and vice versa.
In addition to linking offline and online visits and sales, mobile is certainly the 
other area of high interest in the omnichannel future. By 2020, mobile com-
merce is expected to make up 45 percent of e-commerce.9 Yet the mobile

shopping experience still has a long way to go before it catches up with the 
ease of the desktop shopping experience.
■
■Note  Responsive web sites use more dynamic web design so that the same site can function 
well across a range of desktop, tablet, and mobile devices and screen sizes.
Desktops still account for some 75 percent of digital orders; many retailers 
are still in the process of upgrading their web site interfaces from hard-coded 
desktop-oriented user interfaces to fully responsive web experiences.
E-commerce and AI
Just as retailers are looking to merge the offline and online experiences, they 
are also looking to replicate some aspects of in-store shopping online. One 
example of this is using artificial intelligence (AI) to create the kind of unique, 
customized experience currently available only in a physical retail store.10 
Chatbots have long promised a more personalized customer experience 
online, while still delivering the scalability of automation. Historically, chatbots 
have not been able to provide sophisticated enough interactions for humans 
to give them high reviews. Yet new AI technologies such as IBM Watson 
and the advent of very large data sets (Big Data) generated from ­billions of 
online customer interactions and purchases are enabling the creation of more 
sophisticated chatbots and automated personal shopping assistants. These 
bots can answer questions about order status and even help with recommen-
dations for new purchases.
Retailers and suppliers are looking at other ways to use AI,11 including the 
following:
Customized recommendations
Pricing and out-of-stock prediction
Automated product tagging based on image recognition
Visual search
Fraud detection

Anticipating demand to inform inventory location
Sentiment analysis to understand the nuances of 
reviews and identify product issues or changes in 
consumer demand automatically
Industry research firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85 percent of consumer 
interactions will be managed without a human and that by the end of 2018, 
automated systems will recognize customers by face and voice across mul-
tiple channels.12 Such systems may be used both in-store and online. Amazon 
recently debuted a completely automated grocery store (currently available 
only to Amazon employees), the technology for which could be applied on 
a much broader scale to create an offline shopping experience that is more 
online-like and an online experience that has some of the elements of the 
offline experience.
And in what some industry reports have called “the future of computing,” 
Amazon continues to demonstrate innovative new voice capabilities with the 
Amazon Echo and its underlying service, Alexa.13
■
■Note  Voice is a promising new interface for e-commerce. Amazon’s Alexa service is one 
compelling example of this that is now being integrated not just into Amazon’s own devices but 
into cars, refrigerators, and other devices too.
Industry analysts have pointed out that unlike the iPhone’s Siri, which is rarely 
used as the phone’s primary user interface, Amazon has had to work harder 
to make Alexa more consumer-friendly because voice is the primary interface 
for Amazon Echo and the other devices into which Siri is being embedded.
No matter what area of e-commerce you’re focused on, AI is sure to play a 
big role in it going forward.
E-commerce Playbook for Brands
Looking across the bricks-to-clicks brands, there’s a common playbook we’ve 
helped these suppliers implement to be successful in e-commerce. Many 
brands we work with had a limited e-commerce presence when we first 
started working with them. Yet by adopting the best practices we recom-
mended, they were quickly able to establish strong positions in e-commerce.

Their response times improved, and their cycle times decreased. They imple-
mented a Dashboard that gave them the insight they needed to optimize their 
business operations and a content management capability that enables them 
to ensure brand integrity across their many e-commerce channels.
Table  9-1 shows the playbook they used—and that you can use—in 
e-commerce.
Let’s look at each of these in turn.
Be Present Online (Item Setup)
Many brands we work with were just getting started in e-commerce when we 
first met them. We use a tool we’ve developed called content health reporting 
to assess the health of their product presence online. When we ran their con-
tent health audits, we found that their products were listed for sale on sites 
like Amazon and Walmart—but not by the brands directly.
Their products were being sold online in large part by marketplace (third-
party) sellers, many of whom used poor content and listed items at prices 
that were higher than the brand actually wanted to see its products selling for, 
both of which were diluting brand equity. The first thing these brands needed 
to do was take back control of their items online by getting them listed for 
sale directly by the retailer. Most of our clients were already familiar with this 
model from their in-store work, so it was just a matter of getting their items 
set up and listed online. They had all heard horror stories about item setup—
weeks drifting into months and holiday seasons passing them by without items 
being available online. Our approach to online setup makes the process easier, 
provides more up-front validation to ensure more items are set up faster, and 
delivers visibility throughout the process.

Although retailer item setup forms have macros built in to perform data vali-
dation, the validation performed by the Content Analytics platform is more 
comprehensive, resulting in fewer items being rejected because of data issues.
What’s more, our Master Catalog product content management system makes 
it easy to upload high-quality content for newly set-up items at any time—
when the items are being set up, while they’re going through the process, or 
after they’re already listed for sale. There’s no need to have every piece of 
content ready up front; conversely, if a supplier does have the content ready 
up front, we can easily load and submit all that content immediately.
The Content Analytics platform stores a history of the items that were 
­submitted, making it easy to track down any information you need in the 
future, say, for setting up those same items on other retailer e-commerce sites. 
This avoids the problem of having important product information stored in 
hard-to-find spreadsheets. Items are searchable, and there’s complete ­history 
that’s easy to access. Plus, our built-in Is It Live reporting and alerting helps 
brands know quickly once their items are live for sale.
Be in Stock (Inventory)
Brands invest a huge amount of time and money in product development 
and marketing. Yet only bricks-to-clicks suppliers are truly disciplined about 
ensuring that all that effort doesn’t go to waste. Day in, day out, they make 
sure their items are in stock—and if they’re not in stock, they respond quickly 
to reduce the time it takes to get their items back in stock.
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers use the Content Analytics platform to combine 
web-based data and internal inventory data to identify inventory issues and 
address them quickly. This has resulted in the recapturing of millions of dollars 
in otherwise lost revenue.
In some cases, suppliers take advantage of out-of-stock alerts that let them 
know when a product has gone out of stock on a web site. In other cases, they 
provide us with their internal inventory feeds, which we then compare with 
what retailers are showing on their web sites. Often we identify disparities 
between the two, which can be quickly corrected.
Related to this, we can perform root-cause analysis to help suppliers under-
stand why they are losing the Buy Box. Sometimes it’s because of their 
items going out of stock and a marketplace seller jumping in to fill the void. 
Other times, it’s because the retailer is pricing the supplier’s item higher 
than a marketplace seller is. Either way, bricks-to-clicks suppliers stay on 
top of both out-of-stock and Buy Box issues so that they can get as many 
sales as possible.

Chapter 9 | From Bricks to Clicks to Omnichannel
146
Have Best-in-Class Product Presence  
(Content Health)
Bricks-to-clicks suppliers focus on ensuring that all of their products look 
great online. They start with Content Analytics Content Health reports to 
understand where they stand. Then they work on ensuring that all their prod-
uct detail pages (PDPs) have excellent core content—multiple high-resolution 
images; long-form, unique product descriptions; and mobile-friendly titles. But 
they don’t stop there. They add videos, provide complete product attribute 
data, and run campaigns to get their products reviewed.
Bricks-to-clicks use Content Health reports to establish a baseline. Then they 
iteratively improve until all their items have great content health scores. That 
means multiple high-quality images, unique SEO-optimized product descrip-
tions, mobile-friendly product titles, videos, and reviews. Bricks-to-clicks sup-
pliers know that many times a PDP may be the only form of merchandising a 
shopper looks at before making a purchase decision.
Hand in hand with Content Health reports are brand audits. By comparing 
content on e-commerce sites with content that suppliers provide us with 
(the “master content”), we can identify differences between the content that 
brands expect to see on their retailer partner sites and the content that’s 
actually there. Sometimes they’ve already sent content into the retailer but 
system failures have caused that content not to appear on the site. Other 
times, they have the right content, but the retailers simply haven’t updated the 
on-site content. Regardless, brands want to know when retailers don’t have 
the latest and greatest content. High returns rates are a big issue in e-com-
merce, and they’re made even worse when the product a consumer receives 
is different from the one seen in the product image on a PDP.
One supplier we work with even has us include primary image match as a core 
metric in their e-commerce Dashboard. We compare the images they supply 
us with (via an automated feed into our Master Catalog) with the images on 
e-commerce sites and identify any differences. Our image matching is sophisti-
cated enough so that we can match images with slightly differing resolutions or 
other subtle changes that make the images technically different but the same to 
the human eye (the supplier therefore considers them to be matched images).
In our goal to provide end-to-end solutions to our customers, we also provide 
complete content development services, including product descriptions, imagery, 
and video creation. That way, suppliers who simply want to hand the entire oper-
ation off and get high-quality content deployed can easily do so. Of course, many 
bricks-to-clicks suppliers bring their content creation in-house or work with one 
of their agency partners to create the content they need. Either way, the content 
health scoring system provides the basis for measuring, identifying opportunities 
for improvement, and tracking that improvement over time.

Bricks to Clicks
147
Be Priced Right (Pricing)
Often, suppliers don’t control price. But they do want visibility into it. They 
want to know whether third-party sellers are undercutting the first-party 
retailer price. They also want to know if one channel is pricing significantly 
above or below another channel. In addition to core pricing information, they 
want to know the impact of digital coupons and gift cards on final price. With 
this information in hand, they can better understand the impact of price on 
sales performance across their different channels.
Suppliers also want to monitor price because it gives them insight into retailer 
pricing strategies. For example, is one retailer consistently lowering price 
ahead of others? They want to understand how offline and online prices com-
pare—sometimes a change in one is a leading indicator of a change in the 
other. They want to be alerted if prices are out of whack—sometimes retailer 
pricing systems reprice products too high or too low and then products get 
stuck at those prices; other times, prices are configured wrong initially and 
never get corrected.
Minimum advertised price (MAP) pricing is another key area for suppliers. This 
is especially true in areas such as electronics where suppliers are concerned 
about retailers advertising products below agreed-upon prices or about unau-
thorized resellers listing items below the target price that suppliers want to 
see their items sold for in the market.
Put simply, when it comes to retail, pricing matters, and suppliers want as much 
visibility as possible when it comes to pricing across their retail customers. 
Suppliers implement Content Analytics price reporting and alerting to get the 
visibility and alerting they need to ensure prices are where they need to be.
Implement Ongoing Operational Visibility 
(Dashboard)
To run their omnichannel businesses effectively, suppliers need ongoing opera-
tional visibility into those businesses. That means a Dashboard where they 
can see all the key metrics, trend analysis to show them how those metrics 
are doing over time, and alerts to tell them when there’s an urgent exception 
that needs to be investigated. We use the acronym SPARCS to cover the key 
metrics involved.

•

• 
Content
• 
Share of search and shelf
Many suppliers encounter the same kinds of issues when they try to get this 
data. First, much of the data is simply not available using existing tools. The data 
for share of search and share of shelf can be gathered only using online report-
ing platforms such as Content Analytics. Second, with the large quantities of 
data involved, it’s hard to get all the data in one place in an easy-to-use interface.
The Content Analytics Dashboard consolidates all that data and makes it easy 
to view, export, and get alerts on. We have found that simply by measur-
ing and having visibility into these key metrics, supplier business performance 
tends to improve. Suppliers couple this visibility with a concerted effort to 
improve their key metrics, frequently achieving millions of dollars in business 
improvement as a result.
Implement Centralized Content Management 
and Syndication (Master Catalog)
Ensuring brand integrity across retailers can be challenging if done manu-
ally. Typically it takes hundreds of hours of visiting item page after item page 
and comparing the content on those pages to content stored locally. We 
make that process significantly easier via our automated brand auditing capa-
bility. Our system gives suppliers easy access to their digital assets, a way to 
run comprehensive brand audits, the ability to output those assets (such as 
product imagery and descriptions) in the individual formats required by each 
retailer, and a process for creating/producing new content assets.
For years, many suppliers have had to generate the Excel spreadsheets and 
image files required by their retailer customers by hand. Each retailer has 
a different set of requirements for content template files and image files. 
Meanwhile, suppliers are always adding more distribution channels to increase 
sales, so the seemingly simple task of ensuring brand integrity becomes expo-
nentially harder over time.
The other challenge that suppliers run into is storing and finding the imagery 
and product content assets they need. Because of mergers and acquisitions, a 
mix of internally developed and third-party systems, and other factors, digital 
assets such as images and videos and text assets such as product descriptions 
are often located in many different places. What’s more, suppliers want the 
flexibility to have digital assets developed by external agencies and by inter-
nal copywriting and media teams. They need workflow support and review/
approval/rejection capabilities.
Among the many benefits of the Content Analytics system design is that it can 
be used as a full-fledged product information management (PIM) solution or

simply as a conduit to syndicate content to retailers and convert product con-
tent to multiple output formats. We can also create digital imagery and write 
product descriptions, providing a truly end-to-end solution for our clients.
Implement an Agile Methodology + MVP
As important as it is to get the right technology in place to support your 
needs in e-commerce, perhaps the most important step in the playbook is 
adopting an agile methodology within your organization. Suppliers see speed 
as both a threat and an opportunity in e-commerce. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers 
are leveraging e-commerce to transform their organizations, enabling them to 
be more digitally focused and more nimble.
One approach that has worked particularly well for our clients as part of 
implementing an agile methodology is the use of the minimum viable product 
(MVP). Rather than implementing complex systems that take months to set 
up, they instead take a rapid, iterative approach to e-commerce. They experi-
ment frequently, looking for ways to make quick improvements while keeping 
their long-term objectives in mind. Often, small changes to their workflows, 
streamlining of workflows, and better visibility into business metrics gets them 
well on their way to where they want to be in e-commerce.
In the context of e-commerce, an MVP can refer to a variety of different 
objectives, such as a specific set of metrics to be measured, product pages to 
be improved, or response times to be optimized.
Suppliers used to buying into multiyear implementations costing millions 
or tens of millions of dollars are often pleasantly surprised at how much 
of a business impact they can make—and how quickly they can make that 
impact—using an agile approach combined with iterative definitions of their 
MVP. Bricks-to-clicks suppliers are leveraging this approach effectively to out-
pace their competition.
Looking Ahead
As we look ahead to the future of retail, there are many challenges and oppor-
tunities on the horizon. On the brand side, retailer private-label businesses 
may pose one of the largest threats to traditional brands. Amazon has been 
taking market share in various categories by introducing private-label prod-
ucts, including in speakers (Amazon Echo), baby wipes (Amazon Elements), 
and batteries (AmazonBasics).14

At the same time, suppliers who move quickly have an opportunity to carve 
out new leadership positions not only in e-commerce but across all chan-
nels. Shoppers often start the new path to purchase online, so suppliers who 
implement the most nimble approach, with the best content, have a chance 
not only to do well in e-commerce but to gain market share in-store as well. 
And always-on, always-connected is not going away. Shoppers are connected 
all the time, whether they are starting the purchase journey, making a purchase 
decision in a physical store, or even reevaluating after a purchase is complete.
The retailer side is similarly faced with challenges and opportunities. As large 
retailers such as Amazon and Walmart continue to compete head on, spe-
cialty independent retailers are emerging to target specific market segments. 
Bricks-to-clicks retailers are partnering with suppliers to bring better content, 
greater product assortment, and a better shopper experience to their cus-
tomers. They’re putting large quantities of data to work, mining that data, and 
finding new ways to drive more sales as online, mobile, and in-store channels 
collide. We expect to see many exciting innovations in the months and years 
ahead.
