About the Author
As a roving photojournalist for more than 20 years, David D. Busch illus-
trated his books, magazine articles, and newspaper reports with award-
winning images. He’s operated his own commercial studio, suffocated in formal
dress while shooting weddings-for-hire, and shot sports for a daily news-
paper and upstate New York college. His photos have been published in maga-
zines as diverse as Scientiﬁc American and Petersen’s PhotoGraphic, and his
articles have appeared in Popular Photography & Imaging, The Rangeﬁnder,
The Professional Photographer, and hundreds of other publications. He’s also
reviewed digital cameras for CNet Networks and Computer Shopper.
When About.com named its top ﬁve books on Beginning Digital Photography,
occupying the #1 and #2 slots were Busch’s Digital Photography All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies, and Mastering Digital Photography. His 98 other
books published since 1983 include bestsellers like The Nikon D40/D40x
Digital Field Guide, The Ofﬁcial Hewlett-Packard Scanner Handbook, and Digital
Photography For Dummies Quick Reference.
Busch earned top category honors in the Computer Press Awards the ﬁrst
two years they were given (for Sorry About The Explosion and Secrets of
MacWrite, MacPaint and MacDraw), and later served as Master of Ceremonies
for the awards.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks as always to senior acquisitions editor Steve Hayes at Wiley, who was
quick to see that a book about digital SLR cameras should cover both the
cameras and photography in depth. Special thanks as both an author and
avid consumer of Dummies books go out to Wiley for publishing books like
this one in full color at a price anyone can afford. Technical editor Mike
Sullivan, as usual, provided his sage advice from the viewpoint of one of the
pioneers of digital SLRs, dating back more than a decade. Mike was also quick
to come up with useful photos to illustrate particular points when my own
portfolio came up short.
More thanks to project editor Rebecca Senninger and copy editor Jen Riggs
for keeping this book looking sharp. Working behind the scenes was my
agent, Carole McClendon.

Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Introduction
T
he digital single-lens reflex (dSLR) is the great step upward for photogra-
phers who want to expand their creative horizons — or simply just get
better pictures. Whether you want to become a serious photo hobbyist, have
a hankering to turn pro, or want to take advantage of the improved control
digital SLRs give you over your photography, discovering how to use this tool
of the future should be high on your priorities list.
In the right hands, digital SLRs in the $600 to $1,000 range can outshoot the
$5,000 professional models of five years ago and are light-years ahead of even
the best point-and-shoot models of today. The dSLR provides more control
over what portions of your image are in sharp focus, boasts lower levels of
the annoying grain effect called noise, and operates fast enough to capture
the most fleeting action. If that isn’t enough, you can change lenses, too,
adding super-wide perspectives or the huge magnification possibilities of
long, long telephoto lenses to your repertoire.
Almost all the other advantages of digital photography come with your digital
SLR camera, too. You can review your image immediately, upload the photo
to your computer, make adjustments, and print a sparkling full-color print
within minutes. You never need to buy film. You decide which images to print
and how large to make them. You can proudly display your digital photo-
graphic work framed on your wall or over your fireplace. You can even make
wallet-sized photos, send copies to friends in e-mail, or create an online
gallery that relatives and colleagues can view over the Web.
About This Book
Technology and techniques — you find both in this book. Understanding
exactly how a digital SLR works can help you use its capabilities more fully.
By mastering the technology, you’re better equipped to understand how to
use interchangeable lenses, set up speedy continuous-shooting burst modes,
apply selective focus, and shoot under the lowest light levels. Understanding
how a point-and-shoot digital camera works offers you little advantage
because such entry-level cameras don’t give you the creative control that a
dSLR does.

2
Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
You don’t need to understand internal combustion to drive a Porsche, but it
helps if you know a little about double-clutching and limited-slip differentials.
Technology also provides the grounding you need to work with advanced
photographic techniques, such as the ones I discuss in this book. I fill these
pages with basic information and tips you can use to hone your skills while
you grow as a digital SLR photographer.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is written for both experienced and budding photographers who
have a good grasp of using their computers and navigating the operating
system, and at least a cursory knowledge of the operation of their digital SLR
camera. You needn’t be an expert photographer — all you need is a desire to
improve your skills and knowledge.
Because dSLRs are a more-advanced type of digital camera, you might be
making the upgrade from a conventional film SLR. At the very least, I assume
that you aren’t new to photography and have some knowledge of conventional
photography. If so, this book helps you fine-tune your capabilities.
Although most of the emphasis in this book is on picture-taking, I offer a
couple chapters on image-editing, too, so it helps if you have some familiarity
with an image editor, such as Paint Shop Pro, Ulead PhotoImpact, Adobe
Photoshop, or Adobe Photoshop Elements.
How This Book Is Organized
Organization is your friend! All the chapters in this book are grouped
together into parts that address a broad, general area of interest. If you’re
especially keen to know more about a particular topic, such as how to select
the perfect dSLR or its accessories, turn to the part that includes that mater-
ial. You don’t have to read this book in any particular order. You can absorb
each part and chapter on its own. If I explore a certain topic, such as shutter
lag or infrared photography, in more detail elsewhere in the book, I give you a
cross-reference pointing to the relevant section in case you want more back-
ground. Read in any order you like. Skim through and study the photo exam-
ples, or examine only the odd-numbered pages if you prefer. It’s your choice. I
hope that eventually you’ll wade through the whole thing, but my top priority
is delivering the information you need right now to take better photographs.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You
Find out all the advantages of digital SLRs and why they beat the pants off
both film and digital point-and-shoot cameras. Take a safari through the
innards of a typical dSLR to track down the most-needed and most-desired
features. Then, choose the accessories that will take your dSLR to the next
level.
Part II: Oh, Shoot!
Digital SLRs bristle with controls and components that give you absolute sov-
ereignty over virtually every feature and function. In this part, you work with
those controls, master the mysteries of interchangeable lenses, and discover
special features, like image stabilization.
Part III: Beyond the Basics
It’s time to take the next step and improve your photography by using more
advanced features, such as the RAW format and your dSLR’s action, sequence
shooting, and flash capabilities. Then, apply the advanced features to get
better compositions in a variety of settings.

your picture by using image-editing software. Then make hard-copy prints
you can show off, hang on the wall, or display on your mantel. This part
shows you some of the things you can do with your prize (and prize-winning)
photos.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Four (not ten) chapters are in The Part of Tens, and each provides a-dozen-
minus-two interesting things you can do to enjoy your digital SLR even more.
You discover the ten best ways to improve your photography right now, ten
fascinating things you probably never thought of doing with your dSLR, and
ten online resources with more information and showcases for your digital

 Discovering why digital SLRs are a Big Deal

 Looking at downsides? What downsides?
N
ow that you can buy a fully featured digital SLR (or dSLR) for five or six
C-notes, virtually everyone, including your grandmother, probably
knows that SLR stands for single lens reflex. However, your Nana — or you for
that matter — might not know precisely what single lens reflex means. SLR is
a camera (film or digital) that uses a marvelous system of mirrors and/or
prisms to provide bright, clear optical viewing of the image you’re about to
take — through the same lens that’s used to take the picture.
The key thing to know is that a dSLR is a very cool tool for
taking photos electronically.
Welcome to the chapter that tells you exactly how
smart you were when you decided to upgrade from
whatever you were using previously to a digital
single lens reflex camera. You find out how a digital
SLR transforms the way you take and make pictures,
why the strengths of the dSLR are important to you,
and why the few downsides really don’t matter.
Although digital SLRs have become a Big Deal, it’s not
too late to get in on the ground floor, and I tell you why.
dSLR: dNext Great Digital Camera
Surprise! Digital SLRs are now available in virtually every price range. It was
amazing when these cameras, which as recently as 2004 cost $2,000 or more,
dipped below the $1,000 price point. By 2007, dSLRs — complete with a zoom
lens — could be had for $599 or less. And resolution has been increasing dra-
matically. Today, it’s hard to find a dSLR that doesn’t have at least ten million
pixels’ worth of image-grabbing sharpness.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
So, almost anyone can afford to make the jump to a digital SLR. If you have,
you’ve discovered that the dSLR lets you take pictures the way they’re meant
to be taken. After using other film or digital cameras, avid photographers
interested in taking professional-looking photos notice why dSLRs stand out:
 You can view a big, bright image that represents (almost) exactly what
you’ll see in the final picture. No peering through a tiny window at a
miniature version of your subject. No squinting to compose your image
on an LCD (liquid crystal display) viewfinder that washes out in bright
sunlight. Nor do you have to wonder whether you’ve chopped off the top
of someone’s head or guess how much of your image is in sharp focus.
 A dSLR responds to an itchy trigger finger almost instantly. Forget
about pressing the shutter
release and then waiting a
second or two before the
camera decides to snap off the
shot. Unlike some sluggish
point-and-shoot digital cameras,
dSLRs can crank out shots as
fast as you can press the button.
 You have the freedom to switch
among lenses. For instance,
you can switch among an all-
purpose zoom lens, a super-
wide angle lens, an extra-long
telephoto lens, a close-up lens,
or other specialized optic
quicker than you can say
170-500mm F/5-6.3 APO
Aspherical AutoFocus Telephoto
Zoomexpialidocious. (Best of all,
you don’t even have to know
what that tongue-twister of a
name means!)
Just be prepared to succumb to
lens lust, a strange malady that
strikes all owners of dSLRs
sooner or later. Before you
know it, you’ll find yourself con-
vinced you must have optical
goodies, like the lens shown in
Figure 1-1, a telephoto lens
that’s absolutely essential
(you’ll think) for taking photos
of wildlife from enough of a dis-
tance to avoid scaring away the
timid creatures.
Figure 1-1: Playing with lenses, lenses, and
more lenses is one of the inevitable joys of
working with a dSLR.

If you’re ready to say sayonara to film, adiós to poorly exposed and poorly
composed pictures, and auf Wiedersehen to cameras with sluggardly perfor-
mance, it’s time to get started.
The sections that follow (as well as other chapters in this part) introduce you
to the technical advantages of the digital SLR and how to use the dSLR features
to their fullest. When you’re ready to expand your photographic horizons
even further, Parts II, III, and IV help you master the basics of digital photog-
raphy, go beyond the basics to conquer the mysteries of photo arenas (such
as action, flash, and portrait photography), and then discover how you can
fine-tune your images, organizing them for sharing and printing.
Improving Your Photography with a dSLR
The differences between digital SLRs and the camera you were using before
you saw the light depends on where you’re coming from. If your most recent
camera was a point-and-shoot digital model, you know the advantages of
being able to review your photos on an LCD an instant after you took them,
and, if you’re serious about photography, you also understand the benefits of
fine-tuning them in an image editor. If you’re switching to a digital SLR from a
film SLR, you’re likely a photo enthusiast already and well aware that a single
lens reflex offers you extra control over framing, using focus creatively, and
choosing lenses to give the best perspective. And, if you’re making the huge
leap from a point-and-shoot non-SLR film camera to a digital SLR, you’re in for
some real revelations.
A digital SLR has (almost) all the good stuff available in a lesser digital
camera, with some significant advantages that enable you to take your photo
endeavors to a new, more glorious level of excellence. Certainly, you can take
close-ups or sports photos with any good-quality film or digital camera. Low-
light photography, travel pictures, or portraits are all within the capabilities
of any camera. But digital SLRs let you capture these kinds of images more
quickly, more flexibly, and with more creativity at your fingertips. Best of all
(at least for Photoshop slaves), a digital SLR can solve problems that previ-
ously required working long hours over a hot keyboard.
Despite the comparisons you can make to other cameras, a digital SLR isn’t
just a simple upgrade from a conventional film camera or another type of dig-
ital camera. A dSLR is very different from a film SLR, too, even though some
vendors still offer film and dSLRs that look quite a bit alike and share similar
exposure metering, automatic focusing, and other electronics, as well as
interchangeable lenses. If you look closely, you find that the digital SLR
camera is different, and how you use it to take pictures is different.
In the sections that follow, I introduce you to the advanced features and inner
workings so that you can begin getting the most out of your dSLR.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Composing shots with a more accurate viewfinder
With non-SLR cameras, what you see isn’t always what you get.
Theoretically, the LCD on the back of a point-and-shoot digital camera should
show exactly what you’ll get in the finished picture. After all, the same sensor
that actually captures the photo produces the LCD image. In practice, the
LCD might be difficult to view under bright light, and it’s so small (a few LCDs
on older cameras are as tiny as 1.5 inches diagonally) that you’ll feel like
you’re trying to judge your image by looking at a postage stamp that’s gone
through the wash a few times.
The view through a non-SLR camera’s optical viewfinder is likely to be even
worse: diminutive, inaccurate enough to make chopping off heads alarmingly
easy, and with no information about what’s in focus and what isn’t.
More advanced cameras might use an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which is a
second, internal LCD that the user views through a window. EVFs provide a
larger image that’s formed by the actual light falling on the sensor and can
be used in full sunlight without washing out. However, they might not have
enough pixels to accurately portray your subject and tend to degenerate
into blurred, ghosted images if the camera or subject moves during framing.
They also don’t work well in low light levels. An EVF is a good compromise,
but not as good as a dSLR for previewing an image.
A digital SLR’s viewfinder, in contrast, closely duplicates what the sensor
sees, even though the image is formed optically and not generated by the
sensor itself. It’s all done with mirrors (and other reflective surfaces) that
bounce the light from the lens to your viewfinder, sampling only a little of the
light to measure exposure, color, and focus. As a result, the viewfinder image
is usually bigger and brighter — from 75 percent to 95 percent (or more) of
life size using a dSLR “normal” lens or zoom position, compared with 25 per-
cent or smaller with a point-and-shoot camera’s optical or LCD viewfinder.
You see 95 percent of the total area captured, too.
Check out Figure 1-2 and decide which view of your subject you’d rather
work with. Even the 2.5-inch LCD on the point-and-shoot model in the upper-
left corner is difficult to view in bright light; the electronic viewfinder in the
upper-right corner can be fuzzy, making it hard to judge focus. The digital
SLR’s big bright viewfinder (bottom) is, as Goldilocks would say, just right.
A dSLR shows you approximately what’s in sharp focus and what isn’t (the
depth-of-field), either in general terms (all the time) or more precisely when
you press a handy button called the depth-of-field preview, which is available
on many dSLRs. Your dSLR viewing experience is likely to be more pleasant,
more accurate, and better suited for your creative endeavors.

Figure 1-2: A point-and-shoot LCD (upper left) or an EVF LCD (upper right) is no match for a
dSLR’s optical system (bottom).
Flexing the more powerful sensor
Digital SLR sensors are much bigger than their point-and-shoot camera coun-
terparts, and this gives them a larger area for capturing light and, potentially,
much greater sensitivity to lower light levels.
A dSLR’s extra sensitivity pays off when you want to 
 Take pictures in dim light.
 Freeze action by using shorter exposure times.
 Use smaller lens openings to increase the amount of subject matter
that’s in sharp focus.

Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Within the Canon digital camera line
alone, you find digital SLRs with 22.2
x 14.8mm to 24 x 36mm sensors (the
size of a 35mm film frame). By com-
parison, some of Canon’s digital
point-and-shoot cameras use a
sensor that measures only 7.8 x
5.32mm. Put in terms that make
sense to human beings, the dSLR
sensors have 8 to 20 times more area
than their Lilliputian sensor-mates.
Figure 1-3 gives you a better idea of
the relative sizes.
If you think of a sensor as a rectangu-
lar bucket and the light falling on it
as a soft drizzle of rain, you see that
the larger buckets will collect more
drops (or the particles of light called photons) more quickly than the smaller
ones. Because a certain minimum number of photons is required to register a
picture, a larger sensor can collect the required amount more quickly, making
it more sensitive than a smaller sensor under the same conditions.
In photography, the sensitivity to light is measured by using a yardstick called
ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Most point-and-shoot
digital cameras have a sensitivity range of about ISO 50 to ISO 100 (at the low
end) up to a maximum of ISO 800 (at the high end). Fuji has introduced a
compact digicam with its SuperCCD sensor that includes two light-sensitive
areas per pixel, boasting an ISO 1,600 maximum sensitivity, and Olympus
introduced a model with a freakish ISO 10,000 capability. It remains to be seen
how useful these ultra-high ISO point-and-shoot models are, but in the mean-
time, most other non-SLR digital cameras top out at ISO 800. Those with higher
ISO settings generally don’t do a very good job in terms of image quality.
In contrast, digital SLRs — with their more sensitive sensors and larger light-
gathering pixels — commonly have usable ISO settings of up to ISO 1,600.
Many are capable of ISO 3,200 or even higher. There’s a downside to this
extra speed, as you see in the section “Reducing noise in your photos,” but in
general, the added sensitivity is a boon to people who want to shoot photos
in dim light, take action pictures, or stretch the amount of depth-of-field avail-
able.
Reducing noise in your photos
Noise is that grainy look digital photos sometimes get, usually noticeable as
multi-colored speckles most visible in the dark or shadow areas of an image.
Figure 1-3: These images represent the
comparative size of a dSLR’s 24 x 36mm sensor
(upper left), a dSLR’s 22.2 x 14.8mm sensor
(center), and a point-and-shoot digital
camera’s 7.8 x 5.32mm sensor (bottom).

Although you can sometimes use noise as a creative effect, it’s generally a
bad thing that destroys detail in your image and might limit how much you
can enlarge a photo before the graininess becomes obtrusive.
The most common types of noise are produced at higher sensitivity settings.
That’s because cameras achieve the loftier ISO numbers by amplifying the
original electronic signal, and any background noise present in the signal is
multiplied along with the image information. Figure 1-4 shows an image with a
relatively low ISO value of 200 that’s virtually free of the noise, but jumping
the sensitivity to ISO 1,600 produces a lot more noise — even though a
person used a digital SLR for both pictures.
Figure 1-4: A noise-free photo shot at ISO 200 (top); a noisy photo shot 
at ISO 1,600 (bottom).

Chapter 1: The Digital SLR Difference

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
One reason why point-and-shoot digicams often don’t have ISO settings
beyond ISO 800 is that the noise becomes excessive at higher ratings, some-
times even worse than you see in the bottom example in Figure 1-4. However,
you can boost the information that the bigger dSLR sensors capture to higher
ISO settings with relatively lower overall noise. I’ve used digital SLRs that had
less noise at ISO 800 than some poor-performing point-and-shoots displayed
at ISO 100. Obviously, the larger sensors found in dSLRs score another slam-
dunk in the noise department and make high ISO ratings feasible when you
really, really need them.
Noise doesn’t always result simply from using high ISO settings: Long expo-
sures can cause another kind of noise. Although some techniques can reduce
the amount of noise present in a photo (as you discover in Chapter 2), by and
large, digital SLR cameras are far superior to their non-SLR counterparts
when it comes to smooth, noise-free images.
Thanks to the disparity in size alone, all sensors of a particular resolution
are not created equal, and sensors with fewer megapixels might actually be
superior to higher-resolution pixel-grabbers. For example, most older 8-
megapixel dSLRs produce superior results to the newest 10-megapixel non-
SLR digicams. I’ve seen results from one $3,000 4.3-megapixel pro-level dSLR
that runs rings around the best images possible from an $800 EVF model with
an 8-megapixel sensor. So no matter how many megapixels a point-and-shoot
camera’s sensor can hoard, that sensor isn’t as big as a dSLR’s. And when it
comes to reducing noise, the size of the sensor is one of the most important
factors.
Reclaiming depth-of-field control
Depth-of-field is the range over which components of your image are accept-
ably sharp. In general, being able to control the amount of depth-of-field is a
good thing because having more or less depth-of-field gives you creative con-
trol over what’s sharp and what isn’t. You might prefer to zero in on a specific
subject and let everything else remain blurry. Or you might want to have
everything in your frame as sharp as possible.
To understand how dSLR cameras give you more control over depth-of-field,
you need to understand the three factors that control this range, which I out-
line in Table 1-1.

Table 1-1
How Depth-of-Field Affects Photos
Factor
How It Affects a Photo
The distance between the 
The closer your subject is to you, the greater the 
camera and the subject
tendency for the objects in front or behind the sub-
ject to be blurry.
The size of the lens opening 
Larger f-stops (smaller numbers), such as f/2 or f/4, 
(the f-stop or aperture) 
produce less depth-of-field than smaller f-stops 
used to take the picture
(larger numbers), such as f/11 or f/16. Remember:
The sizes of the numbers are reversed because
apertures are actually the denominators of frac-
tions, so 1⁄2 and 1⁄4 are larger than 1⁄11 or 1⁄16.
The magnification (or focal 
The shorter the focal length of the lens (say, 18mm 
length) of the lens
or 20mm), the more depth-of-field is present. When
the focal length grows longer (say, to 70mm or
100mm), depth-of-field shrinks.
Point-and-shoot digital cameras offer very little control over depth-of-field
because unless you’re shooting an extreme close-up (see Factor 1 in Table
1-1), virtually everything is in sharp focus (despite Factor 2). This condition
(which can be a bad thing if you’re trying to use focus selectively) is due to
Factor 3: Non-SLRs use that tiny sensor, which calls for lenses of a much
shorter focal length.
So, a point-and-shoot digital camera might have a 7.5mm to 22.5mm 3X zoom
lens that provides a slightly wide-angle to slightly telephoto field of view. A
digital SLR with the largest (24 x 36mm) sensor might need a 35mm to 105mm
zoom to provide the same perspective.
Yet, depth-of-field is dependent on the actual focal length, not the equivalent.
So that point-and-shoot camera’s lens, even at its longest telephoto position,
provides more depth-of-field than the dSLR’s same-perspective zoom at its
widest angle. So much is in focus with a non-SLR digital camera that, in prac-
tice, you have very little control over depth-of-field except when shooting
close-up pictures from very short distances.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
You can see the effect of the maximum aperture in Figure 1-5, which was shot
at a small lens opening (f/22.) Although the focus is on the building block in
the middle, all the blocks are fairly sharp. Shooting the same scene at f/5.6
shows how control over depth-of-field can be used creatively to isolate a sub-
ject (see Figure 1-6). Only the middle left red block is in sharp focus, whereas
the others are blurred. In Chapter 6, I explain depth-of-field in more detail.
Figure 1-5: A small aperture yields too much depth-of-field for 
selective focus.
Figure 1-6: A larger f/stop makes it easy to isolate a subject with creative 
application of blur.

Taking photos faster
Everything about a digital SLR seems to work more quickly and responsively.
That’s important when you want to make a grab shot on the spur of the
moment, or expect the camera to take an action photo right now when you
press the shutter release at the peak moment. Most point-and-shoot digital
cameras are downright sluggardly compared to dSLRs when it comes to per-
formance. You can find improved speed in three key areas, which I explain in
the following sections.
Wake-up time
A non-SLR digicam that can be powered up and ready to snap its first photo
in as little as two seconds is considered fast. Many take three to four seconds
to emerge from their slumber. Worse, because they consume so much power,
these cameras go into stand-by mode or shut off completely if you don’t take
a picture for 30 to 60 seconds.
When you flip the power switch of a dSLR, the camera is usually ready to take
the picture before you can move the viewfinder up to your eye. Some are
ready to go in 0.2 of a second! Digital SLRs don’t need to go to sleep, either,
because they consume so little power when not in active use. I’ve left dSLRs
switched on for days at a time with little perceptible draining of the battery.
Certainly, the autofocus and autoexposure mechanisms go on standby a few
seconds after you move your finger from the shutter release, but they’re
available again instantly with a quick tap on the button.
Shot-to-shot time
Conventional digital cameras have limits on how quickly you can take pic-
tures in succession. Unless you’re using the motor-drive-like burst mode, one
shot every second or two is about all you can expect. Even in burst mode,
you’re lucky to get much more than about 1 frame per second for 5 to 11
shots, max.
Digital SLRs have large amounts of built-in memory that temporarily stores
each photo you snap before the camera transfers it to your memory card at
high speed. You can probably take pictures in single-shot mode as quickly as
you can press the shutter release, and for at least eight to ten shots before a
slight pause kicks in. With faster dSLRs and some quality level settings, you
can often keep taking pictures for as long as your finger (or memory card)
holds out.
A dSLR’s burst mode can capture 3 to 8 frames per second for 12 to 30 shots,
depending on the speed of the camera and the quality level you’ve chosen;
lower quality (higher compression) settings produce smaller images that can
be written to the memory card faster (see Figure 1-7). No point-and-shoot
camera comes anywhere close to that level of performance.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Figure 1-7: Digital SLRs make high-speed action sequences easy.
Shutter lag
When I’ve spoken before groups promoting my other books, such as Digital
Photography All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, 3rd Edition (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.), the number one question I get from new digital photographers
is “What can I do about shutter lag!?!” This pause — between the moment you
click and the moment the sensor captures a slightly different image — seems
to be the thing that digicam owners like the least about their shooters.
Digital SLRs experience shutter lag, too, but it’s likely to be so brief — on the
order of 0.1 to 0.2 of a second — that you never notice it. That’s true only
most of the time, of course. Point your lens at a difficult-to-focus subject, such
as the sky, or try to take a photo under low light, and your speedy autofocus
lens might hunt back and forth while you gnash your teeth in frustration.
(You discover some ways around this in Chapter 5.)
A dSLR works like a camera
Another reason why digital SLRs have improved performance is that they’re
easier to use, so you, as the photographer, can work faster while you shoot.
Most point-and-shoot cameras have to be configured for consumers who are
more interested in grabbing a quick snapshot than investing some artistry in
creating a photograph.
Moreover, point-and-shoot cameras tend to be designed by an engineer who
did a really, really good job adding photo capabilities to the vendor’s cell
phone line last year, and who obviously must be the best choice to cobble
together a full-fledged digital camera. So, like a cell phone, non-SLR digital

cameras tend to have most of the controls tucked away out of sight in the
menu system, where the average consumer never has to see them and where
the photo enthusiast has to hunt for them.
Digital SLRs, on the other hand, are always designed by a team of engineers
with extensive photographic experience. They know which controls are
essential and which can be buried away in the menus because you access
them when setting up the camera and maybe once a month (if that) thereafter.
Digital SLR designers know that you don’t want to go three levels deep into a
menu to set the ISO sensitivity or adjust white (color) balance for the type of
illumination you’re using. You want to press an ISO or a WB (white balance)
key and dial in the setting without giving it much thought. You don’t want to
activate an onscreen display to set shutter speed or aperture — you want to
have separate dials for each. Nature intended zooming and manual focusing
to be done by twisting a ring on the lens — not by pressing a little lever and
letting a motor adjust the lens at its own pace.
Simply having a camera that operates like a camera instead of a DVD player
makes your picture-taking much easier and faster.
Getting more lens flexibility
With non-SLRs, the lens mounted on the camera is the one you use. Some
models have add-on telephoto and wide-angle attachments, but those acces-
sories tend to subtract a bit of sharpness even while they change the
camera’s viewpoint.
So point-and-shoot camera owners must decide at the time they buy the
camera what kind of pictures they intend to shoot. If they want to take a lot
of photos indoors or of architecture outdoors, they might need cameras with
the equivalent of a film camera’s 24mm wide-angle lens, which is still fairly
rare among non-dSLR models. (And if they need something even wider,
they’re probably out of luck.) Or, perhaps a photographer wants to shoot
sports and would like a lens that’s the equivalent of a 400mm lens on a film
camera. Those are available, too, although not, generally, with cameras that
also have wide-angle capabilities.
Digital SLR camera owners have fewer limitations. I own a 12–24mm zoom
that’s the equivalent of an 18mm to 36mm wide-angle lens. (You find out why
lenses are measured in equivalents later in this chapter.) Other lenses I own
cover every single focal length up to 500mm (750mm equivalent). I have two
lenses designed especially for close-up photography and others with fast
f/1.8 apertures that are perfect for low-light sports shooting. I’ve far from
exhausted the possibilities, either: Longer and wider lenses than what I own
are available, along with specialized optics that do tasks, such as canceling
sharpness-robbing vibration caused by a photographer’s unsteady hand.
19

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Owners of dSLR cameras don’t have to mortgage their homes to buy these
lenses, either. Camera vendors offer some very sharp-fixed focal length
lenses (prime lenses) for around $100. You’ll find inexpensive 70mm to
210mm zoom lenses for as little as $150–$200. A versatile 28mm to 200mm
zoom that I bought cost only $300. Because dSLRs can often use lenses
designed for their film camera counterparts, hundreds of inexpensive used
lenses are available, too. With a non-dSLR, if you want to expand your lens
horizons, you frequently have to buy a new camera. You find out more about
selecting lenses in Chapter 6.
Freeing yourself from image editors
Digital SLRs do more than change how you take pictures. They change how
you make pictures, as well. Perhaps you’re a seasoned image editor, accus-
tomed to cropping images in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements to mimic
the extreme telephoto perspective your previous camera couldn’t duplicate.
You might have used an image editor’s Zoom Blur feature because your digi-
cam’s zoom lens didn’t zoom fast enough to permit creating that effect in the
camera, as shown in Figure 1-8. You’ve faked fish-eye lens effects because
your camera didn’t have a fish-eye lens, or you’ve manually added lens flare
instead of trying to create the real thing.
Figure 1-8: Don’t settle for fake zoom blur when you can have the real thing.

Or, you had to blur the background of your images in an image editor
because your digital point-and-shoot camera always brought everything into
sharp focus (an excellent trait when you want everything in focus, and not so
great when you want to use focus selectively for creative effects).
Those limitations might be behind you now. A digital SLR can do lots of tricks
that you had to fake in Photoshop in the past. Image editors are still helpful
for some tweaks, as you discover in Chapters 11 and 12.
The Downsides That Don’t Matter
Of course, the digital SLR isn’t perfect — yet. I’ve found a couple downsides
to using these Wundermaschinen that range from the annoying to the almost
irrelevant. I address them in decreasing order of concern (at least for most

The lack or expense of super-wide lenses
Many high-end digital SLRs have sensors that are the same size as the 35mm
film frame, so there are no equivalency factors to calculate. A 200mm lens
provides the same magnification on a full-frame dSLR as it does on a film
camera. More importantly, a 16mm or 14mm super-wide-angle lens retains its
same wide field of view.

A closer look at shutter lag
Typically, the snapshooter can finally coax a
niece or nephew into smiling and press the
shutter release to capture the moment. Or, a
batter swings lustily at a fat pitch and lofts the
game-winning run into the stands just as the
photographer presses the shutter button.
However, the crucial moment is never captured
on pixels.
What happens instead is that the digicam’s auto-
focus and autoexposure mechanisms make
some last-minute adjustments, a bunch of elec-
tronic components process some algorithms,
and, eventually, two or three seconds later (it
seems), the camera takes the picture. This
period of time is measured in ohnoseconds;
ohnoseconds are the interval between when
you want to take the picture and when you actu-
ally hear the shutter-click sound your camera
emits. I’ve tested hundreds of digital cameras,
and the actual elapsed time for non-SLRs
ranges from 0.6 seconds to 1.2 seconds under
bright, contrasty lighting conditions, or up to 1
to 2 seconds in dimmer lighting. It just seems
even longer than that.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
More affordable digital SLRs have smaller-than-full-frame sensors (more on
that in Chapter 2), so the sensor crops the field of view of any lens you mount
on the camera, to match the smaller sensor size. The crop factor ranges from
1.3 to about 2.0 for the current, er, crop of digital SLRs. In practice, that means
that a 100mm telephoto lens mounted on one of these cameras has the same
field of view as a longer 130mm to 160mm telephoto lens on a 35mm film
camera. Because you figure the effective field of view by multiplying the
actual focal length by the crop factor, the figure is also sometimes called a
magnification factor, and this is where all the mentions of “equivalency” come
in when comparing lenses. But magnification factor isn’t an accurate term
because no magnification is taking place. The camera simply crops out part
of what the lens sees. Your 100mm lens might look like it’s been magically
transformed into a longer 160mm optic, but the depth-of-field and other char-
acteristics remain the same as the 100mm lens it really is.
Photographers who shoot sports and distant subjects often love the crop
factor, even though it gives them nothing they couldn’t have achieved just by
cropping a full-size frame. That’s because the crop factor seems to provide a
longer telephoto lens for the same money. The good news turns bad, how-
ever, when they mount 28mm wide-angle lenses on their beloved dSLRs and
find that they have the same field of view as a 45mm standard (normal) lens,
or that their favorite 18mm super-wide lenses are now 29mm ordinary wide-
angle optics. (I use a 1.6 crop factor in all these examples.) In this case, you
get a less wide view from a particular lens.
Fortunately, plenty of true wide-angle lenses are available for digital SLRs.
Three different vendors offer 12–24mm super-wide zooms for my favorite
dSLR, making it possible to shoot expansive shots, like the one shown in
Figure 1-9. Focal lengths down to 8mm to 10mm are available. None of these
are particularly cheap. If you want to shoot wide and have a dSLR with a crop
factor, prepare to spend a bit more money on lenses than you’d need to if
you’d stuck to film.
On the positive side, however, most of these accessory lenses are considerably
wider than the (current) widest-angle optics available for point-and-shoot
cameras, which seem to get no wider than the equivalent of 24mm with a tra-
ditional film camera.
Fending off dirt and dust
For some dSLR owners, the bane of this category isn’t the lack of wide-angle
lenses, but the plethora of dust bunnies and odd particles of matter that
seem to attach themselves to the camera’s sensor at every opportunity.
Take extra care when changing lenses to keep dust from wending its way
back to the sensor area (which is fully exposed only when you’re taking a pic-
ture, anyway). You also need to know how to clean this dust off your sensor,
a process that’s much easier to do than it is to describe. You find out more
about sensor cleaning in Chapter 4.

Figure 1-9: Panorama-like shots are possible with ultra-wide-angle lenses.
Some photographers have problems with dust seemingly on a weekly basis.
Others go months without any infiltrations. Dirt and dust and digital SLRs
might be a very small problem for you or might loom larger, depending on
your working habits, cleanliness, and willingness to stomp out a few artifacts
from time to time in your image editor.
Working without an LCD preview
Non-SLR digital cameras are able to offer a live preview of the image as seen
by the sensor prior to exposure. Almost all dSLRs can’t provide such a pre-
view because the mirror used to provide the optical view of the subject is in
the way. It flips up just prior to exposure. A few cameras from Fujifilm,
Olympus, and Canon (such as the Canon EOS 1D Mark III) use technologies,
such as dual sensors or a prism that splits incoming light into two paths (one
for the sensor and one for the viewfinder), to provide a “live” preview. People
who really need such a feature are delighted with this capability. But in most
cases, however, when you use a dSLR, previewing images in an LCD viewer as
well as the optical view just isn’t needed.
You’ll miss this feature in only a few cases. A digital SLR’s larger optical
viewfinder is usually a better choice for judging composition and depth-of-
field and for framing fast-moving action. The following sections cover the key
applications that could benefit from an LCD preview, if only your dSLR could
display one on its back-panel LCD.
23

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Live histograms stopped dead in their tracks
A histogram is a graph that displays the tonal range of an image and can be
used to judge whether a photograph is or will be under- or overexposed. The
trained eye can also see whether an image is likely to have excessive contrast
or look particularly flat, based on the distribution of tones in a histogram. 
You can make adjustments to lighting and exposure to improve the rendition
of a shot. Lacking a live, real-time histogram that can be viewed prior to
taking a picture (as found in most point-and-shoot digicams), the digital SLR
owner must make these decisions after the fact and adjust for the next picture.
You find more about the use of histograms in Chapter 5.
Déjà view with extended eye-points
The eye-point is the distance you can move the eye away from the viewfinder
and still see the entire image for framing. An extended eye-point is useful for
sports and other applications where you want to keep an eye on what’s hap-
pening outside the camera’s viewfinder.
A live LCD preview lets you keep the camera a few inches from your face, or
even at arm’s length, and still see what will be captured. Point-and-shoot digi-
tal cameras sometimes put the LCD on a swiveling mount so you can use it
for framing with the camera held at waist level, overhead, or even facing you
for a self portrait. Digital SLRs (except for a model from Olympus) don’t have
this kind of swivel LCD because they don’t have the live preview that would
make the capability useful.
Infrared imagery up to your imagination
Infrared photos call for a filter that blocks visible light. All you see through
the optical viewfinder is a vast expanse of black, which makes framing your
photo difficult. A live LCD preview would give you some type of image, at least.
Although this problem is annoying, you can work around it. Most people
don’t shoot infrared photos at all. A few dedicated souls have an extra dSLR
converted for full-time infrared use so that a visible-light blocking infrared
filter isn’t necessary. Those who do shoot infrared with their unmodified
cameras find that exposures are so long, a tripod is a must. If you fall into this
camp, you have two options:
 Set up your camera on a tripod, frame your picture, and then mount the
infrared filter.
 Frame the photo as best you can, take a shot, and then use the after-
shot LCD review to make adjustments, as was done for Figure 1-10.
Neither solution is very satisfactory, but the lack of LCD preview in this case
is likely to be annoying only for those who take a great many infrared photos.

Figure 1-10: You can’t preview infrared shots in a dSLR’s optical viewfinder, so the
photographer often shoots blind.
Carrying that weight
With the exception of some tiny models, such as Nikon’s latest entry-level
dSLR, most digital SLRs are much bigger, heavier, and clunkier than pocket-
sized point-and-shoot digital cameras. Fortunately, camera manufacturers
have recognized the appeal of smaller dSLRs, so you’ll find relatively com-
pact models from Nikon, Canon, Sony, Pentax/Samsung, and others.
Of course, the more you spend on a dSLR, the bigger it’s likely to be, too
because vendors offer magnesium alloy bodies instead of the composite plas-
tic used for entry-level digital SLRs. Tack on extra battery packs and special
grips that let you shoot more comfortably in a vertical position, and the
camera becomes even larger.
This “problem” is an annoyance only to someone who needs to travel light.
For most photographers, the whole point of upgrading to a digital SLR is to
gain access to the extra lenses and accessories that these cameras can use.
The extra heft is part of the cost of the greater versatility. Many dSLR owners
also purchase small point-and-shoot cameras to carry when weight and size
are important to them.

In my case, I often use a compact version of my “big” dSLR as a backup when
I’m traveling. I fully intend to take all my photos with my hefty main camera,
but I would hate to be without any camera at all in case of a mishap. So, the
compact dSLR goes in the bag, too, as backup.
Budding Spielbergs are out of luck
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras can capture motion picture clips with
monaural sound. Many offer only poor quality clips at, say, a herky-jerky 10
or 15 frames per second (fps) instead of the standard 30 fps, and resolutions
are as low as 320 x 240 or 160 x 120 pixels. You might be limited to 30- or 60-
second clips, tops. Higher-end, non-SLR digital cameras might give you virtually
TV-quality 640 x 480 resolution at 30 fps with decent sound, and recording
times as long as the available capacity of your memory card. You can even
find in-camera trimming and editing facilities.
Because a dSLR’s mirror can’t flip up and down 30 times a second (the current
fastest burst capability tops out at around 10 frames per second), you won’t
find motion picture capabilities on any dSLR that I’m aware of. That doesn’t
bother me. If I want to shoot digital movies, I take along a digital video (DV)
camcorder. If I just want a few clips, I tote an old 5-megapixel digicam that
shoots 640 x 480 clips up to 120 seconds long. Few people decide against
buying a digital SLR because they can’t also shoot movies with it.

f digital photography is the greatest thing since sliced bread, the digital
SLR is the toaster — a no-nonsense device that anyone can use to create
tasty results. Even so, you can get better results if you know a little about
how your favorite gadget works. You don’t need to understand Ohm’s Law to
make breakfast, but it’s a good idea to understand a little about a toaster’s
innards before you poke a fork inside. In the same vein, understanding pixels,
lenses, and sensors can help you get better results from your photographic
appliance.
This chapter takes you on a safari through the darkest
recesses of the digital SLR to give you a little knowledge
about how it works before you decide to poke a figura-
tive fork inside.
Megapixels and Why dSLRs 
Have More of Them
If you’ve been working with digital images for a while,
you know that pixels are your pals. They’re the basic
building blocks that make up an image. The term pixel is
a portmanteau, which was Lewis Carroll’s term for a new
word created by combining two old words, such as combining
slimy and lithe to create slithy. In this case, pixel stands for picture
element and came into vogue when computer imaging became popular.

28
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
However, you’ve seen pixel-like components outside the digital realm, in
pointillist paintings, such as the illustrations Georges Seurat created for the
Broadway musical, Sunday in the Park with George. You also see pixel-like
components in newspaper halftone photos. All these are made up of tiny dots
that you can see vividly up close, but those dots blend to create continuous
tones and colors when you view them from a distance, as you can see in
Figure 2-1. The difference between these picture elements and those used to
represent digital photos is that the digital variety is all the same size and
shape, varying only in brightness and hue.
In digital images, the pixels — tiny squares that can be seen individually only
under magnification — are arranged in rows and columns like a checkerboard
that happens to measure hundreds of squares on a side. Among current digi-
tal SLRs, this array is a minimum of 2,464 pixels wide and 1,632 pixels tall, for
a total of 4.3 million pixels in all. The latest digital SLR cameras for consumers
actually offer many more pixels than that, from 3,008 x 2,000 (6.1 million pixels)
for certain entry-level models to 3,872 x 2,592 (10 million) for the majority of
digital SLRs. Of course, “pro” cameras go up to 4,288 x 2,848 (12 million) or
4,992 x 3,328 (16.6 million), and some models with 22 to 24 million pixels are
in heavy rumor rotation while I write this book. That’s a lot of pixels!
Figure 2-1: Every digital picture is made up of thousands (or millions) of pixels.

Those counts represent the number of light-sensitive areas in the digital
camera’s sensor, and the total is usually expressed in terms of megapixels
(millions of pixels), and abbreviated MP. The precise dimensions might vary
depending on the exact sensor used. For example, the Nikon D40 uses a
3,008-x-2,000-pixel sensor, but the original Canon Digital Rebel had a 3,072-x-
2,048-pixel array. Both are considered 6MP dSLRs, even though the arrange-
ment and number of pixels is slightly different.
Pixelementary, my 
dear Watson
Pixels, represented by individual
light-sensitive areas in a sensor
called photosites, are what capture
the detail in your image. In general
terms, the more megapixels the
better because when you add pixels,
the ability of the sensor to capture
more detail improves, and the effec-
tive resolution of the sensor rises.
It’s like dividing a foot-long ruler into
1,200 increments rather than 120. In
the former case, the ruler could mea-
sure things with 1⁄100 of an inch accu-
racy; in the latter, the rulings could
be used only in 1⁄10 of an inch chunks.
In the same vein, a sensor of a partic-
ular size with 12MP can show much
finer detail than one the same size
with only 6MP.
As you can see in Figure 2-2, when the
size of the pixels decreases, more of
them can fit on a sensor to capture
ever smaller details of the original
image. However, there’s more to image
quality than resolution alone. Many
8MP dSLRs produce sharper and more
noise-free results than 10MP non-
dSLRs simply because the 8MP dSLR’s
sensors are physically larger, and each
individual pixel is better. Some dSLRs
even outperform other dSLRs with
more resolution because of the quality
of the sensors, lenses, or electronic
circuitry. The raw number of megapix-
els is only a guideline even though
more pixels are quite often better.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Deciding how many pixels your camera needs
People contemplating the purchase of a digital SLR often agonize over how
many megapixels they should buy, even though other factors, such as ease of
operation and the kind and quality of lenses available for a particular dSLR,
can be considerably more important in the long run. To a certain extent, this
agony has been (at least temporarily) alleviated. In the past year or two, a
surprising number of vendors have settled on 10MP as a basic benchmark
number.
Nikon, for example, has three 10MP digital SLR cameras — a subcompact,
basic entry-level model; an intermediate amateur camera; and a feature-packed
advanced model that’s beloved by serious amateurs and professionals alike.
Canon, too, has introduced several 10MP models, and other vendors have 
followed. It’s true that, for most applications, more resolution isn’t really
needed. But, with competitive pressures being what they are, it remains to be
seen just how long the 10MP plateau will remain the standard. (As always, I
urge those of you reading this in 2009 with your $499 14MP cameras to refrain
from laughing.)
Although more pixels usually equal more resolution and more detail in your
pictures, the number of pixels you actually need depends on several factors:
 How you’ll be using the photo: An image placed on a Web site or dis-
played in presentations doesn’t need to have the same resolution as one
that’s used professionally, say, as a product advertisement or a magazine
illustration.
 How much manipulating and cropping you plan to do: If you’ll be
giving your images quite a workout in Photoshop or if you often crop
small sections out of images to create new perspectives, you want all the
spare pixels you can muster because higher resolution images can with-
stand more extensive editing without losing quality.
 How much you plan to enlarge the image: Many people view most of
their images on a computer display or in 4-x-6-inch to 5-x-7-inch prints.
Any dSLR has enough megapixels for those modest applications. If you’re
looking to make blowups bigger than 8 x 10 inches, say, to make posters
or prints displayed on the wall, you need a plethora of pixels.
 The resolution of your printer: Most digital images are printed on inkjet
or dye sublimation devices with their own resolution specifications, usu-
ally from 300 dpi (dots per inch) to 1,440 dpi and beyond. Printers work
best with images that more closely match their own ability to print detail.

If you primarily want to create prints, the following section can help you
gauge which capabilities you need in your camera and printer so that you
can get the best output possible.
Matching pixels to print sizes and printers
If nice-looking prints are important to you, you need to pay as much attention
to your printer as the number of pixels in your digital SLR. In truth, printers
with lower resolution don’t benefit much from digital shots with high
megapixel counts. They might produce worse results because they’re forced
to discard lots of that precious detail to squeeze the picture information into
their available output pixels. You need a printer with lots of resolution to do
the best job with a high-resolution photo.
Calculating the appropriate resolution for a particular printer/image size
combination is easy. Just follow these simple steps:
1. Multiply the printer resolution by the desired width of your image to
get the number of pixels you need for an image that wide.
For example, if I have a 300 dpi printer and want an 8-x-10-inch print,
300 × 8 = 2,400 pixels.
2. Multiply the printer resolution by the desired height of your image.
So, 300 × 10 = 3,000 pixels.
3. Multiply the width in pixels by the height to get the number of pixels
you need.
Keeping with my example, 2,400 × 3,000 = 7,200,000.
4. Divide the total number of pixels by 1 million to get the number of
megapixels your camera needs to collect for the print.
Technically, that’s 7.2MP in my case, but a ballpark figure of 6MP will do.
(The 6MP camera can hold as many as 3,000 x 2,000 pixels, which gives
you a 6.67-x-10-inch print, so you can reasonably assume that a 6MP
image is just about ideal for a print in the 8-x-10-inch neighborhood.)
Using an image of this same resolution (2,400 x 3,000 pixels), you can print in
other sizes, of course, but your printer or the software that drives it must
drop or add pixels by using a process called interpolation, or resampling,
which applies intricate computer calculations to come up with a reasonably
good-looking representation of your original image at a different size.
31
Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR

32
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 Adding pixels (or upsampling): Figure 2-3 shows a highly simplified
example of how new pixels are calculated from existing pixels during
interpolation. In this case, upsampling is taking place; the two original
pixels, one black and one white,
are used to interpolate interme-
diate gray pixels. In sophisti-
cated interpolation schemes,
pixels in the rows above and
below the original pixels and the
actual colors of the pixels are
also taken into account.
 Dropping pixels (or downsam-
pling): This is basically the
same process as upsampling,
but in reverse. Based on calcula-
tions by the software, some
pixels are deleted to create the
smaller image size.
Table 2-1 shows the nominal print sizes without the need for interpolation,
for various camera resolutions at three different common print resolutions.

These native print sizes represent only the dimensions you can get without
interpolation. In practice, digital SLR cameras are capable of producing much
larger prints with very little noticeable loss of quality. A 6–8MP camera
should give you 11-x-14- to 16-x-20-inch prints that look great; a 12–16MP
camera should be good for 20-x-30-inch enlargements and beyond.
Figure 2-3: Software sees a black and a white
pixel and guesses that gray pixels are needed
between them.

Nothing’s super about superfluous pixels
If you think you can never be too rich, too thin, or have too many megapixels,
think again. There’s a dark side, too, Luke. Unnecessary pixels lead to bigger
image files, which are great when you actually need all those pixels, but are a
potential nuisance at other times. Few people have the problem of being able
to afford a camera with a resolution significantly higher than they really need,
but if you’re in that elite class, consider these caveats:
 Excess megapixels eat up your memory cards. All dSLRs store images
on solid-state memory cards. I own three cards for my 10MP camera,
each of which can store about 114 pictures in the best high-resolution
shooting mode. Most of the time, that’s plenty of digital “film” for any
day’s shooting, and I can always drop to a lower resolution mode to
stretch my memory cards further. However, if I was using another
vendor’s top-of-the-line dSLR, each of those cards would hold no more
than an old-fashioned 36-exposure roll of film. I’d have to own a lot more
memory cards to do the same work!
 Extra resolution taxes your computer. Fatter photo files take longer to
transfer to your computer and call for faster processing speeds and
extra memory to manipulate them in your image editor. That high-end
digital camera you’re lusting after might call for a high-end computer, too.
 More pixels need more storage. Very high-resolution files can be sev-
eral times larger than your run-of-the-mill high-resolution image files. If
you want to keep lots of them available on your hard drive, you need a
large disk, and probably lots of extra CDs and DVDs to archive them to
for permanent storage.
Touring through a Digital SLR
Now is the time to explore the innards of your digital SLR as a way to better
understand how to use all the nifty features your digital shooter includes. At
best, these sections give you a better handle on why, sometimes, the results
you get when you press the shutter release aren’t exactly what you expected.
At worst, you can find more convincing excuses to give when you goof.
In some ways, the basics of a dSLR have a lot in common with the conven-
tional film SLR, or indeed, any film camera. All these picture-grabbers share
some fundamental components, which I list in the general order of their
arrangement inside your camera, as shown in Figure 2-4:

Figure 2-4: Components of a digital SLR.
 A lens — consisting of one or more optical components made of glass,
plastic, or ceramic — which captures light and gathers it to a point of
focus inside the camera.
 A viewing system that lets you see what the camera sees so you can
compose your image and perform other functions, such as evaluating
depth-of-field.
 An aperture, or opening, inside the lens that you can (usually) adjust in
size so that more or less light is able to sneak through into the camera.
 A shutter or other mechanism to control how long the light passing
through the lens can expose the film or sensor.
 A light-sensitive component, either film or — with digital cameras —
the sensor, which captures the illumination admitted through the lens
by the aperture for the time duration allowed by the shutter.
 A medium for storing the captured image until it’s removed from the
camera. With a film camera, that medium is the film itself. For a digital
camera, the storage is a solid-state film card.

Some of these components for film and digital cameras, especially lenses, are
very similar. Indeed, many digital SLRs can use the same lenses built for their
film counterparts. So, in this guided tour of the dSLR, I concentrate on the
pieces and parts that are different. In the sections that follow, I explain each
component listed here.
Sensorship
After a night on the town, you might find in the morning that you’re extra 
sensitive to light. Well, a digital SLR’s
sensor is like that all the time. When
exposed to an incoming stream of the
light-bits (photons), a solid-state
sensor scoops them up into little
buckets, with one bucket for each
pixel (except for certain Fujifilm 
cameras, which I describe in the 
sidebar, “Four exceptional sensor
exceptions”).
If each bucket, or photosite, collects
enough photons to partially fill it to
an imaginary line (or threshold) seen
as a line on the side of the bucket in
Figure 2-5, that pixel registers some-
thing other than black. As more and
more photons accumulate, the pixel’s
value gets lighter and lighter until,
when the bucket is full, the pixel is
deemed to be completely white. The
intermediate tones are registered as
grays or, in color pictures, as darker
or lighter shades of a particular color.
If too many photons are dumped into the bucket, no further tonal changes
happen to that pixel, but the excess light-bits can actually overflow to adjoin-
ing pixels, causing an unpleasant effect, blooming. After the exposure is com-
pleted, the bucket full of sloshing photons is converted to ice cubes. Well, not
actually, but it might help to think of the process of analog (water) to digital
(ice cubes) conversion that way. Your computer’s bits and bytes can handle a
discrete number of ice cubes (expressed in 1s and 0s) a lot more easily than
it can work with an amorphous quantity of H20.

Figure 2-5: A photosite is like a bucket that
collects photons.

36
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
The bits are processed and then transferred to a memory card, making your
camera ready to take another picture. All this can happen in 1⁄2 to 1⁄8 of a
second or less (which explains why digital SLRs can take two to ten or more
pictures per second).
Two (count ’em), two types of sensors
Two main types of sensors are used in digital SLRs today: CCD (charge cou-
pled device) and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor)
imagers. Although each type of sensor uses different technology to capture
images, there’s no inherent quality difference between them. Some vendors,
including Sony, Pentax/Samsung, and Nikon, make great dSLRs based on
CCD technology. Fujifilm’s latest dSLR uses what it describes as a SuperCCD
sensor. But Nikon also offers dSLRs built around CMOS sensors (fabricated
by Sony), so it’s logical to expect Sony to blossom into the CMOS arena, too.
Firmly in the CMOS camp are Canon and Sigma. Note that although the
Foveon sensor used in Sigma cameras is, in fact, a CMOS imager, it’s of a spe-
cial type that I describe in the nearby sidebar, “Four exceptional sensor
exceptions.”
Both CCD and CMOS imagers use metal-oxide semiconductors (although,
apparently, the CMOS type is more complementary), and they have about the
same degree of sensitivity to light. The main difference is in what each type
sensor does with the light after capturing it:
 The CCD sensor is “dumb” to the extent that all it does is capture pho-
tons as electrical charges in each photosite/pixel. After exposure, the
charges are swept off the chip to an amplifier located in one corner of
the sensor. External circuitry converts the analog signal to digital form
and handles storing it on your memory card.
 A CMOS sensor, theoretically, is a lot more complicated than its CCD
counterpart. It includes solid-state circuitry at each and every photosite
and can manipulate the data for each pixel right in the sensor. That’s
pretty cool because it gives the CMOS sensor the ability to respond to
lighting conditions in ways that a CCD can’t. However, sweeping all the
photon information off a CMOS chip isn’t necessary; every photosite can
be accessed individually.
Piling on the components
Some interesting components are piled on top of both sensor types. These
components include

 Color filters, which give the color-blind CCD and CMOS chips the ability
to respond to various colors of light.
 Teensy microlenses that focus the incoming light onto the photosensi-
tive area in each photo site.
 A protective transparent layer that contains a special filter (an
antialiasing filter) that smooths out the incoming light signal by eliminat-
ing certain frequencies of light before they can clash. This layer also
includes an infrared cutoff filter that removes most of the IR light compo-
nent from the illumination reaching the sensor (because so-called “IR
contamination” can affect image quality and produce off-color colors).
Only the color filters are likely to be of interest to the average digital photog-
rapher because these filters make color photography possible. The sensors
in dSLRs do a fairly good job of registering the brightness in a scene.
However, these pixel grabbers are totally colorblind on their own.
So, each individual photosite is overlaid with a tiny color filter, as shown in
Figure 2-6, that renders it sensitive only to a single primary color of light —
red, green, or blue. These colors are combined to produce all the intermedi-
ate hues, such as yellow (red + green), cyan (green + blue), or magenta (blue
+ red). All three colors (red, green, and blue) added together produce white.
Your TV set and computer display use the same color system to show colors,
and any image editor can manipulate them, which is highly convenient from
the digital photographer’s standpoint.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
The (now) color-sensitive pixels are arranged in a matrix of alternate rows of
red-blue-red-blue-red-blue photosites and blue-green-blue-green-blue-green
photosites. Green gets twice as many pixels as each of the other two colors
because of the way our eyes perceive color. (Humans are most sensitive to
green light.) This arrangement is a Bayer pattern, after the Kodak scientist
who developed the process. (See
Figure 2-7.)
As you might guess, a green, red, or
blue pixel might not be lucky enough
to receive light colored its designated
hue. So, the camera takes all the
information and uses the color of sur-
rounding pixels to calculate (or inter-
polate; there’s that word again) the
most likely true color of a particular picture element. With more than six mil-
lion pixels to work with, this interpolation (called demosaicing, for any of you
terminology nerds) generally provides a pretty good representation of the
actual colors in a scene.
Understanding noise and sensitivity
You’re driving along in your convertible with the top down, wind whistling in
your ears, and the satellite radio playing some cool tunes. This is pretty
great, but it would be even better if you could hear the sounds coming out
the radio. So, you crank up the volume, only to find that you really can’t hear
the music much better. Welcome to the wonderful world of background noise.
Unfortunately, digital photography has its own equivalent background noise.
In the digital camera realm, noise is what you get when you crank up the sen-
sitivity of a sensor so it can capture the sparse population of photons that
exist under dimmer lighting conditions. This sensitivity is measured in ISO
settings, with ISO 800 being twice as sensitive as ISO 400, and ISO 400 having
double the sensitivity of ISO 200.
When you amplify the signal created by actual photons striking the sensor,
you also multiply the noise produced by random electrical charges generated
in the sensor. At lower ISO settings, the sensor simply waits until a certain
level of photons has been captured, and that number is enough to overpower
the smaller number of random noise pixels.
In a digital camera, noise is worse at higher ISO settings, at longer exposures
(because longer exposures provide more time for random pixels to be gener-
ated on their own), and in smaller pixels. I rhapsodize in Chapter 1 about how
brilliant digital SLRs are at ignoring noise, chiefly because of their larger pixels,
but remember that any digital camera is subject to this curse when you raise
the ISO enough or take pictures with an exposure that’s long enough.

Four exceptional sensor exceptions
Although the majority of sensors on the market
are plain-vanilla CCD or CMOS imagers, a few
exceptions totally mess up any attempt to gen-
eralize. These emerging technologies, none of
them currently in use in what you’d call “main-
stream” dSLRs, could fizzle out in the future . . .
or blaze a trail for exciting new ways to capture
images.
For example, Sony has developed sensors that
depart from the RGB (red, green, blue) model to
add a fourth color, a shade of blue-green that
Sony calls emerald. This RGB+E sensor technol-
ogy supposedly deals with one quirk of human
vision that changes the way we see certain red
colors. The sensor contains 25 percent each of
red, green, blue, and emerald photosites, and,
most of the time, the emerald pixels respond
more or less like the green ones to give the same
overall effect. However, the camera can use the
additional information gathered to correct those
maverick red colors when they pop up.
Foveon has developed a special kind of CMOS
imager that doesn’t use the Bayer filter pattern
at all. Instead, it has three separate photosen-
sitive layers, one each for blue, green, and red
(stacked in that order). During exposure, each
pixel absorbs the blue light first (if present), then
green, and finally red while the photons work
their way through the layers. No interpolation is
required, and each color of light can be
detected by each and every pixel. Although
Foveon technology sounds pretty cool (and it
is!), some kinks still need to be worked out, not
the least of which is that the highest-resolution
Foveon sensors to date, used in Sigma dSLRs,
have only about 4.6MP of resolution. You could
argue that 4.6MP without interpolation equals
14.1MP with interpolation (and Sigma does!),
but that isn’t necessarily the case.
Fujifilm stirs up the pot with its SuperCCD SR
sensor, which uses two octagon-shaped photo-
sites per pixel to capture images. One is rela-
tively large and highly sensitive to light over a
relatively narrow range. If you use buckets as
an analogy for sensors, these high-sensitive
photosites are containers with a wide mouth but
a fairly shallow depth, so they can capture only
a few different levels of photons before they fill.
However, Fuji mates each high-sensitivity pho-
tosite with a smaller one that’s lower in sensi-
tivity that can capture copious different levels
of light (think narrow mouth, deep container).
The information from both photosites, which is
arranged in the standard Bayer pattern, can be
used to capture images with lots of detail in the
inky shadows, bright highlights, and everything
in-between.
Finally, Nikon introduced a radically different
type of CMOS sensor called LBCAST (short for
Lateral Buried Charge Accumulator and
Sensing Transistor array) in 2003, but it has been
used (to date) only on the pro-level Nikon D2H
and D2Hs cameras. When compared with other
types of sensors, LBCAST requires reduced
power, produces images with less noise (grain),
has improved processing speed (giving the D2H
models the fastest continuous shooting speeds
of any Nikon model), and better color reproduc-
tion. These cameras are a favorite among
sports shooters — even though their resolution
tops out at 4.3 megapixels. But don’t be fooled.
Many pros swear by the image quality of these
LBCAST cameras, preferring the output over
that of many higher-resolution models.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Digital cameras can remove much of the noise caused by long exposures
by taking a second, blank frame after the first picture is exposed and then
comparing the two. The camera can see which pixels appear in both versions
and remove those that appear to be noise. Figure 2-8 shows a long exposure
plagued with noise (left) and another interior photo in which the noise has
been silenced with the dSLR’s noise reduction feature.
Figure 2-8: Too much noise (left) and a much quieter photo (right).
You find more about noise reduction in Chapter 11.
The bits that control exposure
You need to understand the controls that adjust the exposure. What’s expo-
sure, you ask? A picture’s exposure is nothing more than the amount of pho-
tons available for capture by the sensor. A good exposure requires exactly
the right number of photons captured. Too few, and the image doesn’t regis-
ter at all. Too many photons, and the photo is overexposed.

As you might guess, if a lot of light is bouncing around a scene, a large
number of photons can illuminate the sensor in a very brief time. If the light
is dimmer, it might take longer for enough photons to reach the sensor. The
important detail to remember is that for any given scene, an ideal exposure
exists — one that provides just the right number of photons to capture the
image.
Your digital SLR’s exposure system is designed to improve your chances of
getting that ideal exposure, either by adjusting the length of time the sensor
is allowed to suck up photons or by modifying the number of photons that
reach the sensor in any particular instant. You make these adjustments by
using the camera’s shutter speed and lens opening/aperture controls, which I
describe in the following sections.
Your exposure time machine
Of course, in a digital SLR, the sensor isn’t exposed to incoming light all the
time. Instead, it sees photons for a brief interval, dubbed the exposure time,
usually measured in fractions of a second. The exposure time can extend for
many seconds in the case of a time exposure.
The gatekeeper that controls these time slices, a sort of exposure-time
machine, is the shutter. The shutter can be a mechanical device (usually a
curtain in front of the sensor that opens and closes very quickly) or an elec-
tronic mechanism that activates the sensor for a specific instant of time.
Digital SLRs might have both, using a mechanical shutter for exposures mea-
sured in seconds from about 1⁄180 to 1⁄500 of a second and an electronic shutter
for exposures in the 1⁄500 to 1⁄8,000 of a second range.
Longer shutter speeds let in more light but can produce blurring if the sub-
ject or camera moves during the exposure. Shorter shutter speeds cut down
the amount of light admitted, but they also reduce the chance that movement
causes blurriness.
An aperture is a lens opening is an f-stop
You can control photons by using the lens aperture (or the f-stop). The 
aperture is the size of the opening through which the photons pass. You can
think of an f-stop as a pipe: Larger pipes let more light flow in a given period
of time, and smaller pipes restrict the amount of light that can pass. The
aperture is a clever little adjustable mechanism that uses a sliding set of
overlapping metal leaves to create an opening of the desired size, as shown
in Figure 2-9.
41
Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR

42
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
To get the right amount of light for an exposure, you need to choose the right
f-stop. To choose the right f-stop, it helps to understand three confusing facts
about f-stops:
 F-stops seem to be named wrong. That is, f/2 is larger than f/4, which is
larger than f/8. When the numbers get larger, the amount of light an
aperture can admit gets smaller.
 F-stops don’t seem to be properly proportioned. An f/2 opening lets in
four times as much light as f/4, and f/4 admits four times as much as f/8.
You’d think numbers like two,
four, and eight would represent
double (or half) as much — not
four times.
 F-stops use all these weird
intermediate numbers that do
represent halving and dou-
bling the amount of light
passed by the aperture.
For example, between f/2 and f/4
is f/2.8, which is exactly twice as
large as f/4 and half the size of
f/2. The actual sequence of f-
stops, each half the size of the
previous aperture, is this:
f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11,
f/16, f/22, f/32
What’s going on here?
Everything becomes clear when you realize that f-numbers are actually
denominators of fractions that represent the size of the aperture opening,
just as  1⁄2,  1⁄4,  1⁄8, or  1⁄16 represent ever-smaller quantities. So f/11 allows your
camera’s sensor to collect more light than f/16 because  1⁄11 is a bigger number
than  1⁄16.
Two of one, half a dozen of the other
As far as the camera is concerned, f-stops and shutter speeds are equivalent.
Cutting the shutter speed in half produces the same effect on exposure as
using an f-stop that cuts the size of the lens opening in half. An exposure that
is twice as long is the same as one exposed for the same length of time but
with an f-stop that’s twice as large.
Figure 2-9: Overlapping metal leaves create
various sized lens openings.

So, if your camera’s exposure system suggests an exposure of 1⁄500 of a second
at f/8, you could reduce the exposure to 1⁄1,000 of a second (half as long) at f/8,
or get the exact same exposure at 1⁄500 of a second at f/11 (with the aperture
half as wide).
Similarly, various combinations of f-stops and shutter speeds can produce
the same exposure value. An exposure of 1⁄500 of a second at f/8 is the same as
1⁄1,000 of a second at f/5.6 (halving the shutter speed, but doubling the size of
the lens opening), whereas 1⁄250 of a second at f/11 (twice the shutter speed,
but half the size of the lens opening) is the same, too. Although these recipro-
cal relationships might be confusing at first, they always seem natural after a
few weeks using a camera.
Taking time out for viewing
Strictly speaking, your camera’s viewfinder isn’t part of the exposure
process. It does have an important role, however, because the dSLR’s viewing
system is, with lens interchangeability, one of the reasons why people lust
after these cameras in the first place.
Non-SLR digital cameras generally use an LCD on the back panel to provide a
real-time image of what the sensor is seeing. This LCD view is often coupled
with an optical viewfinder window that you can also use to frame the image,
which is particularly handy under bright lighting conditions when the back-
panel LCD is washed out. Some cameras, called EVF (electronic viewfinder)
models (which might physically resemble dSLRs even though their lenses
can’t be changed), have a second LCD inside, which you can view through a
window. This EVF is easier to see in bright light.
At present, the most popular digital SLRs don’t offer LCD previews in any
form (except for a handful of specialized cameras). Instead, light admitted by
the lens is bounced by a system of mirrors or prisms to a viewfinder window,
making it possible to see exactly what the sensor sees. When it’s time to take
the picture, the mirror in a typical dSLR swings out of the way, blanking the
viewfinder for a fraction of a second while the light is directed to the sensor
to make the exposure.
Compared to the tiny LCD or optical view offered by non-SLRs, the big,
bright optical display of a dSLR is easier to use to compose, evaluate
focus, and judge how much of the image is actually sharp, as shown in
Figure 2-10.

Figure 2-10: Digital SLR viewfinders show lots of information along with the big, bright view of your subject.
Through the looking glass
All cameras form their images by grabbing light through a lens, a series of
precision-made elements of glass, plastic, or ceramic. The components are
arranged to gather the light and focus it onto the film or sensor at a certain
distance, called the focal length. Fixed-focal-length lenses, or prime lenses,
always produce the same magnification. Other lenses have elements that can
shift around in particular ways to change the magnification over a certain
range. These are called zoom lenses. One of the coolest things about dSLRs is
that you can remove a particular lens and replace it with one that provides a
different zoom range or has other useful capabilities, such as the ability to
focus extra close.
Inside the lens is a diaphragm that can dilate or contract, much like the iris of
the eye, to change the size of the aperture. These f-stops not only control the
amount of light reaching the sensor, but affect the amount of an image that’s
in focus. Smaller f-stops provide larger areas of focus (called depth-of-field),
and larger f-stops offer a smaller sharp focus range.

The distance of the lens elements from the sensor also controls the overall
focus of the picture. You can adjust focus manually by twisting a ring on the
barrel of the lens itself or automatically by using tiny motors inside the lens.
Some lenses have additional motors that move the elements in response to
camera shake or movement, producing a useful vibration reduction or image
stabilization effect. I explain more special lens features in Chapter 3.
Storage
The very first electronic cameras of 30 years ago stored images on tape
recorders! Fifteen years later, the $30,000 digital cameras that a few daring
professional photographers used stored their photos on a bulky hard
drive that had to be tethered to the camera by a cable. Today, you’re
much better off because you can use tiny solid-state devices called flash
memory to store your photos until you can transfer them to a computer for
permanent archiving. A dSLR’s storage has two components you want to be
aware of:
 The buffer: Your digital SLR takes the bits siphoned out of the sensor
and conducts them to a special high-speed type of internal memory
called a buffer. Thanks to the buffer, you can continue taking photos
while the camera deals with transferring the most recent pictures to the
film card.
The size and speed of the buffer determines how many pictures you can
take in a row. Digital cameras generally let you take 5 to 30 shots consec-
utively, and have continuous shot (burst) modes good for 2.5 to 10
frames per second for as long as the buffer holds out. A faster, larger
buffer is better.
 Memory card: Memory cards have their own writing speed, which
determines how quickly the card can accept images from the buffer.
There’s no standard measurement for this speed, so you can find
memory cards labeled 40X, 80X, 120X, 133X, Ultra, or Extreme.
Most of the time, however, card speed limits your shooting only if you’re pho-
tographing sports and want to take many pictures in a row. The rest of the
time your dSLR is probably a lot faster than your trigger finger.
Digital SLRs today generally use either CompactFlash (CF) or Secure Digital
(SD) memory cards, as shown in Figure 2-11. They’re mostly equivalent in
speed, cost, and capacity, although SD cards are smaller than their CF coun-
terparts. You’ll also find miniature hard disk drives with the CompactFlash
form factor. A few cameras use xD cards or, with an adapter, Sony Memory
Stick Pro Duo cards.
45
Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR

46
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Figure 2-11: Memory cards come in a variety of capacities.
In recent months, the cost of flash memory has plummeted, which is great for
users of digital cameras because the reduction in cost came at the same time
that the basic resolution specifications for digital SLRs increased from 6MP to
10MP and beyond. More megapixels bring a need for larger capacity memory
cards. Today, you can purchase an 8GB CompactFlash card for about half
what a 4GB card cost a year or more ago, even if you purchase one of the
upscale “speedy” models with faster write speeds. It’s painful to realize that I
paid $150 for a 1GB card for my first dSLR, and now can buy several cards
with 4 to 8 times as much capacity for half that price!
If your dSLR uses Secure Digital (SD) memory, check out any cards with
capacities of 2GB or larger to make sure they’re compatible with your camera
and your memory card readers. Some older cameras and other devices don’t
accept 2GB or larger cards at all. To alleviate the problem, a new format,
SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) has been developed for capacities of
4GB to 32GB, but it works only with products that are explicitly SDHC com-
patible. Most recent dSLRs that use SD-type memory, such as the Nikon D40,
D40x, D80, and Pentax K10D, include support for the newer type of memory.
Overcoming Quirks of the dSLR
If you’re entering the digital SLR world from the realms of film cameras or
non-SLR digital photography, you’ll note some significant differences that can
only be called quirks. They’re idiosyncrasies of the dSLR that you must 
compensate for or grudgingly put up with. Some might even drive you crazy.
The following sections offer some advice for contending with these quirks.

Out, out damned spot: Cleaning the sensor
Every time you remove your dSLR’s lens to replace it with another, you could
be admitting tiny specks of dust that might, if you’re unlucky, find their way
past the shutter when it opens for an exposure, and thence onto the sensor.
It might take a few weeks or a few months, but eventually, you’ll end up with
artifacts on your sensor.
You might not even notice this dust because it’s most apparent when using
the small f-stops that produce the largest range of sharp focus. (I explain why
in the section, “The bits that control exposure,” earlier in this chapter.) If you
take most of your pictures at f/8, f/5.6, or larger, any dust on your sensor
might be blurry and almost invisible. In addition, if the dark dust spots
happen to fall into dark areas of your image, they’re masked.
So, if you own a digital SLR, you can plan on the need to clean your sensor
from time to time. It’s not particularly difficult, and cleaning kits are available
at camera stores and online. Some tips to remember include
 Point your camera downward when changing lenses to reduce the
amount of dust that infiltrates.
 If possible, change lenses only in relatively clean environments.
Do not attempt to clean your sensor with canned air, compressed air
blowers, lens cleaning liquids, or other methods that seem to make
sense but which can damage your sensor. Use only bulb blowers and
swabs intended expressly for sensor cleaning.
 If you have any doubts about your ability to clean your sensor yourself,
let your local camera shop or the manufacturer to it.
Multiplication fables: Working around the crop factor
As I mention earlier, many digital SLR cameras use a sensor that’s smaller
than the 35mm film frame even though they typically use lenses that were
originally designed for full-frame cameras. The smaller sensor, in effect, crops
out part of the image, so you’re using only, say, 75 percent of the area pro-
duced, as shown in Figure 2-12. When you use a 100mm lens, say, only the
center area is imaged by a smaller sensor, capturing an image with the same
field of view as a 150mm lens.
47
Chapter 2: Safari Inside a dSLR

48
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Figure 2-12: A wide-angle shot (upper left) loses its wide perspective due to the 1.5X crop
factor (lower right).
This effect is sometimes called, inaccurately, a multiplication factor or lens
multiplier because you can represent the equivalent field of view by multiply-
ing the focal length of the lens by the factor. In truth, no multiplication is
involved. A 100mm f/2.8 lens used on a camera with a 1.5 multiplier is still a
100mm f/2.8 lens and provides the exact same image. It’s just being cropped
to a smaller rectangle by the camera. The correct terminology is crop factor.
Common crop factors with today’s dSLRs are 1.3X, 1.5X, 1.6X, and 2X. A camera
that provides a full-frame image, with no cropping at all, is sometimes said to
have a 1X crop factor.

The crop factor affects your picture-taking in two ways:
 Your telephoto lenses seem to be magically converted to much longer
focal lengths. A 200mm telephoto lens becomes a 300mm telephoto
lens; a 400mm-long lens is transformed into a 600mm super telephoto
lens. Of course, your results would be identical to those you’d get taking
the same picture with a full-frame camera and cropping the image, but
it’s a convenient fable even so.
 The view of wide-angle lenses is cropped so that they no longer take
in as much of your surroundings as they would on a full-frame
camera. A nice, super-wide 20mm lens on a camera with a 1.6X crop
factor has the same field of view as an ordinary 32mm wide-angle lens. A
useful 35mm wide-angle lens view, like the one shown in the upper left in
Figure 2-12, becomes the mundane 56mm normal lens perspective, as
shown at lower right. The crop factor means that, to get a true wide-
angle view, you have to purchase expensive, ridiculously wide lenses,
such as the popular 12mm–24mm lenses offered by Nikon, Sigma, and
Tokina.

W
hen you upgrade from your first digital camera to a digital SLR, the
stakes increase dramatically. A dSLR generally costs quite a bit more
than the average point-and-shoot digital camera, so you want to make the
right purchase the first time. You also want to buy into a camera product line
that has all the accessories you’ll want to buy in the future. Owning a very
cool digital single lens reflex is little comfort if you can’t find that special
external electronic flash you need or an underwater housing you absolutely
must have.
The high stakes extend into the future, too. The dSLR you buy
now will grow when you add lenses and other accessories,
and you’ll want to use those same add-ons with what-
ever camera eventually replaces your current pride
and joy. SLR camera buyers have known for years
that it’s easy to get locked into a particular camera
system, so selecting the right camera today is a little
like choosing a spouse. If the photographic marriage
doesn’t last forever, starting over with a new mate
can be expensive and full of heartache.
This chapter helps you choose your ideal dSLR now
and ensures your future happiness.
Features for Now and the Future
Some have said that once, in the 1950s, a world-famous photographer was
preparing to shoot a portrait of an important business executive. The captain
of industry watched him set up and made conversation by observing proudly,
“I see you use a Leica. So do I.” Cracking a faint smile, the famed lensman
replied, “I see your secretary uses a Royal typewriter. So does Hemingway.”

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
The best camera in the world can produce mediocre pictures in the hands of
a clumsy photographer. Conversely, a creative mind can produce stunning
images when armed with the simplest of cameras. Figure 3-1 is far from a
stunning photograph, but I took it with a $200 point-and-shoot camera and a
pair of $10 high-intensity desk lamps for illumination. I didn’t use any fancy
close-up or macro lenses. You don’t need an expensive camera to take good
pictures.
Of course, you don’t have to tie one hand behind your back to make sure you
concentrate on composition and capture the decisive moment. So, consider
the full range of available features when choosing your camera, recognizing
that you might not be able to justify them all right now. Divide the features
you’re considering into these three categories:
 Features you need: These are the capabilities you really must have for
the kind of photography you do. Perhaps you shoot in low light levels
and require a fast lens that lets you grab images without flash. Or, you
specialize in sports photography and must have a dSLR with a 3–4 fps
shooting rate or better. If you plan to shoot a lot of time-lapse photogra-
phy, you probably want a camera that can take pictures while powered
by AC current and tethered to a laptop computer. Make a list of your
must-have features and keep them in mind when searching for your ideal
camera.
 Features you want: These are the features that aren’t absolutely essen-
tial for the majority of your photography, but which could come in handy,
or which might expand your picture-taking opportunities. Odds are
you’ll consider how much extra you have to pay to get these features.
You might want to take wildlife photos without a tripod, so the availabil-
ity of long lenses with built-in image stabilization features could be nice.
Still, if you can’t afford such a lens, you could probably get by almost as
well with a good tripod (despite the extra weight to lug around). Your
nice-to-have features aren’t deal-breakers, but they can tilt your prefer-
ences from one camera line to another.
 Features you wish you could get but can’t (yet): A few capabilities are
totally out of your reach either because they’re too expensive or not
available for the camera models you’re considering. Deposit these fea-
tures in the What Ifs category: These features just might filter down to
you someday — perhaps more quickly than you think. Perhaps you want
image stabilization built into the camera itself so that just about every
lens you own gains anti-shake capabilities. If that’s what you want, you’ll
find it in an increasing number of cameras, including Sony Alpha and
Pentax models.

photography.
Breadcrumbs on the Upgrade Path
The ability to upgrade your dSLR in the future can be tempting, like alluring
breadcrumbs sprinkled on the path through the dark woods of the future.
You can plan now to make sure these crumbs haven’t been gobbled up by the
time you choose to add to your own dSLR system.
The following tips can help you choose a camera with great upgrade potential:
 Look at how particular vendors have handled the evolution of their
lens systems when they’ve added features. The Pentax line of dSLRs is
capable of using KA and K mount lenses, older Pentax screw-mount
lenses dating back decades, and even some lenses intended for medium
format cameras if you have the proper adapter. The latest Nikon dSLRs
53
Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
(except for the entry-level Nikon D40 and D40x) can use virtually any
Nikkor lens dating back to 1959, although some require slight modifica-
tions. (The D40 and D40x can autofocus only with lenses having built-in
focusing motors.) Of course, automatic metering and focusing aren’t
possible in all cases for very old lenses built before these features were
invented! Although all Canon EF-series lenses work fine with any EOS
camera (film or digital), the company’s EF-S-series lenses must be used
only on the latest consumer-oriented dSLR Canon models, such as the
EOS 20D/30D/40D or later, and the Digital Rebel/Rebel XT/Rebel XTi.
 Explore how well a vendor supports its older model cameras and
flash units. Vendors are continually improving their dedicated electronic
flash units. As a result, the latest speedlights might not be compatible
with newer or future cameras. Some might not function with full
through-the-lens metering, but can be operating in semi-automatic
modes with exposure-measuring cells built into the flash itself. Others
might not be usable in wireless mode without special adapters. For
details on using electronic flash, see Chapter 9.
 Figure out which filter size fits the most lenses. This is especially true
before making an investment in polarizers, infrared filters, and close-up
lenses that can be fairly expensive. A film SLR I worked with for many
years used the same size filter on nearly all its lenses, so I could safely
buy as many of these screw-on accessories as I wanted. I knew they
wouldn’t become obsolete when I added a new lens. Today, vendors
might offer lenses that use a bunch of different size filters. You might
own one lens that takes 62mm filters, another that calls for 67mm add-
ons, and a third that takes 72mm accessories. You might find that the
clearest upgrade path is to buy the largest filters and then adapt them to
other lenses by using step-down rings, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: You might be able to use one set of filters on several different lenses with adapter
rings.

Cameras of Today and Tomorrow
Only a few years ago, dSLR cameras came in only one category — expensive.
You could expect to spend at least $5,000 for a digital SLR from Canon, Nikon,
or Kodak, and be thankful the camera was that affordable. After all, it wasn’t
long ago that digital SLRs cost upwards of $30,000, used a tethered 200MB
hard drive, and gave you 1.3-megapixel photos!
Of course, dSLRs of the late 20th century were built on rugged professional
camera bodies, and they housed very expensive sensors. The Kodak DCS 460
of a decade ago was basically a common Nikon body with a very, very costly
6MP imager built in. Although some digital SLRs that cost as little as $2,000
(for the body alone) made an appearance, it wasn’t until the original Canon
Digital Rebel was introduced in 2003 at less than $1,000 (with lens) that the
new category of basic consumer dSLR was born.
Although the distinct camera categories that I cover in the following sections
have some overlap, these categories are still aimed at particular classes of
buyers.
Basic dSLR cameras
The basic dSLR is the newest type of digital camera with interchangeable
lenses. These cameras are stripped-down versions of more advanced digital
SLRs, aimed specifically at photographers who are looking to step up from
point-and-shoot models, but who don’t necessarily want full-fledged systems
with all the bells and whistles. Typical cameras in this class include the Nikon
D40, Nikon D40x, the Pentax/Samsung models, and the original Canon Digital
Rebel, which remained in the line even after the Rebel XT/XTi were intro-
duced. A typical compact basic dSLR is shown in Figure 3-3.
Priced at around $600 with lens, basic dSLRs compete directly with the more
expensive point-and-shoot, non-dSLR cameras in the same price and megapixel
range. The point-and-shoot cameras might have noninterchangeable zoom
lenses with a longer range (12:1 or more) while offering a smaller and lighter
package that’s more portable.
I tend to avoid calling basic dSLRs “entry-level” models because that implies
a tendency to move up and beyond the original dSLR to more advanced cam-
eras, lenses, and accessories. In practice, a surprising number of buyers of
these cameras are perfectly happy with the capabilities they have and may
stick with their new dSLRs for years. Many of them never buy another lens.
They get great results with their basic dSLR and its kit lens and have no inter-
est in upgrading. I think it’s terrific that vendors have recognized this impor-
tant type of snapshooter and have provided affordable cameras with the
features casual photographers need.

Chapter 3: Tracking the Ideal dSLR

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Figure 3-3: Basic dSLR models boast very low price tags but lots of useful features.
The advantage of a $600 dSLR over a comparably priced point-and-shoot
camera is usually faster operation and better image quality (even when
matched in the megapixel department), plus the ability to exchange lenses.
Those who never plan to buy additional lenses find the quality of the non-SLR
adequate, and people who don’t shoot demanding subjects, like sports, are
happy with the point-and-shoot models, especially the models that offer a bit
of manual control. Both groups prize the pocket size of point-and-shoot cam-
eras and will actually pay more for an extra-tiny shooter. But, more serious
photographers will take a basic dSLR at the same price every time.
Of course, these basic dSLR models do lack a few features that their more
advanced brethren have — but, boy, are they affordable! You might be happy
with one of these as your main camera or as a second camera body, particu-
larly if your budget is tight.
What do you give up? Most of the basic dSLRs sacrifice a few features that
you might never or rarely use. These include depth-of-field preview, shutter
speeds faster than 1⁄4,000 second, or the speediest continuous shooting bursts.
Some of the cost-saving measures add some inconvenience: Your basic dSLR
might have only one command dial, so you’d need to press a button to switch
between setting the shutter speed and aperture. Many skip the traditional
top-panel monochrome LCD (liquid crystal display) status display and show
all shooting information on the color LCD on the back of the camera. Or, the
budget model might use only SD (Secure Digital) memory cards, rather than
the CompactFlash cards found in most upscale dSLRs.

Still, what you give up to save several hundred dollars might be insignificant
if it means you can get behind the wheel of an honest-to-gosh dSLR today.
Entry-level enthusiast dSLRs
What I think of as entry-level enthusiast dSLRs are a step up from the most
basic models and provide a true launching point for avid photographers who
need to get into digital SLR shooting at minimal cost, but insist on plenty of
opportunities for enhancing their capabilities later with new lenses, flash
units, and accessories.
These dSLRs start at about $800 (often including a basic zoom lens) and
range to about $1,200. These models include the Nikon D80, Canon Digital
Rebel XTi, Pentax K10, and Sony Alpha DSLR-A100 (as shown in Figure 3-4).
These cameras don’t sacrifice many features; the corners are cut in ways that
probably don’t affect the typical photo enthusiast. For example, cameras in
this class often are built around rugged polycarbonate bodies rather than the
almost-indestructible magnesium camera bodies found in upscale cameras.
The viewfinder systems might use pentamirrors that are a little dimmer than
the pentaprisms found in pro cameras, and magnification through the view-
ing system might be lower. It’s common for these dSLRs to have much less
sprightly continuous shooting modes, too.
Figure 3-4: True entry-level enthusiast dSLRs start at less than $1,000 and have a full set of
features.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
For anyone who could never justify spending $1,800 or more on a dSLR, these
models offer just about every needed feature with enough megapixels to pro-
duce very high-quality pictures, indeed. They form an excellent foundation
for building an arsenal of lenses and other accessories that remain useful
even when the photo enthusiast upgrades to a newer model in the future.
Prosumer dSLRs 
The next step up is the prosumer models, which are cameras intended for
more-experienced, advanced consumers/amateur photographers, but outfit-
ted with enough features to make them attractive to professionals as a
second camera body. Indeed, some pros who have light-duty shooting
requirements (perhaps because their work is more contemplative and they
don’t fire off thousands of shots a day) use them as primary cameras.
Prosumer dSLRs start at about $1,200 (for body only) and range to about
$2,500. These models include the Nikon D200, Fujifilm FinePix S5 Pro, and
Canon EOS 30D/40D.
Like entry-level enthusiast cameras, these cameras trim a few features to
achieve their affordable cost and may use plastic bodies rather than the
almost-indestructible magnesium camera bodies found in the pro cameras.
They might lack built-in vertical camera grips and easy plug-in remote con-
trols that professionals require. They’ll typically fire off fewer shots in burst
mode, typically from 3–5 fps, whereas pro models usually have 8–10 fps 
capabilities.
Professional dSLR models
Although some models are priced in the $3,000 range, most professional
dSLRs set you back 5 to 8 grand. If you’re selling your work, the camera is
well worth the cost. Cameras in this class include the Nikon D2xs, Canon
EOS-1D Mark III, Canon EOS 5D, and Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II. These models
take you all the way from 12MP up to a lofty 16MP (or beyond) and can,
arguably, meet or exceed the image quality of the best film cameras.
What do you get for thousands and thousands of extra dollars? Here’s a quick
checklist of what your extra cash buys:
 Tank-like reliability: Okay, I really have no experience with how reliable
tanks are, but they must be pretty good if being “built like a tank” is a
positive. Pro dSLRs have metal bodies, excellent sealing against the ele-
ments, and rugged controls and components like shutters that can be
operated thousands of times without failing. A typical professional might
shoot more pictures in a day than an amateur photographer takes in a
year. I know one canine photographer (he’s not a dog; he photographs
them) who recently passed the 500,000 exposure mark with his pro
camera and its original shutter. Professionals can’t afford to have a

camera wimp out at the worst possible moment. So, many of these cam-
eras are purchased for their ruggedness alone, and even then true pros
commonly buy multiple bodies in order to have a backup or two or three.
 Faster operation: Pro cameras generally have the most advanced auto-
focus systems available from a vendor, so they can take pictures right
now without delay or shutter lag. They have large internal memory
buffers to suck up exposures as fast as you can take them, and the
speedy digital image chips process the bits and bytes and then write
them to your memory card. Exposure systems, too, are top-notch, both
in accuracy and speed. Professional dSLRs are veritable speed demons.
 Faster burst modes: Whereas prosumer dSLRs are considered speedy if
they can capture continuous-mode pictures at 3 fps, pro cameras typi-
cally can grab 4 to 10 fps without sweating. Those big memory buffers
(to store images until they can be written to the memory card) and
digital signal processing chips make this speed possible.
 More options: Pro cameras let you set up multiple sets of shooting para-
meters and recall them at the press of a button, so you can tailor your
camera’s operation to particular environments. You might find other
choices not available to lesser cameras, such as the ability to save images
in compressed or uncompressed RAW format, TIFF, and multiple levels
of JPEG quality. (You find out more about file formats in Chapter 8.)
 Bigger sensors: Some pro cameras offer larger sensors, which can be an
advantage to pro shooters. These sizeable sensors are available from
Canon; several models are offered by Kodak (before they were discontin-
ued); and there are a few so-called medium-format dSLRs, such as those
from Mamiya and Hasselblad. In the case of the Canon and late, lamented
Kodak models, the cameras used traditional 35mm-camera-style lenses but
imaged on a sensor that was the same size as a full 35mm frame. A chief
advantage of this was the ability to use any existing 35mm camera lens
with no lens crop factor applied. (Chapter 2 explains lens crop in detail.)
dSLR-like cameras — a fading star?
A strange thing happened after the first low-cost digital SLR cameras
emerged onto the market. The cameras positioned at the former high end of
the amateur/photo enthusiast market were suddenly described as “SLR-like.”
These cameras happened to be priced about the same as the new dSLRs but
didn’t have interchangeable lenses. They did have a form of through-the-lens
viewing that lesser point-and-shoot cameras lacked, so they became “SLR-
like.” What’s the story here?
In their time, cameras sporting internal electronic viewfinders (a miniature
LCD inside the camera) were the next best thing and were all that serious
photographers with limited bank accounts could afford. Their viewing sys-
tems were far superior to the optical viewfinder windows that supplemented
rear-panel LCDs in point-and-shoot cameras. You could use these electronic
viewfinders (EVFs) to compose your shots accurately even in bright sunlight

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
and, with luck, monitor depth-of-field. Many of them were designed with real
controls, including zoom rings, rather than the motorized gadgets and but-
tons the point-and-shoot cameras used.
Justifying EVF cameras’ existence in these days of $500-neighborhood dSLRs
is tough. Some manage to live on by providing features you can’t get in cam-
eras with interchangeable lenses, such as a fixed 18X zoom (the equivalent of
28mm to 504mm) or ISO settings up to ISO 10,000. But most EVF cameras are
more “SLR-ish” than “SLR-like.” Table 3-1 lists some of their advantages and
disadvantages.

If you’re reading this book, you’re probably irreconcilably biased toward a
digital SLR. However, an EVF camera you already own or can pick up at a rea-
sonable price can make a good spare camera or a fall-back camera for when
taking your dSLR is undesirable or impractical.
Checking Out Key Features
When you approach your final purchase decision, look at the individual fea-
tures of the cameras you’re considering and how they affect you. I cover
most of the main topics in the following sections in more detail in Chapter 2,
and Chapter 7 has information on special features. The following sections
summarize what you need to know.
If you make a list of features and divide it into three categories, as I explain in
the section, “Features for Now and the Future,” earlier in this chapter, this list
can help you decide which camera best suits your needs.

Lenses
The ability to swap optics is the reason why the word lens is so important in
the abbreviation SLR. Some factors to consider when choosing a camera
include
 Lens quality: Are the lenses of a particular vendor known for their qual-
ity, both optically and mechanically (which is known as build quality)?
Does this vendor offer multiple lens lines with economy lenses that
might be a little less rugged but affordably priced, as well as pro-style
lenses with the ultimate in sharpness and ruggedness? Depending on the
type of photography you do, trading off a little weight and replacing a
few metal parts with tough plastic might be important. Or, you might
require lenses that can take punishment and still deliver sparkling results.
 Focal length ranges: Some vendors are stronger in the telephoto lens
department and weaker when it comes to providing wide-angle lenses.
Canon, for example, sells an amazing array of long lenses, many with
built-in image stabilization, and offers them at amazing prices. Nikon has
some exquisite wide-angle lenses. Some vendors do a better job with cer-
tain kinds of zooms than others. Make sure that the vendor of the camera
you’re contemplating offers lenses in the focal lengths and maximum
apertures you require. If not, see
whether you can fill in the lenses
you require from third-party ven-
dors, such as Tokina, Tamron,
and Sigma. These manufacturers’
optical offerings might be com-
pletely satisfactory — or they
might not. It’s best to see
whether the lenses you need are
readily available at a price you
can afford. Figure 3-5 shows a
typical lens that’s often used as
basic optics for Canon dSLRs.
 Special features: Focal lengths,
zoom ranges, and maximum
aperture aren’t the only features
you want in a lens. You might
need close focusing, fast auto-
focus (which is partially depen-
dent on the design of the lens),
or the ability to control the out-
of-focus areas of an image.
(Nikon, for example, has a line of
DC lenses that are great for por-
traiture because you can control
how the defocused areas look.)

zoom range but also has built-in anti-shake

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Sensors and image processors
The sensor and digital signal processor has as much effect on your final
image as the lens does, so be sure to check out the qualities of your dream
camera’s imager very carefully. In particular, look into the following:
 The amount of noise it generates at low ISO settings (ISO 100 or ISO
200) and at higher ISO settings (ISO 800 and above): Some photographers
like the lower noise produced by the prosumer Canon digital cameras
compared to that of competing Nikon dSLRs. Others find the Canon
images so smooth they look plasticky and prefer the extra sharpness
and texture of the Nikon sensor. Chapter 11 tells you more about noise.
 The sensor’s dynamic range: Is there detail in both shadows and high-
lights? Are colors accurate? Do the images look sharp? If you answered
“no” to any of these questions, you probably need to keep looking for
the right camera.
CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) and CCD (charge 
coupled devices) sensors show little difference in quality these days, but sig-
nificant differences exist among sensors from different vendors. Do some
comparisons now so you’ll be happy with your camera later.
Exposure systems
Exposure systems range from simple spot metering, to center weighted, to
complex evaluative systems that examine a huge matrix of points to arrive at
the correct settings. Often, all three systems dwell in harmony together in
one camera. To better understand exposure systems and how they can affect
your work, check out Chapter 5 before you select your camera.
Focusing systems
The focusing system of a dSLR is partially dependent on two factors:
 The mechanisms built into the lens, which move the lens elements to
the proper position at the camera’s direction.
 The electronics in the camera that evaluate the contrast of the image to
decide exactly where the correct focus point is.
That’s complicated stuff! Yet, if your image is out of focus, odds are that your
picture is totally ruined. You can often partially or fully correct for improper
exposure. Color-correction tools in an image editor can fix bad white balance.
You can crop your photos to remove extraneous subject matter. But if your
image is badly out of focus, you should end its suffering by pressing Delete.

You definitely want a camera with an efficient autofocus system, one that
focuses accurately. You sometimes need to specify what point the camera
should use as the point of focus, especially when your main subject is not in
the center of the viewfinder. It’s a good idea to be able to specify that the
camera locks focus when you press
the shutter release halfway down, or
that it can continue to seek a focus
point for moving subjects right until
the instant of exposure.
You might appreciate a camera that
can predict where the focus point will
be when a moving object is racing
towards or away from the camera.
You might want the ability to switch
quickly to manual focus by using a
switch — either on the lens or on the
camera body — as shown in Figure
3-6. Some kinds of photography, par-
ticularly macro photography, work
best when the photographer has 
complete control over focus.
Special features
Digital SLRs are rife with special features. There are enough of them, in fact,
that I devote all of Chapter 7 to describing things like extra-fast burst modes,
anti-dust features (which literally shake the debris off your sensor before it
can appear in your images), image stabilization, time-lapse photography, and
so forth.
If you have specialized needs, you might have special requirements. For
instance, if you like to photograph the progress of blossoming flowers or con-
struction, you might require the ability to connect to a computer, as shown in
Figure 3-7. Or, perhaps you’ve discovered that the vibration of the flip-up
mirror in an SLR spoils your critical close-up or telephoto shots, and you
want a camera with preshot mirror lock-up. Maybe you want to be able to
instantly transmit your photos to a laptop computer for immediate review by
an assistant. If infrared photography is your most important application, you
need a camera that’s especially sensitive to infrared illumination.

Figure 3-7: A USB port (bottom socket) allows you to connect

If you do have special needs, pay particular attention to how well your poten-
tial new digital camera fills them. Nothing is more frustrating than having a
hard-to-fulfill requirement while owning a camera that’s just a little less than
what you require in that department.

emember how cool it was to pick out your school supplies every August
before classes began? You got to choose the exact notebook and paper
you wanted. You likely selected your pencils and book covers with the greatest
of care. If you’re younger than I am, you probably spent a lot of time deliberat-
ing over which Trapper Keeper to get. If you’re my age, the big deci-
sion was which quill pen to buy. If you own a digital SLR, you
can experience the same joy of buying school supplies —
but all year ’round!
That’s because one of the best things about dSLR
cameras is that they’re almost infinitely expandable.
Hundreds of different lenses are available, of course,
but that’s another whole level of accessorization.
I’m talking about add-ons that let you focus closer,
operate your camera more efficiently, hold your
camera steady for long exposures, or do things that
you otherwise couldn’t do at all.
I’m sure you already know about some of the accessories
in this chapter. Some are a bit more obscure, though. Only a
few of them, such as memory cards, are absolutely essential for
taking photos. However, you might take comfort in knowing that so
many tools are available if you want them. This chapter shows you some of
the basic items to consider.

66
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Memory Cards in a Flash
Most digital SLRs are furnished without any memory card at all, so you need
to buy one as soon as you get your camera. Of course, even entry-level point-
and-shoot digicams frequently come without a card, too, or are furnished
with a useless small-capacity card, so this omission comes as no surprise.
Whereas low-end cameras come with no card to save costs, more sophisti-
cated cameras (like a dSLR) lack a memory card because it’s highly unlikely
that the vendor knows exactly what kind of card you prefer. By not including
any memory card at all, your camera vendor is upholding your right to
choose the card that exactly suits your needs. So, when choosing a memory
card for your digital SLR, here are the key factors to consider:
 Type: It behooves you to buy the type of card that fits your camera. For
most cameras, you choose either flash or miniature hard disk, and
because mini-hard disks are on their way out, you should choose flash.
 Write speed: Perhaps you shoot a lot of sports and want to use only high-
speed memory cards that can suck up bursts of shots as quickly as you
can take them.
 Capacity: With most dSLRs, a 512MB card is almost useless because of
its low capacity. Who needs a card that holds as few as 40 RAW shots?
You might not want to bother carrying around any card smaller than
1GB or 4GB (as shown in Figure 4-1) in capacity. 
 Form factor: This is one fact
or you usually don’t need to
consider — unless you have a
camera that accepts more than
one type of media. Maybe 
your digital SLR accepts both
CompactFlash (CF) and Secure
Digital (SD) memory cards. 
A few do, and at least one
camera accepts both SD cards
and xD Picture Cards, and Sony
dSLRs have traditionally accom-
modated both CompactFlash
and Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo
cards (using an adapter for the
latter).
In the following sections, I explain the three main considerations (type, write
speed, and capacity) in more detail.
Figure 4-1: A memory card with at least 4GB of
capacity is suitable for most digital SLRs.

Choosing between flash memory and hard disks
Most memory cards use solid-state flash memory to store information. Also,
a limited number of cards are actually miniature hard drives, descended from
the original microdrives developed by IBM and eventually taken over by
Hitachi (and now also offered by Seagate).
In the old days, microdrives were relatively cheap, compared to flash
memory, often providing 4 to 8GB of storage for about half what solid-state
CompactFlash cards cost. Today, flash memory may even be less expensive
than mini hard drives, and although some users swear by them, the micro-
drives sometimes don’t quite stack up against flash memory:
 Drives are generally slower and require more power than flash memory
cards.
 Some dSLRs can’t use microdrives at all.
 You can’t find any solid data on the reliability of these drives, but like
any hard drive, they’re likely to be less rugged than a solid-state card.
From reading photographer forums and newsgroups, I’d guess that reliability
is lower; I’ve seen many reports from users of hard drives failing right out of
the box or after a short period of time. Dead-on-arrival flash memory cards,
on the other hand, seem to be comparatively rare. Keep in mind that only the
folks with problems are likely to complain publicly, so there might be millions
of happy microdrive users.
Unless some amazing technological breakthroughs happen, I fully expect mini
hard drives, like EVF (electronic viewfinder) cameras, to become a niche
product or fade away entirely.
The right write speed
Memory cards operate a little bit like hard drives in the sense that some of
them can write data faster than others. Although cards don’t have the rotat-
ing platters that hard drives have, they do have electrical properties that
limit the speed with which they can accept and store information.
Real-world write speeds typically range from about 0.75MB/second to about
8MB/second, and they depend greatly on the speed of your digital camera.
That is, a particular card might be usable at 3MB/second in one camera and
at 8MB/second in another that does a better job of writing information
quickly. However, the speeds are proportional: A card rated as a better per-
former works faster in all the dSLRs it is used with, regardless of the actual
speed, and regardless of the type and size of the file being written.
67
Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR

68
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Fast memory cards can help if your digital SLR has a small buffer that can hold
only a few shots. The faster your card can accept images, the more quickly you
can resume shooting. Some digital single lens reflex cameras can’t shoot and
write at the same time, so this can be critical. For more info about memory
cards, check out Rob Galbraith’s Web site (www.robgalbraith.com).
Finding the key to the (capa)city
You must weigh technical, cost, and practical considerations when choosing
memory card capacity:
 Technical: Some older dSLRs can’t use memory cards (neither solid-
state nor microdrive) with capacities of more than 2GB because they
aren’t compatible with the file system used for larger cards. (Check with
your vendor in case a firmware update fixes this.) You might find some
4GB cards with a switch that transforms them into a pair of 2GB cards-
in-one, but this is a poor solution. If your camera is limited to 2GB stor-
age, that’s the largest you should buy.
 Cost: If a 4GB card costs more than twice as much as a 2GB card, it isn’t an
economical buy — unless you really need a 4GB memory card rather than
several modules of other sizes, like those shown in Figure 4-2. If you must
have the higher capacity to keep from switching cards often, or if you plan
to upgrade to a
higher resolution
dSLR in the future
and want to use the
same cards, you
might be willing to
spend more per giga-
byte for the compo-
nents you buy now.
As I write this, 4GB
cards cost almost
exactly double the
2GB versions; 8GB cards cost twice as much as 4GB modules, but 16GB
cards are roughly three to four times the cost of their 8GB counterparts.
 Practical: Some photographers are nervous about putting all their photo
eggs in one basket. They fear having a card failure or, more commonly,
losing the card altogether. Using a smaller number of higher-capacity
media does put you at risk of losing a chunk — or even all — of your
vacation to Paris if something bad happens. Only you can weigh the
risks. However, as you see in the following section, you can take steps to
minimize picture loss.
Figure 4-2: A selection of memory cards lets you
keep your photo eggs in multiple baskets.

Storing Your Images
You don’t keep your images stored on your flash memory cards for very long.
The first chance you get, copy them to your computer’s hard drive for
reviewing, editing, and printing. The second chance you get, copy them to
more permanent storage for archiving. So, backup media is high on your list
of accessories for your dSLR.
Exploring options for backup media
The most common way to store images is on CDs or DVDs. All commercial
computers built today, even laptops, have some sort of CD or DVD burning
capability.

Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR
The eggs/basket myth
Memory card capacity doubles, and prices drop
by half with amazing regularity. Any time digital
photographers start to make the transition from
one common size to the next larger size, doom-
sayers come out of the woodwork warning
against putting all your photo eggs in one
basket. The same folks who are saying it’s fool-
ish to use a single 8GB memory card instead of
two 4GB cards (or even four 2GB cards) were
panicking over the thought of storing their
images on one of those new-fangled 1GB
memory cards instead of the 256MB versions
only a few years ago.
The fact is, unless you’re using a camera that
accepts more than one memory card at once
and you write each picture to both cards, you’re
always storing your pictures in a single “basket”
until you choose to back it up. The chief variable
is how many pictures you’re putting at risk, and
the nature of the peril. Using more memory
cards increases your chances of accidentally
formatting one or damaging another. With
CompactFlash cards, it’s actually more common
to damage the camera through over-frequent
insertions/removals than to lose images to a
faulty card. Nor do memory cards work perfectly
until they’re full and then mysteriously fail. It’s
just as likely that a 4GB card becomes corrupt
after, say, 2GB of photos as it is for an 8GB card
to flake out after 2GB of images have been
stored. Your risk is identical in either case.
Would you insist that your family drive in two
cars to each destination? How many people are
riding in each car? How likely is a traffic acci-
dent in your location? Obviously, the risks are
impossible to assess. Each photographer should
realize that malfunctioning memory cards are
also exceedingly rare, and each must decide for
himself or herself how many images can be
comfortably exposed to such a minuscule risk.
In my day-to-day shooting, I use the largest
memory cards I have to avoid needless swaps
(which would cause me to “lose” pictures I
couldn’t take during the switch-over). When I
travel or shoot any kind of once-in-a-lifetime
event (such as a wedding), I back up my photos
on the spot — to two backup devices. I don’t
care how many baskets I must use, as long as I
take good care of those baskets.

You can also purchase standalone battery-operated burners and hard drives
(dubbed personal storage devices, or PSDs) with 20–40GB of storage to offload
your images while you’re traveling. Some prefer the portable DVD burners
over the PSDs because the hard drive solutions are subject to the same poten-
tial problems that any hard drive can suffer. Non-rewriteable optical media
that’s verified when originally written
should remain readable for at least
long enough to copy it to additional
backup discs when you return. I like
the PSDs (see Figure 4-3) because
they’re much more compact than
DVD burners and have proven reli-
able enough for my needs. (When I’m
being especially careful, I take along
two PSDs, or a laptop and a PSD, and
then back up to both.)
If you own an Apple iPod, consider buying one of the card-reader adapters
available from several vendors. You can use these to copy your images to
your iPod. Then you can transfer them to your computer later. The only prob-
lem with the iPod solution is that transfer is very, very slow, and uses up a lot
of your MP3 player’s power in a very short time.
Creating image archives that last
According to the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST), current
DVD/CD technology is suitable for archiving images for “tens of years” at a
minimum.
Of course, not just any media will last that long. Nor should it need to. Within
10 to 20 years, a newer, better storage medium likely will come along, and
you’ll be able to transfer all your image files to that medium just as you
copied your floppy-disk files to CD when floppies faded from use.
To improve your chances of retaining your priceless images for the ages, you
need to use media that resists the rigors of aging and protects your discs
from rough handling, heat, humidity, and direct light. Although rewritable
CDs and DVDs are fine for temporary storage, for archiving images you’re
better off with write-once CD-R and DVD-R/DVD+R media rather than the
RW/+RW variety. And, because dual-layer DVDs are still a new technology,
you’re probably best to avoid them, too. Although they have double the
capacity, they currently cost more than twice as much, and so aren’t quite as
economical for backup, either.
Of course, CD-Rs and DVD-R/DVD+Rs aren’t necessarily permanent, either.
The organic dyes, like the dyes in color film and papers, change over long
periods of time as part of a natural process that can be accelerated when
they’re exposed to high temperature and humidity. These dyes are also sensi-
tive to UV (ultraviolet) illumination and fade on exposure to direct sunlight.
Figure 4-3: Personal storage devices (PSDs)
are standalone hard drive backup units.

In the case of CDs, the technology is fairly stable, so after you locate a name
brand that purports to have the permanence you’re looking for, you can gener-
ally stick with it. The technology for recordable DVDs is a little more fluid
because vendors regularly increase the recording speed of the media with more
sensitive dyes, and they switch to double-layer systems to boost capacity.
Even the worst optical media lasts a year or two if treated gently. After a period
of time, a few bits here and there are lost while the disc degrades. You might
not even notice, at first, because error correction routines can usually recon-
struct limited amounts of unreadable data. When a disc starts developing
uncorrectable errors, the end is near. For tips on keeping your discs in good
shape, see the nearby sidebar, “Maximizing the life of your CDs and DVDs.”
Filtering Factors
Filters are those glass or gelatin disks or squares that are affixed to the front of
your camera’s lens, changing the light that passes through the lens in some
way. Filters were really popular before the advent of digital photography
because some of the effects you could get with them weren’t possible (or easy)
to achieve in the darkroom. I own dozens of them, including a complete set of
decamired color-correction filters, which many of today’s photographers have
never heard of.

Maximizing the life of your CDs and DVDs
By taking a few precautions, you can avoid
losing your archived images unnecessarily
through age. Here’s the regimen to follow so you
get the most from your CD or DVD archives:
 Don’t flex or bend your discs, and store them
vertically in a cool, dry area as much as
possible.
 Never use a solvent-based marking pen in
the data area. The safest place to jot infor-
mation about your disc is in the clear center
area around the hub.
 If you use labels, make sure they adhere per-
fectly. Irregularities, such as bubbles, can
imbalance the disc and cause tracking areas.
 If you must remove dirt or fingerprints from
the read side of the disc, use a CD or lens
cloth and wipe in straight lines out from the
center. Never use a circular motion or
wood-based products, such as facial tissue.
You can use isopropyl alcohol, clear water,
or soapy water to clean a grimy disc, but
never use acetone or antistatic agents.
 Make multiple copies of your photo discs
and store at least one copy offsite.

Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
Things to do with ND filters
You can do a lot of amazing things with a neutral
density (ND) filter, including rendering objects
invisible! All ND filters decrease the amount of
light reaching the sensor, so you need to use a
longer exposure than you would without the
filter (or let your camera adjust the exposure for
you automatically). Here are the key applica-
tions you’ll want to take advantage of:
 Use the large f-stop you prefer. Sometimes,
there’s too much light to use the large f-stop
you want to work with (in order to reduce
depth-of-field). Some dSLRs have ISO set-
tings no lower than ISO 200, so in bright sun-
light, even a 1⁄4,000 of a second shutter speed
means that the largest f-stop that you can
use is about f/4. Add an ND2 or ND4 filter,
and f/2.8 or f/2 is available to you.
 Use the slow shutter speed you want.
Perhaps you want to get the classic blurry-
water effect possible when photographing a
flowing stream at a slow shutter speed while
the camera’s mounted on a tripod. At ISO 200,
using f/22 gives you a shutter speed of 1⁄100 of a
second under bright sunlight. If, as is likely,
your mountain stream isn’t in bright sunlight,
it’s still unlikely you can use a shutter speed
any longer than about 1⁄30 to 1⁄15 of a second. 
An ND filter can give you the half-second to
several-second exposures you need for truly
cool-looking water effects, like the one
shown in the following figure, which I further
enhanced in Photoshop.
 Make moving objects vanish. The moving
cars and people in your scene distract from
the image of the building you’re trying to cap-
ture. No problem. Use an ND8 or heftier neu-
tral density filter (stack several filters if you
need to), mount the camera on a tripod, and
shoot an exposure of 30 seconds or even
longer. Unless a traffic light halts traffic, it’s
unlikely that any individual person or vehicle
will be in the image long enough to register.
If you have enough ND filter power at your
disposal, this trick works in full daylight, so
you can create your own ghost town.
 Balance the sky and foreground. In most
scenes, the sky is much brighter than the
foreground. A split ND filter, with the dark
portion rotated so it’s on top, can even out
the exposure for the two halves, making
those washed-out clouds visible again.

Glass and gelatin filters are less used today among casual photographers
because you can achieve many of the effects they provide within Photoshop.
Yet, not all filtration effects are possible in the digital darkroom. 
Here’s a description of the most essential filter add-ons:
 Infrared: Many digital SLRs are capable of taking photographs by using
only infrared illumination, which produces a spectacular effect out-
doors. You can get dark skies, vivid clouds, and ghostly white trees in
your landscape shots and strange, pale complexions with your pho-
tographs of humans. 
However, you must buy an infrared filter that blocks visible light and be
prepared to shoot at slow shutter speeds (because very little light is left
for the exposure). Also, you can’t preview your shot (because an SLR
viewfinder turns black when an infrared filter is mounted). For more on
infrared photography, see Chapters 7 and 15.
 Polarizers: Polarizing filters, like the one shown in Figure 4-4, can reduce
the glare bouncing off shiny surfaces in your photos. Simply attach the
filter and rotate it until the glare disappears. These filters can also help
deepen the contrast of the sky from certain angles.
Be certain to buy a circular polarizer rather than a linear polarizer for
your dSLR. (All polarizers are round; circular refers to the way in which
the filter handles light.) Circular polarizers don’t interfere with the auto-
exposure mechanism of your camera as linear polarizers can.
 Neutral density: The third kind of filter that every digital SLR photogra-
pher should own is a neutral density (ND) filter, so called because it
blocks light but is neutral in color. ND filters come with various assigned
filter factors, such as ND2 (reduces the light by one f-stop), ND4 (reduces
light two f-stops) and ND8 (cuts down three f-stops). 
As with most filters, they can be stacked to combine the effects of more
than one, as long as the additional filters in the pack aren’t so thick that
they become visible in the image, thereby cutting off corners. (This is
called vignetting.) Neutral density filters also come in a split variety — the
top half (or bottom half or one side, if you rotate it) has neutral density,
and the other half is clear.
 Special Effects: Lots of different filters produce special effects, including
star-like points on highlights, prisms, special colors, and so forth. All the
leading filter vendors offer these, but the 140 spectacular filters offered
by Cokin (www.cokin.com) are in a class by themselves. Check them
out. If you’re interested in making your own filters, flip to Chapter 15.

Figure 4-4: Polarizing filters can reduce glare in many situations.
The Tripod: Your Visible Means of Support
One way to tell the casual photographer from the serious photographer is the
size of the tripod he uses. (Snapshooters don’t have any tripod at all and are
probably none the worse for it.) Casual photographers rarely shoot the
longer exposures that need help from a tripod, and the lenses of their digi-
cams aren’t long enough to require a tripod’s steadying influence. That’s all
for the better because photographers who aren’t serious photo enthusiasts
are likely to purchase flimsy tripods that don’t do what they’re supposed to
in any case.
When a shooter evolves into a photo enthusiast, the real value of a tripod
becomes evident. The first step is to spend $100 on a “really good” tripod,
which will turn out to be not so really good after all. However, the money isn’t
totally wasted because experience with inadequate tripods provides a valu-
able education that comes in handy when it’s time to buy the real thing.
You know you’ve met a serious photographer when she unfolds a beautiful
work of art made of carbon-fiber or magnesium alloy, topped with a quick-
release grip-ball head that allows her to pivot the camera in any direction in
seconds. Such a tripod is likely to be larger and steadier than the amateur
jobs (which frequently have tell-tale leg braces because they need them) but
still weigh a lot less thanks to the exotic materials used in its construction.
Although a really good tripod can cost $500 (don’t gasp; I wanted to say $800,
but didn’t think you’d believe me), it can be a once-in-a-lifetime investment.

I bought my own tripod when I was in college, and it’s served me ably ever
since. If enough people buy this book, I’m planning to replace it with a new
one, but only because current tripods have a few features my original one
doesn’t have, and, built of carbon fiber or basalt materials, weigh about
75 percent less.
Putting a tripod to good use
A tripod is much more than a three-legged camera stand. They can do a lot for
you and let you take pictures you couldn’t get otherwise. Their key uses are
 Holding the camera steady: If you need a long shutter speed for a pic-
ture in dim light, a tripod reduces the loss in sharpness from camera
shake. Notice I said reduces. You might still have camera shake when
using a tripod if the tripod itself is unsteady or is jiggled during the
exposure. A steady camera is essential when shooting longer exposures
in dim light or when using a telephoto lens, which magnifies vibrations
along with your image. Few people can hand-hold a camera for 1⁄30 of a
second or slower with a normal or wide-angle lens. Fewer can get good
shots at a shutter speed slower than the reciprocal of the effective lens
focal length — for example, 1⁄300 of a second with the equivalent of a
300mm lens (which might actually be a 200mm lens before a 1.5X crop
factor).
 Serving as a camera stand: Perhaps you want to get in the picture, too,
or do something else besides stand behind the camera while the photo’s
taken. Even if the shutter speed will be high enough that you won’t need
the tripod’s steadying influence, the tripod fixes the camera in one place
long enough for you to take the picture with the self-timer, a cable
release, or a remote control device.
 Providing precise, stable positioning: A tripod lets you frame a shot
exactly and then take several pictures with the same framing. This capa-
bility can be useful for landscapes, portraits, or any other shot that you
want to be repeatable. Stability is almost essential for close-up pictures
when precise depth-of-field or focus considerations come into play.
 Keeping the camera level for multiple shots in a panorama series:
Some tripods can be fitted with a panorama head that can help you pro-
vide the precise positioning and proper overlap for these photos.
The chief disadvantage of tripods is that you have to carry them along when
you need them, and sturdy-but-lightweight tripods can be expensive. An
alternative is to use a tripod substitute, which can vary from a simple clamp-
like device, to beanbags, to monopods.
75
Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR

76
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
I always, without fail, carry my
tripod clamp in my bag (see Fig-
ure 4-5). And most of the time, I
carry along a monopod, too. I have a
170mm–500mm zoom lens that I like
very much, but I find that it’s virtu-
ally impossible to use without, at the
very least, a monopod. At 500mm
(750mm after applying the crop
factor), I’ve detected visible camera
shake in my photos even when using
a 1⁄2,000 of a second shutter speed. Who
wants to jump up to ISO 1,600 to be
able to get a decent aperture while
freezing camera motion, when a
tripod or monopod lets you do the
same thing at ISO 400 or ISO 800?
Choosing a tripod
The thing that all tripods have in
common is that they have three legs
(if they have only one leg, they’re
monopods). Some tripods can also
have only two legs, but that’s
because their third leg is removable
and can be used as a monopod.
Ordinarily, they’re one or the other
because a bipod has very little prac-
tical use. Here are some considera-
tions for you to think about:
 What you see and what you get: Tripods always look nice in the cata-
log, but what’s shown might include several optional components that
you don’t get unless you order them with your tripod. For example,
higher-end tripods tend to come as a set of legs only, with a center
column that cranks up or down to extend the height of the tripod
beyond what you get from extracting the legs. If you want a tripod head
to attach your camera to, it might be $100 extra (don’t wince; I wanted
to say $200–$300, but I held back for your sake). Other necessary parts,
including quick-release plates that help you mount and dismount your
camera speedily, it might be shown but cost more.
Figure 4-5: A tripod clamp allows you to use
any handy stationary object as a support.

 Leg style: The legs might be cylindrical, cylindrical but flat on one side,
open-channel, or some other shape. They might open from three to five
different sections. The more sections, the more compact the tripod is
when folded up, but the smaller the inner sections have to be to fit
inside the others. The important thing is that the legs are as sturdy as
possible when extended. They shouldn’t bend or flex, and the extended
tripod shouldn’t sway in the breeze.
 Leg height: Your tripod should extend to at least eye-level without the
need to crank up the center column (which is best used only for minor
height adjustments, when you require the absolute maximum height, or
if the column swivels and can be used to vary the shooting angle). My
own tripod goes up much higher than that, so I need to stand on a
ladder or stool to use it at its maximum height. That’s great for shooting
photos from a higher vantage point. At the other end of the scale, you
want some way of shooting from low angles too, which can be accom-
plished by retracting the legs of a tripod with multiple sections or by
swiveling or reversing the center post.
 Leg lock and positioning:
Check out the method used for
locking and unlocking the legs
and note the range of move-
ment available. The best
designs let you lock or unlock
all the sections of a particular
leg simultaneously rather than
one at a time, as shown in
Figure 4-6, and they allow you to
position the legs at independent
angles so you can use your
tripod on uneven ground.
 Use your head: The head is the
part you attach your camera to. The most common type is the pan/tilt
head that allows you to pan the camera on one axis and tilt it on
another. Fluid heads have a long handle that you can twist to release the
head so you can pan and tilt simultaneously. Increasingly popular are
joystick and ball heads, which let you tilt the camera at any angle.
 Fast release: Some heads come with quick-release plates or can be fitted
with them. One part of the plate fastens to the tripod socket of your
camera. The other part attaches to the tripod. Instead of screwing and
unscrewing the camera from the tripod each time, you press a control
and slide it off.

locks at once and operate them simultaneously.

Electronic Flash in the Pan
Digital SLRs that cost $2,000 or less — for the body only — generally have a
built-in electronic flash, or speedlight. (The exception to this rule as I write
this book is the inexpensive Foveon-based dSLRs from Sigma.) Digital SLRs
that cost $2,000 or more usually don’t have a built-in flash (except the Fuji
pro-quality S series dSLRs).
Professional photographers probably wouldn’t use a built-in speedlight on
their high-end cameras, usually because such units aren’t powerful enough for
anything other than fill flash and provide the kind of direct lighting that pros
abhor. I’ve been paid for my photos and seen them used on covers and inside
magazines, but not every picture I take is destined for the cover of National
Geographic Magazine (okay, none of them are). Like you, I find it quite handy to
be able to pop up my dSLR’s internal flash when I want to take a quick shot
and/or don’t have my fully laden shoulder bag handy. I like having a flash built-
in and always available.
However, like you, I’m serious about photography, and I’m glad I have my
more powerful and flexible external flash units available to provide additional
and supplemental lighting. In the following sections, I offer tips on the types
of flashes you’ll likely find useful. I also explain different ways external flash
units work with your camera, and I cover any pros and cons you’ll want to be
aware of. In Chapter 9, I explain using a flash for various effects.
Perusing different types of flash units
Flash units come in several types. I have a whole bunch of them, and you can
probably use any of these types of flash units with your dSLR:
 A fancy sort of flash: My $350 super-sophisticated unit can communicate
with my camera and do fancy tricks, such as zooming its coverage to
match the camera lens’s zoom setting. It also reports to the camera the
exact color temperature it uses, which results in more accurate hues and
adjusts its exposure by reading the light that actually goes through the
lens. In wireless mode, I can use it off-camera with no connecting cable.
 Do the mashed potato: I have a big monster of a “potato masher” flash
with massive output for sports photography. I use this beast when I
want to, say, illuminate a fullback on the opposite sideline. It attaches to
an external battery powerpack, so it lasts forever, and I never ask it to
do anything fancy. Although it has an automatic mode, I don’t use that
all the time because I often want to get the maximum output. The only
zoom coverage available is through built-in wide-angle and tele-filters
that modify the light.

 Studio flash dance: I probably get the most use out of my studio flash,
though, which consists of a pair of large monolights (AC powered flash
units with power built into the flash head) and two smaller electronic
flash units used as background and hair lights.
Tools for triggering the flash
To use an external flash, your camera needs to have some way of triggering
the supplemental flash unit. You can do this in four ways:
 Slave operation: Perhaps the external flash can be set to function as a
slave unit, which means it has a photocell that detects the firing of the
camera’s main flash, and the external flash triggers in response. In this
mode, you can use any slave-compatible external flashes, including
those with an add-on trigger. The problem with using slave flash is that
you might not want both the built-in flash and the external to illuminate
your scene. If you can cut the power of the internal flash, you might be
able to reduce its impact on the photo, relegating it to a fill-flash effect.
 Wireless mode: Some dSLRs can communicate with the same vendor’s
electronic flash units in wireless mode. You might expect something
called wireless to involve radio waves or, at the very least, some sort of
infrared signal, but it can be much simpler than that. For example,
Nikon’s flash units “talk” to compatible Nikon dSLRs by using almost
imperceptible preflashes that take place an instant before the flash fires.
The camera’s own flash tells the external flash details, such as the zoom
setting of the lens, the correct exposure to use, and most importantly,
when to fire. The external flash, in turn, responds with information, such
as the color temperature of the illumination it provides. This data
exchange can take place when the two flashes aren’t connected, or even
without the built-in flash providing part of the main exposure.
 Hardwired PC connection: You can find some dSLRs with a standard PC
connection for attaching standard electronic flash units. (PC stands for
Prontor-Compur, pioneering shutter manufacturers, rather than personal
computer.) That means you can plug in studio flash and speedlights made
by other vendors, assuming that the triggering voltage of the flash units
isn’t high enough to fry the circuits of your dSLR. (A Wein Sage-Sync add-
on device isolates your camera from the flash’s voltage. I use one to con-
nect my studio flash to my digital cameras.) A PC connection, if you have
one, works only with non-dedicated flash units that can’t communicate
with the camera. The only signal that’s exchanged between the camera
and the flash is the trigger that fires the external unit.
79
Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your dSLR

80
Part I: Digital SLRs and You 
 Hot shoe connection: Modern cameras, including dSLRs, tend to use
more sophisticated dedicated flash units that require full communication
between the camera and speedlight. These require special connectors,
usually in the form of a flash accessory hot shoe on top of the camera,
like the one shown in Figure 4-7. The shoe has multiple contacts. You can
plug in a flash unit designed to work with these contacts or use a hot
shoe adapter that allows connecting a flash with a cable instead.
Figure 4-7: Dedicated electronic flash units use flash accessory hot shoe connections.
Other Must-Have (Or Maybe-Have) Gear
After you’ve collected the most essential accessories your digital SLR needs,
if you have any money left over, you might want to consider some of the add-
ons I discuss in the following sections.
A second camera
I’ve gone to Europe on vacation and taken along only a single camera and
lens (I was planning on shooting movies most of the time). But now that I
think about it, that wasn’t a smart thing to do. When people are paying me
money to take pictures, I always have one or two spare camera bodies, extra
lenses, multiple flash units — duplicates of any essential piece of equipment.
I discovered early in my career that “Sorry, my camera broke!” is not an
Flash accessory
hot shoe

excuse that clients find acceptable. So why was I so dumb to go overseas and
risk arriving with no way to take photos? Umm . . . I wanted to travel light?
Sooner or later, you’ll discover that a second camera body makes sense for
you, too. Even if you aren’t 3,000 miles from home, can you really stop taking
photos for a few weeks while your dSLR is off in the shop? Haven’t you been
in situations where you wanted to alternate between taking photos with a
wide-angle or wide-angle zoom and a long telephoto or telephoto zoom lens?
Having an extra body, one for each lens, can be just what you need.
You don’t have to break the bank to buy your second camera body. Your
existing lenses fit just fine if you buy another model from the same vendor,
but you don’t need an identical camera. You can purchase a Nikon D40 or
Canon Digital Rebel XTi to supplement more expensive bodies from the same
manufacturer. Or, you might find yourself with an extra camera body when
your favorite vendor comes out with a new model and you decide to buy it
and keep your old camera as a spare/second camera.
Sensor cleaning kit
Like it or not, if you remove the lens
from your dSLR, sooner or later
you’re going to have to clean dust and
grime off the sensor. Available gear to
do this includes brushes, swabs, and
special liquids. But all you may need
for most cleanings is a blower bulb,
like those shown in Figure 4-8. Taking
that first swipe at your sensor can be
terrifying, but cleaning is actually
simple and relatively safe.
Close-up equipment
Lots of available add-ons can help
you focus closer, including filter-like
close-up attachments that screw 
onto the front of the lens, as well as
bellows accessories that fit between
the camera and lens.
Extension tubes, like those shown in Figure 4-9, are an inexpensive and versa-
tile solution. These tubes are installed between the camera and lens, and
they provide the additional distance needed to focus closer. Single tubes are
available for as little as $50, but you can pay $150 or more for a complete set
of fully automatic tubes in multiple lengths.

n terms of buttons, dials, and controls, comparing a typical point-and-
shoot camera with a digital SLR is like comparing a hang glider to a Boeing
787 cockpit. Certainly, the more sophisticated option has more controls, but
most people find it easier to flip a switch and shift a control than to yank on
a lever, lean to the right, and pray.
Because you can do so many different things with a dSLR, the
learning curve is a bit steep. Fortunately, your digital 787
has an autopilot — programmed modes — that flies your
photographic aircraft for you until you can ease into
navigating solo. But all those controls may be daunting
at first. You might have four or five exposure modes
to choose from, a half-dozen different ways to focus,
and the ability to fine-tune details, such as white bal-
ance, sharpness, contrast, and color. Because you’re
a more serious photographer, those options are
probably the reason you bought a digital SLR in the
first place.
Okay, champ. You have this incredibly versatile gadget
in your hands. How will you make it work? This chapter
helps get you started with the toughest of the tough: expo-
sure and focus.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Discovering the Secrets of Exposure
If you’re lazy or not up to using your brain on any given day, you can set up
your digital SLR to operate much like a glorified point-and-shoot camera.
Turn on autofocus, set the exposure control to Auto, and fire away. When
you depress the shutter release, your camera tries to guess which subject
in the frame is most important, and it focuses on that. The camera attempts
to ascertain what kind of picture you’re shooting (landscape, portrait, 
close-up, for example), and it chooses an exposure that’s probably fairly
close.
Clever little algorithms choose a shutter speed that eliminates subject- or
camera-related blur (most of the time) and an f-stop that provides a decent
compromise between depth-of-field and proper exposure. It’s almost a given
that your $800 dSLR then produces pictures just as good as a $200 snapshot
camera.
But that isn’t what you bought your digital SLR for. Auto is the mode you
use when you hand your camera to your fumble-fingered brother-in-law
and ask him to take a picture of you and your kids. You’d rather maintain
control over your exposures so you can apply f-stops and shutter speeds
creatively.
Understanding why exposure is tricky
In a perfect world, your dSLR’s sensor could capture all the photons that
reach it from your subjects. Dark areas would be represented by photosites
(the individual picture elements) that received few photons, and light areas
would be registered by photosites that captured lots and lots of photons. All
the intermediate tones would fall somewhere in between.
But it doesn’t work quite that way. Some dark areas might produce too few
photons to produce an image at all; some very light areas might be repre-
sented by so many photons that excess light overflows from one pixel into
adjacent pixels, causing a light smear known as blooming. (I introduce this in
Chapter 2, where I explain how sensors work in more detail.)
Proper exposure helps ensure that the sensor receives enough light to cap-
ture detail in the dark areas of an image, but not so much that light areas are
washed out. Figure 5-1 shows some of the choices you might have to make.
Exposing for the shadows provides lots of detail in the top version (the origi-
nal version of this image), but the highlights are completely washed out. The
bottom version uses improved exposure to trade off some of the brightness
in the shadows for more highlight detail. (Actually, I played with the exposure

by using an image editor on the RAW
version of the file, but this repre-
sents real-life choices nonetheless.
You can find more information on
using RAW files in Chapter 8.)
It’s generally a good idea to try to
preserve highlight details; they’re
impossible to retrieve if washed
out. Brightening dark shadows is
a lot easier than retrieving lost
highlights.
Achieving such an ideal exposure
can be tricky because sensors have a
fixed dynamic range, which is the
range over which detail in both light
and dark areas can be captured. No
sensor’s dynamic range covers the
full gamut of illumination levels that
you’re likely to encounter in every-
day photography, so the “right”
exposure is likely to be a series of
compromises.
The first compromise comes when
the continuous range of brightness
and darkness in an image is con-
verted from that analog form into 
digital bits and bytes. During the con-
version, an infinite gradation of tones
is sliced into a limited number of dif-
ferent shades — 256 different shades
per color in the case of the 24-bit “full”
color you probably work with in your
image editor. Your digital SLR might
capture more different tones than that — as many as 4,096 variations if your
camera captures 12 bits per color channel — but you still end up with a measly
256 tones for each color in Photoshop (except if you’re working with an HDR,
high dynamic range, image with more than 8 bits per channel).
Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to make sure that the available
tones are the right tones to represent your image. You don’t have many to
spare. Perhaps you’re shooting a night scene and have lots of detail in the
87

wash out; they’re impossible to retrieve.

88
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
shadows that you want to preserve, but there are also some details in high-
lights illuminated by a street lamp. How can you even guess how the camera
captures each of these details? Let the histogram be your guide.
Getting exposure right with the histogram
Digital SLRs include a histogram, which is a chart shown on your LCD (liquid
crystal display) that displays the number of tones being captured at any
brightness level. The number of pixels at each brightness level is shown on
the histogram as a vertical bar, and there are 256 of these bars. The far-left
position represents the darkest tones in your image, and the far-right slot
shows the tones in the very lightest parts of your image.
Typically, a histogram looks something like a mountain, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Most of the tones are clustered in the middle of the image because the average
image has most of its detail in those middle tones. The bars are shorter at the
dark or light ends of the scale because most images have less detail in the
shadows and highlights. However, images that have a great deal of detail in
the dark or light portions can have histograms that look very different, reflect-
ing that particular distribution of tones.
Figure 5-2: With a well-exposed image, the histogram looks like this.

It isn’t really possible to do much to manipulate the shape of the histogram in
your camera, other than increasing or decreasing your dSLR’s contrast set-
ting. To make significant changes to the tonal value relationships, you need
to use an image editor. What dSLR owners can do with a histogram display is
use it to judge whether the current exposure is correct for the image. That’s
fairly easy to do:
1. Take your picture.
You have to take the picture first because, unfortunately, most dSLRs
can’t display a histogram “live” (in real-time). The sensor doesn’t see the
image until the exposure is actually made. (Point-and-shoot digital cam-
eras might show a live histogram.)
2. Examine the histogram with your picture review function.
• If an image is overexposed, the graph is shifted toward the right
side of the histogram, with some of the pixels representing lighter
tones clipped off entirely, as shown in Figure 5-3.
• An underexposed image has the opposite look: The tones are
crowded at the left side, and some of the shadow detail is clipped
off, as in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-3: An overexposed image clusters all the information at the 
right side of the graph.

Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Figure 5-4: An underexposed image moves all the picture information 
to the left side of the histogram.
3. If you see either condition, compensate by changing the f-stop, shutter
speed, or exposure value (EV) to correct the exposure error.
Most of the time, experienced photographers try to keep the important
details from running off the right side of the graph, where thanks to
overexposure, they’re lost forever.
If you’re shooting RAW (see Chapter 8 for more about that), you might
be able to adjust exposure and contrast when importing the image into
your image editor. However, most of the time you’ll want to get the expo-
sure correct in the camera.
I spend the rest of this chapter showing how you can change the f-stop, shut-
ter speed and EV to control the exposure. 
Fine-Tuning Exposure with the Metering System
Your camera’s exposure metering system is a tireless friend that keeps plug-
ging away, calculating its reckoning of the correct exposure (based on para-
meters you set) regardless of whether you choose to pay attention. It’s
available whether you’re setting exposure manually or using one of the pro-
grammed or priority modes. You can’t really turn off the exposure meter
completely when the camera is on — although it might go to sleep after a few
seconds of inactivity. Even then, as soon as you tap the shutter release
button, a sleeping meter wakes up, looks at the current view through the
lens, and reports its findings.

Like any true friend, your metering system is on its best behavior when
you’re around. It responds with the metering mode you prefer and calculates
exposure based on your particular guidelines. What more could you ask for?
In the following sections, you find out how metering works, and you get a
tour of all the main metering options on your dSLR to help you choose the
optimum setting for the type of picture you want to take.
Metering works how?
The reason why dSLR exposure meters are so accurate is that they interpret
the actual light passing through the lens, which is flipped upward by the
mirror toward the viewfinder (or sideways in the case of some cameras in
the Olympus E series). A portion of the light is used for viewing, and some is
used to measure the exposure. If you zoom the lens (which often changes the
amount of light passing through) or place a gadget, like a filter, in front of
the lens to modify the light, the meter sees the results and takes them into
account. The metering system is also linked to the shutter speed and aper-
ture controls, so it understands the effects of both on the recommended
exposure.
Choosing a metering scheme
Metering schemes on your dSLR enable you to configure the photosensitive
elements of the exposure system (which can number from a dozen or so to
thousands of individual light sensors) so that the exposure system interprets
the incoming light in a specific way. Table 5-1 explains how photographers
typically use the most popular schemes.

More versatility with metering options
Your digital SLR has several options that can increase your exposure
versatility:
 Lock in settings with exposure lock control. When you press the
button, the current exposure (or focus, or both) is locked until you
press the button again or take a photo. This lock gives you the freedom
to set exposure and then reframe the photo any way you like without
worrying that the preferred settings change. This option is different from

the normal system of locking exposure and/or focus when you press the
shutter release, partially because you don’t have to keep your finger on
the release button. Exposure lock control is sometimes combined with a
focus lock adjustment.
 Shoot a series of photos at different exposures by setting your dSLR’s
bracketing system. The camera takes the first picture at the metered
exposure, and then it takes the second and third at, say, one-third stop
less exposure and one-third stop more exposure. You can set the exact
increment, choosing to bracket by half or full stops if you want. You can
also bracket parameters other than exposure, such as white balance and
flash. Your camera might allow you to bracket more than one of these
settings in the order you choose.
 Adjust the shutter speed and/or aperture combination in use without
changing the exposure at all. If the camera chooses 1⁄250 of a second at
f/8, spinning the command dial to the right might switch to 1⁄500 of a
second at f/5.6, or to the left to change to 1⁄125 of a second at f/11. All these
exposures are the same, but they provide different useful combinations
of shutter speeds and f-stop sizes.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
The Many Ways to Choose Exposure
If you want to get the best results, you must use the available exposure
options — automated, manual, and semiautomatic — in an intelligent way.
Whether you’re choosing Auto, Programmed, Aperture Priority, Shutter
Priority, Manual, or one of the programmed Scene modes, give some thought
to what you want to accomplish and choose the mode that’s best suited for
your planned picture-taking session.
The following sections offer tips for selecting the right mode.
Adjusting exposure the easy way
Digital SLRs include a simple way of bumping exposure up or down through
EV (exposure value). You can use EV as a way of referring to equivalent shut-
ter speed and aperture settings that produce the same exposure. For exam-
ple, if the correct exposure for a scene is 1⁄250 of a second at f/11 exactly,
equivalent exposures would include 1⁄500 of a second at f/8 (a shutter speed
half as long, but an aperture twice as large) and 1⁄125 of a second at f/16 (a shut-
ter speed twice as long, but an aperture half as large). All three exposures
would have the same EV.
Increasing or decreasing the EV setting adds to or subtracts from the basic
exposure. If you bumped up exposure by one EV, you could change the shut-
ter speed to 1⁄125 of a second while keeping the f-stop at f/11, or you could use
the equivalent exposure of 1⁄250 of a second at f/8. Reducing exposure by one
EV works in the opposite direction: You can shorten the shutter speed or
make the aperture smaller. It doesn’t matter. EV is a quick way to add or sub-
tract exposure without fiddling with the shutter speed or aperture controls
directly.
Your digital SLR has an EV button somewhere. Press it and use the corre-
sponding EV control (usually a command dial or cursor pad button) to adjust
the EV up or down one increment. This adjustment overrides your camera’s
autoexposure setting. In effect, you’re giving your image more or less expo-
sure than the exposure meter indicates when you change the EV.
Whether the camera adjusts the aperture or shutter speed is determined by
your current shooting mode:
 If your camera is set in a Programmed exposure mode, the camera
might adjust either value. It’s that simple.
 If you’re using Aperture Priority mode (you set the f-stop and let the
camera determine the shutter speed), making an EV change bumps the
shutter speed up or down.

 If you’re using Shutter Priority mode (you set the shutter speed and
the meter sets the f-stop), an EV adjustment makes the aperture larger
or smaller.
 If you’re using Auto mode, the camera sets both shutter speed and
aperture with no input from you.
In the following sections, I discuss these modes (Program, Aperture Priority,
and Shutter Priority) in more detail.
Giving up control (in Program mode)
If you don’t want absolute control over your exposure, you have an alterna-
tive to the dreaded Auto setting. It should suit you to a P — as in, pro-
grammed exposure — and that’s where this option is usually found on the
mode dial. It’s an automated exposure system but, unlike Auto, the Program
setting lets you fine-tune the exposure settings it selects. Auto generally locks
you out of most useful adjustments completely.
Program mode is smarter than Auto. Most dSLR cameras have a built-in data-
base of tens of thousands of photos that have been analyzed and reduced to
numbers that characterize their optimum exposures. In Program mode, your
camera can look at the image in your viewfinder, compare it with this data-
base, and come up with an image that probably is a pretty good match. It can
then apply the exposure parameters to your picture.
For example, the camera decides it has a landscape picture on its hands and
attempts to maximize depth-of-field. Or, the camera determines that it’s work-
ing with a portrait and, therefore, less depth-of-field might be in order. The
algorithms might dictate that high shutter speeds are used to counter camera
shake or subject motion, and the program switches to lower shutter speeds
only when the aperture is deemed too small for the correct exposure at the
current speed. 
Carried to the extreme, programmed exposures can include settings that are
optimized only for a specific type of picture, such as portraits, night photog-
raphy, beach or snow photos, sports, or macro photography. These Scene
modes are useful when you want to take a particular kind of picture and want
to inform the camera of what you’re doing, but don’t have the time to set up
the camera yourself. Scene modes can include more than exposure settings,
too. They might adjust saturation to give you more vivid landscapes or
decrease contrast to cope with bright snow scenes.
Figure 5-6 shows an image that would’ve benefited from using the Sports
Scene mode. The default shutter speed selected by the camera produced a
good exposure, but it wasn’t fast enough to stop the moving softball and bat.
Although a little blur can be useful in action photography (as you see in
Chapter 9), in this case, it was too much. (Shutter priority, which I discuss
later in this chapter, would’ve helped, too.)
95
Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR

96
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Figure 5-6: The Sports Scene Mode could have improved this action photo by freezing the ball and bat,
limiting the amount of blur.
Both Program and Scene modes are useful shortcuts for photographers in a
hurry. However, most of the serious photographers I know use the options in
the next section — Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and Manual Exposure
modes — almost exclusively.
Taking control
One of the joys of gaining expertise with your dSLR is knowing what’s best for
a particular type of photo and making the necessary choices even if you let
the camera’s electronics do most of the work. That’s why Aperture Priority,
Shutter Priority, and even Manual Exposure modes are so popular among dig-
ital SLR owners.
Here’s how to choose among them.
Getting your aperture and shutter priorities straight
Your camera doesn’t know you’re taking photographs of a soccer game, but
you do. You know that you sometimes want to use  1⁄1,000 of a second to freeze
the action, but other times you’d prefer to use 1⁄125 of a second to introduce a
little blur into the mix.
With Shutter Priority mode, usually represented by an S or Tv (for Time Value)
on the mode dial, the shutter speed is your choice. After you select the shut-
ter speed, the camera locks it in. The autoexposure system varies only the
aperture.

You also see the selected aperture in the viewfinder so that you, the all-
knowing photographer, can decide when, say, the f-stop is getting a little too
large for comfort and you want to accept a slower shutter speed to gain a
smaller aperture. Should light conditions change enough that your selected
shutter speed doesn’t produce a correct exposure with the available f-stops,
you’re alerted with a LO or HI indicator in the viewfinder or, perhaps, a flash-
ing light emitting diode (LED).
Aperture Priority mode, represented by an A or Av (for Aperture Value) on the
mode dial, is the flip-side of Shutter Priority mode. (Don’t confuse A with
Auto, which is another setting entirely.) Perhaps you want a small aperture to
maximize depth-of-field or a large f-stop to minimize it. It’s your choice. You
set the aperture you want, and the metering system sets the matching shut-
ter speed. Again, if you notice that the shutter speed is too slow, you can opt
to adjust the f-stop you’ve dialed in to one that’s larger or smaller.
With some cameras, there’s an ISO Auto option that also can change the sen-
sitivity (to a higher ISO setting) if the camera’s programming determines that
the aperture you’ve selected doesn’t allow using a shutter speed fast enough
to counter camera shake.
Shutter and aperture priority let you use your photo smarts to set a basic
parameter suitable for the photo you have in mind, and then the camera
takes over to intelligently make the other adjustments.
Doing exposure yourself
Sometimes if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.
Manual Exposure mode allows you to set both the shutter speed and aper-
ture by using the camera’s built-in meter for guidance. After you switch to
Manual mode, the dSLR doesn’t touch either setting, but it continues to eval-
uate the scene for the correct exposure and provide information in the
viewfinder showing that you’re over, under, or right on its recommendation.
I’m no technological Luddite, but I did resist exposure automation for an
interminable period. Why did I resist? Well, Manual Exposure mode has some
distinct advantages:
 Special effects: Suppose you want to create a silhouette effect, as in
Figure 5-7, or underexpose a sunset to cloak your image in deep shad-
ows. Maybe you want to overexpose a bit to wash out unwanted detail.
Any automatic exposure mode stubbornly tries to correct for the light-
ing, effectively blocking you from applying your special effect. Simply
switching to Manual Exposure mode and making the settings yourself is
usually a lot faster than trying to override your camera’s autoexposure
mechanism.
97
Chapter 5: Taking Control of Your dSLR

98
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Figure 5-7: Manual settings let you use creative exposure for special effects, such as
silhouettes.
 Balancing lighting: You have a subject that’s illuminated by several dif-
ferent light sources, say, two or more studio lights, or outdoors, by sun-
shine and fill light from your flash or a reflector. Manual Exposure mode
lets you control exactly how exposure is set for these multiple light
sources.
 Older optics: You might have an older lens that doesn’t couple with
your dSLR’s autoexposure system. In that case, setting the exposure
manually might be your only option.
 Noncompatible flash: I use Manual Exposure mode quite frequently
when I connect my dSLR to some studio flash units. The camera can’t
control the flash, and it has no way of adjusting exposure automatically.
So, I use a flash meter and set the f-stop manually. If you’re using a flash
that isn’t built specifically for your dSLR or you want to use the flash in
Manual mode (say, to make sure it always uses its full power), manual
exposure setting can work for you. Chapter 9 covers working with flash
in more detail.

Focus Pocus
Focusing your image correctly is arguably the most important technical
aspect of taking pictures because even a small focus error might ruin an image
beyond redemption. You can often correct exposure problems or fix bad color
balance in an image editor. You might be able to fix clumsy framing with some
judicious cropping. You can even retouch images to remove particularly ugly
subject matter. But if an image is badly focused, you can sharpen it a little, but
most likely not enough to bring a blurry shot back from the dead.
Oddly enough, focus is something that is both a benefit and bane of the dSLR.
Focus isn’t usually much of a worry for point-and-shoot photographers
except when taking close-up pictures. Nor is selective focus (placing parts of
an image out of focus to emphasize other portions) much of a creative tool.
That’s because the very short focal lengths required by the tiny sensors in
those cameras put virtually everything in sharp focus, regardless of zoom
position, f-stop, or distances (other than close-ups). Even a telephoto shot
taken with a point-and-shoot camera’s lens wide open is likely to be sharp
from a few feet to infinity.
That isn’t so with dSLRs and their lenses. You can throw parts of your scene,
such as the background in a portrait shot, out of focus to emphasize your
subject. Unfortunately, you can also accidentally throw your subject out of
focus if you aren’t careful, producing unintended results.
Digital SLRs offer two different ways of achieving focus: manual and automatic.
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Read on for details.
Focusing manually
Manual focusing sounds easy, but it’s more difficult than it sounds. All you
need to do is twist a ring on the front of the lens, and the image pops into
sharp focus, right? If only it were that simple! Manual focus is, unfortunately,
rather slow when compared to the automatic focus features of digital SLRs.
It works well when you’re doing thoughtful work, such as macro (close-up)
photography, where your subject sits there patiently while you fiddle with
the camera (often locked down on a tripod) and focus until you get every-
thing exactly right.
Manual focus isn’t so good when you’re photographing fast-moving sports or
if you’re shooting in a rush for any reason. The big problem is that our brains
have a very poor memory for sharpness. You don’t really know for sure that
sharp focus has been achieved until you’ve passed it and your image starts
to blur again. Then you have to jog back and forth until you’re convinced the
image is sharply focused. This jostling takes time, and you might not have
that much time to waste.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Focusing an image becomes more difficult when your scene is darker or
lower in contrast. That’s true for both you and the camera’s autofocus mech-
anism, but at least when the camera’s doing the job, you don’t have to fret in
frustration.
Still, manual focus might work for you in several situations:
 Zeroing in on one subject: When you want to focus on a particular
object that the autofocus system doesn’t readily lock in on, focus manu-
ally. Perhaps you have three eggs set up in a diagonal row and you want
to focus on the center one, as in Figure 5-8. Most autofocus systems can
be aimed, but it might simply be faster to do the focusing yourself.
 Shooting action pictures: In some action situations, autofocus systems
can be fast, but they might focus at lightning speed on the wrong sub-
ject. Sports photographers can sometimes use Manual mode to focus
ahead of time where they know the action will be, dispensing with the
uncertainty.
 Avoiding total confusion: Autofocus systems are totally confused by
some kinds of situations, such as subjects posed against plain back-
grounds. For example, I find that when photographing seagulls in flight, I
often have to focus manually unless I’m lucky enough to have a bird
blunder into one of my camera’s autofocus zones.
 Photographing through glass: Sometimes an autofocus system fixates
on the glass itself rather than the subject behind it, so you might be
better off focusing manually.
Figure 5-8: It might be easier to focus on the center egg manually.

Oughta’ autofocus
Digital SLRs focus automatically by selecting the focus point at which the
highest image contrast is achieved. When a subject’s out of focus, it looks
blurry and lower in contrast. When the subject’s in focus, the lack of blur
translates into higher contrast that the focus system can see.
Of course, that means that a low-contrast subject or one that’s poorly illumi-
nated can give an autofocus system fits. (I recommend manual focus in such
cases.) Sometimes a focus assist lamp built into the camera or a dedicated
flash unit can put a little light on the focus problem.
One nagging problem with autofocus is how the system decides what to
focus on. Most digital cameras have five to nine (or more) focus sensors
grouped around the viewfinder screen, and the cameras evaluate the contrast
of the image in each of them to select the zone on which to base focus. To
gain a little more control over the focal point of a shot, you might have the
following options:
 Switching zones manually: You might be able to switch from one zone
to another manually by using your camera’s cursor pad or other control.
That’s useful if your subject isn’t smack in the center of the frame but
still lies within one of the other focus zones. The zone you select is
highlighted in the viewfinder and remains in that position until you
move to another zone.
 Switching zones under camera control: If you don’t choose a focus
zone yourself, your camera does it for you by using a scheme, such as
dynamic focus area (the zone switches around when the camera detects
subject motion) or nearest subject (the zone is locked into what the
system determines is the closest object to the camera). You might be
able to allow the autofocus system to set the focus point for you, yet still
override its decision without resorting to full manual focus.
 Locking out focus ranges: Another option is the ability to lock out certain
focus ranges, such as extreme close-up or distant focus, so your autofocus
system doesn’t hunt over the full range when seeking correct focus.
Most of the time, you can let your camera focus for you, choosing between
the three common primary focus modes:
 Continuous autofocus: After you press the shutter release halfway, the
camera sets the focus but continues to look for movement within the
frame. If the camera detects motion, the lens refocuses on the new posi-
tion. Use this option for action photography or other subjects that are
likely to be in motion. Remember that if your subject moves faster than

the autofocus system can keep up, you might take an out-of-focus picture.
That isn’t as bad as it sounds, though: Sometimes you’d rather capture a
picture — any picture — even if it’s slightly out of focus than miss the
shot entirely.
 Single autofocus: Press the shutter release halfway, and focus is set. It
remains at that setting until you take the photo or release the button.
This mode is best suited for subject matter that isn’t likely to move after
it’s been brought into sharp focus. However, you can’t take a photo at all
until focus is locked in, so you end up either with a sharp photo or none
at all.
 Automatic autofocus: Press the shutter release halfway, and focus is set,
as in single autofocus. But if the subject starts to move, the camera
switches to continuous autofocus and refocuses as required. This mode
is great when you’re not certain that your subject will remain stationary.

I
n one sense, the term single lens reflex is a misnomer. Even in these days
of 18–250mm lenses that cover the range from wide-angle to medium tele-
photo (or 50–500 superzooms that extend from short telephoto to really,
really long telephoto), few dSLR owners try to operate with only a single lens.
In fact, buying extra optics for one of these cameras is more than a reflex —
it’s a passion! Additional lenses are probably the most popular accessory for
digital SLRs. They are the single component that can provide the biggest
boost to your photographic repertoire.
Of course, you probably know that the term SLR actually
refers to a camera design; one that uses the same lens
to take the picture as for reflex viewing (that is, by
reflection using mirrors or a prism) — as opposed to
a twin-lens reflex that pairs two lenses of the same
focal length for separate viewing and snapshooting.
These days, however, dSLR owners are more likely
to be single-minded about acquiring accessory
lenses.
This chapter helps you choose which lenses to add to
your collection, based on your needs — both real and
imagined — and shows you how to use them effectively.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Optical Delusions
Unless you happened to purchase a compact 12mm–400mm f/1.4 zoom lens
with your dSLR (they don’t exist), you’re deluding yourself if you think you
couldn’t use an accessory lens to improve your photography. Lenses don’t
make you a better photographer, of course, but they do increase your oppor-
tunities and let you take pictures you simply couldn’t grab with the lens that
came with your camera.
This next section lists some of the things that an accessory lens can do for you.
Shooting in lower light
The “do-everything” zoom lenses furnished with dSLRs often have maximum
apertures of f/3.5 to f/4.5. The Canon Digital Rebel XTi, Nikon D40 and D40x,
and Pentax K10D models are all furnished in kit form with 18mm–55mm
f/3.5-5.6 zooms (I’m sensing a trend here).
You can’t compare the focal length ranges directly, of course, because these
popularly priced dSLRs have different crop factors, ranging from 1.5X (for
Nikon, Sony, and Pentax) to 2X (for the Olympus line). But you can compare
maximum apertures, and you’ll see that f/3.5 or slower is common among
every vendor’s “starter” lenses.
That’s where your add-on lenses come in. Although zooms with large maxi-
mum apertures are expensive (and for a zoom lens, f/2.8 is a large maximum
aperture), fixed focal length (prime) lenses that are fast can cost very little.
For example, a 50mm f/1.8 lens from a major camera manufacturer may cost
less than $100 even though it’s two f-stops faster than an f/3.5 lens and three
stops better than an f/4.5 optic.
If you’re willing to spend a little more, you can buy 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, or
85mm f/1.4 lenses from the larger lens companies and speedy third-party
lenses, like the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 and Sigma 20mm f/1.8. Those extra notches
on the aperture ring let you take pictures in darker environments hand-held,
as shown in Figure 6-1, without resorting to detail-robbing higher ISO ratings.
An indoor concert that calls for a 1⁄15 second exposure at f/4 and ISO 100 may
work just fine at 1⁄125 second at f/1.4.
The fastest lenses are generally designed to produce good results wide open,
too, so you needn’t fear using f/1.4 with a prime lens even though you’ve
gotten poor results with your zoom at f/4.5.

Figure 6-1: Wider apertures allow shooting in dim light without mounting the camera on a tripod.
Improving your shutter speed
That wider aperture also pays dividends in the shutter speed department.
The difference between f/1.4 at 1⁄125 of a second and 1⁄15 of a second at f/4 can be
quite dramatic from a sharpness perspective, as you discover in Chapter 5.
You find out more about making the most of slow shutter speeds using image
stabilization technology in Chapter 7.
Producing sharper images
You may be able to get sharper images by switching lenses, too. That’s not to
say that the lens you purchased with your camera is unsharp. However, your
“do-all” lens is built on a foundation of compromises that don’t necessarily
produce the best results at all zoom positions and all apertures. Other lenses
you add to your collection may provide better results at specific focal lengths
or f-stops. For example, that 50mm f/1.8 lens you pick up for less than a single
Benjamin just might be the sharpest lens you own. Or, you might buy a close-
up lens that’s optimized for macrophotography and produces especially
sharp images at distances of a few inches or so.
Your current lens is probably very good, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get
sharper pictures with another set of optics, particularly when you’re swap-
ping a general purpose zoom lens for a fixed focal length prime lens designed
for exactly the kind of photo project you’re working on at the moment.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Taking a step back
Wide-angle lenses let you take in a wider field of view, in effect, stepping back
from your subject even in situations where there really isn’t room to move
farther away. It’s likely that the lens you bought with your camera provides a
field of view no wider than that of a 28mm lens on a full-frame film SLR. That’s
not really very wide. Some very interesting perspectives can be had with
ultra-wide lenses, including the 10.5mm fish-eye view provided by one Nikkor
lens particularly, because Nikon offers a utility that can defish the curved
image to produce a more rectilinear (straight line) version. Your particular
dSLR may have wide-angles available with the equivalent of a superwide
18mm lens, or better. Third-party vendors also offer some interesting wide-
angle choices, such as the Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 optic that offers the equiva-
lent of a 15mm to 30mm zoom on a dSLR with a 1.5X crop factor. I’ve had a
great deal of fun with a Tokina fish-eye zoom lens (used for Figure 6-2) that
allows you to choose your degree of distortion over a 10–17mm range.
It’s understandable if you’ve been lusting after longer and longer lenses, par-
ticularly if you shoot wildlife or sports, but if you haven’t worked extensively
with wide-angle lenses, I urge you to give them a try. It’s a whole new world.
Figure 6-2: Extreme wide-angle lenses, like the fish-eye used for this shot in a baseball park,
provide a new perspective.

Getting closer
The inverse of a wide-angle lens is the telephoto lens, and these longer
focal lengths let you bring distant objects that much closer to your camera.
The lens that came with your camera probably provides only a moderate
telephoto effect, perhaps around 70mm, which, with a 1.5 crop factor, is the
equivalent of a 105mm short tele-lens on a full-frame 35mm film camera.
Longer lenses are easy to find and can be very inexpensive, simply because
telephoto prime lenses and telephoto zooms are generally simpler to design
than their tricky wide-angle counterparts. You’ll find 70mm–300mm zooms
for many dSLRs for only a few hundred dollars. Prime lenses can be even
cheaper. I picked up an ancient non-automatic (focus, exposure, and aper-
ture) 400mm lens for about $79 that’s great for shooting the moon, as shown
in Figure 6-3, or for wildlife, especially if you can mount the camera or lens
on a tripod.
Figure 6-3: Shoot for the moon — if you have a long enough 
telephoto lens.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Focusing closer
Your optional lens may be able to focus much more closely than the lens that
came with your camera, making it a macro lens. If you’re new to close-up pho-
tography, you’ll soon find that the magnification of the image is more impor-
tant than the close focusing distance.
You can get the same size image with a 200mm lens at eight inches as you get
with a 50mm lens at two inches, and you may even be better off. The closer
you get, the harder it may be to get good lighting on your subject. There
simply isn’t a lot of room to apply effective lighting when there’s only a gap of
a couple inches between the front of the lens and that tree frog you’re snap-
ping. Worse, the tree frog may get skittish at the proximity of you and your
camera, making that 200mm lens and the extra distance it provides an even
better idea.
Choosing Your Prime Lens — or Zoom
In the olden days, fixed focal length prime lenses were all photographers
used most of the time. Zoom lenses were slow, often expensive, and had lim-
ited zoom ranges. In the 1960s and 1970s, photographers used zoom lenses
only when they absolutely couldn’t swap lenses to get the focal lengths they
needed, and even then were more likely to tote around three or four camera
bodies, each mounted with a prime lens of a different focal length. Zooms
were also good for special tricks, such as the infamous zoom-during-exposure
effect. In 1966, Nikon introduced one of the first decent zooms with a practi-
cal zoom range and acceptable sharpness, a 50mm–300mm f/4.5 that seems
fairly tame today, but which was revolutionary and horrendously expensive
at the time.
Today, zooms are sharper, smaller, faster, and less expensive. The 28mm–
200mm zoom I have mounted on my dSLR right now costs around $300, mea-
sures about 2.7 x 2.8 inches, weighs 13 ounces, and focuses down to 1.3 feet
at 200mm. It’s truly an all-purpose lens. You can find other zooms that meet
your needs, or, perhaps, fill out your arsenal with a few prime lenses.
Prime time
As I note in the section before this one, prime lenses can be faster (both in
aperture and autofocusing speed), sharper, and much lighter in weight than
zoom lenses. If you’re looking for the ultimate in image quality, a good prime
lens or two may be exactly what you want. Here’s a list of some common
applications and the prime lenses that might be especially suitable for them.
In all cases, when referring to recommended focal lengths, I use the actual

focal length, but assume that your camera has about a 1.5X crop factor.
That’s a good number that works for the majority of consumer-priced dSLRs
on the market, and isn’t too far off for those with 1.3 to 1.6X crop factors.
 Architecture: Wide-angle lenses in the 18mm to 30mm range (depending
on how much of the wide view your system’s crop factor clips off). Most
of the time, you’re shooting stopped down to a relatively small aperture
to gain depth-of-field, so an f/2 or f/1.4 maximum aperture isn’t as impor-
tant even when shooting indoors under low light levels. A tripod serves
you better. If you shoot a great deal of architecture, you can purchase a
perspective control lens that compensates for the falling back effect that
results when you tilt the camera back to capture the upper reaches of a
tall structure. You can find out more about perspective problems in
Chapter 10.
 Indoor sports: You want a mod-
erately wide angle of roughly
30mm focal length for indoor
sports, like basketball or volley-
ball, with longer lenses for
shooting from up in the stands.
Large apertures can be useful for
available light sports, but only if
you can focus or pre-focus care-
fully on a single subject or two
because depth-of-field is limited,
as you can see in Figure 6-4.
Autofocus may not accurately
focus exactly where you need 
to when using a very large 
aperture.
 Outdoor sports: Longer lenses
are useful, and primes in tele-
photo focal lengths often offer
an excellent combination
of reach and speed. You’ll find
100mm to 200mm lenses, or
longer, great for capturing foot-
ball, baseball, soccer, and
other outdoor sports. Apertures
of f/2.8 to f/4 let you use faster
shutter speeds to freeze the action (again, assuming that you or your
camera’s autofocus system make the most of the available depth-of-field).
 Portraits: If you’re taking head-and-shoulders shots, a 50mm to 70mm
prime lens offers the same flattering perspective as the traditional 75mm
to 105mm portrait lenses used with 35mm full-frame cameras (with a
109

carefully because depth-of-field is sparse at
wide apertures.

110
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
1.5X crop factor on the dSLR). Such prime lenses usually come with f/1.8
or faster maximum apertures, which are useful for limiting depth-of-field
when you want to concentrate on your portrait subject’s face. Longer
focal lengths can produce a flattening effect on the features, and shorter
focal lengths can make ears look too small while enlarging noses if used
up close.
 Macro photography: Prime lenses, such as the ever-popular 50mm f/1.8,
although not intended for close-up work, can still do a great job. You
may have to purchase extension tubes or other accessories to focus
close enough to fill the frame with very small subjects.
 Landscapes: Wide-angle primes (18mm to 24mm) can give you land-
scape photos that are sharp enough to blow up to 16 x 20 inches or
larger as framed pictures to grace your walls.
Of course, the only problem with using prime lenses is that you must be will-
ing to swap lenses whenever you decide to shoot something else or need a
different perspective you can’t get by stepping closer or farther away. Digital
SLRs have one additional consideration: If you’re working in a dusty environ-
ment, you may not want to change lenses a lot because each time you take off
a lens, you’re letting some dirt invade the camera body and, possibly, end up
on the sensor. You can read more about sensors and dust in Chapter 2.
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zooms are good, too. Honest. I may be a little biased because most of my
lenses have always been primes, with only a lone zoom that wasn’t used
much. Today, most of my work is with 12–24mm, 18–70mm, 28–200mm, and
170–500mm zooms, so you can see I’m no optical Luddite. But I still get a lot
of use from my new 60mm and 105mm macro lenses, as well as older prime
lenses I own, including a 16mm fish-eye that functions as a quirky 24mm lens
with a heck of a lot of barrel distortion (even after the crop factor has
trimmed the image). I also regularly use my prime 50mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.8,
105mm f/2.5, and 200mm f/4 lenses when I want a little extra sharpness or
aperture speed.
But those applications are in the distinct minority. Like you, I rely on zooms
most of the time. Consider these different broad categories of zooms:
 Wide angle: These are strictly designed for wide-angle perspectives,
and, if designed for digital SLRs, may include ranges, like 10–20mm or
12–24mm. You’ll find wide angles originally created for full-frame 35mm
cameras, too, with ranges like 17–35mm. On a camera with a crop factor,
such lenses are actually closer to wide-to-normal in range but are likely to
be very sharp (and sometimes very expensive). Before purchasing a wide
zoom for your dSLR, you might want to check it out carefully because the
widest of the wide often have serious distortion and aberrations.

 Mid-range: The lens furnished with your camera is likely to be a mid-
range zoom, with a focal length at the wide end of about 17–18mm,
extending out to 55 to 70mm at the telephoto end. Such lenses are inex-
pensive, not very fast, but reasonable in cost. You can also find some
upscale versions in the same focal lengths, with greater sharpness and
larger maximum apertures. These were usually designed for finicky full-
frame 35mm film camera users. They’re often worth the extra expendi-
ture because they often have a fixed maximum aperture throughout the
zoom range. That is, a 17–55mm f/2.8 lens has a constant f/2.8 aperture
and doesn’t vary between, say, f/2.8 at the wide-angle position and f/4 at
the telephoto position, which is common with less expensive models
(like the one that came with your camera).
 Short tele to telephoto: These lenses may start out at 50 to 70mm and
extend out to 200 to 300mm or more. One vendor’s 50–500mm zoom is
especially popular because it provides such a huge range of focal
lengths in one lens. Of course, it’s also possibly the largest and heaviest
50mm lens on the planet, so you want to own such a beast only if you
plan on actually needing its 10X zoom reach.
 Telephoto: These lenses start long, and go longer. My 170–500mm zoom
falls into this category and can really reach out and touch someone, as
shown in Figure 6-5. You’ll also find 200–400mm zooms or even longer
lenses from various vendors. As with any lens of more than about
200mm, seriously consider using these optics with either the camera
mounted on a tripod or, better yet, with the lens attached to the tripod
using a special collar with a tripod socket. Many long lenses are sold
with such removable collars.
Figure 6-5: Subjects that you can’t get close to can be captured easily 
with a long lens, like the 170-500mm zoom used to capture this shot.

112
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 Macro: Several vendors offer lenses with zoom ranges in the medium
telephoto range (out to about 200mm) that also offer macro focusing.
They’re especially useful for wildlife photographers who photograph big
beasts and small.
Special (lens) delivery
I touch on special purpose lenses in this chapter and describe them in more
detail in other sections of this book. Just to make things neat and tidy, I list
the special kinds of lenses you may encounter (or wish to acquire). They
include
 Optical image stabilization: I discuss this in Chapter 7; these are the
lenses that counter camera or photographer shake by shifting lens ele-
ments around just before exposure. They give you the power to shoot at
shutter speeds about 4X as long without producing camera-induced blur.
Sony and Pentax build the anti-shake feature into the camera itself, so,
with only a couple exceptions, all your lenses can be used with image
stabilization.
 Perspective control: These are the optics that shift to provide improved
perspective when photographing buildings or other subjects that con-
verge in the distance.
 Macro: These are prime or zoom lenses designed especially for close-up
photography, offering extended focusing, better sharpness, and, often,
extra-small apertures (such as f/32 or f/45) to maximize depth-of-field.
 Focus control portrait: Nikon offers a series of DC lenses with defocus
control, which lets you adjust how the out-of-focus background appears
in portraits or similar kinds of single-subject pictures.
 UV: If you’re a scientist photographing subjects using ultraviolet (UV)
light, you’ll probably want to scrounge around for one of these rare,
expensive optics that don’t filter out UV in the same way as lenses built
of conventional glass elements.
Lens Concepts
Ideally, lenses used on dSLRs should be designed to meet the special needs of
digital cameras. That’s not always possible. Most digital SLRs use lenses that
were originally designed for film cameras, which might not work as well on a
digital camera. Some vendors, such as Pentax, Nikon, and Olympus, offer
lenses that work exclusively with their digital cameras. That’s a better solu-
tion, in my book.

That’s because sensors aren’t what engineers might describe as plug compatible
with film. You can’t rip out the film transport mechanism and substitute a 
digital sensor and expect the same results (even though that’s exactly how
some of the original dSLRs were designed).
Different strokes
Sensors are smaller than film frames, introducing the infamous crop factor
I’m forced to drag into about half the shooting discussions in this book. Only
part of the image formed by a lens designed for a full frame sensor is cap-
tured by a sensor that, like most dSLR sensors today, is smaller than 24mm x
36mm. The crop factor may be 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, or even 2.0 times. This can be
(seemingly) good for telephoto pictures, but not such a great effect if what
you really wanted was a wide-angle view. A 100mm lens may have the field of
view of a 150mm lens, but a 20mm super-wide-angle ends up with the view-
point of a mundane 30mm lens.
Because a smaller portion of the lens coverage area is used, the smaller
sensor crops the edges and corners of the image, where aberrations and
other defects traditionally hide. You just might be using the best part of your
lens if it was originally designed for a film camera.
Of course, vendors are producing lenses designed expressly for smaller sen-
sors, which means that their reduced coverage area must be extraordinary
even in terms of sharpness and light distribution.
But wait, there’s more! Sensors don’t respond to light the same way film does.
Film grains absorb light in roughly the same manner regardless of its angle
of approach to the film surface. A sensor’s photosites, on the other hand,
are little pixel-nabbing wells that collect photons best when they drop
directly into the bucket rather than coming in from a steep angle. With
lenses designed for film, some of the light can hit the side of the well or
spill over into adjacent pixels. Unwanted patterns and light fall-off can also
result, along with flare that results when photons bounce off the shiny sensor
surface, hit the equally shiny rear lens elements, and then reflect back onto
the sensor. Ugh!
Although camera and lens designers have found ways to counter these prob-
lems with equipment designed expressly for digital photography, optics cre-
ated for film cameras might not produce the same uniformly good results.
Image quality can vary from lens to lens based on how well the design meets
the needs of digital imaging.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Going for bokeh
Obsessing over the quality of the out-of-focus areas of an image that a lens
produces (its so-called bokeh) has become a subspecialty fixation of its own
in recent years. Some lenses are prized for their wonderful bokeh, whereas
others are reviled because their bokeh stinks. You’ll find endless discussion
of this topic in the photographic forums online. So what does it all mean?
The word boke means “blur” in Japanese, I’m told. English speakers insisted
on rhyming it with “broke,” so the silent “h” was added to the Western
spelling of the term to help ensure that the language-challenged among us
would properly pronounce it as if it rhymes with “polka.”
Bokeh describes the points of light in the background that become fuzzy
disks when rendered out-of-focus by inadequate depth-of-field. Various lenses
render these disks in different ways. Some create uniformly illuminated disks.
Others generate disks that are dark in the center and lighter at the edges,
which make them stand out like a sore thumb or, actually, a frosted dough-
nut. The reverse effect, a nicely illuminated center that fades to a darker
edge, is ideal because the disks tend to blend into each other. Lenses with
the very best bokeh characteristics display almost no disk shapes at all.
If you shoot close-ups, portraits, or long telephoto shots that have out-of-
focus backgrounds, examine the bokeh characteristics of any lens you’re con-
sidering very carefully. You might not even be aware of the deleterious effects
of bad bokeh (except when using a so-called mirror or catadioptric telephoto
lens, which generates the mother of all doughnuts around each point of
light). But you’ll eventually notice that some out-of-focus backgrounds are
more harmonious than others or, in the worst case, your bokeh-aware pho-
tographer friends will make fun of you. Figure 6-6 shows examples of both
good and bad bokeh.
Figure 6-6: When bokeh goes bad, as at left, out of focus points of 
light produce obvious disks that are darker in the center than at the 
edges. With good bokeh, the points blend together to produce a 
smooth out-of-focus background (right).

Using Lenses Creatively
There’s more to working with a lens than simply adjusting to its greater or
lesser field of view. That’s to say, a wide-angle lens is much more than just a
wider perspective, just as a telephoto lens has a lot more going for it than the
ability to pull objects closer to your camera. This section shows you some of
the things you need to know to work with wide-angle and telephoto lenses
creatively.
Creative use of wide angles
Wide-angle lenses have some special characteristics you should be aware
of because those characteristics can hold some special pitfalls that you
want to avoid, while offering some creative advantages if you use them
properly.
You can use those qualities in your photography in these ways.
 Increase depth-of-field: Sometimes you want what cinematographers call
deep focus. Akira Kurosawa was a master of the technique of having both
subjects very close to the camera as well as those that are more distant
all in sharp focus. You can do it, too. At any given aperture, wide-angle
lenses provide more depth-of-field than a telephoto lens, allowing you to
picture a larger range of subject matter without the distracting blurriness
of objects in the foreground, background, or both.
 Emphasize the foreground: If you want to put extra emphasis on sub-
jects in the foreground, such as a lake or meadow, while de-emphasizing
the mountains in the background, use a wide-angle lens.
 Distort the foreground: Although wide-angle lenses tend to exaggerate
the size of objects closest to the lens, you can effectively use this form
of perspective distortion to create an interesting viewpoint in your
picture.
 Add a unique angle: When you get down low and shoot up with a wide
angle, the combination of perspective distortion and the unusual angle
can be used creatively, as shown in Figure 6-7. The same is true when
shooting down from high angles.
 Use slower shutter speeds: Just as telephotos magnify camera shake,
wide-angle lenses tend to minimize it. If you can hand-hold your camera
with a normal lens (or zoom setting) at 1⁄60 second, you just might be able
to pull off 1⁄30 second exposures, or longer, with a wide-angle lens.
115
Chapter 6: Mastering the Multi-Lens Reflex

116
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Figure 6-7: A low angle with a wide-angle lens is a 
dual-edged sword. The perspective is interesting, but 
you run the danger of having tall structures appear to be 
falling backward.
 Show more stuff: Indoors or outdoors in tight quarters, you can show
more of your scene with a wide-angle lens. That’s great when you want
to picture most of a building or all of a room indoors, but you can
also use this expansive view when photographing people in their
environment.

Don’t be lulled by the creative opportunities wide angles offer. Here are some
pitfalls to avoid:
 Avoid skewed horizontal and vertical lines: Watch those horizons and
the vertical lines of buildings so they don’t look skewed in your photos.
Keep the camera level as much as possible.
 Watch proportions: Because wide angles exaggerate the relative size of
objects that are close to the camera, you can end up with weird propor-
tions in your photos. You don’t want your spouse’s nose to appear twice
its normal size (even button noses don’t benefit from optical plastic
surgery), so keep the possibilities of distortion in mind when framing
your photos.
 Don’t let lens defects ruin your photos: Wide-angle lenses may be
subject to distortions that change the shape of vertical and horizontal
lines at the edges of the photo. Or, such lenses may have chromatic
aberrations that add purple or cyan glows around backlit subjects.
 Avoid vignetting: Filters, lens hoods, and other add-ons may actually
intrude into the picture area with wide-angle lenses. Use thin filters,
avoid stacking too many of them together, and use only lens hoods
designed for a particular lens.
 Watch that flash: Your digital SLR’s built-in electronic flash might not
spread wide enough to cover the full frame of a wide-angle lens. Use a
diffuser or wide-angle adapter over your flash. Some dedicated flash
units actually zoom their coverage to match your lens’ zoom position.
Also make sure that your lens or lens hood doesn’t cast a shadow when
shooting close-up subjects with flash.
Creative use of telephotos
Telephoto lenses have their own set of creative strengths and dangerous pit-
falls. You’ll want to keep these tempting applications in mind when working
with your longer lenses and tele-zooms:
 Compression: Telephoto lenses compress the apparent distance
between objects, making that row of fenceposts appear as if each
post is only a foot or two distant from the next. Movie-makers use
this effect all the time to make it look like the hero is bravely racing
between speeding cars while crossing the street, when actually none
of the vehicles come closer than five or ten feet.

Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
 Isolation: The reduced depth of field of tele-lenses let you apply selec-
tive focus when you want to isolate your subjects from the foreground
or background.
 Sports action: A telephoto lens brings you into the middle of the huddle,
right in the center of the action around the goal, and a lot closer than
you ever wanted to get to the periphery of a scrum.
 Nature’s bounty: A telephoto can take you closer to your photographic
prey, including animals of all shapes and sizes, while letting you stay
far enough away that you don’t become prey yourself, as shown in
Figure 6-8.
 Macro photos: You might not need a macro lens to shoot macro photos.
A telephoto lens with enough reach that focuses reasonably close may
be all you need.
Figure 6-8: Don’t get too close! Use a telephoto and live to shoot another day.

Telephoto lenses don’t have an unusual number of pitfalls, but you should be
aware of them nevertheless. Here are the crucial things to watch out for:
 Flash coverage: Like wide-angle lenses, telephotos have some potential
problems with electronic flash coverage, except that the problem is
depth rather than width. The electronic flash built into most dSLRs
isn’t powerful enough to reach more than 10–20 feet, so if you’re pho-
tographing a running back who’s 50 feet away, you’ll end up with a very
underexposed photo. If you do a lot of sports photography, you might
want to consider buying a powerful external flash to provide the extra
light you need.
 Too-slow shutter speeds: Because longer lenses magnify the shakiness
of lightweight cameras or lightweight photographers, use a shutter
speed that’s high enough to counter the vibration. If you can’t use a
higher shutter speed, use a tripod or monopod.
 Reduced depth-of-field: Telephotos have less depth-of-field at a given
aperture. If you need the maximum amount of depth-of-field, use a
smaller f-stop.
 Atmospheric conditions: Even when smog doesn’t fill the sky, the air is
full of enough haze or fog to reduce the contrast of your long telephoto
shots and affect your pictures. Sometimes a skylight or haze filter helps,
or you can boost the contrast and color saturation in your camera or
image editor.
 Flare: Telephoto lenses have a narrow field of view, making it easy for
bright light outside your image area to affect your image with flare,
which reduces contrast. Use your lens hood without fail.

veryone loves watching movies on DVD more than on videotape, pre-
mium cable, or maybe even in a theater. Why? Because of those special
features! It’s a kick to press a button and hear the director’s commentary,
watch hilarious outtakes, or listen to Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson banter in
French or Japanese. Okay, maybe a minority likes the image quality that DVD
provides, but for me, special features are the attraction.
The special features built into your digital SLR are even cooler.
These are the functions built into some dSLRs, but not all.
They let you do some very interesting things, such as take
pictures in virtual darkness or shoot the unfolding of
flowers through time-lapse photography.
This chapter describes what you can do with some
of these special features. No movie stars are chatter-
ing in a foreign language, but if you have your heart
set on gibberish, your dSLR probably has a setting
for switching your menus to any language you like.
While you’re at it, I’ll keep busy exploring some of the
more useful features of digital cameras.
Feel the Noize at Night
All digital SLRs can take fine pictures at night, but some do a better job than
others, thanks to special features built into them to handle long exposures
and noise (or, as Quiet Riot and Slade fans call it, noize). This section
describes the key components you need to work with so that your night
shots are sparklingly clear.

122
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
A fast lens . . . or not?
As you discover in Chapter 6, a lens with a large maximum aperture (gener-
ally, anything faster than f/2.8) is a must only if you’re hand-holding (that is,
shooting without a tripod) your night photos or, perhaps, if you want to
shoot with flash and need your speedlight’s illumination to reach as far as
possible. An f/2 or f/1.4 lens might let you take some night pictures at 1⁄30 of a
second hand-held or, with image stabilization (which I discuss in the follow-
ing section), at slightly slower shutter speeds.
The more sane shooters take night photographs with the camera securely
mounted on a tripod, so that you can use virtually any lens at any desired f-
stop and still get a clear photo. Correct exposure in such cases is simply a
matter of using a sufficiently long shutter speed. That said, using a long shut-
ter speed isn’t always an option, as I discuss in the following section.
Taking night shots at short shutter speeds
You might want to avoid very long shutter speeds and prefer the shorter
shutter intervals a higher sensitivity (higher ISO setting) affords, for any
number of valid reasons:
 Perhaps you don’t want to spend 30 seconds or more making a single
exposure because of time constraints or physical conditions (rain, mug-
gers, an episode of Desperate Housewives you don’t want to miss, and so
forth).
 You might want to take as many photos as possible in available darkness.
 You’d rather avoid the light streaks from moving cars or other illumi-
nated objects that a long exposure is likely to produce.
Bumping up the ISO can let you take your night photos with a reasonably
short exposure. Some dSLRs have ISO settings no higher than ISO 800, but
others go up to ISO 1,600, ISO 3,200, or higher. A few cameras top out at a spe-
cific ISO notch but include “push” settings with names like H1 or H2, which
elevate the effective sensitivity a notch or two more that you can use in a
pinch. You can also adjust your camera’s exposure value (EV) compensation
controls to underexpose an image (effectively providing a higher ISO setting)
and then try to salvage the photo in your image editor.
Of course, high ISO settings tend to amplify non-image signals in an image,
producing extra noise. That’s where your camera’s noise reduction feature
comes in, reducing the annoying speckles produced. See the next section for
more about using noise reduction.

Noise Reduction Made Easy
You’ll want to consider using noise reduction anytime you take photos at
night using long exposures or high sensitivity settings because the objection-
able texture overlays unprocessed images.
Noise comes from several sources. One might be the amplification of the
weak signal that the sensor produces under low light conditions. The sensor
itself also produces noise while it inevitably heats up during a long exposure,
and some of that heat is mistaken for incoming photons. Some digital cam-
eras exhibit an amp glow or amp noise phenomenon, which is a reddish or
purple glow in the corners and edges of very long exposure images (usually
several minutes or more) caused not by heat, but by electroluminescence of
electrons in the readout amplifier of the camera’s sensor. You don’t need to
be a rocket scientist to understand that; the actual specialty is astronomer
(they experience amp glow when taking astrophotographs).
The bottom line is that noise can be generated at high ISOs with exposures of
any length and at relatively low ISO settings with long exposures.
To cancel some of those noisy speckles, digital SLRs include internal noise
reduction circuitry. It works by making two exposures: an actual picture of your
subject and a blank or dark exposure
for the same length of time. This
second picture contains only noise of
the same type that appears in the real
picture. The camera’s noise reduction
circuitry compares the two and zaps
the pixels that are common to both
(the noise). This solution is along the
order of the sculptor who starts with
a block of marble and removes every-
thing that doesn’t look like a statue.
Figure 7-1 shows two versions of an
image taken in the early evening at a
hotel that’s been converted to an art
museum, using a relatively short
exposure (1⁄4 of a second), but with
the ISO setting cranked up all the
way to ISO 1,600. A lot of noise is vis-
ible in the upper version. (The upper
version is actually a little exagger-
ated to make it visible on the printed
page.) The lower version is the same
shot with noise reduction applied.
The difference is quite dramatic.
123
Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs
Figure 7-1: The upper version badly needs
noise reduction. You can see the results in the
lower version.

124
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Because the noise reduction feature works by taking two shots, any photos
taken with the noise reduction feature turned on take twice as long. You’ll
scarcely notice the delay with shutter speeds of about one second or shorter,
but when you’re snapping off 30-second exposures, you’ll definitely notice the
extra half-minute pause during this “dark frame subtraction” process. If you’re
in a hurry or forget to switch on the noise reduction, you can also perform
some post-shot noise reduction with an image editor, such as Photoshop (as
shown in Figure 7-2), or with a third-party application, such as Neat Image
(www.neatimage.com) or Noise Ninja (www.picturecode.com).
The Reduce Noise filter in Photoshop and Elements lets you control the
strength of the noise reduction, how much detail to preserve, whether to
eliminate color noise, and how much sharpening of the remaining detail
should be applied. The Adobe Camera Raw plug-in supplied with both
programs also includes noise reduction features you can apply to RAW
files. For an introduction to image editors and image editing, see Chapters 11
and 12.
Figure 7-2: Photoshop CS3 and Photoshop Elements 5.0 have a noise reduction filter built in.

Shake, Shake, Shake
Whenever photographers get together, one of the inevitable topics of conversa-
tion is each shooter’s prowess at hand-holding a camera for incredibly long
exposures. Oddly enough, these are the same photographers who might swear
by an emerging camera-steadying technology known as image stabilization.
“I get razor-sharp images at 1⁄30 of a second, even with telephoto lenses!” one
boasts. “I can squeeze off shots at 1⁄4 of a second with no problem!” another
counters. “I have a special technique for bracing my arms that lets me take
time exposures of up to two seconds without a tripod!” a third asserts, leav-
ing the others to wonder whether he’s joking or just filled with braggadocio.
No matter how experienced a photographer you are, and whether you apply
arcane breath-control and body-steadying practices to your techniques, you
only think you’re steady enough to shoot long exposures with short lenses,
and reasonably long exposures with telephotos.
In the sections that follow, you find out some of the common myths about
camera shake, identify the point where you really need to switch from hand-
held shots to a tripod, diagnose shake-related problems in your photos, and
discover ways to fix those problems.
Leaving camera shake myths behind
In camera shake lore, you might have come across two misleading
assumptions:
 If you don’t see the shake, it isn’t there. The slowest shutter speed at
which you think you can reliably shoot sharp images is probably the
speed at which you can’t detect the blurriness that appears at normal
levels of enlargement. Crop a small section out of the center or make a
huge enlargement, and you can probably see the difference. A surprising
number of your shots very likely would be sharper if you used a tripod.
 Use a shutter speed that’s the reciprocal of the lens’s focal length (for
example, 1⁄250 of a second with a 250mm lens). This is more of a rough
guideline than a rule because it doesn’t take into account the crop factor
some dSLRs produce. That is, your 250mm lens is effectively a 400mm
lens (if your camera has a 1.6X crop factor). No, you’re not multiplying
the focal length of the lens (as I emphasize over and over), but you are
filling the frame with less subject area, magnifying any camera shake just
as if you’d made an 8-x-10-inch print instead of a 4-x-6-inch print.
Some people are shakier than others, so a 1⁄400 of a second shutter speed
that one photographer can use successfully might be woefully inade-
quate for another photographer. To figure out the point where you per-
sonally need to switch from hand-held shots to using a tripod, see the
next section, “Testing for tremors.”
125
Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs

126
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
It goes without saying, of course, that this discussion is concerned only with
blurriness caused by camera/photographer shake. Blurs derived from
moving objects are another issue entirely, although they, too, can be fixed by
using higher shutter speeds.
Testing for tremors
Before looking at the latest technological cure for shaky hands, try this exer-
cise to see just how bad you have the “affliction.” (If you’ve inherited, as I have,
a mild case of essential tremor condition, you can remove the quotation marks.)
1. Find a scene that contains sharp pinpoints of light, preferably at night
so you’ll have a dark background, such as a scene with streetlights.
2. Switch your camera to Manual mode so you can vary both the shutter
speed and f-stop independently.
3. Take several pictures at a fixed f-stop but vary the shutter speed for
each picture.
Use various shutter speeds you think are test-worthy. For example, 1⁄60, 1⁄30,
1⁄15, or 1⁄8 of a second.
4. Calculate your exposure with your digital camera’s metering system.
Exposure needn’t be precise as long as you vary only the shutter speed
during the tests. If you change f-stop or focus, you can change the size of
the points of light, although the greatest effect is on any out-of-focus
points.
If you’re shooting over a great range, change the ISO setting of your
camera so you can maintain the same aperture while varying the shutter
speed.
5. After you finish, open your shots in your image editor and examine
the camera shake by enlarging the light points enough that you can
study their shape.
The appearance of the round disks of light in your images let you judge
fairly accurately how steady you could hold the camera during the tests:
• If the disks are perfectly round, like those shown at lower right and
upper left in Figure 7-3, you used a shutter speed that’s fast enough
to stop action at that focal length.
Keep in mind that if you zoom in to a longer focal length, you need
a higher shutter speed. Telephotos magnify the effects of camera
shake.
• If the disks are elongated vertically, the camera’s been shaken up or
down (or both).

Figure 7-3: The spots of light in the lower-right and upper-left corners are round; the shutter
speed was fast enough to stop camera shake.
• If the disks are elongated in a diagonal direction (usually a diagonal
pointing from upper left to lower right), you’ve jerked the camera,
probably by punching the shutter release button too aggressively.
Why that particular direction, because you tend to press down and
to the right, not the other way around? Remember that an image is
recorded on your sensor upside-down, so the direction of any
camera movement is reversed.
• If the disks are elongated from side to side, your camera shake
formed some panning-style blur. Again, the direction of the blur is
reversed, so if you jerked the camera slightly to the left, the blur
appears to the right in your final image.
• If you’re really shaking, you might find the blurs create a streaky pat-
tern, like the one shown in Figure 7-4. That shutter speed is way too
low for hand-held exposures.
127
Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs

128
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
Figure 7-4: Really streaky photos mean that you need a much faster shutter speed if you want to hand-hold
your camera.
Everyday solutions for shakiness
After you determine what your minimum practical shutter speed is for hand-
holding (keeping in mind that this speed can vary because of lens focal
length and other factors), you can attempt to sharpen your photos. To cease
the shakes, try using
 Higher shutter speeds
 Better shooting ergonomics (that is, bracing yourself)
 Aids, like tripods, monopods, or beanbags (see Chapter 4)
 Image stabilization
Image stabilization: The ready-steady-shoot 
technology
Anti-vibration technology has gained a lot of attention because several of the
most popular low-priced cameras from Sony and Pentax include the feature
right in the camera body, so it’s now available in modestly priced entry-level
cameras.
Leave it to the techno-wonks to come up with stunning new technologies just
because they can. Camera-steadying technology has been around since 1976

in the motion picture industry when the Steadicam was introduced. This
device produces gyroscope-like stability through an exquisite application of
gimbaling and balance. By 1995, Canon had introduced an electronic form of
image stabilization (IS), which is now offered by Nikon, Sony, Pentax, and
others under names like Vibration Reduction or Anti-Shake.
Nikon and Canon build IS into individ-
ual lenses; Sony, Pentax, and
Olympus (the only other vendors
offering the technology for digital
SLRs) incorporate image stabilization
into the cameras. They all operate by
using similar principles: The device
(lens or camera) senses motion and
then shifts components in the oppo-
site direction(s) to compensate —
those components being elements of
either the lens or the sensor. You can
turn off the vibration-reduction fea-
ture when you don’t need it. An anti-
shake on/off switch is shown in the
lower-right corner of Figure 7-5.
The mechanics of image stabilization
work very quickly, although not
quickly enough to avoid slowing down
camera operation a tad. That’s why IS is best suited for countering camera
shake when taking pictures of relatively slow-moving subjects, when using
longer exposures, or for shooting with telephoto lenses without a tripod.
Although many photographers use IS for sports photography, the small delays
it introduces can be annoying — the dSLR equivalent of shutter lag.
IS allows you to hand-hold your camera at shutter speeds roughly four times
longer than you could manage without image stabilization. If you can hold
your camera steady at 1⁄60 of a second, you can get the same results with IS at
1⁄15 of a second. Those extra two stops of exposure might mean the difference
between not being able to take the picture at all and getting a well-exposed
shot at a decent aperture.
The following scenarios offer a close-up look at how image stabilization
works in different circumstances:
 You’re shooting a poorly lit subject and you need an exposure of 1⁄60 of
a second at f/2. Oops! Your zoom lens has a maximum aperture of f/5.6.
With image stabilization cranked up, you can go ahead and shoot at the
equivalent exposure of 1⁄15 of a second at f/5.6 and expect the same
amount of sharpness from a camera steadiness perspective.
Of course, if your subject is moving too much for capture at a slow shut-
ter speed, that’s another story. I took photos of my son’s high school

stage performance last fall by using the 1⁄15 of a second and f/5.6 combina-
tion. I ended up capturing razor-sharp scenery, but the expressive
hands, arms, and mouths of the actors were often lost in blur!
 You’re using long lenses and shutter speeds that are high, but not quite
high enough, such as if you’re shooting wildlife (or even sports, if you
can put up with the slight delay). In this case, IS can offer extra steadiness
to compensate for the shake that long lenses can introduce. For example,
you might find that shooting at 1⁄500 of a second at f/16 and ISO 400 with a
500mm lens is correct from an exposure standpoint, but your front-heavy
lens causes enough wobble to blur photos even at that shutter speed.
With IS, you can retain the 1⁄500 of a second shutter speed and the depth-of-
field provided by the f/16 aperture, but with enough steadiness to make
your image tack sharp. Figure 7-6 shows a pair of images shot with a
400mm lens at 1⁄200 of a second, both with and without image stabilization.
Tracking this bird in flight made holding the camera steady difficult at 1⁄200
of a second (top), but I got a sharp image of the same bird a few minutes
later at the same speed with image stabilization turned on (bottom).
Figure 7-6: Image stabilization made it possible to shoot this bird 
hand-held with a long lens.

Time Waits for Someone: Creating 
Time-Lapse Sequences
Walt Disney didn’t invent time-lapse photography, but some of the most mem-
orable nature sequences ever filmed were early Disney films of flowers blos-
soming or the sun marching across the sky in the Painted Desert. Today,
time-lapse imaging is so easy that people use it for transitions and segues in
television shows. Just set up a motion picture or video camera, pop off a
frame every minute or hour or day, project the sequence at the normal 24 or
30 frames per second (fps), and you have a time-lapse movie.
Your digital SLR can easily produce the same kind of sequences. You can
snap off pictures at preset intervals to document a flower opening, a butterfly
emerging from its chrysalis, or the construction project across the street. All
you need is a willingness to tie up your camera for the necessary period of
time and some means of tripping the shutter at the proper times. Of course,
you can trip the shutter manually if you have the patience.
Some non-SLR digital cameras have built-in timers that trip the shutter for
you. With digital SLRs, however, it’s more common to tether the camera to a
computer with a USB cable and allow computer software to take the expo-
sures. This method makes sense for several reasons:
 Time-lapse photography uses a lot of juice. Consequently, it’s a good
idea to keep the camera close to a computer and an AC power source. If
your sequence takes more than an hour or two, your camera’s battery
probably can’t supply the power needed to take the photos. So, you’ll
want to connect your camera to an AC adapter plugged into the same
power that keeps the attached computer running.
 Long sequences tax your camera’s internal storage. If you want to use
the maximum resolution your dSLR offers, you might find that a single
memory card fills up before your sequence is done. Systems that tether
the camera to a computer save the images directly onto the computer’s
hard drive.
 Computer-driven time-lapse photography can be more sophisticated.
Most of the software programs used for this kind of work can automati-
cally assemble your finished shots into a movie.
Experiment with time-lapse photos to see your world from an entirely differ-
ent perspective. It’s fun!
Better Infrared than Dead
Feel like your creativity is on its last legs? Looking for a real challenge? Do a
little research and see whether your particular dSLR can handle one of the

Chapter 7: Special Features of dSLRs

132
Part II: Oh, Shoot! 
unexplored frontiers of digital photography — infrared imaging. It’s dark ter-
ritory (quite literally — you’ll be shooting blind), but it’s worth a long look.
Infrared (IR) photos have a particu-
lar, otherworldly look. Skies are
dark, clouds stand out in sharp
relief, and foliage appears ghostly
white, as you can see in Figure 7-7.
Human faces are pale and lack tex-
ture. The pictures are grainy and
sometimes seem to glow with an
inner light. You’ll either love or hate
these effects after you take the time
to explore them for yourself.
Some digital SLRs are better suited
to IR photography than others.
That’s because most models include
an IR-blocking filter called a hot
mirror to filter out most of the longer
wavelengths of light that encompass
the infrared band. As luck would
have it, digital sensors are quite
sensitive to infrared, but that sensi-
tivity leads to poorer photographs
in visible light. Thus, you need an 
IR-blocking filter.
Luckily for photographers interested
in infrared imaging, some of these fil-
ters do a worse job than others in blocking the IR illumination. Your own
dSLR might be one of those capable of taking infrared pictures. A quick way
to tell is to point a remote control at your lens and snap off a picture with a
button on the remote depressed. If you can see the glow of the remote con-
trol’s IR burst in the image, you’re in business.
In addition to the hot mirror, watch for infrared blockers on your lens, too. A
few lenses from Canon and other vendors have an anti-IR coating that can
produce a bright spot in the center of your image. If you have this problem,
switch to a different lens or try to correct the spot in your image editor.
To start taking infrared photos, all you need is a special filter and some
patience:
 The filter blocks visible light but lets infrared light though. Don’t con-
fuse this infrared filter with the hot mirror I just mentioned.
Figure 7-7: Infrared images are otherworldly in
appearance.

 Patience is essential because even with the most IR-worthy dSLRs,
most of the infrared light is still filtered out. Enough infrared light
remains to take a picture, but you’ll have to use long exposures for best
results. I’ve taken IR photos at 1⁄30 of a second with my lens wide open
and ISO set to 1,600, but they’ve been fuzzy and lacked depth-of-field.
 For better results, use normal ISO settings and mount your camera on
a tripod. The tripod helps because you’re shooting blind. Any IR filter
you use removes virtually all visible light, so the view through your
viewfinder is totally black. Digital SLRs generally don’t provide an LCD
preview, so you can’t frame your photograph that way.
In Chapter 15, you find details on choosing a filter and steps that walk you
though taking infrared photos.
When the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro UVIR D-SLR was introduced, infrared fanat-
ics (as well as the scientists and law enforcement technicians for whom the
camera was intended) were well pleased. The camera is a version of the com-
pany’s S3 Pro series digital SLR (first introduced in 2004), with some tweaking
to allow it to capture light in both the ultraviolet and infrared ranges as well
as visible illumination. It’s an interchangeable-lens camera based on Nikon
components, can use Nikon lenses (with the same 1.5X crop factor), and
costs several thousand dollars.
The S3 Pro UVIR isn’t really practical for photographers who don’t have scien-
tific or forensic applications for it, unless you’re really, really interested in IR
work. It’s expensive, and it doesn’t really represent visible light subjects (shot
without any filtration) very well. Its conventional photos have a bit of a red
tint for many subjects and quite a rich red or orange cast in plants and other
IR friendly subjects. IR pictures require a Wratten #89B filter, which, of course,
removes the visible light with this camera the same as it does with any other
digital camera. Fujifilm’s solution is to provide a 30-second grayscale preview
image on the LCD, which can be used for framing and evaluation.
Dust Off
Another new feature found in some dSLRs is a built-in automatic dust
removal system (as opposed to the non-built-in manual dust removal proce-
dures I outline in Chapter 4). These usually work like the system found in the
Sony Alpha models: The same sensor-shifting technology used to provide
anti-shake features is employed to produce a little vibration (usually when
the camera is turned off) that bounces any dust or other particles that have
found their way onto the sensor off the filter covering the sensor and onto a
flypaper-like sticky strip at the bottom of the chamber.
At this time, such dust-removal systems are found only in cameras with inter-
nal image stabilization. You can expect them to become more popular as
additional vendors add anti-shake features to their designs.

Working with RAW
and Other Formats
In This Chapter
 Discovering all those formats
 Understanding dSLR format options
 Choosing the right file format
 Using RAW as a digital negative
You can find many bones of contention in the digital SLR world, but the
choice of file format is one of the boniest. Some photographers swear by
RAW, a misnamed “unprocessed” format (RAW isn’t really unprocessed) that
supposedly retains all the information the sensor captures (it doesn’t).
Others scoff at RAW, feeling that the JPEG format is the key to
taking pictures most efficiently, with a minimum of after-shot
processing required. Old-school photographers might
insist that the TIFF format is the only way to go, despite
the fact that few digital SLRs even support that format
these days.
This chapter removes the mystery surrounding
RAW and other formats, and helps you choose
which one is right for you in any particular situa-
tion. Should you shoot RAW, JPEG, or both at the
same time? In the following sections, I explain what
you need to know to make that call.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
So Many Formats, So Little Time
The proliferation of file formats started with image-editing software. Dozens
of different schemes exist for saving image files, and most of the leading
image editors are forced to support just about all of them.
Unfortunately, digital cameras brought back the revenge of the format prolif-
erators, and it helps to get the lay of the land before you venture out to do
what should be so simple: Choose a format for saving an image. 
Digital SLRs today (except for a couple quirky cameras from Sigma) all support
JPEG because that format lets you squeeze more images onto memory cards
that have limited amounts of space. Even Sigma, which supported only RAW
with its original SD9 and SD10 models, has climbed on the JPEG bandwagon
with its latest SD14 model that provides three levels of JPEG compression.
A few (chiefly higher-end) dSLRs also let you capture images in TIFF format,
which is great at retaining detail but not so great at compressing photos to a
reasonable size. All dSLRs have the option of saving images in a proprietary
RAW format that supposedly preserves all the image detail and parameters
captured by the sensor.
In truth, that claim is not precisely true. The sensor data is processed quite
thoroughly by algorithms that convert the image from analog to digital form.
However, the resulting RAW data doesn’t have all the settings you dialed into
your camera (white balance, sharpening, color, and so forth) set in concrete.
When a RAW file is imported into your image editor, you can go ahead and
use those settings if you like, or — using the RAW converter software that
does the conversion — specify new parameters instead. That’s where the
“unprocessed” label gets hung on RAW files.
What!? Am I telling you that each digital camera vendor uses a different RAW
format? If only it were that simple! As it turns out, some camera makers have
created several different versions of their RAW format, each incompatible in
some way with earlier versions, so that instead of a dozen RAW variations,
you have to deal with several dozen. Here are a few examples:
 The different RAW formats for Canon dSLRs include CRW and CR2.
 Nikon has some slightly different variations of its format, including a
trick it unveiled a few years ago of encrypting the white balance informa-
tion of its newest cameras so that third-party RAW tools can’t interpret
it. (After much consternation and reverse engineering by other vendors,
Nikon ended up demystifying its encryption scheme.)
 Other vendors might use one RAW format for their dSLRs and another
for their high-end point-and-shoot models.

This mess was Adobe’s cue to get into the act, producing yet another format,
DNG (digital negative), which purports to support all the features of all the
other RAW versions, as a sort of standard. Adobe even provides a free Digital
Negative Converter, shown in Figure 8-1, should you want to change all your
current RAW files to the new format. 
Things get even more interesting when you realize that there is no standard
for naming the formats used within digital SLR cameras. Instead, the cameras
use names like Fine, Basic, Superfine, Good, Supergood, and so forth, provid-
ing no real clue to which format you’re actually choosing. The Superfine
option might represent TIFF on one camera and JPEG with minimal image
loss on another. Choosing the right format is difficult, but the following sec-
tions help clear things up.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Worth the Fuss: Understanding the Main Formats
I ignore the file formats used only within image editors and for applications
outside the realm of digital cameras, such as Web pages. These formats
include GIF, PNG, PICT, PDF, and BMP. Nice formats. Not relevant. B-b-b-bye!
When you’re trying to decide what format to shoot with, you need to look at
only TIFF, JPEG, and RAW, because that’s what digital cameras work with.
Each of these formats has its advantages and disadvantages, and that’s what
you really need to know about to make a wise selection.
Don’t get TIFFed
This format originated in 1987 with a company called Aldus, which developed
pioneering graphics and layout programs such as Freehand and PageMaker.
Intended as a standard file format for images, TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
incorporates descriptors called tags, which you can use to provide parameters
for any special features included in the file. Theoretically, an application could
include any kind of information it liked in a TIFF file — such as layers, objects,
special color information, and selections — and tell any other application
attempting to read that TIFF file how to retrieve the special data.
Along came a proprietary format
Did you know that Photoshop gives you the
option to save your images in almost two dozen
different formats right out of the box? Do you
know what RLE or PXR or TGA formats are, or
what applications create or need them? Or why
these formats exist at all?
I’m sure each of the various file formats must
have seemed like a good idea at the time. The
ostensible reason for creating a particular
format is that the software vendor wanted to
add special features (such as the layers in the
Photoshop PSD format) that weren’t possible in
other formats. Presto! A new file format is born
that includes support for the new feature.
Of course, back in the dark ages of computing,
another reason for creating a proprietary format
existed: It tied buyers to the particular applica-
tion that relied on that particular format. If you
liked PixelPaint (I’m not making the name up; it
was a Macintosh program that flourished in the
early 1990s), you used the PixelPaint format —
and after you’d accumulated a few thousand
images in that format, you were pretty well
locked into that program. That is, you were until
a new, spiffier application came along, offering
support for the PixelPaint format and negating
the advantages of the proprietary feature.
Before long, most of the non-compatible formats
fell into disuse (although they remain as shad-
owy wraiths in many Save As menus). Virtually
all image editors support the Photoshop PSD
format, plus JPEG (created to provide extra-
small file sizes) and TIFF (the closest thing to a
standard high-quality format that isn’t tied to one
vendor). Image editors still have their own pro-
prietary formats, but users of those programs
are more likely to archive processed images as
PSD or TIFF.

In practice, the TIFF format’s versatility ends up making it possible to create
“standard” files that can’t be read by all the applications that have to work with
them, which is not an advantage at all. TIFF files run the gamut (ha!) from RGB,
CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black), and L*a*b color models to black/white
and grayscale images. It supports both 24-bit and 48-bit (high dynamic range)
color depths, and it can be squeezed down without losing any picture informa-
tion by using optional Huffman encoding, LZW, or PackBits. (If you don’t know
what some of these are, consider yourself lucky; they aren’t important for day-
to-day shooting.) Adobe acquired Aldus in 1994, and today offers options for
saving Photoshop layers and selections right in a TIFF file.
To make things even more interesting, some of the RAW formats I discuss a
bit later in this chapter are actually TIFF files with some headers that trans-
form them from standard TIFF into a vendor-specific format that requires spe-
cial software to read.
Keep in mind these two important TIFF-file facts: 
 TIFF files are lossless. They don’t discard any of your image information.
 TIFF files are much larger than
JPEG and RAW files. The larger
size can increase the time it
takes for your camera to store
them on a memory card. In my
tests, files that take only a few
seconds to write to a memory
card in RAW format can take 20
seconds or more as TIFF files. 
The third most important thing to
keep in mind is that fewer dSLRs
offer a TIFF option these days; most
that do are professional-level cam-
eras, such as the Nikon D2Xs, as
shown in Figure 8-2.
JPEG o’ my heart
Virtually every dSLR currently on the market can create JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group) files. About 15 years ago, a consortium of the
same name created this format. (The consortium originally consisted mostly
of vendors such as Eastman Kodak Company, but it’s now overseen by an
international standards body.) The goal of devising the JPEG format was to
create files that are significantly smaller than is possible with formats like
TIFF, which compresses files somewhat without discarding image informa-
tion, and to make them readable by a wide variety of applications in a stan-
dard way.
141
Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats
Figure 8-2: Pro-level dSLRs still offer a TIFF file
option, as shown in this camera menu.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
The first JPEG-capable applications reduced the time needed to transmit
images by telecommunications links. The Internet wasn’t in wide use by the
public at that time. So newspaper photographers had to plug their unwieldy
portable computers (laptops of that era needed several laps to support
them) into devices called modems to beam their photographs back to the edi-
torial office over telephone lines. I am not making that up.
JPEG can reduce files by a factor of 20 or more by throwing away some of
your hard-won image data, in a series of processes that are intended to
reduce the size of the file by eliminating excess or redundant information.
JPEG compression first divides your image into luminance (brightness)
values and chrominance (color) information, on the theory that human eyes
are less fussy about color than they are about brightness. (That is, if you see
a stop sign that’s a slightly odd shade of red, you’ll notice that less than if the
same sign were darker or lighter than you’d expect.) It’s the excess color
information that’s discarded.
The process slices your image into cells, say 8 x 8 pixels on a side, and then the
process looks at each of the 64 pixels in the resulting chunk individually. Using
mathematical trickery called Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT), the com-
pression process discards pixels that have the same value as those around
them. (You don’t have to remember things like Discrete Cosine Transformation
unless you’re trying to impress someone at a party.) Next, quantization occurs,
during which pixels that are nearly the same color are converted to a common
hue, and the picture information that’s left is transformed into a series of num-
bers, which is more compact than the original information. (It’s a bit like writ-
ing 1500 instead of one thousand five hundred.) If everything is done properly,
the process compresses the image by 5X to 20X or more, depending on what
compression level you’ve selected when you chose to save the file.
Because JPEG doesn’t keep all the image information, it is referred to as a lossy
format. Each time you load a JPEG image, make changes, and then save it again,
you run the danger of losing a noticeable amount of information because the
JPEG process occurs all over again — every time you save. The loss might be
very slight at first, but it can accumulate, as you see in Figure 8-3, which shows
a photograph that has lost sharpness after repeated savings.
What’s cool about JPEG is that you can dial in the amount of compression
you want, using lots of compression to produce very small file sizes (with an
attendant loss in quality), or very little compression to preserve quality at
the cost of larger files. What’s not cool is that there is no standard way of
referring to the amount of compression. Digital cameras tend to use discrete
steps with names like SuperFine, Fine, Normal, Good, and Basic. Image edi-
tors might let you choose a continuous compression/quality range from, say,
0 to 15 or 0 to 20. (The Nigel Tufnel in you might wish that your editors
offered an all-the-way-to-21 setting for when you need just that little bit of
extra quality, but unfortunately, the designers of these applications appar-
ently have never seen the movie This Is Spinal Tap.)

Figure 8-3: Repeatedly saving JPEG images can introduce artifacts into your photos. 
Instead, in-camera JPEG compression is a little like a box of chocolates: You
never know what you’re going to get.
The RAW deal
RAW isn’t really a single file format. It’s the broad term applied to all the pro-
prietary formats created by each digital camera vendor for its particular
product line. Every RAW format is different, which means that in order to
access a RAW file, you must have one of two types of programs: 
 Special software from your vendor designed especially for its RAW
format
 A third-party utility, such as Adobe Camera RAW (furnished with
Photoshop and Photoshop Elements), that is compatible with your par-
ticular camera’s RAW format
143
Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats

144
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Not all utilities support all RAW formats (not even the Adobe DNG converter),
so your choices for reading these files might be somewhat limited. It’s common
for support for a particular version of RAW to lag behind the introduction of
the camera that produces it for a few weeks or months, leaving you at the
mercy of the camera vendor’s utilities until everyone else plays catch-up.
You can consider RAW files to be your digital negatives because they haven’t
been subjected to the usual manipulations that your camera settings man-
date when the raw image data is converted to JPEG or TIFF. (See the section
“Using RAW Files as Digital Negatives” for more details.)
Choosing a File Format
So your choices boil down to TIFF, RAW, and JPEG (or, with some cameras,
saving in RAW and JPEG simultaneously). Which do you select? Your decision
might hinge on how you shoot and on what you plan to do with your files
after you’ve transferred them to your computer. Your available storage space
might also figure into the equation.
If you get good results most of the time by using your camera settings, don’t
want to do a lot of processing in your image editor, and are taking lots of pic-
tures, you might opt for TIFF or JPEG. TIFF gets the nod if you want the best
image quality (although, as I noted, it’s becoming rather rare as an option
with digital SLRs), but JPEG might be preferable if you’re on a trip and want
to make your memory cards stretch as far as possible. RAW could be best if
you plan on doing a lot of tweaking. These next sections explore these
options in a little more detail.
TIFF enuff
If your camera has a TIFF option, here are some factors to consider:
 Highest quality: Use TIFF if you want the highest-quality image in a
standard file format. This lossless format produces image files that
are theoretically and practically better than even the least compressed
JPEG image.
 Minimal post-processing: TIFF is a good choice when you’re generating
large numbers of images for distribution and want to apply a minimum
of post-processing. Perhaps you’re shooting a wedding or other event
and don’t want to laboriously apply individualized settings to each
photo with your image editor. If you carefully select your camera set-
tings so your TIFF files already have the exposure, color balance, sharp-
ness, and other attributes you want to end up with, you can safely save
your files in TIFF format and expect all or most of them to be good to go
right out of the box.

 Limited editing: TIFF is fine for images that will be manipulated in
Photoshop for improvements that don’t involve “unprocessed” RAW file
attributes. For example, if you’ll be retouching portraits to minimize
facial flaws or compositing several images into one, you really don’t
need to work from RAW images. TIFF serves just as well.
 Too slow for sports: TIFF might not be the best choice if you’re shooting
sports or doing continuous shooting and your dSLR takes a long time to
save such files to your memory card. Most digital SLRs store JPEG and
even RAW files much more quickly than they do TIFFs.
 Takes lots of memory: TIFF is a poor choice if your memory card space
is limited. If you’re on vacation and have only a few 1GB cards to use
between opportunities to offload your images, you’ll find that TIFF files
fill up the available media with alarming speed. (Your camera’s best
JPEG setting produces image quality that’s almost as good while con-
suming perhaps 10 percent of the storage space.)
JPEG junkies unite!
JPEG is a highly popular alternative to TIFF (for cameras that offer that
option) and RAW. Some JPEG junkies use nothing else for their original
photos. The format is compatible with virtually all applications, making
it as much of a standard as TIFF, and much more compatible than RAW
formats.
Of course, JPEG has that nagging loss-of-quality issue. You have to decide
for yourself how important that is. Ponder these points when considering
JPEG:
 Really minimizes post-processing: Everything I said about TIFF as an
option when large numbers of images are involved goes double for JPEG.
I don’t know a single wedding photographer who prefers to shoot and
work with RAW images, simply because they can’t afford to spend that
much time post-processing hundreds of images. I don’t shoot weddings
anymore, but I do photograph sports, and it’s not uncommon for me to
fire off 1000-1200 shots at a single game (blame my dSLR’s 5-frames-per-
second burst mode for that). I spend a little time before the contest
shooting test pictures and adjusting my color balance, sharpness, and
exposure to suit the conditions. Then I blast away, knowing that most of
my photos will require little or no post-processing.
 Gives you ready-made photos for Web display: JPEG is a good choice
for display on Web pages, like the one shown in Figure 8-4. Or, if you
want to distribute pictures in digital albums on CDs, in online albums,
or as prints no larger than 11 x 14 inches, the least-compressed JPEG
option your dSLR offers should produce files that are easily up to these
tasks.
145
Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats

146
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Figure 8-4: JPEG files are good for Web display as is.
 Good-enough quality: If you do end up editing JPEG files, you’ll find the
quality is good enough as long as you remember to save your final ver-
sion as a TIFF or Photoshop PSD file. You should always save your JPEG
files in one of those lossless formats after making changes. That helps
you avoid the quality loss that can result from repeatedly opening and
editing JPEG files. If you still need a JPEG file (say, for display on a Web
page), create one and retain your new TIFF or PSD versions in case the
image requires more editing later on.
 More compatible with software: JPEG can be more compatible with
some image-management/album-making software than other formats.
The ancient application that I prefer (which predates the term “digital
asset management” by about ten years) doesn’t handle RAW files at all,
so I always catalog a JPEG version of the file that’s produced at the same
time as the RAW file. (See the section “JPEG+RAW” later in this chapter.)
 Writes to memory faster: Your digital SLR probably can write JPEG files
to your memory card faster than any other type of file. This speed might
not matter if you’re taking only a couple pictures at a time; the photos
first go into the camera’s high-speed memory buffer, which sucks up
JPEG, TIFF, and RAW at similar speeds. However, writing these images to
the memory card takes longer, and after the buffer fills, you can’t take
any more photos until some shots make their way out of the camera’s

internal memory onto the card. I’ve used dSLRs that are so fast at writing
JPEG files to a high-speed 120X (or faster) CompactFlash card that I can
take sequence photos almost continuously for a dozen shots or more.
 Takes less room on cards: You can fit a lot more JPEG files on a memory
card of a particular size. A 1GB card can store about 300 photos snapped
with a 6-megapixel camera with the typical JPEG Fine setting, nearly 600
photos at a representative medium-quality setting, and as many as 1,100
shots at the highest compression setting. Only 180 RAW shots from the
same camera might fill a 1GB card. My 10-megapixel camera can fit 488
RAW images on an 8GB CompactFlash card, or more than 900 JPEG Fine
images.
I don’t usually recommend using card storage space as a criterion for
choosing which file format to use. I’d rather you purchase enough
memory cards, instead. However, in some situations (such as vacations)
storage is limited, and using the JPEG format, particularly the highest-
quality setting, makes a good compromise.
JPEG+RAW
Most digital SLRs include an option to save a pair of files every time a picture
is taken: one as a JPEG file and a second in the RAW format. Many cameras,
including modestly priced models from Nikon and Canon, let you select the
quality level for the JPEG version, so you choose between a high-quality JPEG
and one that’s more compressed and lower in quality. Other cameras have a
fixed JPEG quality level for the supplemental file; often the version that has
the highest compression ratio sets the quality level.
Saving JPEG+RAW is a valuable capability. It lets you shoot JPEGs for cata-
loging, reviewing, and use in less-demanding applications (such as small
prints, online auctions, and Web display), while retaining RAW versions as
digital negatives in case you need to do more extensive tweaking. Generally,
the image pairs share filenames (only the file extension is different), so it’s
easy to match them up.
The storage-card space penalty is fairly low. Even a 12-megapixel dSLR can save
198 RAW shots per 4GB card, and 132 JPEG FINE+RAW image pairs. It’s truly a
case of getting the best of both worlds. This is the mode I use by default.
Working RAW
Saving in RAW format is the best option if you frequently need to fine-tune
your images. RAW lets you make changes to settings that normally you apply
in the camera, either to individual files or batches of them. For example, if
you take a whole series of shots under a particular lighting setup and later
decide on a single group of settings to apply to all of them, you can do that
quickly with one batch process. Also, you can manipulate individual photos
to your heart’s content.
147
Chapter 8: Working with RAW and Other Formats

148
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Using RAW Files as Digital Negatives
The more you shoot, the more you realize that it’s always a good idea to have
that (relatively) unprocessed image as a sort of digital negative you can go
back to at any time to work with anew. These files can be a treasure trove of
images that will prove invaluable at a later time, whether or not you might
think so now.
Salvaging images from RAW files
However adept you may be presently, your image-editing skills will improve.
With an image saved in RAW format, you can salvage images that weren’t
usable before you gained new capabilities. Pictures that you didn’t think you
had any use for might turn out to be worthwhile with the passage of time.
For example, take the photo shown in Figure 8-5, which I sometimes use as an
example of how you can take photos in dim light without a tripod if you have
a lens with a large maximum aperture. It’s true that the original photo was
taken at dusk, and the camera wasn’t mounted on a tripod. It was taken with a
fast lens, too, exactly as described. However, as they say, here is the rest of
the story. (You’ll see that you don’t always need to have the patience of Ansel
Adams to take landscape photos.)
RAW in the raw
People often describe RAW files as “un-
processed” image files that contain all the infor-
mation captured by the sensor. That’s nonsense! 
As I explain in Chapter 2, the sensor catches
photons in little analog buckets (setting aside
the wave/particle duality of light, as well I
should!). The data collected is manipulated by
your camera’s digital signal processor, a special
chip that converts the analog information into
digital format. At the same time, the Bayer-
filtered image data that mimics separate red-,
green-, and blue-sensitive pixels is interpolated
to create three different color channels of 12 to
16 bits each. That’s a lot of processing right
there! 
All that preprocessing can have a significant
impact on the quality of your image, and that’s
beforeyour camera settings are applied. You can’t
do a whole lot to RAW files to reverse the
changes that have been made. What RAW does
for you is let you apply after taking the photothose
settings you normally make in the camera (such
as white balance, sharpness improvements, color
saturation, and to an extent, exposure). If your
shutter speed was too slow and you have a blurry
photo, you can’t fix that. If your f-stop was too
large and your depth-of-field is inadequate, you
can’t fix that, either. You can apply a little sharp-
ening, which might help somewhat in either case,
but you have no way to undo serious errors made
when you snapped the photo.

Figure 8-5: This picture wasn’t carefully composed. It was a grab shot produced from a RAW file shot on the
spur of the moment. 
I took the picture one evening when I was out scouting locations for future
shoots. I was driving across a causeway that crossed a lake a few miles from
my home, and I decided the view was interesting. While driving at 45 miles
per hour, I picked up my camera and shot the image shown in Figure 8-6
through the open right-side window of my minivan. (Don’t try this at home!)
The ISO sensitivity was at 1250, the camera was in Shutter Priority mode with
a shutter speed of 1⁄1,250 of a second preselected, and an aperture of f/2 —
chosen by the metering system — let me capture a relatively unblurred image
despite my relatively high motoring speed. I know all this information
because it was recorded in the EXIF data that accompanied the RAW file.
This was a grab shot in every sense of the word. Yet, when I needed a photo
taken in dim light with a large f-stop, this throwaway proved useful. Because
I’d saved in RAW, I was able to manipulate the photo a bit to make it a little
more interesting by cropping out the guardrail and portions of my vehicle.
Archiving RAW files
If you want to use RAW files as your digital negatives, you need to have a way
to store them, because they’re sure to eat up your hard drive space quickly. I
have virtually every image I’ve shot in RAW archived on my computer’s hard
drives as well as on DVD. That includes shots of my feet taken when I tested
an electronic flash, semi-blank frames that are seriously underexposed, and
all manner of out-of-focus and poorly composed pictures. As my example in
the preceding section shows, you never know when you might find some use
for a garbage shot.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Figure 8-6: Here’s the original RAW file before image editing. 
Blank DVDs are so inexpensive these days that you have no excuse for not
saving all your digital negatives. (Just don’t forget to copy them to whatever
format replaces the current DVD format in ten, or five, or two years.) With
most operating systems, all you need to do to archive files to a DVD is drag
and drop them to the DVD drive.
Finding RAW image-editing applications
Remember, to work with RAW files, you need an application that can read
them. A variety of RAW converters are at your disposal. Some of these are
provided by your camera’s vendor and, as you might expect, work only with
the RAW files for that line of camera. Unless you own several different digital
cameras from different manufacturers that can produce RAW files, these pro-
prietary converters might be all you need — or you can check out third-party
RAW applications if you prefer. The following sections introduce some of the
more popular proprietary and third-party applications.

Nikon Capture NX
Nikon offers the eponymous Nikon Capture NX, an extra-cost ($149.95) pro-
gram that handles both older and the latest versions of RAW files created by
Nikon cameras. Besides offering control over settings you could have made in
the camera, this utility provides some interesting additional capabilities. For
example, it can de-fish images taken with Nikon fish-eye lenses, producing
undistorted photos with straight lines where straight lines ought to be. This
is one way to get super-wide-angle photos from your trusty fish-eye lens.
Nikon Capture NX, shown in Figure 8-7, has a separate lightness/chroma/hue
palette for modifying these image attributes directly, along with post-shot
noise-reduction features and vignette control to remove (or add)
darkening/lightening to the corners of photos. Also handy is an image-dust-
off feature that compares your shots with a dust reference photo and
removes spots caused by dust on the sensor. 
Figure 8-7: Nikon charges $149 extra for Nikon Capture NX, but the extra features it offers are
worth the cost.

EOS Utility/Digital Photo Professional
Canon provides these software utilities for viewing/converting RAW images
taken with Canon cameras, and for controlling the camera remotely. The EOS
Utility is a bare-bones program; most dedicated Canon shooters prefer Digital
Photo Professional, shown in Figure 8-8.
Digital Photo Professional offers much higher-speed processing of RAW
images than was available with the late (not lamented), sluggardly File
Viewer Utility formerly offered for Canon cameras (it’s as much as six
times faster). Canon says this utility rivals third-party stand-alone and 
plug-in RAW converters in speed and features. The program supports
both Canon’s original CRW format and the newer CR2 RAW format, along
with TIFF and JPEG.
Figure 8-8: Digital Photo Professional is an advanced RAW file utility for Canon dSLRs. 

You can save settings that include multiple adjustments and apply them to
other images, and use the clever comparison mode to compare your original
and edited versions of an image, either side by side or within a single split
image. The utility allows easy adjustment of color channels, tone curves,
exposure compensation, white balance, dynamic range, brightness, contrast,
color saturation, ICC Profile embedding, and assignment of monitor profiles.
A new feature gives you the option to continue editing images while batches
of previously adjusted RAW files are rendered and saved in the background.

a long list of RAW formats from vendors including Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fuji,
Olympus, Pentax, and Sigma. It does most of the general-purpose RAW con-
version tasks that the vendors’ own utilities handle, and it has the advantage
of working transparently with lots of different RAW formats, plus Adobe’s new
DNG format.

swapping the colors around (red for blue, blue for green, and so forth) to
create false-color pictures. 
Phase One’s C1 Pro (see Figure 8-10) is the gorilla at the high end of the price
scale, and this premium Windows/Macintosh program for professionals does
everything, does it well, and does it quickly. Phase One has taken pity on us
mere mortals and also provides several budget “lite” versions with a limited
feature set and a more affordable price.
One of my personal favorites among third-party RAW converters is Bibble
Pro, which now also incorporates Noise Ninja noise-reduction technology. It
supports one of the broadest ranges of RAW file formats available (which can
be handy if you find yourself with the need to convert a file from a friend’s or
colleague’s camera). Available formats include NEF files from Nikon D1,D1x/h,
D2H, D100; CRW files from the Canon C30/D60/10D/300D; CR2 files from the
latest Canon cameras, ORF files from the Olympus product line, DCR files
from the Kodak 720x/760/14n; RAF files from the Fujifilm dSLRs; PEF files from
Pentax, and so on. Bibble Pro is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and,
believe it or not, Linux.

T
he difference between a novice digital photographer and one with some
solid experience is often apparent in how the shooter handles more chal-
lenging photographic situations. Action photography, electronic flash photog-
raphy, and situations that combine both electronic flash and available
light seem to be the trickiest for photographers making the tran-
sition from neophyte to grizzled veteran. (Nobody really
looks forward to being grizzled, but remaining a neophyte
forever isn’t a pleasant prospect, either.) These types of
photography all offer challenges on both the technical
and creative levels. If you can handle them, you can
tackle anything.
This chapter looks at some of the technical stuff
you need to understand to make the transition,
while taking top-notch action, flash, and sequence
photos. Although you find a bit of nuts and bolts
here, stay calm and stick it out — my intent isn’t to
make you go nuts and bolt!

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Kind of a Lag
Shutter lag, first-shot times, and those annoying pauses between photos do
more than interrupt your photographic momentum — they can cause you to
miss photos. Fortunately, of all digital cameras, dSLRs do the best job of
reducing those awkward moments to a minimum. In the following sections,
you find out what causes this lag and what you can do about it.
Comparing point-and-shoot cameras with dSLRs
Users of non-dSLRs feel the pain of shutter lag the worst. Of the dozens of
point-and-shoot and electronic viewfinder cameras I test each year, most of
them average lag from 0.6 to 0.9 seconds when shooting photos under high-
contrast lighting (which makes it easy for the camera’s autofocus system to
lock in). In challenging low-contrast light, the best cameras average 0.9 sec-
onds, many can take up to 1.9 seconds, and a few pause for an interminable
2.5 seconds before squeezing off the shot.
If you want to know how much a one-second lag can affect a photo, check out
Figure 9-1. If you pressed the shutter release when the pitcher unleashed the
ball toward the first baseman (top), what you’d get one second later would
be the photo at the bottom, when the play was over and the action just a
memory. Personally, I think you’d prefer to get the shot shown in Figure 9-2,
an instant before the ball hits the defender’s glove and the base runner’s
hand brushes first base. Full disclosure: None of these photos were actually
taken with a point-and-shoot; I used a digital SLR that captured the beginning
of the play, the ending, and all the action in-between in a five-frame burst. But
the individual images demonstrate what you can capture — or not capture —
with a point-and-shoot camera.
The final version is the sort of picture you can expect to take with a digital
SLR. These cameras operate on a different plane of existence. Most of the
time, such a camera seems to take the picture as soon as you press the shut-
ter button. The actual elapsed time might be 0.2 seconds, or at least three
times faster than what you get with a typical point-and-shoot digital camera.
Shutter lag of any length can cause you to miss a photo, particularly if you’re
engaged in action photography or shots of children and animals, where the
difference between capturing the decisive moment and capturing the not-
interesting moment after the decisive one can be measured in milliseconds.
Shutter lag can be a problem with portraits, too. You say, “Smile!” and your
subject smiles, but then she frowns when nothing happens. Guess which
expression you’re most likely to capture?

Figure 9-1: Press the shutter release when the pitcher releases the ball (top), and a point-and-
shoot camera doesn’t actually capture the image until as much as a full second (bottom photo).

Understanding the sources of lag
Shutter lag is primarily caused by the delay in locking in autofocus between the
time when you press the shutter release halfway and when you fully depress it
to take the picture. But this isn’t the only factor you want to be aware of.
There’s a secondary kind of lag that can’t be blamed on a camera’s pokey
autofocus system. If you’re taking a lot of photos in a row and your camera
takes a long time to write them to the memory card (or your memory card is
a slow one that can’t accept data as quickly as your camera provides it), you
can run into unfortunate delays. Your camera’s buffer fills up, you press the
shutter release, and nothing happens.
But wait! There’s more! A third kind of delay can occur when you’re shooting
with electronic flash. It might take a second or two (or three, or four) for your
flash to recharge after you’ve taken a flash photo, and you’re either unable to
take a picture until the flash is ready or your camera goes ahead and takes
the shot and provides incorrect exposure.
Fortunately, you can do things to counter all these shot-to-shot delays. Read
on to find out how.

Minimizing shutter lag
As I said, even the best-performing dSLR might not take a picture at the exact
instant you want the shot to be captured. Hey, a 90-mph fastball travels 132
feet per second, so during a 0.2 second delay, the ball moves 26 feet. That’s
almost half the distance between the pitcher’s mound and home plate!
Here are some ways to improve your results:
 Anticipate the action. It takes practice, but you can press the shutter
release a fraction of a second before the action peaks. It helps if you
understand the activity so you know approximately when, say, a skier is
about to leap over a mogul, or you can tell the difference between a pump
fake and an actual forward pass. By shooting just prior to the decisive
moment, as I did for Figure 9-3, you can improve your timing.
 Take lots of photos. Hand-in-hand with the previous tip is the proviso
that you’ll end up missing that crucial moment quite a few times. If
you take lots of photos, you’re bound to get some good ones, and the
practice helps you improve your timing. The day before I sat down
to write this chapter, I photographed a professional women’s softball
game and took nearly 400 pictures over 6 innings. This wasn’t a scatter-
shot approach, attempting to get a good picture through dumb luck.
I was trying to take lots of good pictures in an attempt to get a few
great ones.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 Use your sequence capabilities. Your dSLR’s continuous shooting mode
can boost your odds by grabbing quick bursts of three to five shots per
second (or even more; Nikon and Canon offer pro models that snap off 8
to 10 frames per second). However, it’s also possible that all the pictures
in a sequence will be taken just before, just after, or between the best
moments, so burst mode isn’t a panacea.
 Understand your camera’s focus modes. You can help your dSLR lock in
focus more quickly by understanding how the individual focus modes
work. Single autofocus (AF-S) focuses the camera when you partially
depress the shutter release. That’s fast but may not result in a sharp pic-
ture if your subject is moving. Continuous autofocus (AF-C) focuses the
lens but continues to monitor the scene and then refocuses if the sub-
ject continues to move. That’s often the best mode for sports. But you
also need to understand how your camera uses various areas of the
screen, the focus zones, to select which subject to lock in on. Some cam-
eras can be set to focus on the nearest subject and ignore intervening
objects that cross the field of view for a moment (such as when a referee
passes in front of the camera while you’re trying to photograph a run-
ning back).
 Switch to manual modes. Although digital SLR autofocus systems are
remarkably speedy, they can be thrown off by rapidly moving subjects
or shift between the background and the foreground while you frame
your image. You might have better luck turning off the autofocus and
manually pre-focusing on a particular point, such as first base, the goal
line, or the position where an ice skater is expected to leap into a triple
axel. If you don’t expect lighting conditions to change much, use manual
exposure, too. Fewer automatic features can lead to a quicker response
from your camera.
 Lock and load. When using auto modes, follow the action and then lock
in exposure and focus by using the lock control provided by your digital
camera. When your camera is locked in for both exposure and focus
(usually by pressing the shutter release halfway), pressing the shutter
release the rest of the way takes your picture a bit more quickly.
Minimizing first-shot delays
Some digital SLRs take a while to “warm up” before you can take a photo. The
original Canon Digital Rebel was notorious for this, requiring up to three
seconds from the time you turned it on until it reported for duty. Worse, the
Digital Rebel tended to go to sleep as a power-saving measure while it was
turned on, resulting in multiple three-second delays during a shooting session.
This delay was largely eliminated in the Digital Rebel XT/XTi, which turns on
in less than half a second, a figure matched by most other digital SLRs on the
market today.

You can virtually eliminate many first-shot delays with a simple technique:
Don’t turn off your dSLR! Point-and-shoot cameras typically go to sleep after
a few minutes because their LCDs drain so much juice. Digital SLRs use very
little battery power when turned on, so you can safely leave them activated
for hours (or days) at a time.
Digital SLRs are more power efficient because the LCD is switched on only
when reviewing pictures or navigating menus. The autofocus and exposure
systems turn themselves off after a few seconds if you aren’t actively taking a
picture, but both revive almost instantly when you tap the shutter button. A
few cameras, like some Pentax models, switch off the top-panel monochrome
LCD status panel, which is annoying but doesn’t contribute to too much
delay. Only the built-in electronic flash uses a significant amount of power,
and it, too, goes into standby automatically.
If you get in the habit of turning on your camera at the beginning of a shooting
session and not turning it off again until you’re ready to pack up the camera
and put it away, you avoid nearly all first-shot delays. Your flash needs to
recharge from time to time, but that doesn’t impact most of your photography.
Minimizing shot-to-shot delays
All cameras have an interval between shots that limits your ability to take a
new photo immediately after taking the last one. Most of the time, this delay
is negligible. That’s because digital SLRs typically have a good complement of
built-in super-fast memory called a buffer, which accepts photos as quickly as
you take them, freeing the camera to take another picture. As long as the
buffer retains enough room to accept new shots, you can take pictures as fast
as you can press the shutter release. The Sony Alpha, in fact, writes images
to your card so fast you can take pictures one after another for an unlimited
amount of time — until the memory card fills up, in fact.
Unfortunately, not all dSLRs have sufficient buffer memory for all the shots
you might want to take, particularly if you’re using the continuous sequence
modes. When that happens, delays can set in. Here are some of the things
you can do to minimize them:
 Monitor the buffer. Keep an eye on the buffer indicator in your
viewfinder. It might be a bar readout or numbers that show how many
frames remain. If you think a moment that might be more important
than the one you’re shooting now is imminent, back off and let your
buffer drain to make room.
 Get a faster memory card. As I note in Chapter 4, some memory cards
are faster than others. With some digital cameras, a better-performing
card can reduce shot-to-shot delays. When a camera feeds photos to the
memory card faster than the card can accept the images, a bottleneck
takes place, and the buffer can fill. A faster card just might eliminate the
problem. Note that this won’t work with every dSLR. Some have very
163
Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges

164
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
large buffers and can often write even to standard memory cards at
roughly the same speed while new images are captured. You might be
able to shoot photos all day and not notice any delay except, perhaps,
when shooting long bursts. A faster card is of most benefit for dSLRs
that have smaller buffers.
 Shoot at a lower resolution. I don’t advocate shooting smaller image
files (you never know when you can use the full resolution), but in a
pinch, you can switch to a lower resolution to increase the number of
shots you can take in a row. If rapid-fire is more important than image
quality, go for it!
 Enlarge your buffer. This is an unlikely option, but I’m mentioning it for
the sake of being complete. Some digital SLRs can be upgraded with
additional buffer memory by the factory for a reasonable cost. The
affected models are generally older, higher-priced professional cameras.
Your digital SLR is unlikely to have this option.
Minimizing flash delays
Your camera’s built-in electronic flash can cause delays when you’re forced to
wait for it to build up a full charge between shots. Some cameras have a
useful option of locking the camera to prevent taking a photo before the flash
is recharged, which blocks spoiled photos but obviously doesn’t eliminate
the annoying delays. Others let you fire away, risking an underexposed photo
if the flash doesn’t have enough charge.
Keep these tips in mind when you want to keep shooting flash pictures with-
out pausing:
 Close-up shots use less power. If you’re taking close-up photos, you can
probably shoot quicker and with fewer delays than if you’re using up
your flash’s maximum power with every shot.
 Reduce flash power. A related technique you can use for photos taken
at lesser distances is to reduce the power setting of your flash. Many
built-in speedlights and external units can be set to 1⁄2, 1⁄4, or 1⁄8 power, or
can reduce power for you automatically at closer distances. If that’s all
you need, use it and enjoy faster operation.
 Use an external flash. The flash built into your camera sucks juice from
your camera’s main battery and so has been designed to use the mini-
mum amount of power necessary to do the job. This conservative
approach can mean slower recycling. External flash units that fit on your
camera’s hot shoe or use a connecting cable usually have beefier batter-
ies and recycle much more quickly.
 Use an add-on battery pack. You might be able to connect your external
flash to an add-on battery pack that offers really fast recycling, on the
order of a second or less.

Shooting in Sequences
In the consumer marketplace, very
cool features tend to filter down
from higher-end products to the gear
that we peons can afford. Power
seats and power windows once were
found only in pricey luxury cars, but
now you’d have a hard time finding a
vehicle without them. Speedy motor
drives on cameras, once the
province of professional photogra-
phers, eventually made their way
into the lowliest point-and-shoot film
cameras. And now, because burst
mode, continuous advance, or
sequence shooting is found on every
digital camera, you can also produce
a series of shots like that of a speed-
ing train, as shown in Figure 9-4.
The chief differences between the
continuous shooting mode found in
$149 point-and-shoot cameras and
your digital SLR are the speed, flexi-
bility, and number of shots that can
be captured in a sequence. Whereas
a basic digicam owner is lucky to
grab 2 frames per second (fps) for a
half dozen shots, digital SLRs typi-
cally can snap off from 6 to 24 pic-
tures at rates of 2.5 up to 10 fps
(with the pro models) without break-
ing a sweat. Your results vary
depending on the camera and format
you use.
As I mention earlier in this chapter,
sequence photography is no substi-
tute for good timing. You still get
better results by taking a picture at precisely the best moment than by cap-
turing random frames in great bursts of exposures.
165
Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges
Figure 9-4: Continuous shooting lets you
capture a sequence of shots.

166
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Your camera might have several different continuous modes, ranging from a
basic mode at 3 to 5 fps to a high-speed continuous advance of up to 8 fps.
The Canon EOS 1D Mark III offers 10 fps in a camera that offers a 1.3X crop
factor. Nikon’s D2Xs model achieves its 8 fps high speed only by cropping
the image from its 12.4-megapixel 4,288-x-2,848-pixel mode down to a 
3,216-x-2,136-pixel frame that yields a measly 6.8 megapixels.
Nikon’s solution is interesting in that it crops a cropped frame further, so the
D2Xs 1.5X crop factor becomes a 2X crop factor in high-speed mode. The
extra cropping is theoretically an advantage for digital photographers who
imagine that a highly cropped image multiplies the focal length of their
lenses, as I expound upon at length in Chapter 6. Figure 9-5 shows the view
through the D2Xs viewfinder in cropped high-speed mode. The inner bracket
represents the area of the cropped image.
To use your digital camera’s burst mode, all you need to do is activate it and
then fire away, taking into account the need for good timing, the capacity of
your camera’s buffer, and all the other tips for minimizing delays, which I 
discuss in the earlier section, “Kind of a Lag.”
Figure 9-5: Some cameras crop the field of view when shooting at the highest frame rates.

Stopping Action in Its Tracks
Freezing action isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. My recent foray into pro softball
shooting had some strange results, as you can see from Figure 9-6. I was test-
ing a long lens to see whether I could successfully hand-hold it, and I bumped
up the shutter speed of my dSLR to 1⁄2,500 of a second. That lofty speed did nul-
lify any camera shake, but it had the additional effect of freezing a hard-
thrown softball in midair.
Without the added dimension of a
little motion blur, you can’t tell
whether the ball is headed toward
the player or away from her (she’s
actually just thrown it), and it really
appears as if the ball isn’t moving at
all; rather, it seems to be suspended
from overhead by a string. This shot
wasn’t destined to be a prize-winner
anyway, but now, at best, it looks a
little weird.
The lesson here is that stopping
action completely might not be the
best idea unless the image contains
all the other elements of a good
action shot so that it looks like a
frozen moment rather than a staged
setup. Instead of completely stop-
ping all movement, you might want
to incorporate at least a little blur
into your shot to give it more of a
sense of excitement. For example,
motor sports look more realistic if
photographed with a shutter speed
long enough to allow the wheels to
blur. And, anyone seeing a photo-
graph of a helicopter with its rotors
stopped would expect to see it crashing to Earth in the next moment.
The key to stopping action successfully (and believably) is to choose the cor-
rect shutter speed. Your shutter slices off little moments in time; the briefer
the exposure, the smaller the slice and the less blur-causing subject move-
ment. To make things interesting, your shutter sees motion at the same speed
in different ways, depending on which way the subject is moving:
 Across the frame: Motion parallel to the width or height of the frame
seems to move fastest to the sensor, and the subject blurs more easily.
Higher shutter speeds, from 1⁄500 to 1⁄2,000 of a second in many cases, are
required to stop this motion, compared to movement in other directions.
167
Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges

from a string, not flying through the air.

168
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 Toward the camera: Motion moving toward you appears to have a much
slower rate of speed, and such subjects blur the least. You can use a
much slower shutter speed to freeze this kind of motion. For some kinds
of subjects, shutter speeds of 1⁄60 to 1⁄250 of a second might work.
 Diagonal motion: This type of movement falls between the first two. An
automobile going from the upper left to the lower right is crossing the
frame at the same time it’s coming toward you, so you need an interme-
diate shutter speed, on the order of 1⁄125 to 1⁄500 of a second.
 Close up/distant: Subjects closer to the camera cross the frame more
quickly than those farther away, and so require a higher shutter speed.
 Relative speed: If you move the camera in the same direction as the sub-
ject’s motion — a panning technique — the relative speed difference is
less, so you can use a lower shutter speed. The next section has some
tips on panning.
Going with the flow (or, panning)
The term panning comes from the word panorama, or “whole sight” if you
happen to speak Ancient Greek in the home. It refers to an unbroken view
of an area, like the view a motion picture camera produces when rotated
smoothly from side to side. Panning is always horizontal; tilting is the
vertical equivalent.
In either case, because the swiveling motion of the camera (usually) follows
the direction the subject is moving, the subject appears to the camera to be
moving at a slower rate of speed and can be captured at a slower shutter
speed. The result is shown in Figure 9-7, which was taken at 1⁄4 second with
the camera following the player attempting a lay-up. The static background,
which isn’t moving at all, appears to be blurry, and so do the other players
who could be stopped, moving slower than the player in the center of the
frame, or moving in another direction.
You can pan with a hand-held camera or with a camera mounted on a tripod
that has a swiveling panorama (pan) head. Here are some tricks to getting
good panned shots:
 Have the right attitude. To pan without using a tripod, position your
body so you’re facing in the direction at the end of the pan. Then twist
to the start position and untwist while you follow the action smoothly,
triggering the shutter when you want to snap a picture.
 Level your platform. To pan with a tripod, make sure the tripod and pan
head are level with the direction of the movement so that when you
rotate the camera, it follows the action smoothly.

 Practice, practice. Try out your pan a few times before you actually take
a picture. When you practice, your technique improves.
 Move smoothly. Don’t use jerky movements. Follow the movement of
your subject closely.
Catching peak action
Many kinds of action culminate in a peak — the motion stops for a moment
before resuming. A basketball player at the top of his or her leap before
uncorking a jump shot, a ski jumper at the apex of a soaring flight down a
slope, or a roller coaster poised at the top of a hill can all be captured at rela-
tively slow shutter speeds. Figure 9-8 shows a running back bursting through
the offensive line as his teammates engage all but one of the opposing players.
Most of the movement had stopped when the linemen butted heads, and the
halfback was running toward the camera. So, a shutter speed of 1⁄250 of a second
was fast enough to stop this action.
Figure 9-7: A shutter speed of 1⁄4 of a second and panning allowed the player in the center to
appear sharper, adding a feeling of motion to this shot.
169
Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges

170
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Figure 9-8: A shutter speed of 1⁄250 of a second was fast enough to stop this action.
You can find lots of action peaks that don’t involve sports, too. Your child on a
swing can be frozen for an instant at each end of the swing’s arc. Birds in flight
stop pumping their wings and ease into a lazy glide to ride thermal currents.
The magic bullet for catching peak action is patience and perseverance.
Figure out just when the crucial moment is likely to occur and then time your
shot accordingly.
Zapping action with flash
Electronic flash units are still sometimes called strobes, after the stroboscopes
used by Dr. Harold Edgerton at MIT to freeze shattering light bulbs and to stop
bullets in flight. When flash is used as the only source of illumination in a photo,
it can be very effective at stopping action because of its very brief duration.
Indeed, most electronic flashes built into digital SLRs have a maximum dura-
tion of about 1⁄1,000 of a second and might last only 1⁄50,000 of a second or less when
used for close-up photography. That’s because the most effective way of con-
trolling the exact output of a flash is to limit the length of time that the
energy stored in the unit’s electrical capacitors is emitted. To produce a
small blip of light, the flash releases only a tiny amount of energy in a very
short time. To produce more light, give the blip a longer duration.

If the shutter speed and f-stop you use to capture an image with the flash is
such that the continuous or ambient illumination isn’t strong enough to regis-
ter, the image is produced by the flash alone, so your camera’s actual shutter
speed is irrelevant. That is, you might be shooting at 1⁄250 of a second at f/8, but
action is stopped by the electronic flash’s 1⁄2,000 of a second duration.
You find out more about flash in the next section.
Flash in the Pan: Other Keys
to Good Flash Photography
Actually, you can use flash while panning (or when your subject is moving) to
produce an interesting effect, but I save that for a bit later in this section.
First, it helps to understand a few concepts about using flash, whether you’re
applying this tool to action photography or other types. In the following sec-
tions, I help you understand how flash works at different distances, how to
sync flash and the shutter to get the effect you want, and other techniques
that can help you improve your flash photography in less than 1⁄500 of a
second.
Understanding flash at different distances
The most important flash fact to remember is that electronic flash differs from
the continuous illumination you know as daylight in one important respect:
Daylight appears to be relatively even at most working distances, but the
brightness of flash diminishes rather quickly as the distance between the sub-
ject and the flash increases. You can step 10 or 20 feet away from your subject
in daylight, and the exposure doesn’t change. Move the same distance from
your subject when using flash, and the illumination decreases dramatically.
That’s because electronic flash, like all illumination, obeys the inverse-square
law. Light diminishes relative to the inverse of the square of the distance. So,
if you’re photographing a subject that’s 4 feet from your flash, you need 4
times as much light when the distance is doubled to 8 feet, not twice as
much. That also means that if you photograph two subjects, one 4 feet from
the camera and one 8 feet from the camera, the more distant subject will be
underexposed by 4X (two f-stops) if the closer subject is properly exposed.
This pesky law applies to daylight, as well, but the distance between the light
source and subject is so much greater that you can ignore the consequences —
unless you plan on stepping back 93 million miles between shots.
171
Chapter 9: Action, Flash, and Other Challenges

172
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
In practice, your camera’s built-in flash probably doesn’t do a good job illumi-
nating anything 24 feet from the camera (say, a quarterback stepping back to
unleash a pass) unless you use a high ISO setting. Your flash has probably been
optimized to shoot subjects around 12 feet from the camera at around f/8 or so,
and it produces poor results at 24 feet, for which f/5.6 might be required. Those
kinds of situations call for more powerful, external flash units.
In addition to the sharp fall-off in illumination, using flash has some other
disadvantages:
 Flash photos can look harsh, with bright foregrounds and very dark
backgrounds, thanks to that inverse-square nonsense.
 Flash photos can produce a ghost effect when there’s enough ambient
light to produce a blurry secondary image along with the flash exposure.
 Electronic flash uses your camera’s internal battery at a tidy clip.
You can see why proper use of flash is one of the more interesting challenges
facing dSLR users.
That sync-ing feeling: Coordinating flash and shutter
Many new SLR owners become confused over the options for synchronizing
electronic flash with their camera’s shutters. This section clears up that
confusion.
As you might know, digital SLRs can use a combination of electronic and
mechanical shutters to control the length of time the sensor is exposed. An
electronic shutter is just that: The sensor is controlled electronically to allow
it to capture photons for a fixed period of time. The electronic shutter is used
for very brief exposures.
The mechanical shutter physically opens and closes to expose the sensor, and
is used for longer exposures, from 30 seconds (or whatever your camera’s
maximum exposure happens to be) to a length of time that is known as the
camera’s flash sync speed, which can range from 1⁄180 to 1⁄500 of a second. It’s called
that because it’s the fastest shutter speed that can ordinarily be used to take a
picture with the electronic flash.
The reason for that is easy to understand. The mechanical shutter used in
dSLRs travels in front of the sensor, just above the plane of sharp focus (and
is called a focal plane shutter for that reason). The shutter consists of two
curtains. The front curtain opens first, moving across the plane of the sensor
until it’s fully open. Then, after the sensor has been left exposed for the
desired amount of time, the rear curtain begins to follow it, gradually covering
the sensor until it’s completely concealed. Because of the brief duration of
the flash, the flash must be fired only when the sensor is entirely uncovered.
Otherwise, your picture consists of a partial frame, showing only the portion
of the sensor that happened to be uncovered when the flash went off.

You can synchronize the flash in two ways, each producing a slightly different
effect:
 Front-curtain sync: This is the default mode used by cameras. The elec-
tronic flash is triggered as soon as the front current has reached the
opposite side. This records a flash exposure of the subject. Then, the
shutter is allowed to remain open for the rest of the exposure. If there’s
sufficient ambient light and the subject is moving, you end up with a
streak in the direction of the subject movement, as if your subject was
preceded by a ghost. Most often, you don’t want to see that.
 Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, the flash doesn’t fire until the rear cur-
tain begins to move at the end of the exposure. The ghost image, if any,
registers first and terminates with a sharp image at your subject’s end
position. In this case, the ghost image trails the subject, like the cool
streak that follows the Human Torch everywhere, as you can see in
Figure 9-9. If you must have a ghost image (or want one), this is the
way to go.
What if you want no streak at all? In that case, try to use a shutter speed that’s
high enough that the ambient light doesn’t register an image. The higher your
camera’s flash sync speed, the better your opportunity for using a shutter
speed that’s so brief you won’t get a ghost image. Less is more: A  1⁄500 of a
second sync speed, like the one found on the Nikon D40, works better in that
regard than slower speeds, such as the 1⁄200 of a second sync speed of the Canon
Digital Rebel XTi or Nikon D40x, or the 1⁄180 of a second of the Pentax *ist DS.
Don’t confuse front- and rear-curtain sync with slow-sync, which is a digital
SLR option in automated modes that sets the camera to choose slow shutter
speeds to deliberately add exposures from ambient light to the flash image.
Slow-sync doesn’t work well with moving subjects; use it with the camera
mounted on a tripod so the background can be recorded along with the flash
exposure.
Figure 9-9: With rear-curtain-sync flash, the ghost image trails the sharp image of the subject.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Another flash sync option found on some dSLRs is high-speed sync, which
uses longer (but weaker) flash exposures to synchronize the flash at even
higher shutter speeds than the camera’s nominal flash sync speed. This
option is best applied to close-up photography, where the diminished flash
output is sufficient for a good exposure.
Getting the right exposure
Your dSLR most likely uses a dedicated flash unit designed specifically for your
camera, and it’s built right into the camera, mounted on top in the hot shoe or
connected to the camera with a cable or wireless triggering mechanism.
Dedicated flash units are commanded by the camera itself, which measures
the amount of flash that reaches the sensor and tells the flash when to shut
itself off. This is TTL, or through-the-lens metering, which is generally the most
accurate type of flash exposure calculation. Communication between the
flash and camera might also include information about which zoom setting is
being used on the lens (so the flash can change its coverage to match) and
what color temperature the flash emits (so the camera can compensate).
Flash exposure systems can also work with a preflash that’s used to calculate
the right exposure or integrate the distance data supplied by your camera’s
focus system to adjust flash output. There’s also good old manual flash expo-
sure, in which the flash pops at whatever power setting you specify (such as
full, half, or quarter power), and you set the f-stop yourself by using a flash
meter, guide number estimates, or good old-fashioned guessing.
Yo, Trigger! Setting Off an External Flash
The mechanism used to set off your flash involves some considerations, too.
Perhaps you want to separate an external flash from your camera by a distance
that’s too long for a connecting cable. In that case, you have a few options:
 Slave device: This activates the remote flash when its sensor detects
the light from your main flash.
 Slave units: These work well when you plan to use several electronic flash
units together. You can end up with brighter overall illumination or use
the positions of the different flash units to provide specific lighting effects.
 Wireless trigger: This more sophisticated approach sets off your flash
without the need for a main flash at all. The camera or a device attached
to the camera provides the signal that trips the remote flash unit(s).
These often have a selection of four or more channels, which let you
control flash units individually and also avoid conflicts with other pho-
tographers who happen to be using similar wireless devices at the same.
Wireless sync can operate by radio signals or low-power preflashes from
the main camera that don’t contribute to the exposure.

In addition to the type of trigger you can use for your external flash, I have
one more slightly important topic to discuss: how to avoid frying the elec-
tronics of your camera when using an external flash! Sounds like a good
idea, right?
All digital SLRs that allow connecting an external flash use a triggering circuit
that closes a switch that fires the flash. The triggering voltage from the flash
that passes through this switch in your camera might vary from a few volts to
250 volts or more.
Modern digital cameras might not respond well to voltages of more than
10 to 15 volts, and some very bad things can happen to the camera’s circuitry
if more juice goes through than recommended.
Flash units built specifically for your camera or for digital cameras in general
rarely cause difficulties. The problem seems to reside with older flash units
and newer cameras. One solution is to determine from your flash vendor the
exact triggering voltage. You can often find this figure on the Internet, and the
information is usually as reliable as any guidelines you find on the Internet
(which is to say not very). My preference is to use a voltage isolation device,
like the Wein Safe-Sync, which separates your camera from the actual voltage
used by the electronic flash.
The Safe-Sync, as shown in
Figure 9-10, receives the signal
from your camera and passes the
information along to your electronic
flash. The flash fires, your camera
isn’t fried, and everybody is happy.
You can mount the device in your
camera’s hot shoe and then slide
the flash into the shoe on top
of the Safe-Sync. Or, you can link
a flash with a PC cord by using
the connector on the side of the
gadget.

I
n some respects, a digital SLR makes achieving good composition a tiny
bit easier, even though the eye and skills of the photographer bear the
final responsibility. Some photographers say, with justification, that good
composition should be exactly the same whether you’re using a digital SLR or
the least-expensive point-and-shoot camera. Other photographers say that
those folks need to spend more time using a dSLR. Some significant
differences exist between composing photos with a snapshoot-
ing camera and a digital single-lens reflex, the primary one
being that you can do it.
Your basic non-SLR camera might rely on a tiny LCD
(liquid crystal display) that’s 3.0 inches diagonally at
the max (but likely a bit smaller). This LCD is easily
washed out in bright light, might be too dim to view
under reduced illumination, and is grainy and sub-
ject to ghost images if the camera or subject moves.
It might display only 85 percent or less of the actual
subject matter, and it probably turns off after a
minute or two because it hogs so much power. And
that’s the good news.
The bad news is that these cameras often have an alternate
viewfinder that’s even worse than the LCD. A viewfinder is a tiny
optical window that not only shows just part of the actual image, it shows

178
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
you the view uncentered. Depending on the location of the optical viewfinder,
it can seduce you into cutting off the top of your subjects and maybe a little
on the right side, as well. This paragon of technology doesn’t show depth-of-
field even as poorly as the LCD.
And it gets worse. The trend these days is to eliminate the optical viewfinder
on non-SLR cameras entirely, forcing snapshooters to hold their camera at
arm’s length so that they end up aiming the device in the general direction of
the subject they want to shoot, rather than creating a thoughtful composi-
tion. Truman Capote once said of Jack Kerouac’s work, “That’s not writing —
that’s typing!” The photographic equivalent is “framing — not composing.”
Think how much easier the typical dSLR makes your job of creating a photo-
graph. Your camera’s viewfinder probably shows 95 percent of the actual
photo at a magnification of 0.75X to 0.95X life size at a normal focal length
(roughly the equivalent of 45–50mm). You have a good idea of the depth-of-
field by default, and you can usually press a depth-of-field preview button to
get a better representation of what’s in focus and what isn’t. A digital SLR’s
viewfinder is live all the time — even when the camera is turned off, and the
view winks out for just a split second during exposure. There’s no ghosting.
You’re never in danger of cutting off your subjects’ heads.
So, coming up with a good composition when shooting with a point-and-
shoot camera is more than problematic — it’s an outright challenge. Given
that a dSLR makes it easy for you to compose images in the first place, be
sure to consider applying some of the tips listed in this chapter.
Composing a Photo: The Basics
Good composition is a little like good art. Even when people aren’t con-
sciously aware of all the components that go into great compositions, they
still know what they like. That’s because the very essence of composition is
to arrange subject matter in a way that both is pleasing and communicates
the message the photographer is trying to get across.
That communication can be very subtle. Once, I was watching one of my
favorite films by Japanese master Akira Kurosawa with the DVD commentary
turned on. The film scholar/commentator pointed out that when Kurosawa
wanted to express tension in a scene, he frequently arranged the actors and
their surroundings in triangular compositions. During calmer scenes, the
composition was more open and square-like.

When I knew what to look for, the late director’s compositional legerdemain
leapt off the screen, as obvious now as the methods were unnoticed before.
I realized that good composition can strongly affect my feelings about an
image, even if I wasn’t consciously aware of the techniques being used.
I help you understand some of the rules for composing images — and under-
stand when they can be bent or broken. Composition is all about communi-
cating messages in a pleasing way or, conversely, in a disturbing way if that’s
your intent.
Composing for message and intent
Before you can frame your image in the composition you desire, you need to
know what your messages and intent are. You don’t need to spend hours con-
templating your photo before you shoot. Simply keep the following questions
in mind while you bring your dSLR to your eye and compose your picture:
 What do I want to say here? Am I simply trying to portray my subject in
a thoughtful or playful mood, or is my intent to show the anguish and
hard life of a typical migrant mother? Am I looking to create a peaceful
shot of a forest scene, or do I want to show the ravages humankind has
wrought on the environment? Or, is my goal to make my client’s widget
look tempting so someone will buy it? Some good photos make state-
ments; others convey images of quality or affordability. A few more
attempt to evoke humor. If you know in advance what kind of message
you want to convey and who your audience is, you’re way ahead in the
compositional game.
 What’s my main subject? Wow! What a great lot of classic automobiles
all lined up at the drive-in. Wouldn’t that make a great picture? An array
of these cars might make a memorable shot — but it might not make a
good composition. Instead of trying to cram six autos into one shot,
choose one and let the others create an interesting background. Your
photo should always have one main subject, even if that main subject is
a group of people posing for a portrait.
 Where’s the center of interest? Your main subject is generally your
center of interest, and it probably shouldn’t reside in the center of the
photograph except when you’re shooting close-ups, portraits, and other
subjects that are naturally centered. But, if not centered, your subject
should be in a place that attracts the eye and encourages examination of
the rest of the image.
179
Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs

180
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
 Do I want a vertical or horizon-
tal composition? Digital SLR
shooters are much less likely
to fall into the trap that the
point-and-shoot set is subject
to — composing all photos
horizontally — simply because
that’s the way the camera was
designed to be held. A dSLR
easily pivots between vertical
and horizontal orientations
(some even have built-in or add-
on “vertical grips” with auxil-
iary shutter releases and
command dials). So, you can
choose vertical compositions
for tall buildings and NBA play-
ers, and you can use horizontal
layouts for ranch homes and
NFL quarterbacks who’ve just
been flattened by a linebacker.
Of course, you can always crop
your image from one orienta-
tion to the other within your
image editor, but that wastes
pixels. Figure 10-1 shows an
image that quite logically falls
into the vertical composition
mold.
 Do I want to print this image in black and white? In that case, textures
and contrasts can become a more important part of the composition.
 How should I arrange the subjects in my photo? Placement of the sub-
jects within the frame is a key part of good composition. You might be
able to move some objects or change your shooting angle to alter the
composition. The arrangement of your subjects determines how the
viewer’s eye roams around in the frame. There should be a smooth path
to follow, starting with your main subject and progressing to the other
interesting elements in the photo.
 Where should I stand? The distance from you to your subject and your
angle can have a dramatic impact on your composition. A high angle pro-
vides a much different view than a low angle, and shooting at eye level is
likely to be boring. Getting close emphasizes a subject in the foreground
while potentially minimizing the importance of the background. Backing
away can make the foreground appear to be more expansive. You have to
change your shooting angle by physically moving, but you can achieve a
specific distance by zooming, switching to a prime lens of a particular
focal length, or simply taking some steps forward or back. And in a pinch,
you can crop your photo in an image editor.
Figure 10-1: Some subjects are best suited for
vertical compositions.

 What’s in the background? Backgrounds can make or break a photo.
Sometimes you want a plain background to draw emphasis on the center
of interest. Other times the background is part of the composition and
adds interest. Take a careful look at what’s in the background before you
shoot. If you re-examine Figure 10-1, you see that the bush in the back-
ground could be a little distracting or, worse, could form a merger with
the lion statue. You find out more about mergers later in this chapter.
Applying the Rule of Thirds
Every book on photography you’ll ever read includes a blurb describing the
infamous Rule of Thirds, which posits that the ideal locations for objects in a
composition reside 1⁄3 of the way from the top or bottom margins and 1⁄3 of the
distance from either side. For example, in Figure 10-2, the Castillo de San
Marcos in St. Augustine, Florida occupies two such nodes at the left side of
the frame, and the horizon (the stone wall surrounding the castle) lines up
roughly 1⁄3 of the way from the bottom of the picture. Most of the books don’t
tell you exactly why dividing an image into thirds is such a good idea. After
all, couldn’t you follow the Rule of Quarters, the Rule of Fifths, or even the
Rule of Six and Seven-Eighths?
The origins of the Rule of Thirds
In reality, the Rule of Thirds wasn’t created by some all-knowing artist back
in the dawn of time, nor was it created arbitrarily. The Rule of Thirds was
created by Mother Nature herself. The ancient Greeks studied many of the
most pleasing works of nature and discovered that most of them adhered to
a specific proportion that could be described in a particularly harmonious
mathematical way.
They deemed this particular proportion golden and used it to construct a
Golden Rectangle, which, if its long side is defined as 1, the short side is 0.618
as long. Bisecting this Golden Rectangle produces Golden Triangles, and if
you do it enough times, you end up with four points that divide the original
rectangle into thirds. Zazaam! With all that math and natural beauty driving
it, the Rule of Thirds has to provide pleasing proportions. Of course, the typi-
cal digital film frame isn’t necessarily a Golden Rectangle, but the Rule of
Thirds can be applied nevertheless.
Putting the Rule of Thirds to work
To use the Rule of Thirds, try to locate your subjects at one of the imaginary
intersection points in the viewfinder. Remember that if your dSLR has
optional grid lines, they probably aren’t arranged to follow this rule. Also
know when to ignore the guideline. It’s okay to center your subject or locate
it at the far right, top, or bottom if you have good reasons for doing so. Most
close-up photos and many portraits, for example, place the subjects right in
the middle of the frame, usually because no other compositional elements
are in the photo that need to be arranged to provide balance.

image within the frame.
Posers and Poseurs
People photography is one of the most enjoyable types of picture-taking, and
digital SLRs are especially adept at it. Whether you’re posing friends, family,
and colleagues for casual or more formal portraits or attempting to catch,
say, the next rock star wannabe onstage, your dSLR has the features you need
to excel.
Compared to point-and-shoot digital cameras, digital SLRs provide more flexi-
bility in choice of lenses, more control over depth-of-field (so you can throw a
distracting background out of focus), and better image quality with the
longer exposures sometimes necessary for people shots at night. Despite all
you have going for you, be sure to keep the compositional tips in this section
in mind while you snap away.

You can use thousands of good poses for individuals or groups, but you don’t
need to memorize dozens of options to get good portraits. If you’re a begin-
ner at people pictures, you might want to look at some poses that work in
magazines and books. However, a few simple rules can help you build work-
able subject arrangements from scratch. Read on for details.
Shooting individual portraits
Portraits of individuals are theoretically easier than pictures of groups
because you have only one subject to worry about. Of course, you have to
please that subject with your results. Everyone wants to be portrayed in a
flattering way, and it’s the photographer’s job to see that a subject looks the
way he or she imagines himself or herself — or better!
Here are some tips:
 Make sure your subject is relaxed and comfortable. Sitting is better
than standing for anything short of a full-length portrait, and a stool is
often the best seat because no back or arms intrude into the photo, and
a perch on a stool discourages slouching. However, a picnic bench, a
handy rock, a fence, or even the kitchen table can provide a place for
your subjects to relax while you capture them for posterity.
 If your subject isn’t facing the camera, have him or her look into the
frame, rather than out of it. Otherwise, the viewer wonders what’s
going on outside the picture area that’s so interesting.
 Choose a good angle that flatters your subject. As I discovered from my
days photographing models, even the most attractive people can have
hands and feet that are positively grotesque when photographed from
their worst angles, which are the backs and palms of the hands and bot-
toms of the feet. Most of the time, bare feet won’t be a prominent ele-
ment in your portraits, but if you photograph the edges of hands, they
can become an expressive part of your photo. Exception: Baby hands
and baby feet can be cute from any angle, particularly to the parents and
close relatives. But be aware that some childless adults and a few other
types are powerfully sick of adorable pictures of somebody else’s kids,
so this charm isn’t necessarily universal.
 Compose your shot to de-emphasize problem areas. Bald heads aren’t
necessarily as problematic as they once were because athletes, musi-
cians, and those who aspire to coolness often shave their heads specifi-
cally to get the bare pate look. If your subject is sensitive about
involuntary baldness or if his or her particular attempt at being cool is,
um, let’s say, a poor implementation, lower your camera slightly and ele-
vate your subject’s chin. If you’re using external lights, avoid adding
glare to the top of the head.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Long, large, or angular noses might be a badge of honor and personality
for some, and perhaps a plus for thespians seeking character roles for
their distinctive faces. For everyone else, try having subjects face
directly into the camera.
Alfred E. Neuman, Dumbo, and H. Ross Perot just wouldn’t look the same
without their distinguishing ears. Less-famous folk sometimes appreciate
it if you minimize their prominent ears in photographs or, at the very
least, avoid making them the center of interest. Try shooting your subject
in profile or arrange the lighting so that the ear nearest the camera is in
shadow.
 Diffuse lighting to diminish defects. To minimize wrinkles or facial
defects, such as scars or bad complexions, use softer, more diffuse light-
ing. Shooting in the shade or
bouncing light off a reflector
(which can be something as
simple as a white shirt worn by
an assistant or passerby) can
provide a more flattering rendi-
tion. A diffusing filter on your
lens or diffusion added in your
image editor can help, too. Or,
zoom out or take a step back to
shoot your subject from the
waist up, as shown in Figure
10-3. That reduces the relative
size of the face in the final 
picture.
 Avoid reflections off eye-
glasses. Have your subject raise
or lower the chin a bit so the
glasses aren’t bouncing light
directly into the lens. If using
flash, position the flash at 
an angle. You can see many
reflections through your SLR
viewfinder, but for flash shots,
review your picture and reshoot
if reflections are a problem.
Shooting group photos
Group photography has all the potential pitfalls of individual portraits, multi-
plied by the number of people in the shot. However, the following special
considerations are unique to photographing groups:
Figure 10-3: Teenagers are often best pictured
with soft lighting in full-length or waist-up poses.

 Remember that each group shot is also a portrait of all the individuals
in the shot. The guidelines for creating flattering portrayals remain
basically the same. (I list the guidelines in the preceding section.)
Unfortunately, optimizing everyone’s visage in a single shot can be
tricky because you can’t have one person in profile, another from a low
angle, and a third with special lighting to minimize yet another kind of
defect. Fortunately, though, because individual faces in a group shot are
relatively small, these problems can take care of themselves as long as
you keep everyone relaxed and smiling.
 Watch the eyes! Make sure everyone in the photo is looking in the same
direction, which should generally be in the same direction their noses
are pointing. Check for blinkers and nodders, too. Try to take at least
one photo for every person who is in the photo (that is, at least six for a
six-person pose) just to get one in which everyone’s eyes are open. Then
double that number to be safe.
 Arrange your subjects into interesting patterns. Make sure that all the
heads aren’t in a single horizontal or vertical line, although it’s possible
to make exceptions for special poses, like the one shown in Figure 10-4.
 Triangular and diamond shapes work best for groups of three or four
people. If you have more than that in a shot, break them up into multiple
triangles and diamonds. Copyright restrictions dating back to the year
1662 prevent me from including in this book Rembrandt’s portrait we
know as The Dutch Masters, but if you Google this picture (or just buy
yourself a box of cigars), you see that it contains a cunning arrangement
of three triangles to represent just six people. The trio on the left make
up one triangle, the three on the right make up a second, inverted trian-
gle, and the same figures produce a third triangle if you look only at the
three gentlemen in the center.
Tips for Publicity and PR Photography
I made my living taking publicity and public relations (PR) photographs for
more years than I care to count, so you’d think I’d be competent at it by now.
I know enough that I can summarize the difference between the two in a
single sentence:
Publicity photography is intended to make someone or something famous;
PR photography is designed to make someone or something likeable.
A typical publicity photo might be one showing a rising 28-year-old TV/movie
star out on a date with a 45-year-old thespian whose career has seen better
days. If the picture captures the public interest, it’s likely to boost the careers
of both, regardless of whether it portrays the pair in a favorable light, and
regardless of whether it was taken by a paparazzo or supplied by a publicist.
185
Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs

186
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Figure 10-4: This shot works best in a nontraditional pose, with the mother and daughter
facing each other.
A publicity photo can also picture an object, rather than a person. Perhaps a
giant blow-up figure promoting a new movie has been stolen from the roof of
a fast-food restaurant and now resides on the front lawn of a college frater-
nity. Everybody wins here: the restaurant, the movie producers, and the col-
lege students who gain 15 minutes of fame.
Photos intended to improve PR are almost always provided by the PR agency
or publicist of the person or product that benefits. If the 28-year-old and 45-
year-old stars happen to be arrested after crashing a sports car through the
window of a jewelry store, you can bet that some PR photos will soon appear
picturing those same personalities doling out dinner at a soup kitchen or
entertaining the troops in some foreign country.
Of course, the approach isn’t quite that cynical in the real world, and both
publicity and PR photos can be used for quite serious and laudable purposes,
I’m told.

Your job, if you choose to accept it, is to create pictures that do their
intended job. As such, you must realize that publicity and PR photos don’t
revolve as much around a particular subject as they do a particular purpose.
Portraits, sports photos, landscape pictures, and even travel photography all
can be included in this category, so you’ll want to follow the guidelines for
each. But, in particular, keep these things in mind:
 These photos all have a particular message or two to convey. Your
composition should revolve around that message, whether you hope to
portray a particular person as a fine upstanding citizen, represent a
product as a good value, highlight a premium-priced luxury item, or
show a technological breakthrough that will save the world. Keep your
message in mind at all times.
 Keep It Simple, Silly (KISS). Exclude everything that doesn’t help convey
the message out of the photo. You don’t want viewers of the picture to
become interested in something else that they find more compelling.
 Look for unusual angles and
subjects. Your historical society
invited a William McKinley
impersonator to speak before
the group. Ho hum! If you want
newspapers in your area to run
your PR shot, avoid a tradi-
tional photo of the actor posing
with members of the group.
Instead, shoot an eye-catching
picture of him in character, like
the one shown in Figure 10-5,
and make the editor sit up and
take notice.
 If you’re shooting a PR picture,
you must represent the person
or product accurately, within
reason. If you don’t do that,
your image loses credibility 
and reputable news media will
decline to run it. No adding marbles to a bowl of soup to make the 
vegetables rise to the top. Don’t show your company’s CEO running a
marathon when the most exercise she gets in real life is pounding on
the boardroom table. That doesn’t mean you’re obligated to picture
every defect and problem, only that you shouldn’t deliberately use
your photographs to mislead the audience.
 If you’re shooting a photo for publicity, go ahead and ignore all the
advice in the preceding paragraph. Nobody takes your efforts seriously,
anyway. Your photos are desirable only if they’re a bit over the top and
187

perhaps more than a little sensational. A photo showing an Academy
Award winner punching out one of his mates in a bar is a lot more salable
than one of him mending a fence on his ranch. The latter is more likely to
be a PR photo released when he’s released out on bail, and a much
tougher sell.
Capturing Architecture
Architectural photographs frequently call for wide-angle lenses, which let
you take in large expanses of a building and its surroundings without having
to step back a mile or two. Indoors, the same wide-angle lens makes it possi-
ble to photograph interiors without having to step outside and shoot through
an open window. Wide-angle lenses also allow you to include foreground
detail, such as landscaping, which can be an important part of an architec-
tural photo.
On the plus side, the interchangeable lenses available for digital SLRs gener-
ally have a much wider view than you can get with even the wide-zoom model
point-and-shoot digitals. Several non-SLR cameras from Nikon, Olympus, and
others have wide-angle lenses that are the equivalent of a 24mm lens on a
35mm film camera or a full-frame digital SLR. However, those are relatively
scarce, and frequently, that isn’t nearly wide enough. Only digital SLRs allow
you to fit lenses as wide as 15mm for a true ultra-wide view.
Of course, the wide-angle perspective comes at a price, especially if you’re
using a digital SLR with the crop factor that comes with the territory in cam-
eras that have smaller than full-frame sensors. On a camera with a 1.5X crop
factor, a 20mm extra-wide lens becomes an ordinary 30mm wide-angle lens,
and 16mm ultra-wide optic has a 24mm view. Although you can readily buy
true ultra-wide lenses for your digital SLR — including zooms that take in the
equivalent of an 18mm full-frame lens at the wide end, and fisheyes — these
lenses can be expensive. My favorite fisheye zoom lens, a 10-17mm Tokina
optic, costs almost $600. Even so, if you want to shoot architecture fre-
quently, you’ll spring for the pricey lenses you need.
The next sections outline some of the details you need to consider when
shooting architecture, indoors or out.
Reeg, your perspective is out of control!
Whether it’s a good thing, most people take photographs with the camera at
eye-level and the back of the camera parallel to the plane of the subject, and
at right angles to the ground. I’m always harping about using interesting
angles, both high and low, but, most of the time photos are taken straight-on
with little or no tilting in any direction.

Wouldn’t you know it? Camera tilts commonly come into play when the
shooter is taking architectural photos. Outdoors, tilting the camera up is
often necessary to photograph tall structures, which seems like a good idea
until you see that the building appears to be falling back in the final picture.
That little bit of tilt can make the picture look somewhat bizarre, as you 
can see in Figure 10-6, thanks to a syndrome called perspective distortion.
Fortunately, unless you’re inside a cathedral or domed stadium, you probably
won’t need to tilt the camera upward, and you can avoid the most common
kinds of perspective distortion when shooting interiors.
Figure 10-6: Tilt your camera back, and a tall structure 
appears to be falling away from you.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
The most logical solutions for this distortion outdoors don’t always work
well. You can take a few steps back so you don’t need to tilt the camera (or
tilt it as much), but that often means that intervening trees, fruit carts in the
plaza, and other obstacles now intrude on your photo. A wider lens some-
times helps, although you’ll end up wasting a lot of pixels on foreground sub-
jects that you’ll end up cropping out of the picture.
If a handy building stands across the street, you might be able to ascend
about halfway up, shoot out a window, and take in both the base and top of
your target structure without tilting the camera at all, but you’ll rarely be that
lucky.
Your digital SLR might be compatible with any of the available perspective
control lenses, which can move their optics off-center enough to take in more
of a subject in any one direction without the need to tilt. However, perspec-
tive control lenses can cost a bundle, might not be available for your camera,
and are tricky to use.
Your best bet might be to do the best you can and then use your image editor
to correct the perspective distortion. Photoshop CS3 has a handy Lens
Correction tool, as shown in Figure 10-7 (choose Filters➪Distort).
Figure 10-7: Photoshop’s Lens Correction tool can help fix perspective distortion.

The Lens Correction tool can fix perspective distortion, correct chromatic
aberrations, and mend pincushion and barrel distortion (the tendency to
bow vertical and horizontal lines inward or outward, respectively). Apply
this corrective filter, and you can end up with an image like the one shown
in Figure 10-8.

Charge of the lighting
brigade
Architectural photos, indoors or
out, can also suffer from lighting
problems. As with other types
of photography, one of the
main challenges to you, the
photographer, is to make sure
the lighting helps render your
subject in the most suitable way
for the particular type of photo-
graph you’re taking.
In Figure 10-9, for instance,
I decided to let uneven lighting
work for me. The shadows of the
upper rafters of the railroad station
were dark, and the highlight areas
of the surrounding area washed
out, concentrating attention on
the platform area. In most cases,
though, you’re not so lucky, but
you can turn to Table 10-1 for

Most kinds of photography benefit from building a visual frame around your
subject, but architectural photos benefit more than most. If possible, frame
your main subject by using doorways, windows, arches, the space between
buildings, or the enveloping branches of trees as a pseudo border. Usually,
these frames are in the foreground, which creates a feeling of depth, but if
you’re creative, you can find ways to use background objects to frame a
composition.

Part III: Beyond the Basics 
Designing Your Landscape Photos
Landscape photography is another photographic pursuit that benefits from
the dSLR’s ability to use wide-angle lenses. Landscapes also happen to be,
after portraits, one type of photography that is most likely to be blown up to
huge sizes and displayed on the wall. As much as people love their loved ones,
they’re also fond of Mother Earth and enjoy sharing photographs of each.
Like architectural photography, landscapes lend themselves to contemplative
shooting. Scenery changes slowly over long periods of time, so Ansel Adams-
esque quests for the perfect angle, idyllic weather, and ideal conjunction of
the stars and planets are understandable and not at all unreasonable. Given
enough time to work with, you can use all the compositional suggestions that
I mention in this chapter.
Use curves, lines, and shapes, like those shown in Figure 10-10, to guide the
viewer’s eye. Fences, gracefully curving seashores, meandering roads, rail-
road tracks, and receding tree lines all can lead the viewer through your care-
fully crafted composition. Curved lines are gentle; straight lines and rigid
geometric shapes are more forceful. Although you can’t plan on moving
things around helter-skelter to improve your composition (rocks, mountains,
and streams pretty much must remain where you found them), you’re free to
change angles and viewpoints until your picture elements all fall into place.
Figure 10-10: Lines and shapes can guide your viewer through your photograph.

Landscape photography also happens to be one of the more happily gadget-
prone photographic pursuits. Gradient neutral density filters — dark on top
and clear on bottom — can balance a brilliant sky with the less-bright fore-
ground. Gradient color filters, which I describe in more detail in Chapter 15,
can blend a warm orange color on one half with a rich blue on the other, pro-
ducing an interesting split effect between sky and foreground.
Tripods are a valuable tool for landscape photos because they steady the
camera to help you take razor-sharp images that you can blow up to mam-
moth size. They’re also handy as a camera stand that keeps your lens pointed
in the right direction while you spend lots and lots of time thinking about
your shot. Panorama heads work in conjunction with your tripod to allow
leveling your camera while you crank off overlapping shots at the correct
intervals.
When you’re ready to shoot, keep some of these tips in mind:
 Avoid splitting your photo in half with the horizon. Remember that
Rule of Thirds! Place the horizon 1⁄3 down from the top if you want to
emphasize the foreground or 1⁄3 up from the bottom if the background
and sky are your most favored subjects.
 You don’t have to compose landscapes in landscape mode. Try shooting
some verticals. If you incorporate strong vertical lines, such as trees, off
to one side of the shot, your landscape photo can be naturally converted
to a vertical orientation.
 Shoot lots of sunsets (or sunrises if you’re that kind of person). Sunsets
and sunrises always look good because the light has a marvelous golden
quality, and they’re different each time — even if you shoot from the same
location. Remember that the sun rises and sets in a slightly different place
on the horizon each day of the year.
 Manually focus if you must. Autofocus systems sometimes have
difficulty finding enough contrast for focusing automatically, especially
if a lot of sky is in the photo. Most landscapes are focused at infinity,
anyway.
Compositional Ideas That Travel Well
Travel shots are often a combination of architectural photography and land-
scape photography. While you roam around on vacation, you’re bound to find
interesting things to photograph within cities as well as in the countryside.
The chief difference between travel photography and architectural or land-
scape pictorials is that the travel shots invariably have one or more members
of your party standing smack in the middle of the picture, waving or pointing.
It doesn’t have to be so. Oh, of course you want to prove you’ve been to the
Eiffel Tower or Grand Canyon, so go ahead and take a few shots with you or
195
Chapter 10: Composition and dSLRs

196
Part III: Beyond the Basics 
your companions mugging for the camera. But then shoo everybody out of
the way and take a few well-composed photos you can be proud of. After all,
20 years from now most of your family members in the photos will be old and
wrinkly. But the Eiffel Tower and Grand Canyon will be an unaging part of
your vacation memories if you take the time to capture some memorable
photos while you’re there.
Vacation photos are your chance to apply some of the basic compositional
techniques I discuss throughout this chapter. A few new principles to con-
sider include
 Try to balance your compositions. Place interesting subject matter on
both sides of the frame. I don’t mean that you need to have two centers
of interest, only that your photo shouldn’t be lopsided. If you pose a
person on one side of the frame, include a building or some foliage on
the other side to create a balanced look. This trick encourages viewers
to explore the image, rather than feel uneasy because they’re wondering
why all that empty space is on the other half of the photo.
 Avoid mergers. Mergers are the (usually) unintentional combinations
of unrelated subjects spliced together in disturbing ways. The classic
merger is usually a tree growing out of the top of someone’s head
(but you can do the same thing with the Eiffel Tower if you’re careful and
have tired of having your subjects just stand in front of it and wave).
Mergers can also happen when subjects seem to grow out the edges of
the picture. For example, if you have a tree branch drooping down into
your image but there is no tree anywhere to be seen in the rest of the
photo, the branch appears to have sprung from the edge of your picture.
Examine your compositions carefully to spot and eliminate mergers
before you capture them in pixel form.
 Don’t be afraid to try some new subjects. Certain travel photos are
almost obligatory. Return from Spain without a picture of a flamenco
dance or come back from Philadelphia lacking a shot of Independence
Hall or the Liberty Bell, and your acquaintances might doubt you’ve actu-
ally been where you claim. But don’t let those expectations limit you.
I like to photograph what I call the Gettysburgs of each location I visit —
the places many people have heard of, but have rarely seen pictured. In
the United States, that might be a view of the St. Louis arch taken from
underneath the arch itself, rather than from the other side of the
Mississippi River, or a close-up of a door knocker on an ancient door of a
cathedral, like the one shown in Figure 10-11. In Europe, you might want
to photograph El Toboso, a village in Spain where Don Quixote’s
Dulcinea lived, rather than snap only the same-old-same-old photos at
the Alhambra or the Costa del Sol.

Figure 10-11: Look for unusual subjects, such as the knocker on 
this 400-year-old door to the cloisters of a European cathedral.
With a little imagination, you can return from your trip with well-composed,
interesting photos that capture the spirit of your vacation but don’t look like
they were cribbed from postcards.

 Fixing up photographs
I
f you’re really, really good at digital SLR photography, your images might
not need any fixing at all, right? Dream on. Nobody’s that good; even the
most sharp-eyed shooter still uses image editing, or what the cognoscenti
refer to as post-processing. (It’d take some major mojo for a photographer to
perform pre-processing on images before they were taken!)
Thanks to the miracles of image editing, you can take that perfect composi-
tion and create an entirely new picture by judicious cropping. Perhaps you
can modify your perfect exposure to produce a special high-contrast effect or
a low-contrast moody look. You can creatively twist great color bal-
ance with oddball colors. You might even find that the perfect
shot of the Eiffel Tower looks even better if you transplanted
the structure to a cornfield in Kansas.
Image editing is a skill anyone can master. One of the
best things about digital photography is that your
images are digital all the way. You don’t need to scan
film or a print or do any conversion. What you shot
is what you got — a digital image full of pixels just
waiting to be tweaked, fine-tuned, shifted around,
and optimized. You can do a lot of that in your
camera, but for even greater image enhancement, you
need an editor, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements,
Paint Shop Pro, or even the granddaddy itself,
Photoshop CS3.
These are all things you can do with an image editor. This chapter
and Chapter 12 show you what you can do to fix up images or transform
existing shots into entirely new ones.

202
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Editor-ial Comments: Choosing an Image Editor
Which image editor should you use? It could be argued that Adobe
Photoshop is the best image-editing software on the planet. It could also be
argued that owning your own private jet is the best way to travel around the
country. Not everyone can afford private jets or Photoshop, and not every-
one wants to spend time figuring out how to pilot them. That’s why so many
alternatives to Adobe’s flagship image editor have flourished.
Some image editors have every imaginable feature, but others take a barebones
approach. Do you need to be able to edit CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black)
image files and make color separations, or are you just looking to correct red-
eye problems? Do you want absolute control over every parameter, or would
you prefer that your image editor handles simple tasks with a wizard-like inter-
face? Image editors differ both in the features they have and the approaches
they take to image editing. The trick is to figure out which editor has the fea-
tures you need and an approach that’s compatible with your working style.
Because you’re working with a digital SLR, I assume that your editing require-
ments are — potentially — a little on the ambitious side. Certainly, you want to
adjust tones, fix color, or sharpen things a little. But you also might have a han-
kering to drop out backgrounds, remove an extra head from your brother-in-
law from another planet, or combine several of your best shots into one. So, in
this chapter, I assume that you want to go beyond the basics with your image
editor and your image-editing activities. (In Chapter 12, I explain how to do so.)
For an ambitious soul like you, the image-editing choices are numerous.
Adobe Photoshop
www.adobe.com
Photoshop is a verb? With apologies to R. Buckminster “I Seem to Be a Verb”
Fuller, Adobe Photoshop is well on the way to joining our language as a
process rather than just a product. The average person who has never used
an image editor, when confronted with an obviously manipulated photo-
graph, is likely to say, “That looks photoshopped!” Common misusage of its
trademark might pain Adobe, but the company has to be pleased at how
widely known and used the product is.
Since it appeared on the market in the early 1990s, Photoshop, including its
latest incarnation, Photoshop CS3, has gained its number-one position over
the years by virtue of a complex set of circumstances, many of which relate
to how cool the product really is. Consider these points:
 Photoshop does everything any sane digital photographer or graphics
worker would want to accomplish. Recent releases have filled a lot of
holes, including the long-requested ability to curve text along a path. If
you can’t do it with Photoshop, you probably don’t need to do it.

 Photoshop does not include feature bloat in the form of capabilities
that nobody wants or uses (unlike, say, a certain Office suite). You might
not need every single Photoshop feature now, but someday you might.
Photoshop has no equivalent of a dancing paper clip.
 Photoshop works identically with both PCs and Macintoshes. With
some minor interface differences, Photoshop works the same with both
PCs and Macs.
 Understanding how to use Photoshop is a marketable skill. Certainly, it
takes months to become a Photoshop master, but the knowledge you
gain won’t help you only with your current job but, potentially, your
next one, as well. Employers won’t take notice if you’re a Paint Shop Pro
guru (unless the company happens to use that program) but might place
a premium on Photoshop expertise.
Despite its cost and learning curve, Photoshop, as shown in Figure 11-1, is cer-
tainly not out of the reach of the average dSLR owner. Most computers built in
the last couple years are certainly powerful enough to run it, especially if you
upgrade to 2GB of random access memory (RAM), which shouldn’t cost more
than $200. If you’re serious about photography, spend the time to master it.
Figure 11-1: Photoshop CS3 in action.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Attractive upgrade offers let you purchase a full copy of Photoshop for a frac-
tion of its original $650 list price (or about $1,000 for the CS3:Extended ver-
sion). Thereafter, you can upgrade when Adobe comes out with a new release
(on roughly an 18-month schedule) for about $200. You can even skip a
release (upgrading, say, from Photoshop CS to Photoshop CS3) if you don’t
need the very latest features.
The good news
Photoshop’s strength is its complete feature set, with tools for doing retouch-
ing, compositing, complex color correction, and even Web design. If you spe-
cialize in one type of image processing over another, you’ll find that
Photoshop has everything you need in its well-organized tool set.
The latest version has a revamped user interface, including (at last!) the abil-
ity to dock palettes at the edge of the workspace to keep them out of the way
of the image you’re working on. Selection tools have been improved, making it
easier to grab parts of a photo for pasting into new combined (composited)
images. Photoshop’s filters have gotten smarter, so you can edit their settings
or even remove their special effects throughout the picture-fixing process. My
favorite new tool is the nifty black-and-white conversion capability, which
enables you to create a monochrome version of a color image while retaining
the tonal separation of objects — so that parts of your photo that have differ-
ent colors but similar brightness levels can still be clearly discerned.
Photoshop is a nimble, cross-platform, cross-application tool. It can read,
write, and manipulate all the industry-standard file formats as well as many
nonstandard file types. You can resample images to change the image size,
resolution, and color depth. Photoshop excels at providing images that are
optimized for specialized uses, such as commercial printing and Web graph-
ics. As part of the Adobe Creative Suite, Photoshop is also well-integrated
with several leading page-layout programs and Web-development programs,
such as Illustrator, PageMaker, InDesign, and GoLive. Now that Adobe has
acquired Macromedia, you can enjoy some integration with that subsidiary’s
products as well.
Photoshop provides a rich set of tools for everything from simple image
manipulation (cropping and color balance adjustments, to name two) to
selecting complex shapes from an image and applying sophisticated filters
and effects to the selected area. Photoshop also includes a full set of painting
tools that you can use to retouch your images or to create original artwork.
Adobe designed Photoshop to accept filters and plug-in program extensions
provided by third-party suppliers, such as Andromeda, Applied Science
Fiction, Alien Skin, Auto FX, and Extensis. A robust aftermarket has evolved
to supply a wide assortment of plug-ins that let you quickly and easily apply
all manner of textures, edge treatments, special effects, and other image
manipulations to the images you edit in Photoshop.

The latest Photoshop version has an improved way to review images on your
disk, an upgrade to an earlier program called Bridge, which is a standalone
application (used with all the Creative Suite applications) that you can open
without powering up Photoshop.
The bad news
Photoshop doesn’t do natural media well; that is, it has trouble mimicking
various types and styles of brushes, charcoal, pens, and other tools needed
to paint original images. For that, you need Corel Painter. In fact, many graph-
ics pros own both, using Photoshop for color correcting and retouching and
using Painter for creative brushwork.
Photoshop’s $650 list price has to go into the bad news column. Photoshop
can also develop into a money pit. Serious Photoshop users have a thirst for
plug-ins, which can each cost as much as, say, Paint Shop Pro. Although
Photoshop comes with more than 100 plug-ins, you can never be too rich, too
thin, or have too many filters for your image editor.
Don’t downplay your investment in time required to figure out how to use
Photoshop. Although you can pick up the basics in a few weeks, if you really
want to master every nuance and trick, be prepared to spend even more
time. There’s a good reason why a search for Photoshop books on
Amazon.com returns more than a thousand results. Hundreds of authors who
had to figure out how to use this application are eager to share their knowl-
edge with you. You probably need to buy two or three of the best books and
read them thoroughly to master the basics and most common shortcuts.
One of the most comprehensive books on the market is Photoshop CS3 All-in-
One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Finally, Photoshop is definitely not a program you can use once a month. 
You can invest all that time figuring out how to use it, and then forget half of
what you know if you don’t work with the application on a weekly basis.
Photoshop is a commitment.
Adobe Photoshop Elements
www.adobe.com
Adobe Photoshop Elements is a powerful junior version of the full Photoshop
program. Elements has most of the functionality, but it lacks some of the fea-
tures that the average photographer might be able to get along without. At
about $100, it’s more affordable, too.
Elements, as shown in Figure 11-2, shares much of the same user interface
with Photoshop. Although it’s missing a few features that Adobe deems pro-
fessional, such as Layer Masks and CMYK editing, Elements includes most of
the basic image-editing tools that the typical digital photographer needs on a
205
Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images

206
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
regular basis. That includes image-selection tools, retouching tools, painting
tools, a generous assortment of filters, and the ability to expand those filters
by accepting the same Photoshop plug-ins as its sibling program.
The good news
A price tag of $100 puts Elements within the reach of anyone, and its reduced
feature set is a good match for the needs of the typical digital photographer.
Most of the standard selection, retouching, and painting tools from
Photoshop are available in Elements. If your image-editing needs revolve
around retouching and manipulating individual pictures one at a time, you’ll
probably never miss the more advanced Photoshop features.
The automated commands on the Enhance menu make quick work of common
image-editing tasks, such as adjusting backlighting or color cast. As a result, an
occasional user working with Elements can complete those tasks faster and
more accurately than a seasoned graphics pro working with Photoshop.
Elements also makes a good introduction to Photoshop for people who plan
to upgrade someday. After you master this program, you can transfer much
of what you know directly to Photoshop. You make filters, most kinds of
selections, and basic tonal and color corrections in much the same way in
both applications.
Figure 11-2: Photoshop Elements at work.

The bad news
Compared to the most basic non-Adobe image editors, Elements can be a
bit daunting. The similarity to Photoshop works against you if you’re a total
image-editing neophyte because the menus and palettes bear more similarity
to Photoshop than they do to less ambitious programs. Even so, dSLR
photographers probably wouldn’t be happy with the simplest image editors,
anyway, so the “easy, but not that easy” interface of Elements doesn’t offer
much of a downside.
The other downside is Adobe’s tendency to introduce new features for
Elements in its Windows version first, with the Macintosh upgrade following
months later. Some features are available only in the Windows edition.
Corel Photo-Paint
www.corel.com
Corel Photo-Paint is one of four image editors theoretically available from
graphics-giant Corel. The company’s product line is often in a state of flux,
and I can’t promise that Photo-Paint or its stablemates, Corel Painter, Corel
PaintShop, and Ulead PhotoImpact, will all remain available (or under those
names) for the life of this book. I’ll do the best I can to describe your avail-
able options from Corel, starting with Photo-Paint.
Photo-Paint, in its revamped Photo-Paint Image Adjustment Lab incarnation, is
the image-editing program that is included in the popular CorelDRAW Graphics
Suite. Various versions of this program are available for both PCs and the Mac,
although the Mac version is several releases behind and might be difficult to
locate.
Photo-Paint, as shown in Figure 11-3, is a reasonably full-featured photo-
retouching and image-editing program. Although its feature set can’t match
the full version of Photoshop, Photo-Paint stands solidly among a second tier
of products that deliver a large portion of Photoshop’s functionality for a rel-
atively small portion of that program’s price.
Photo-Paint offers a full set of selection, retouching, and painting tools for
manual image manipulations. It also includes convenient automated com-
mands for a few common tasks, such as red-eye removal. Photo-Paint accepts
Photoshop plug-ins to expand its assortment of filters and special effects.
The good news
Corel Photo-Paint is a respectable product as a standalone image editor.
However, its greatest strength is its integration with CorelDRAW and the rest
of the Corel Graphics Suite. If you use CorelDRAW to create and edit graphics,
you’ve probably got Photo-Paint installed on your computer, and you’ll feel
right at home using the product. All the Photo-Paint menus, dialog boxes, and
palettes behave just as they do in CorelDRAW.

Figure 11-3: Corel Photo-Paint comes with the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite.
The bad news
Photo-Paint is available only as part of the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. At
$400, CorelDRAW Graphics Suite is a good value, provided you need the main
CorelDRAW program and any of the other components of the suite. However,
$400 is a lot to pay for Photo-Paint alone, especially because other image edi-
tors are available for around $100.
Corel Paint Shop Pro
www.corel.com
Paint Shop Pro (PSP) is the next-to-last image-editing program to join the
Corel fold. The company that originated it, Jasc, is no more. PSP is a general-
purpose image editor that has gained a reputation as the “poor man’s
Photoshop” for providing a substantial portion of Photoshop’s capabilities at
a fraction of the cost. The program lists for about $100, but you can often find
it for sale at a substantial discount.

This Windows-only program features a fairly complete tool kit that includes
selection, painting, and retouching tools for direct manipulation of your
images. It also offers a sizable collection of wizard-like commands that
automate common tasks, such as removing red eye and scratches. Paint Shop
Pro, as shown in Figure 11-4, includes a nice assortment of filters and effects,
and you can expand that assortment by adding almost any of the Photoshop
plug-ins.
The good news
Paint Shop Pro originated as a shareware program, but was so good that it
eventually became a thriving retail product. It’s been around for more than a
decade and has had plenty of time to evolve and mature into a robust, easy-to-
use product. Indeed, many people rate PSP as the easiest to use of the general-
purpose image editors, and it’s among the lowest priced programs in its class.
Paint Shop Pro supports layers, which enable you to achieve some fairly
sophisticated editing effects. This is a surprising capability in such a low-cost
image editor.
Figure 11-4: Paint Shop Pro has many of the features found in Photoshop.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
The bad news
The breadth and depth of the Paint Shop Pro feature set is a little uneven.
The program shows surprising depth in some areas, such as the availability
of layers, and shallowness in others, such as the limited choice of selection
and paint tools. Also, some tools (such as the Histogram Adjustment com-
mand) require more knowledge and experience to use effectively than do the
corresponding tools in some of the other editors.
Evaluate the program carefully to determine whether its particular strengths
and weaknesses are a good match for the mix of work you need to do. 
Corel Painter
www.corel.com
Corel’s third image-editing program is Painter, which continues to be popular
among photographers and artists because of its ability to create content from
scratch. As such, it might not be your favorite application for retouching
your digital pictures, but if you need to paint something on an existing image
with a fuzzy brush soaked in oil paints, this is your baby, and this baby works
for both PCs and Macs.
Painter, as shown in Figure 11-5, is adept at re-creating in digital form a wide
range of traditional artist media, such as charcoal, pastels, and various kinds
of paint. Painter includes a basic assortment of tools that you can use to edit
existing images, but the program is really designed for artists to use in creat-
ing original illustrations.
The good news
Painter’s natural media effects are incredible. Some other programs allow you
to select different paintbrush tools and adjust their color, size, edge softness,
and a few other attributes. But Painter takes the concept of brush effects to a
whole new level.
In Painter, you can define not only the characteristics of the brush, but the
texture of the paper or canvas, the thickness of the paint on the brush, and
how the paint, brush, and paper interact. As a result, the program can realis-
tically simulate the very different effects of a watercolor wash on hot-press
paper, oil on canvas, pastels on a sanded board, or any of a huge assortment
of other media/material combinations. Painter comes with a large inventory
of predefined brushes and art materials, which you can use or modify to suit
your artistic impulse. With the right settings, you can even watch the digital
paint drip and run.
A pressure-sensitive graphics tablet is almost a must with this program.

Figure 11-5: An image being edited in Painter.
The bad news
Expect to be confused the first time you work with Painter. Its bewildering
array of palettes have options that allow you to exercise precise control over
each brush stroke. Just finding where each feature or palette is located can
be a challenge, and working your way through the various options each time
you want to do something can be tedious. When you gain experience with the
program, it becomes easier to use, but figuring out how to use Painter effec-
tively takes no small amount of time and commitment. This isn’t a program
that lends itself to occasional, casual use.
Painter’s image-editing capabilities are more attuned to the needs of an artist
who wants to incorporate part of an existing image in a new composite than
they are to routine image enhancements and corrections. If you’re looking for
a digital darkroom where you can crop, correct color, and repair your digital
photographs before printing, look elsewhere.
At about $300 (for the downloadable version), Painter is somewhat expen-
sive. You probably wouldn’t want to buy it just to fool around with it. If you
need this program’s capabilities, though, $300 can be a bargain.

Ulead PhotoImpact
www.corel.com
In the last edition of this book, I announced that Ulead PhotoImpact, as
shown in Figure 11-6, was unique in that it was just about the only general-
purpose image-editing program that hasn’t been acquired by another com-
pany. That’s no longer true, as this useful application has finally fallen before
the Corel hegemony. In longevity terms alone, PhotoImpact deserves a look.
For more than a decade, it’s been on the market as a Windows-only program
and has a particularly strong palette of features.
PhotoImpact includes a full assortment of brushes for painting, retouching,
and cloning in addition to the expected selection, cropping, and fill tools. It
also offers tools for text and vector shapes, as well as tools for creating slices
and image maps for use on the Web. PhotoImpact supports layers and
includes a generous collection of effects filters, which you can expand with
Photoshop plug-ins. Auto-process commands are available to automate many
of the most common image-correction and image-enhancement tasks.
Figure 11-6: PhotoImpact offers Photoshop versatility for less than $100.

The good news
Price! Like Paint Shop Pro, PhotoImpact offers a lot of what you get in
Photoshop but for less than $100 (Corel currently lists it at $89.99). It’s also 
a good tool for repetitive operations, although the PhotoImpact batch and
auto-process tools are no match for the Photoshop Actions. Still, you can
select multiple image files and then apply any one of a long list of filters,
enhancements, or auto-process commands to all the selected files.
PhotoImpact also includes some specialized features for creating Web graph-
ics, including wizards that lead you through creating Web backgrounds, ban-
ners, and buttons. Its image-optimization features are good for people who
would otherwise use ImageReady or Fireworks.
The bad news
I find the PhotoImpact user interface odd and inconsistent, and some fea-
tures feel more like add-on modules than built-in components.
Workflow Workarounds
Regardless of what image editor you end up with, as a digital SLR owner, you
need to establish a mysterious set of protocols, or a workflow, before you get
down to serious business. A workflow is nothing more than the order in
which you perform all the various tasks associated with image editing under
particular circumstances. You can easily have one workflow that you use for
sports photography (because you’re shooting tons of JPEG images at a
healthy clip and don’t want to waste a lot of time in post-processing) and
another for landscape photography (which might require fine-tuning of RAW
images to retain detail and subtle tones).
At the very least, think about your workflow and establish some guidelines
for yourself, if only because all your photographer friends will be asking you
what your workflow is in a given situation, and if you don’t have a good
answer ready, you’ll look like a (lowercase) dummy.
A well-planned workflow can actually save you some time because you aren’t
reinventing wheels every time you work on a photographic project that’s sim-
ilar to one you’ve already mastered. The key elements of a typical workflow
proceed along these lines:
 Getting your photos from your camera to your computer. Will you be
using a USB cable (fine for small numbers of photos) or a card reader
(probably better for larger numbers of images)? Are your photos located
on an external hard drive, such as a PSD (personal storage device) used
for backing up images in the field or on vacations? Are you copying all
the photos on your memory card or only some of them?
213
Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images

214
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 Processing on-route. If you’re using a photo transfer program, such as the
one provided with Photoshop Elements, you can select from a few options
for processing your images during the actual transfer to your computer.
For example, you can rename the image files automatically (from, say,
DSC_0488 . . . to DisneyWorld0001 . . . and so on). Some transfer programs
can look for and remove red-eye effects automatically as well.
 Destination location. Where do you put your photos on your hard
drive? Do you separate them into folders with chronological names and
dates? Do they go into folders arranged by project? Are all your flower
or football photos dumped into folders arranged by subject matter? This
point in your workflow can help determine how easily you can locate a
particular image at a later date.
 RAW conversion. If you shoot RAW files, do you run everything through
a RAW converter, such as Adobe Camera Raw (see Figure 11-7), creating,
say, TIFF or JPEG files, at the time the photos are transferred? Or do you
just dump the RAW files and convert them when you’re ready to edit a
particular photo? Do you plan to convert files one at a time or in
batches? Will you use (or need) preset settings to perform similar
adjustments on images shot at the same time?
 Image editor workflow. You have lots of options after a photo is
imported to your image editor. The order in which you crop photos,
adjust color, make tonal changes, and apply sharpening can be impor-
tant. Do you save a copy with all its layers before you “flatten” an image
to produce the “final” version?
Figure 11-7: RAW conversion is an important part of your digital workflow.

 Backing up your images. How and when do you create backup images?
Do you back up everything, or just original files and modified files? Do
you copy images to a spare hard drive, a DVD, or some other media?
How many DVD copies is enough for perfect safety? Where do you store
your backups?
Workflow considerations inside — and outside — your image editor can be
quite complex and include many more factors than those I’ve listed here. But,
in any case, a little planning never hurts.
Fixing Your Photos
You can manipulate your photos in two different ways: by fixing anything
seen as a defect without really changing the content extensively, or by com-
bining and reorganizing images in more drastic ways. I show you the basics of
combining and reorganizing (which includes compositing, or melding several
different images or parts of images) in Chapter 12. In the following sections, I
stick with the techniques for making repairs and fixes.
The most common fixes for digital photos fall into five categories:
 Cropping: As you discover in Chapter 10, you can often improve a photo
just by removing items that don’t belong or that distract from the com-
position. Cropping — adjusting the borders of an image — is the easiest
way to do this.
 Tonal adjustments: Your images might be too bright or too dark, or
worse, include some parts that are too dark and others that are too light.
Although your dSLR includes features that let you make some adjust-
ments for tone (including specialized tonal settings called custom curves),
frequently these adjustments are easier to make with an image editor.
 Color correction: If your colors are off, you can usually fix them in your
image editor. If your colors are accurate, you might want to make them
seem off as a creative effect. You can do both with your editor.
 Spot removal: Your dSLR shots might have a variety of different spots
and artifacts that need to be removed. A dirty sensor can produce dust
spots on pristine images. Perhaps birds in the sky off in the distance are
too small to look like anything other than blotches. Your subject might
have a small scratch or defect. You need an image editor to touch up
these spots.
 Sharpening/blurring: You can change the emphasis within your compo-
sition by selectively sharpening or blurring parts of the picture. You can
also salvage a shot that isn’t quite sharp enough with a little sharpening,
or smooth out rough texture with blurring.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
The following tips apply specifically to Photoshop; your image editor can per-
form the same tasks, but it might use different commands.
Cropping
If you know anything about composition, you know that images can often be
vastly improved with some judicious trimming. Figure 11-8 shows you what I
mean. At first glance, it appears to be a photo of a powerful jet fighter climb-
ing into the sky at dusk, possibly preparing to attack an enemy in a dogfight.
When I show people this photo, they often ask whether I took it from the air
or perhaps from the ground with a very long telephoto lens.
The answer lies in the uncropped version of the photo, as shown in Figure 11-9.
(Please don’t feel cheated by the mundane origins of this picture!) As you can
see, it’s a photo of an old jet mounted on concrete pylons on the front lawn of a
high school in my area (nickname: Aviators). I loved the plane, but I found that
it was difficult to get a good angle. So, I shot a picture anyway, darkened it a
little to make the image look more dramatic, cropped the image tightly, and
trimmed out some utility wires to produce a much more exciting view.
Figure 11-8: Cropping tightens a composition and adds drama.

Figure 11-9: The original shot is slightly less inspiring!
Photoshop gives you several ways to crop a picture. Here are some of the
fastest and most versatile:
 Create a rectangular marquee around the part you want to crop to
and then choose Image➪Crop. Photoshop trims off everything outside
the selection marquee.
 Draw around the area you want to crop with any line-oriented selec-
tion tool, including the Lasso, Polygonal Lasso, and Magnetic Lasso.
The area specified doesn’t even have to be remotely rectangular in
shape (see Figure 11-10). However, a cropped rectangle is what you end
up with. Photoshop crops to the smallest rectangle that includes the
entire image within your selection, as you can see in Figure 11-11. For
details on using these Lasso tools, see Chapter 12.
If the image you want to preserve is included inside a border that’s
roughly the same tone, such as a picture frame surrounding a photo
hanging on a wall, you might be able to select that border with the Magic
Wand and then reverse the selection with Ctrl+Shift+I (Ô+Shift+I on the
Mac) and crop to the image that’s now selected.
 Use the Crop tool. The Crop tool is probably the best choice because it
allows you to adjust the borders of the selection individually before
making the crop.
To use the Crop tool, follow these instructions:
1. Select the Crop tool (press C to make it active or select it from the
Tool Palette).
2. Drag a selection that roughly includes the area in the cropped image.
217
Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images

218
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
3. Grab the handles on the top, bottom, or side selection borders and
move in or out to adjust the cropping exactly the way you want.
Notice that the area outside the crop selection darkens, making it easier
for you to visualize the final picture, as shown in Figure 11-11.
4. Press Enter (Return on the Mac) to apply the crop to your image.
Figure 11-10: I made a selection with the Lasso tool, and Photoshop 
kindly cropped to the selection for me.
Figure 11-11: The Crop tool allows you to precisely specify the crop borders.

Fixing murky or contrasty photos
Tonal adjustments are another fix that you’ll frequently want to make. Digital
SLRs have the ability to capture a broad range of tones, called a dynamic
range. That lets you capture detail in dark shadows as well as bright high-
lights. Unfortunately, many scenes have a dynamic range that’s too long for
even the best digital sensors. When that happens, you might end up with pic-
tures that have lots of detail in the shadow areas, but the highlights are
washed out (or blown in digital parlance).
If an exposure captures highlight detail, your shadows might be murky.
Indeed, some dSLRs are programmed to deliberately produce this murky
effect, on the theory that it’s easier to retrieve underexposed information in
shadows that are dark, but not completely black, than it is to regain detail in
highlights that have gone completely white.
Some images might have a very limited range of tones, including whites,
some intermediate grays and colors, and blacks, but lacking the other in-
between tones. These images are said to be high contrast. Others are rather
bland-looking, with lots of individual tones spread throughout the image, but
few true blacks or whites. Such images are said to be low contrast. The prob-
lem doesn’t always lie with your camera: The lighting in your scene might be
too contrasty or too low in contrast to render the scene attractively.
If your images are high or low in contrast, or are simply too dark or too light,
you might be able to fix the problem in Photoshop or another image editor.
As you might expect, Photoshop has several tools that can help you. Some
work well, but others are atrocious or intended only for beginners. In the fol-
lowing list, I run through all the tools so you know which traps to avoid:
 The “auto” tools: Photoshop includes two tools, Auto Levels and Auto
Contrast (choose Image➪Adjustments). They can analyze your photo
and correct the brightness, contrast, and tonal values for you. These
tools have no idea what kind of effect you’re going for, so the results
might or might not please you.
 The Brightness/Contrast controls: Also on the Image menu is a decep-
tively simple set of sliders that allow you to brighten or darken every-
thing in an image or change the contrast of the entire image. Originally,
this tool was problematic because you very seldom want to apply that
sort of adjustment uniformly to every pixel in an image. Lighten the shad-
ows with the Brightness slider, and you probably made the highlights too
light. Slide the control to the left, and your too-light highlights turn an
ugly gray while your shadows turn black. You could expect the same
poor overall results with the Contrast slider. However, Photoshop CS3
219
Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images

220
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
made this pair of controls considerably smarter. The Brightness/Contrast
controls now work proportionately, so you can change the amount of
detail in the highlights and shadows without affecting all the other tones.
If you’d prefer to use the “bad old” tool, mark the Legacy box in the
dialog box to return to Photoshop’s old behavior.
 The Shadow/Highlight controls: These controls are a more intuitive
way of doing what the Brightness slider should have done all along.
They let you adjust the brightness of the shadows and highlights indi-
vidually by using a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 11-12. This
one’s a keeper, and I explain it in more detail in the next section.
 Levels: The Levels dialog box
lets you specify how tones are
distributed in your image. I
explain this one later in the
chapter, too.
 Curves: The Curves dialog box
gives you full control over the
tones in your image. Stay tuned
for more on this.
Working with the Shadow/
Highlight controls
When you activate this dialog box, it
defaults to settings suitable for fixing
images that have been backlit, with
the shadows much too dark. The
Shadow slider will be at 50 percent,
and the Highlight slider at 0 percent.
If you’ve selected the Show More
Options check box, you see the full
dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-12.
The full dialog box has three areas:
one for shadows, one for highlights,
and one for adjustments. The
Shadow and Highlights areas have
the same three sliders. Here’s how you can use each one to fix contrast in an
image:
 Amount: This is the degree of change to be applied. A higher number
equals a more drastic application of the tonal change.
 Tonal Width: This represents the number of tones, from the 256 differ-
ent tonal levels in the image, that are affected. For example, if you set
Tonal Width to 25 percent, one quarter of the 256 tones (64 tones) are
Figure 11-12: The Shadow/Highlight controls
allow you to adjust tonal areas individually.

modified. A value of 50 percent affects 128 tones and produces a more
pronounced change.
The best way to decide what value to use is to watch your image while
you move the slider. Use a small value to brighten only the very darkest
shadow areas or to darken only the lightest highlight areas. Increase the
value to brighten more of the dark areas or darken more of the high-
lights. Don’t use very large values or you end up with glowing haloes at
the boundaries between the shadows and highlights.
 Radius: The Radius slider helps Photoshop determine what should be
considered a highlight pixel and what should be considered a shadow
pixel. Ordinarily, the control examines each pixel’s neighbor to make
this determination. Increasing the Radius value enlarges the size of the
neighborhood so that more pixels are counted as highlight or shadow
pixels rather than middle-tone pixels (which are not affected by the
Shadow/Highlight control). Monitor your preview image to see whether
you’re getting the effect you want.
The third area of the dialog box, the Adjustments area, controls other para-
meters. These include
 Color Correction: This isn’t a color-correction tool as much as it’s a way
of compensating for color shifts that occur when you’re fiddling with the
tonal controls. Use it to remove these casts.
 Midtone Contrast: Although the shadow and highlight controls adjust
only the darkest and lightest areas, this slider lets you apply some fine-
tuning to the middle tones.
 Black and White Clipping: Use these controls to increase contrast
intentionally by dropping (or clipping) a desired percentage of black or
white tones from your image.
Working with levels
The Photoshop Levels dialog box allows you to control the tonal values of an
image much more precisely than you can with the Shadow/Highlight controls.
Most good Photoshop books have a whole chapter on using levels, but I can
provide a good introduction.
The Levels dialog box shows a histogram graph, which is very similar to the
histogram you can view on the LCD (liquid crystal display) of your dSLR after
you’ve taken a shot. Your camera histogram shows you only whether all the
tones are being captured, and you can do little other than adjust exposure up
or down, or perhaps make a tonal setting change in your camera’s menus.
The one in the Levels dialog box (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Levels) actu-
ally lets you change the tonal values.
221
Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images

222
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
As you might know, a histogram is
a graph that shows the relative
number of pixels at each of 256
brightness levels. The more pixels
at a particular brightness, the
higher the bar at that level.
Histograms provide a mountain-
range-type curve, like the one
shown in Figure 11-13, with most
of the tones usually distributed in
the middle and fewer trailing off
toward the dark tones (left side of
the graph) and light tones (right
side).
The objective of the Levels com-
mand is to avoid wasting any of the
256 possible tones that can be represented. You do that by moving a trio of
triangular sliders at the bottom of the graph:
 Move the black triangle to the right until it touches the edge of the black
tones actually present in the image, as shown in the graph.
 Move the white triangle to the left until it touches the edge of the actual
white tones.
 You can move the middle gray triangle to lighten or darken the overall
image by adjusting the midtone position.
If you remember these basics, you can improve your images significantly
without understanding the additional fine-tuning capabilities of the Levels
dialog box. Should you want to spread your wings and discover more, I rec-
ommend Photoshop CS3 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies by Barbara
Obermeier (Wiley).
Working with curves
If the Levels dialog box is worth a chapter or two, the Curves dialog box, as
shown in Figure 11-14, is worth an entire book! That’s particularly true
because Adobe smartened up the Curves command for Photoshop CS3, pro-
viding new automatic presets that can bend tones for you and adding dis-
plays of histogram, clipping, and other information.
Curves are a way of changing the highlights, midtones, and shadows entirely
independently. They allow you to change the values of pixels at any point
along the brightness-level continuum, giving you, in effect, 256 locations at
which you can make corrections.
Figure 11-13: The Levels dialog box provides
more precise tonal control.

The Curves dialog box includes a
two-dimensional graph, with the hor-
izontal axis mapping the brightness
values as they are before you make
image corrections. The vertical axis
maps the brightness values after cor-
rection. By default, the lower-left
corner of the graph represents pure
black (0,0), and the upper-right
corner represents pure white
(255,255). When you open the dialog
box, the graph begins as a straight
line because, unless changes are
made, the input is exactly the same
as the output, forming a direct 1:1
correlation. When you change the
shape of the curve, you change the
values in the image at each point
within the curve.
The best way to see what this tool
can do is to play with it (press
Ctrl+M on a PC or Ô+M on a Mac to
access the dialog box) or try out some of the preset curves to see how they
affect your image. After you’ve been using Photoshop for a while, you begin
to see how curves can provide the precise control you need over tonal
values.
Correcting those colors
Sometimes, despite the best intentions and competent technique, you end up
with pictures that have bad color. Perhaps the picture has a green color cast
caused by fluorescent lights, or it has too much red because you took it late
in the day. Fortunately, image editors, such as Photoshop, let you fix these.
Lots of tools are at your disposal. Some are easy to use, but others take a
little practice.
Before you get started, keep in mind that you can’t add color that isn’t there
in the first place. If your image is way too red, you can’t compensate by
adding its opposite color (cyan). Image editors work by subtracting hues. So,
if your picture is dominated by red and has very little green or blue, when
you remove the excess red, you don’t end up with a correctly balanced
image. You wind up with a picture that’s grayish because a little bit of red,
blue, and green are all that’s left.

values at 256 different brightness points in your

224
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Photoshop’s color-correcting tools include the following:
 Auto Color: This is another one of those pesky “auto” controls that uses
Photoshop’s guesswork to provide a possible correction to your color
problems, but most likely, the correction isn’t what you want.
 Color Balance: The Color Balance sliders (press Ctrl+B on a PC or Ô+B on
a Mac) let you seemingly add red, green, or blue while subtracting their
complements (cyan, magenta, and yellow). You can use the sliders while
viewing your image to make color corrections. Of course, as I note earlier,
you can’t really add a color to an image; the dialog box’s operation is just
an easier-to-understand representation of what’s really going on. That is,
when you move the Red/Cyan slider to the right, Photoshop actually is
subtracting cyan. Move it to the left (to “add” cyan) and you’re really sub-
tracting red. If you understand what’s going on, you aren’t really fooled,
but you don’t mind, either. The same thing takes place when you adjust
the Magenta/Green and Yellow/Blue sliders. The Color Balance dialog box,
as shown in Figure 11-15, allows
you to apply these color changes
to the highlights, midtones, and
shadows.
 Hue/Saturation: This control
(press Ctrl+U on a PC or Ô+U on
a Mac) changes color by using
different components than the
standard color balance tools
use. Instead of modifying the
primary colors of light, it
adjusts the overall color of the
image (hue), how pure or rich
the colors are (saturation), and the lightness or brightness of the color.
Moving the Hue slider rotates the color clockwise or counterclockwise
around the edges of the color wheel, as shown in Figure 11-16, but not
displayed in the dialog box. The Saturation slider adds richness, turning
a muted pink into a deep rose or dark red, for example. The Brightness
slider controls the overall luminosity of the image and is generally 
less used.
 Variations: The Variations dialog box gives you a way to compare differ-
ent color and darkness alternatives for an image. You get to choose the
one that looks best, as you can see in Figure 11-17.
 Curves: I’ve come full-circle to the Curves tool again. You can use this
complex tool for more than adjusting basic (grayscale) tonal values. You
can actually control the tonal rendition of each of the primary colors in
an image. Using the Curves tool in this way usually requires a lot of
experience unless you’re very adventuresome.

green, blue, cyan, magenta, or yellow.

Use whichever combination of color-correction tools works for you. They all
have particular advantages and disadvantages.
Spot removers
Unwanted artifacts in your image might not be arty, but they are facts. Your
job, should you choose to accept it, is to remove them. Several different
causes of spots, speckles, and other naughty bits (and bytes) are in your
images, and Photoshop has the tools to remove them. In the following sec-
tions, I offer an overview of how to use these tools.
Reducing noise
A little noise in your image can be a good thing. Noise can add an artsy,
grainy effect and serve to add some texture to an annoyingly smooth surface.
Indeed, detractors of one particular brand of digital SLR say that the remark-
ably noise-free results produced by that camera look plasticky. I’m not going
to mention the particular camera model because the rebels who prefer that
brand see this lack of noise as a definite advantage.
This little tidbit isn’t widely known among digital photographers who don’t
have a graphics-production background: One advantage of noise is that a
little noise actually makes smooth gradients reproduce better because of the
way press equipment and the halftoning process operate. Now you know.
However, for most folks, noise is unwanted. You can often prevent it by using
your dSLR’s noise reduction feature. But what do you do if noise turns up in
your captured image?
You’re in luck! Photoshop CS3 includes a Reduce Noise plug-in, found by choos-
ing Filters➪Noise. The dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-18, has four main
sliders. You can specify the strength of the noise reduction, whether noise
reduction should be done at the expense of image detail, how much to tone
down the colored speckles that are endemic in most noisy images, and
whether the remaining details should be sharpened after the noise has been
removed. You can also have the tool search for and remove defects caused by
JPEG compression. In Advanced mode, you can access a second tab that allows
you to specify the noise reduction by color channel, which is useful because
some channels, such as green, might be more prone to noise than others.
Spotsylmania
Photoshop gives you several ways of eliminating other kinds of spots,
scratches, and so forth. These include filters, like

 Despeckle: This filter looks for areas of great contrast in your image
because such areas are likely to be edges. Then, it blurs the non-edges,
making any spots and speckles less obvious. Because the edges are still
sharp, your image still might look relatively sharp. This filter works best
with images that are sharp in the first place but plagued with artifacts,
and it’s less effective with images that are already somewhat blurry. It’s
a good tool for eliminating halftone dots, too.
 Dust & Scratches: This filter actively hunts through your image for spots.
It includes two sliders: a Radius slider that lets you specify the size of the
area around a potential spot to be searched, and a Threshold slider that
determines how distinct a spot must be before it is considered a defect.
Send in the Clone Stamp
The Clone Stamp tool is useful for removing spots and other defects by copy-
ing a portion of the surrounding pixels, which should have a similar color and
texture, over the ailing portion of your image.

To use the Clone tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Clone tool from the Tool Palette or press S to make it active.
2. In the Option bar, choose a brush of an appropriate size from the
Brush drop-down list.
A soft-edged brush is usually best.
3. If you want to gently copy over the area to be fixed and blend the
pixels more evenly, set the Opacity slider on the Option bar to less
than 100 percent.
Anything from 25 percent to 90 percent works well.
4. Make sure the Aligned check box is selected in the Option bar.
This lets you stop and start the cloning process while retaining the same
positional relationship with the origin point you choose in the next step.
When Aligned isn’t selected, each time you begin cloning again, the
origin point goes back to the original location.
5. Place the cursor in an area near the portion you want to copy over.
Hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click in that area
to select the origin point.
6. Move the cursor to the area you want to copy over, hold down the
mouse button, and paint.
Figure 11-19 shows you an example of what you can do with the Clone
Stamp.
Figure 11-19: If your results are a little spotty, the Clone Stamp can help you out.

Healer, heal thyself
The Healing Brush, Spot Healing Brush, and Patch tools let you copy pixels
from one place in an image to another, similar to the Clone Stamp tool, but
while taking into account the lighting, texture, and other aspects of the image.
That makes for smoother, less obvious touch-ups. Here’s how each one works:
 The Healing Brush works like a brush in much the way the Clone Stamp
tool does. It copies pixels from a sample origin point you specify.
 The Patch tool operates like a tire patch, pasting an area of pixels you
choose on top of the part of the image you want to fix.
 The Spot Healing Brush works like the Healing Brush, but you don’t
have to specify an origin point; it automatically samples pixels around
the area being healed and uses them to copy over the defective spots.
Look sharp, be sharp
If you have an image that isn’t sharp enough or if you want to increase the
contrast between one area and another by sharpening one part, Photoshop’s
varied sharpening tools can do the job for you. Keep in mind that sharpening
works by increasing the contrast between transitions in tone of an image. So,
while you’re adding sharpness, you’re also increasing contrast. It’s easy to
end up with too much of a good thing.
If you want to sharpen the entire image, use the various sharpening filters.
Choose Filters➪Sharpen and you find a selection of choices. These include
 Sharpen: Applies a fixed amount of sharpening to the entire image or
selection.
 Sharpen More: Applies a stronger fixed effect.
Use either of these filters, Sharpen or Sharpen More, only when you
need a touch of sharpening and don’t need to be precise.
 Sharpen Edges: This filter seeks out the areas of transition in an image
(the edges) and sharpens only those areas, preserving the smoothness
in the rest of the image. As with the first two filters, you can’t specify the
amount of sharpening to be applied.
Unsharp Mask: This filter does let you control the degree of sharpening,
especially when it’s applied to the edges of images. This should be your
tool of choice for most image sharpening because it applies sharpening
more intelligently and flexibly.
229
Chapter 11: Fixing Up Your Images

230
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
 Smart Sharpen: This filter includes three tabs that let you specify sharp-
ening parameters, as with Unsharp Mask, but you can also control
sharpening separately in shadow and highlight areas.
If you want to add some sharpness in specific areas quickly (say, to sharpen
the eyes in a portrait), Photoshop has a Sharpen tool in the Tool Palette that
lets you “paint” contrast. It’s easy to overdo this tool, so be careful.
Blurring for effect
Blurring is the exact opposite of sharpening: Instead of heightening the con-
trast difference between adjoining pixels, the color and brightness differ-
ences are reduced so that pixels are much closer to each other in terms 
of their color levels, brightness, and contrast. Your eyes see this as a low-
contrast blur effect.
Selective blurring can reduce the effect of noise or spots, or even make some
areas seem sharper in contrast. You can blur one area while sharpening
another to create an especially dramatic look, as shown in Figure 11-20. Of
course, you can also go too far with blurring and end up with something that
isn’t even recognizable, or you can fail to blur enough, leaving the content as
distracting as ever. The key is to find a happy medium where objects are still
recognizable, but nobody spends much time looking at them.
Figure 11-20: An apparent contrast in sharp and blurred areas of an image can be dramatic.

Photoshop has blur effects to match those in the sharpen category, including
the Blur tool and filters, such as Blur, Blur More, Gaussian Blur (the equiva-
lent of Unsharp Masking, but in reverse, in many ways), and Smart Blur.
Photoshop also has more specialized blur effects, including
 The kind of blur you get from subject or camera motion at relatively
slow shutter speeds
 A blur produced by lens effects
 A Radial blur, as if you were photographing a record player turntable
from above as it spun
 A Box blur, which blurs by using mosaic-like boxes
 A Shape blur, which uses your choice of oddball shapes to blur your
image
Fixing with filters
As you notice in the previous section on blurring and sharpening, filters can
be your friends. Although many of the filters available with Photoshop, in
other image editors, and from third-party vendors are best known for their
“special effect” capabilities, they can also be used to fix up your images, even
if you’re using the filter’s image transmogrification features just to disguise
an egregious problem in your photo.
That’s what I did when I found
myself with the photo shown in
Figure 11-21. It had all the elements
of a good picture: majestic water
bird in flight, interesting birdie pose,
magnificent clouds in the back-
ground, um . . . dSLR autofocus 
locking in on the clouds in the 
background, allowing the avian to
become a messy blur (see the inset).
Fortunately, I have dozens of add-on
filters at my disposal, including an
interesting clutch from the fine folks
at Alien Skin, who brought us
Xenofex, Eye Candy, and now, Snap-
Art. This plug-in offers hundreds of ways of transforming great photos into
great art by using media, such as colored pencil, comics, pastel, pen and
ink, oil painting, and many more. And if you don’t have a great photo that
needs transforming, it can do its stuff on mediocre images, like mine (see
Figure 11-22).

focus when the sky confuses the dSLR’s servos.

232
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Figure 11-22: Alien Skin’s Snap Art plug-in comes to the rescue.
Many more options and fine-tuning parameters are available than the “photo-
art” filters within Photoshop or other image editors, and Snap-Art includes
hundreds of preset effects so you can reproduce “canned” looks. Figure 11-23
shows how I turned my sorry excuse for a photo into a semi-abstract comic
book rendition in the Roy Lichtenstein tradition (albeit with somewhat less
artistic merit).
You can use other filters to mend your defective images quickly and some-
what easily. For example, as I note, sharpening filters can often fix photos
that are slightly out of focus. Blur filters can provide the illusion of reduced
depth-of-field if you want to isolate a subject using selective “focus.”
Distortion filters, like Photoshop’s Lens Correction filter, can fully or partially
eliminate some kinds of perspective distortion, remove chromatic aberration
(colored fringing around subjects), and eliminate inward or outward curving
(pincushion and barrel distortion, respectively) caused by some telephoto
and wide-angle lenses (also, respectively).
I’m no advocate of letting your image editor and its filters correct problems
that never should have been present in the first place, but when you do goof
(or want to use one of these pixel bending tools for artistic effect), it’s good
to have them available.

Figure 11-23: This comic book look is the best “fix” I can hope for.

Worse, you have an unsightly photo showing your mother-in-

happier if the image showed just the tree. That’s the sort of thing you can do
with an image editor, such as Photoshop. The simple editing and retouching
tasks I detail in Chapter 11 are cool enough on their own, but in this chapter,
you get serious performing real imaging magic to add or subtract objects,
move them around, or combine photos.

236
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
This chapter focuses on image editing with Photoshop. Your favorite image
editor might work similarly or have cool features of its own.
Making Selective Modifications
A wag once said that time is what keeps everything from happening at once.
The same can be said of selections in Photoshop: The ability to select one
portion of an image makes it possible to modify only that selection while
leaving everything else in the photo untouched. Selections are the basis for
just about every variety of image manipulation I describe in this chapter.
You’ll see this is true the first time you use the Sharpen filter to enhance the
sharpness of everything in an image because along with sharpening that face
in the foreground, the Sharpen filter can make some unwanted details in the
background more visible, too.
What is a selection?
In Photoshop, a selection is all the stuff inside the crawling selection border,
which is sometimes called marching ants. Selections can consist of an image
area within straight or irregular outlines; include multiple disconnected areas
in one selection; and have relatively solid edges or fuzzy, fading edges, as
shown in Figure 12-1.
A selection defines an area in which modifications can take place. You can
create selections with three kinds of edges: antialiased (smoothed), feathered
(fading out gradually), and non-antialiased (jagged edged). Selections can be
totally opaque, semitransparent, or graduated in transparency.
Figure 12-1: Selection edges can be sharp (left) or fuzzy (right).

Performing everyday changes with selections
After you successfully select part of your image, you can do lots of things
with the selection. These include
 Copying the selected area to an area of memory called the Clipboard,
where it sort of sits around waiting (until you copy something new to
replace it) so you can paste it into a new layer of its own. The copied por-
tion is surrounded by transparency, so it floats over the image area in the
layers below it. Press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on the Mac) to copy a selected area.
 Cutting the selected area so it is removed from your image. The cut por-
tion ends up on the Clipboard, just as if it was copied and is available for
pasting until you replace it on the Clipboard with something else. Press
Ctrl+X on a PC (Ô+X on the Mac) to cut a selected area.
 Changing the selection. After you make a selection, you can change its
boundaries, making them larger, smaller, and more or less feathered or
irregular. You can also add other selections to your original selection,
transform the size and shape of the selection, and invert it. Use the
Select menu to adjust a selection.
 Filling with the contents of other selected areas or images you’ve copied
to the Clipboard, thereby pasting one image into another. Press Ctrl+V
(Ô+V on the Mac) to paste an image that’s been copied to the Clipboard.
 Painting, filling, or modifying the selected areas by using any of the
brush-like and painting tools while rendering the rest of the image (the
nonselected area) immune to your fiddling. You can paint with color or
fill the area with a color or pattern. To apply changes, you can use the
Clone Stamp, Gradient tool, Dodge and Burn tools, Blur/Sharpen tools,
and many more utensils.
 Applying a filter only to a selected area.
 Masking selected areas to prevent them from being modified acciden-
tally. Use masking when you want to do a little brushwork on the back-
ground of an image but don’t want to mess with a face in the foreground.
Select the face as a protected mask (Photoshop lets you use selections
as either an active or a protected image area) and go to town.
 Transforming the selected area by changing its size, shape, or perspec-
tive; by flipping it horizontally or vertically (or both); and by rotating it.
Choose Select➪Transform Selection to apply these changes.
 Saving selections to use later when you want to reselect the same por-
tion of an image. Choose the Selection➪Save Selection and store the
selection as a file under a name you choose.
 Converting selections into vector-oriented paths that you can manipu-
late with the Pen tool. You go the other way, too, converting paths to
selections. Use the Make Work Path and Make Selection options, respec-
tively, in the Paths palette.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Making Basic Selections
Photoshop has three main selection tools: Marquee, Lasso, and Magic Wand.
Each tool has multiple variations. For example, the Marquee tool includes
Rectangular, Oval, and Single Row/Column versions. The Lasso tool includes
Polygonal and Magnetic varieties. The Magic Wand is pretty much the Magic
Wand (it’s magic, it’s a wand, and that’s about it) but does come in one varia-
tion, Photoshop CS3’s new Quick Selection tool, which although its icon is also
a wand, operates in a different way (by dragging around your object, as I
explain later). The tool you use depends on the shape of the image you want
to select. In the following sections, I offer the simple steps for using each tool.
Making rectangles, squares, ovals, and circles
Normally, you draw a Marquee selection by clicking and dragging to the cor-
rect size:
1. Select one of the Marquee tools from the Tool Palette (the tools are all
nested within the same icon) or press M to select the Marquee.
2. Then click and drag in your image, releasing the mouse button when
the selection is the size you want. (See Figure 12-2.)
Cancel your selection by clicking outside the selection border when using
a selection tool or by pressing Ctrl+D on a PC (Ô+D on the Mac). Make its
borders visible/invisible by pressing Ctrl+H on a PC (Ô+H on the Mac).
Figure 12-2: Round things lend themselves to selecting with the Elliptical Marquee.
Selection marquee

You can view all the nested tools hidden in a Photoshop Tool palette icon by
clicking the small triangle in the lower-right corner of the icon. When you
pass the mouse cursor over an icon, the name of the tool pops up. To display
all the tools, right-click (Control-click the Mac) the icon.
To radiate a selection outward with the clicked point as the center of
the selection, hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while
dragging. Hold down the Shift key while dragging to create a perfect circle
or square.
The Option bar gives you increased control over your Marquee selection:
 To create a selection with particular proportions (say, 5:7 if you want
to crop to the shape of a 5-x-7-inch print), select Fixed Aspect Ratio in
the Style drop-down list.
 If you want a selection with specific pixel dimensions, such as 640 x
480 pixels, select Fixed Size in the Style drop-down list.
 To feather the edges of your Marquee selection, which creates a fading
border effect, type a pixel value into the Feather box.
Selecting odd shapes
You can use the Lasso tool to make freehand selections of a part of an 
image:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tool palette (or press L).
You can choose from three types of Lasso:
• The Default Lasso sketches in a selection as if you were drawing
with a pencil.
• Click multiple times with the Polygonal Lasso to create odd-shaped
selections with straight lines.
• The Magnetic Lasso, at work in Figure 12-3, looks for edges while
you drag, and it hugs those edges by using Option bar options,
such as width, edge contrast, frequency (number of magnetized
points to lay down), and (with a pressure-sensitive tablet) pen
pressure or line thickness.
2. Drag around the outline of the area to be selected.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Figure 12-3: The Magnetic Lasso clings tightly to outlines.
Selecting pixels
The Magic Wand tool, as shown in Figure 12-4, selects pixels that are similar
in hue and value to the pixel you first clicked. The Magic Wand is a good tool
for selecting plain areas with few contrasting details, such as the sky, blank
walls, or solid colors. After you select this tool, use the Option bar to set how
the tools should work:
 You can set the Magic Wand tool to select only pixels that touch each
other (contiguous) or similar pixels anywhere in the image (noncontigu-
ous). Select either mode from the Option bar.
 Decide how fussy you want the wand to be by choosing a Tolerance set-
ting from 0 (really fussy) to 255 (accepts just about anything).
A default value of 32 usually works best, but you can increase or reduce
this number to select more or fewer pixels.
 Select the Use All Layers box to tell the wand to select pixels based on
information in all the layers of your image, rather than just the currently
active layer.

Figure 12-4: The Magic Wand is good for selecting evenly toned, evenly colored subjects, like
the sky in this picture.
The Quick Selection tool, nested in Photoshop CS3’s tool palette with the
Magic Wand, can be dragged around the periphery of a relatively well-defined
shape (one surrounded by a background that might be suitable for selection
with the Magic Wand, for example). While you drag, the tool creates a selec-
tion around your object. Although the selection may not “look” right at first,
as shown in Figure 12-5, in which the selection border appears to be on the
wrong side of the lighthouse spire, when you continue to define the selection,
it corrects itself.
After you’ve used this tool for a while and are familiar with how it defines a
selection, mark the Auto-Enhance check box to allow the Quick Selection tool
to more closely align the selection border with the object. You can make fur-
ther improvements to the selection border by clicking the Refine Edge button
after the selection is complete. Both toolbar controls are shown in the inset
in Figure 12-5.

Figure 12-5: The Quick Selection tool allows you to drag a selection around the edges of an

Painting selections
Photoshop’s Quick Mask mode is a great way to create your selections by
painting them with any size and shape brush that you want. While in Quick
Mask mode, you can also use other selection tools, such as the Lasso tool or
Magic Wand, to select areas that you then fill with the mask color. Here’s how:
1. To enter Quick Mask mode, click the Quick Mask icon in the Tool
palette or simply press Q.
2. (Optional) Double-click the Quick Mask icon to set several options,
such as the opacity and color of the tone used to represent the
painted mask. 

You can also choose whether the tone represents the areas that are
selected for editing, or the areas that are protected from editing
(masked). I prefer to paint the actual selection I want.
If you’re working with a subject that contains a lot of red, you might
want to use a mask painting color other than red. You can also select
whether the painted area represents a selection (an area that can be
worked on) or a mask (a protected area).
3. With the Brush, paint the area you want to select/mask.
For the image shown in Figure 12-6, I wanted to blur part of the back-
ground, so I painted a selection that included the parts to be blurred.
Figure 12-6: Paint your selections by using Quick Mask mode.
4. Apply whatever changes you want to make to the selected area.
In my example, as shown in Figure 12-7, I applied the Blur filter.
5. Press Q again to exit Quick Mask mode.

Figure 12-7: The painted areas become fuzzy when the Blur filter is applied.
Fiddling with your selections
After you select part of an image, you can apply all sorts of effects to your
selections, including marking the Anti-Aliased box in the Option bar to
smooth the edges of freehand or elliptical selections. (Rectangles don’t need
smoothing.) Type a value into the Feather box to create a selection that fades
out over the range of pixels you specify. Add to a selection by holding down
the Shift key while you drag with any selection tool to create additional
selected areas. Subtract from a selection by holding down the Alt key (Option
on the Mac) while dragging the area you want removed. If you want the selec-
tion tool to default to normal, add, or subtract mode, you can also click the
Normal, Add, or Subtract icons (natch) on the Option bar. Another handy
tool is the Intersect button, which lets you create a selection that consists
only of the portion that overlaps both the new and original selection.
You can also modify selections by using the Select menu. You find options for
selecting everything in the image (usually it’s easier to press Ctrl+A to select
all or Ô+A on the Mac) or to select nothing (press Ctrl+D or Ô+D on the
Mac). You might also choose to select based on a range of colors that you
specify; to feather the current selection; to modify the selection border
width, size, and smoothness; to grow the selection to adjacent pixels meeting
the current tolerance parameters; or to select pixels anywhere in the image
that are similar to those chosen already. The Transform Selection option can
be useful for sizing, rotating, or skewing a selection.

One handy new tool added to
Photoshop CS3 is the Refine Edge
facility, available by clicking the
Refine Edge button when a selection
is complete. The Refine Edge dialog
box, as shown in Figure 12-8,
appears. It contains sliders for
smoothing, feathering, expanding, or
contracting the selection edge, plus
increasing the size of the selection
edge radius or enhancing the con-
trast. Photoshop can show you the
effects of your changes in various
modes (including Quick Mask mode,
and the selection contrasted against
a black or white background).
Although Refine Edge isn’t a magic
tool, it does allow you to use the
selection tools built into Photoshop
more intelligently.
Adding to and Subtracting
from Your Pictures
Instead of tearing all your wedding
photos in half, you can replace your ex-spouse with a potted plant, which
might be more appropriate than you think. Did your brother-in-law end up
mugging in every single group photo taken at your last family reunion? Does
that 1977 Pinto parked in the driveway otherwise detract from the beautiful
landscaping in the photo of your stately manor home? Sure, you could’ve
been smarter when you snapped the original photo, but at least you have the
opportunity to redeem yourself by removing the offending person or object
in Photoshop.
Evicting your ex-brother-in-law
Okay, your sister has untied the knot, and her former spouse has left the
state. Why is he still haunting all the family photos? Your best move might be
to take him out (unless you live in the kind of family where that phrase has a
different context). Photoshop can do the job. Figure 12-9 shows a typical
“problem” picture. The guy on the left is the one I want to get rid of. I can
copy portions of the background over the parts of him that overlap areas I
want to keep and then crop the image so the rest of him is excluded from the
final photo.

selections with several different controls.

246
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Figure 12-9: How can I get rid of the guy on the left?
The steps to follow are fairly easy:
1. Use a selection tool to grab
parts of the background to
either side of the person you
want to delete and then copy
the selections to a new layer.
A new layer is created automati-
cally when you paste your
copied selection. The resulting
layer looks like Figure 12-10.
You can make the initial selec-
tion by using the Lasso tool or
in Quick Mask mode. Then
press Ctrl+J on a PC (Ô+J on
the Mac) to copy the selection
directly to a new layer. This is
usually a lot faster than pressing Ctrl/Ô+C (copy) followed by Ctrl/Ô+V
(paste).
2. Move the background pieces so they cover the unwanted ex-relative.
After they’re pasted, the copied pieces reside in their own layer, so you
can move them around as you want within that layer.
3. Press E to select the Eraser and use an eraser brush (I selected a soft-
edged eraser brush) to remove the edges of the background pieces so
they blend in with the original background, as shown in Figure 12-11.
Figure 12-10: Grab part of the background to
cover up the unwanted image area.

Figure 12-11: Blend in the background pieces.
4. Flatten the image (choose Layer➪Flatten) to merge all the layers.
5. With the Crop tool, trim the image so it includes only the two main
subjects and some of the background around them, as you see in
Figure 12-12.

Bringing a family closer together
In some situations, you’ll want to bring two subjects who are separated
closer together. Perhaps you deleted a person in the middle, leaving a huge
gap. Other times, the problem stems from a series of unfortunate seating
events. You can use the same techniques from the preceding section to bring
family members (or any other subjects) closer together.
I started with the photo shown in Figure 12-12 and brought the people closer
together by following these steps. Although every picture is unique, you can
likely follow similar steps in your own photos:
1. I copied the fellow on the right and pasted him into his own layer.
2. I copied some of the background that surrounded him because that
makes it easier to blend him in later on.
3. I clicked the Eyeball icon in the left column of the Layers palette to make
the new layer invisible temporarily.
4. Going back to the original layer (click it to reactivate), I copied portions
of the background surrounding his original location and pasted them in
a new layer to cover up the original figure.
5. I blended in the new background so it looked natural.
With your own photo, you might need to lighten or darken the back-
ground (choose Image➪Adjustments➪Brightness/Contrast). Or, copy
some of the pixels from one area to the overlapping area by using the
Clone Stamp to blend the transition.
6. I clicked the Eyeball icon in the hidden layer with the guy to make him
visible again.
7. I used the Eraser to remove some of the edges so the guy blended in
with the two layers underneath.
8. I flattened the image (choose Layer➪Flatten) and cropped to produce
the final photo, as shown in Figure 12-13.
Adding New Backgrounds
You can’t always count on having a background that’s as interesting as your
main subject. If you catch Renée Zellweger or Hugh Grant sneaking out the
back door of a restaurant and the background is a pile of garbage cans, you
end up with a photo that isn’t worth a mention in Bridget Jones’ diary. Go to
work in Photoshop and replace those cans with, say, Central Park, and you
might have something. Adding a new background is easy, particularly if the
existing background can be easily selected with the tools I describe in the
section, “Making Basic Selections,” earlier in this chapter. 

Figure 12-13: Photoshop brought these brothers closer together.
Figure 12-14 shows a shot taken on an overcast fall day, when the foliage was
at its most colorful and the clouds in the sky were dull and lifeless. I shot the
photo anyway and let Photoshop come to the rescue.

I used the following steps to improve the original background. You can use
the same steps for any background you want to replace:
1. Find some suitable background in another photo and paste it into a
new layer in the photo that needs the facelift.
Select the new background and then press Ctrl+C on a PC (Ô+C on a
Mac), followed by Ctrl+V on a PC (Ô+V on a Mac) in the document that
needs the new background.
The new cloudy sky for my picture looked like Figure 12-15.
2. Switch to the original layer,
use the Magic Wand to select
the background that you want
to replace, and set a Tolerance
level.
I selected the main, dull-looking
sky area and used a Tolerance
level of 32.
3. If you have lots of separate
little bits of background (like
the little bits of sky that
peeped through the leaves in my picture), choose Select➪Similar to
expand the selection.
The selection now includes all the niggly little bits of background that
would have been a pain to select individually.
4. Invert the selection by choosing Select➪Invert so that everything
except the sky and gaps in the leaves is selected.
Or press Ctrl+Shift+I on a PC or Ô+Shift+I on the Mac.
5. Switch to the layer that contains the new background and then press
Delete to remove the replacement sky area that isn’t needed.
After I pressed Delete, I was left with only one broad patch of clouds,
plus many smaller slivers, as shown in Figure 12-16.
6. Flatten that image like a pancake (choose Layer➪Flatten) to end up
with your final, one-layer image.
I ended up with the photo shown in Figure 12-17.

Combining Several dSLR Photos into One
About the most entertaining thing you can do with a mouse (assuming you’re
not a cat) is combining photographs to create a new image (also called com-
positing). One of my favorite tricks involves taking an everyday object, such
as my car, and placing it in exotic locales. Dropping a new object into an
existing photo is no more difficult than replacing a background, and in some
respects, it’s a lot easier.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Figure 12-18 shows the automobile in question parked in a grungy gravel
driveway.
The steps are fairly simple: Select the object and copy it to a new layer on an
image that contains a suitable background. The only hard part is blending in
the object so it looks like it belongs there. Here’s how I did both:
1. Use the Lasso tool to select the object, including lots of the back-
ground, and press Ctrl+J on a PC (Ô+J on a Mac) to copy the selection
to a new layer in the current document.
2. Click the Eyeball icon in the layer with the background to make it
invisible, switch back to the copied layer, and use the Eraser tool to
remove everything that isn’t part of the object (in my case, my car).
Using the Eraser makes it easier to remove the surroundings carefully, a
bit at a time. Make a mistake and press Ctrl+Z on a PC (Ô+Z on the Mac)
to reverse your last step. If you don’t catch a goof in time, work your
way through the History palette one step at a time until you get back to
the point where you want to resume erasing.
Figure 12-18: You can take this vehicle for a drive without even leaving Photoshop!
A hard-edged eraser makes a good tool for working on straight edges
(like the top of the automobile), and a soft-edged eraser brush comes in
handy for areas where you don’t have to be precise (like the undercar-
riage). It wasn’t necessary for me to be too precise around the underside

of the car because I planned to blend that portion in with the road in the
new background.
You want to end up with an image that looks like Figure 12-19.
Figure 12-19: Extract the object carefully so you can blend it 
in with its new background.
3. Copy the extracted object and paste it in a second image.
I selected an image of a rural roadway in southern Spain.
4. Sprinkle in special touches as needed.
The auto didn’t look like it belonged in this setting, so I added a few spe-
cial touches:
• I darkened the underside of the car (especially in front) to make it
look as if the car was casting shadows on the ground around it.
• Shadows from the surrounding trees were cast on the road, so I used
Quick Mask mode to select some areas on the side (just beneath the
side mirror) and darkened those areas to match the road shadows.
I selected an area above the front wheel well, extending across the
hood, and another on the back deck, and lightened them as if the
bright ray of sunlight was striking those surfaces.
• I used the Photoshop Lens Flare plug-in (choose Filters➪Render➪
Lens Flare) to add a bright glare to the rear quarter-window.
5. When all is satisfactory, flatten the image (choose Layer➪Flatten).
I ended up with the version shown in Figure 12-20.

Figure 12-20: A successful composite is a lot of work, but it’s worth it.
The pitfalls of compositing images
You can see that a lot of work might be necessary to make the merger of two
images look realistic. The pasted-in objects must have similar texture and
lighting and must be shown from the proper angle and perspective. You can’t
take a photo from a low angle on a cloudy day and paste an object from that
image into a background taken from a higher angle on an overcast day. If you
do, you get a less-successful result, like the atrocity shown in Figure 12-21.
In this case, I started with the same automobile picture but decided to jazz it
up a little. I copied the original car layer and painted the duplicate with vari-
ous colors, including red for the body and brown for the convertible top.

Figure 12-21: Something is wrong here; it looks like a cutout pasted onto a poster.
Then, I merged the colored layer with the original layer by changing the
Blending Mode options in the Layers palette from Normal to Overlay. That
combines the colors in the top layer with the detail in the layer underneath.
The car certainly looks sportier, but the scale is all wrong for the plaza it’s
now set in. The angle of view is too high, and the lighting is wrong because
the background image was taken on an overcast day. Not my best effort, but
it serves as an example of what not to do!
Getting creative with compositing
Don’t be afraid to experiment when combining images. You can create realis-
tic composites, like the one shown on the right in Figure 12-22, or completely
preposterous fantasies, like the one in Figure 12-23.
For the castle/moat photo, I added some clouds and then reversed the upper
half of the photo to create a more vivid reflection in the moat. The Eiffel
Tower on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea demonstrates what can be done
if you have Photoshop and don’t know much about geography.

 Someday your prints will come
 Output options
 Choosing your printer
Years ago, some wise futurists predicted that digital photography would
spell the end of photographic prints, just as the advent of word process-
ing, fax machines, text messaging, and e-mail would cause the Post Office to
close its doors, overnight delivery services to go bankrupt, and manufactur-
ers of file cabinets to switch to more profitable products, like personal aero-
planes. If you believed these folks, the paperless office would be followed by
the printless home, and we’d all be doing our reading and photo viewing on
computer monitors, TV sets, or cell phones.
Of course, these seers are the grandchildren of the prognosti-
cators who foresaw the invention of the automobile, but
had no clue about smog, traffic jams, or road rage. If any-
thing, we’re creating more prints today than a decade
ago because we can make them at home or in the
office, upload digital files to our local megamart for
one-hour printing, or stop by a retailer’s handy kiosk
to custom-print hard copies for about the same cost
as those automated machine prints we got from film
back in the dark ages.
Technology has helped create brand-new uses for
images, including e-mail and desktop presentations,
while not reducing the original need for hard copy prints.
Electronic distribution of images has blossomed, but not at
the expense of traditional applications for prints.
This chapter outlines some of your options and shows you that hard copies
really don’t have to be hard.

258
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Prints? What Prints?
As you find out in Chapter 16, some photo sharing sites are geared for seri-
ous photographers. They display your prize images in sharp-looking galleries
rather than the more amateur-oriented “albums” provided by consumer
photo sharing services. You can also display your images on your own Web
pages, e-mail them to friends and colleagues, exchange them over instant
messaging services, or array them into PowerPoint presentations. It’s entirely
possible for a photographic image to begin and end its life as bits and bytes,
created by a digital camera and viewed only on a display screen.
But you probably don’t want to go that route for all your photos. Passing
prints around and displaying framed photos on the wall or grand piano is one
of the greatest joys of photography. Digital photography makes printing
copies for distribution or festooning your furniture with frames easier than
ever. Here are some very good reasons for making prints:
 Share with friends and family. This is the traditional application
for prints. Do you want to drag a computer along to the next family
reunion — or do you want to have a stack of prints to pass around?
 Display your work. They do make LCD “photo frames” you can set on the
piano to show off a picture or two, but making an 8-x-10-inch or bigger
enlargement to frame and hang on the wall is much more satisfying (and,
possibly, ostentatious, as you can see by the ornate frame in Figure 13-1).
Figure 13-1: You can hang a print on the wall, but it’s hard to frame a computer!

 Sell yourself and your work. Many photographers are turning to digital
portfolios, but when you want to have images available for viewing by
prospective employers or clients, a print is still the best way to show off
your work.
 Submit for approval. You have the job; now you need to secure the
approval of your boss or client. You could e-mail a low-resolution copy
to the person passing judgment, assuming that person can view the
image on a computer. Or, you can print a fine-tuned proof that’s an accu-
rate representation of your image and use that.
 Restore or re-create an existing photo. Not all digital prints need to
originate from your digital camera. You’ll often need to create a restored
or enlarged copy of an existing print, with all the wrinkles and tears
removed, and perhaps improvements made in your subject matter
through judicious image editing. A scanner, an inkjet printer, and an
image-editing program may be all you need.
 Create camera-ready or for-position-only art. Most professional print-
ers today can work from digital files. However, you’ll find that it’s often
helpful to have a print to paste into a layout, either for reproduction or
to create a dummy that can be used for approval purposes.
 Make a teaser. My local newspaper prefers to receive submissions as
high-resolution TIFF files on a CD. Even so, I always include a print or
two of the shots I want the editor to look at. A compelling print can
bring my CD up to the top of the to-do pile.
You Pays Your Money, You Takes Your Choice
When it comes time to make a print, you need to choose between making it
yourself, using an online service, or working with a local retailer/print lab.
Oddly enough, with today’s technology, you can sometimes end up using all
three methods with a single print order. You can, for example, upload digital
images online to your local retailer and then trot down and pick prints while
making a few yourself with the lab’s kiosk.
Indeed, your choice of method for printing images isn’t so much an economic
decision as it is one of convenience, flexibility, and control. Some options are
easier than others. Some let you do more things with your image before print-
ing. Others give you absolute control over how your image looks. All of them
end up costing roughly the same on a per-print basis, which is why many
serious photographers use a mixture of methods.

Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Doing it yourself
If you’re serious enough about photography to be using a dSLR, you probably
want a photo-quality printer close at hand to run off prints as needed. Here
are some considerations to take into account for the do-it-yourself approach:
 Equipment: You need to invest in a printer. Good photo printers can
cost $100 to $300 or more, which isn’t a lot when amortized over the two
or three years (or longer) that you’ll be using the device. Better printers
are always coming along, of course, so you might want to upgrade
sooner. 
Factor in the price of the printer as well as consumables, like paper and
ink, when calculating the per-print cost of your hard copies.
 Speed: Doing your own printing is the fastest way to get a hard copy in
your hands when you’re in a hurry.
 Quality: When you become familiar with your printer’s operation, you
can often tweak your images to look their best with your particular
setup. The fine-tuning may take place in your image editor or using the
printer’s own controls.
 Flexibility: If you print your own images, you can use a larger variety of
paper stocks than your local retailer may have available, make prints in
oddball sizes, or print on both sides of a sheet (which you can do with
some photo-quality printers with duplexing capabilities, such as certain
Canon Pixma models).
 Backup: Unless you have more than one color printer, your rush pro-
jects will always be dependent on the continued health of your mainstay.
Fortunately, should your printer fail, you can use one of the other print-
ing options or run down to the local Quik-E-Mart and buy a new printer
for $50 or so. Remember to have extra ink on hand!
Online output outsourcing options
The universe seems to be moving online. I’m sure someday there will be
remote digital cameras set up at key tourist spots, like the Taj Mahal, allow-
ing you to take your vacation pictures without ever leaving home. About the
only thing you can’t do through the Internet is take your dog for a walk.
Meanwhile, you can order and distribute prints right from your computer.
Yahoo!, AOL, Shutterfly, Kodak, and other sites have Web-based picture ser-
vices you can use to share and print your best efforts. Technically, you don’t
even need a computer or digital camera. Nokia has an agreement with the
Kodak Picture Center that allows cell phone users to phone in images they’ve
snapped and place orders for prints.

Here are some considerations for the online option:
 Need for speed: Your digital SLR photos are likely to be megabytes in
size even if you’re shooting in JPEG format. If you want to upload images
from your computer to a Web service, you definitely need a broadband
connection. Although most digital photographers have broadband at
home and work, sometimes you can’t upload photos quickly, such as
when you’re traveling.
 Honest-to-gosh photo prints: When you order digital prints online, you
can receive hard copies made the old-fashioned way, using conventional
photographic paper and chemicals. If you value the quality and poten-
tially extended longevity of traditional photo prints, online ordering is
one way to get them. (You can also get real prints locally, as I explain in
a bit.)
 Ordering prints for delivery: Online services make prints and mail
them back to you or to a third party. That makes a Web-print service
especially useful for sharing prints with folks back home when, say,
you’re touring Paris and get a few minutes at un café de cyber. (Dozens of
these are in the City of Light, by the way, ranging from Jardin de
l’Internet to Station Internet Rive Gauche.)
 Ordering prints to go: Retailers, like Wal-Mart, let you upload images to
their Web site and specify pick-up at your local store. They’re usually
ready by the time you get there.
 Economy and ease: If you don’t plan to edit your photos much (or
the chore is already out of the way), you can’t beat the ease and econ-
omy of ordering prints online. Just upload, specify print sizes and other
details, and pay as little as 10 cents or so per print. What could be
easier?
Live, and in person!
If you like, you can also trot down to your local retailer or professional photo
lab and get your prints directly. This approach can combine some of the
advantages of making prints yourself and using an online service. For exam-
ple, you can use a kiosk and perform cropping and some image editing just as
you would at home — even if you’re on vacation hundreds of miles from your
own computer. And, you enjoy the speed and economy of using a lab geared
up to produce quantity prints.
261
Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard

262
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Your in-person options range from
using a standalone kiosk to view and
print photos with the kiosk’s printer
(such as the one shown in Figure
13-2), working with a kiosk that’s
connected to the retailer’s digital
photo lab, or handing your digital
memory cards (or a CD you’ve
burned) to a technician and leaving
everything up to them. You might
find these services at a retail store
or avail yourself of a lab geared to
serious amateur and professional
photographers. Either way, you walk
in, get your prints made, and walk
out (or sometimes, return to pick up
your pictures later).
Considerations include
 Compatibility: You don’t need
to worry about having a broad-
band connection because retail
locations accept your memory
cards, CDs, and other media. Or
do they? Some older kiosks and
facilities might not be compati-
ble with every oddball memory
card, mini-CD, or Sony media-of-
the-month. Fortunately, digital
SLRs generally use the univer-
sally accepted CompactFlash or
Secure Digital (SD) cards, but if
you happen to have some
photos on a mini-xD or Sony
Memory Stick Duo, ascertain in
advance that your chosen retailer can work with it.
 Choice of photo-quality or printer-quality output: Some retailers give
you a choice of the type of output you receive. You can have a print made
with a kiosk’s built-in printer or direct your order to the store’s digital
photo lab that uses conventional photographic paper and chemicals.
 Economy: Photo labs are geared to produce quantity prints. If you need
a whole bunch of hardcopies, you’ll almost always find that a quick trip
to your retailer saves you money and time.
Figure 13-2: Walk up to the kiosk and make
your prints live, and in person.

Choosing a Printer
Digital SLR owners have only one special consideration when choosing a per-
sonal printer for their hardcopy needs. As serious photographers, they’re
likely to want really, really good prints to match the stunning images they
create with their sophisticated cameras. As a result, just any old printer prob-
ably won’t do. You’ll want a printer that’s especially good for outputting pho-
tographs, such as the snapshot photo printer, as shown in Figure 13-3.
Fortunately, printer quality and flexibility has improved dramatically in the
past few years. This section helps you choose the perfect printer.
Today, your choices are between inkjet or dye-sublimation printers. Output
devices, such as thermal wax or laser printers, have become niche options
for some specialized applications, or, in the case of the color lasers, for mass
production uses where image quality isn’t paramount.
Figure 13-3: Some printers do one thing — snapshots — and do it very well.
263
Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard

264
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Inkjet printers
Most of the photo printers sold now are inkjet models. These models pro-
duce images by squirting tiny droplets of ink onto paper, using various meth-
ods to control the size and placement of the drops. For example, Epson uses
piezoelectric crystals sandwiched between two electrodes to vibrate the ink
cartridge with different levels of voltage, causing the crystals to vibrate in
ways that adjust the colors and the amount of color sprayed through a nozzle
onto the paper. Other inkjet printing systems use heat or other properties to
control the flow of ink. With resolutions ranging from about 300 dpi (dots per
inch) to 1,440 dpi and higher, inkjets can easily produce photo-quality
images, assuming you use good quality photo paper.
Current models run the gamut of features and prices, with many excellent
models available from $100 to $300. To pay more than that, you probably
need to buy a wide-carriage printer capable of handling paper wider than 8.5
inches. As a photographer, you may indeed want to make 11 x 14 or larger
prints. 
Features to look for are
 Size and design: Some printers hog your desk space or feature clumsy
paper paths that require lots of space behind or in front of the printer
for the paper trays. A few printers weigh a ton, too. If a printer is so
unwieldy that you can’t locate it near your computer, you end up doing a
lot of walking or reaching to retrieve your printouts.
 Speed: Output speed is likely to be important to you only if you make
lots of prints and don’t like to wait. Some printers can be two or three
times faster than another, so if speed is crucial (say, you’re toting your
printer around to events to output prints for customers on demand),
check your intended printer’s specification carefully. You’ll want to make
a test print, too, because vendors use best-case figures even though
you’ll probably be printing under worst-case conditions.
 Number of inks: Most photo printers today use six colors of ink: black,
cyan, magenta, yellow, photo cyan, and photo magenta. The two latter
inks are “weak” versions that provide more subtle gradations of tone. A
few printers add red and green tanks (see Figure 13-4), allowing them to
print richer reds, additional orange tones, and more realistic greens.
Some have both a photo black and text black ink. Generally, in terms of
quality, the more ink tanks the better. But, you have to replenish those
inks at a cost of $11 or so per tank. (Ink prices vary by brand and car-
tridge type.) If your quality needs are slightly lower, you may be able to
get away with a printer having fewer colors. I have both a four-color
inkjet (used for quick and dirty printouts) and an eight-color model
(used for slow and exquisite output).

Figure 13-4: The more ink tanks you have, the more colors you can print.
 Resolution: More resolution is usually better (some models provide
1200 x 4800 dpi resolution), but the higher resolutions have some trade-
offs, such as the traditional gamut versus dot-size dilemma. More inks
produce a larger range of colors, but printers offering extra color depth
often use larger ink droplets. So, a printer with only six colors that out-
puts 1-picoliter droplets can produce more detail but fewer colors than a
printer with eight tanks and 2-picoliter droplets. Higher-resolution print-
ers with tinier nozzles often suffer from clogging issues, too, and the spe-
cial inks they require may not have the same longevity.
 Paper handling: Some inkjet printers produce only 4-x-6-inch prints.
They’re designed to output snapshots only, quickly and economically.
Others let you print 5-x-7 or 8.5-x-11-inch prints as well as other sizes.
Investigate your printer’s ability to handle various paper stocks and
thicknesses, too.
 Memory card access/PictBridge capabilities: A printer that has built-in
memory card slots or a PictBridge-compatible camera-to-printer cable
connection (as shown in Figures 13-5 and 13-6) are especially conve-
nient. Your digital SLR may allow you to specify images for printing right
in the camera. Then, you insert your memory card in the printer’s slot
or connect the camera to the printer with a cable and start the printing
process.
 Duplex printing: The ability to print on both sides of a sheet automati-
cally is useful not only for creating text documents. If you’re preparing an
album or portfolio, you can print on both sides of the sheet using special
dual-sided photo paper and printers that have duplexing capability.
265
Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard

266
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Figure 13-5: A memory card can go directly from your camera to the printer . . .
 Input/output trays: The input
tray(s) hold the paper you’re
printing on; the output trays
catch the finished prints when
they come out. The higher the
capacity of each, the better for
you. One of my favorite printers
has a vertical 150-sheet input
tray that doesn’t take up any
space behind the printer and a
second 150-sheet cassette that
fits underneath the printer. I can
put different types and sizes of
stock in each, alternating, say,
between 8.5-x-11- and 4-x-6-inch
sheets, or fill both with the
same paper and print 300 sheets
in a row. Your output tray
should be large enough to catch
all the prints you make in a session without spilling any on the floor.
 Controls: Printers have a plethora of controls to adjust every function,
perhaps an LCD to use to preview images and a keypad to navigate
menus and options. Others may have a power switch and a paper tray
select button and little more, requiring you to control every parameter
from your computer with the printer driver. Each approach has its
advantages: Printers with lots of controls, if they have memory card
slots, can be used in portable or standalone mode without any computer
attached. Printers that rely heavily on the printer driver are usually
faster to operate and allow storing groups of settings on your computer
for reuse at any time.
Figure 13-6: . . . or you can link your camera to
the printer with a PictBridge cable.

Dye-sublimation printers
Your other choice for printer technology is likely to be the dye-sublimation
printer, which has been enjoying a rebirth of sorts now that vendors have
managed to bring down the costs for the equipment and the prints. You can
find excellent snapshot-size dye-sub printers for $150 or less and pay about
the same as you would for an inkjet print or one from your local photo lab.
The advantage of dye-sublimation printers is that even the most modest of
them produce prints that are superior to run-of-the-mill inkjet output. The
best can generate prints that are exquisite indeed. Most of the dye-sub print-
ers you’ll encounter are 4-x-6-inch photo printers, but I’ve enjoyed using 8.5-
x-11-inch models from Olympus and other vendors that are a joy to use.
Despite their cryptic name, dye-sublimation printers work in a relatively
straightforward way. A strip of plastic film, called a transfer ribbon, is coated
with cyan, magenta, and yellow dye. When a print job is sent to the printer, a
thermal print head heats up the page-sized panel of plastic transfer ribbon.
Variations in temperature control what colors and the amount of color that
are applied to the paper. Because the paper has a special coating on it, the
dye sticks. Often, a final clear protective layer is applied after the color has
been laid on. A dye-sub ribbon cartridge is shown in Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7: Individual color panels apply one hue at a time to your print.
267
Chapter 13: Hard Copies Aren’t Hard

268
Part IV: Fine-Tuning Your Output 
Dye-sub printers can apply color with a vast range of tones because each of
the hues can be added over a range of 256 colors, for a possible 16.8 million
different colors. These printers don’t need the high resolution that inkjets
require to mimic millions of colors by combining teensy dots of ink. So, a 300
dpi dye-sublimation printer can achieve photo output that’s as good or better
than a 1,440-dpi inkjet.
That means that dye-sub printers are useful almost exclusively for
photographs; text quality is generally quite poor at their 300 dpi or lower
resolution. Still, the subtle results they produce are great for professional
designers, artists, and photographers. The high cost of the special paper
and ribbons in larger sizes may be prohibitive for small businesses and
home users, but the 4-x-6-inch models are economical enough for anyone.
If you want dye-sub 8 x 10 prints, you pay a lot more for an advanced unit.
In terms of considerations to look for, some of them are the same as for inkjet
printers. Size and design, speed, paper handling options, availability of
memory cards, and the placement and use of controls all are important fac-
tors for dye-sub printers, too. Others, such as number of inks, resolution,
duplexing capabilities, and paper handling, don’t apply.

and you’re well on the way to technical excellence
and photo perfection. However, if you’re looking for
the top ten techniques to provide instant results,
you can’t beat the collection of quality-enhancing
approaches that I outline in this chapter.
Does Lighting Ever Strike Twice?
Yes, good lighting can be repeatable if you know what you’re doing. And noth-
ing can destroy a photo faster than bad lighting. You can make lots of improve-
ments to a challenging subject simply by using good lighting techniques.

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Your uncle’s bald head, a teenager’s less-than-perfect complexion, a harshly
lit beach scene, a drop of falling water — you can portray all these attrac-
tively with effective lighting techniques. In your uncle’s case, throwing the
top of his head in shadow and avoiding shiny lights on his upper hemisphere
can minimize the glare from his bare pate. The teenager might benefit from
diffuse lighting that softens the texture of his or her face. You can fix up that
glaring direct sunlight on the beach by using a reflector to bounce light into
the shadows. And you can freeze a drop of water in midair with a halo of light
added by an electronic flash.
To use light effectively and take your photography to the next level, here are
some tricks you’ll want to master:
 Managing the quality of light: Light can be highly directional or soft and
diffuse. It can cast sharp shadows and dot your subjects with specular
highlights. Light comes in different colors, too. Figure 14-1 shows the
kind of effect you can get with diffuse light.
 Using multiple lights: Photographers create some of the best pictures
by using two, three, four, or more lights. One source can be used to illu-
minate the main part of your subject, and others can outline its edges,
fill in the shadows, or call attention to a particular area. Some lighting
arrangements are used often enough that they have their own names:
broad lighting, rim lighting, Paramount lighting, and so forth. Other
arrangements are setups you create.
If you can master applying multiple lights to model and shape the appear-
ance of your subjects, you’ll have a powerful tool at your disposal.
 Making best use of a light source’s duration: Generally, electronic flash
units are the main noncontinuous light source photographers put to
work. Using the duration of the flash creatively requires practice and
experience. Some techniques are simple. For example, you can use your
flash’s brief duration (particularly when shooting up close) to freeze
even the fastest action. More complex is the use of repeating flashes to
trace movement or balancing flash output with ambient light to create
combination exposures. Entire books have been written on these topics,
so you have lots to discover.
 Subtracting light: Sometimes, you don’t want to add light to a scene
as much as you want to remove it, to create a particular lighting effect
or look. Barndoors are little flaps that look like a horse’s blinders, and
fit over an electronic flash or other light source to block the light or
feather it onto a subject. Opaque sheets can block light coming from a
particular direction, functioning as a sort of reverse reflector. Gadgets
that stage lighting directors call cookies or gobos can change the size
and shape of a beam of light. With lighting effects, sometimes less is
more.

Choosing a Righteous Resolution 
and Other Settings
Strictly speaking, the resolution of your digital SLR is the number of pixels
captured — say, 3,872 x 2,592 pixels for the typical 10-megapixel model. Most
of the time, the top resolution is the one you want to select. However, as I dis-
cuss in Chapter 8, the file format you choose can affect the sharpness and file
size of a digital image, too. It’s the overall sharpness — which is affected by
resolution — that you want to work with.
Some digital SLRs offer a choice of both compressed and uncompressed RAW
files, perhaps a TIFF option, and several levels of JPEG compression. You can
always select the highest resolution, least compressed, least processed
image format. But if you answer “no” to any of the following questions, you’ll
want to put some thought into your resolution/format/settings decisions:
 Do you have unlimited memory card and hard drive space?
 Do you mind waiting while your pictures transfer to your computer?
 Do you want the ultimate in quality?
 Are you willing to spend at least some time with each shot in an image
editor?
These are some of the things you have to think about. In the following sec-
tions, I explain some situations that call for special considerations.
Changing environments
You’re taking candid photos under conditions that vary abruptly and unex-
pectedly, say, at a concert or party in a night club with frequent lighting
273

changes. Or, you’re outdoors at sunset and both the quantity and color of the
illumination changes over the course of 10 or 15 minutes.
Although the high resolution afforded by your camera’s RAW option has its
value, in rapidly changing environments, you should place a higher premium
on the RAW format’s ability to
 Adjust white balance and exposure after the fact.
 Apply noise reduction.
 Apply tonal curves.
Particularly when it comes to white balance, you’ll find that the manual
changes you make when the file is imported into your image editor are likely
to be more accurate and more easily customized than the default or auto-
matic settings that your camera applies. For details on how to correct these
problems in an image editor, flip to Chapter 11.
Living with limited memory card space
You’re leaving for a two-week vacation, and you have three 1GB memory
cards, want to leave your laptop at home, and don’t own one of those portable
CD/DVD burners. None of the other options — such as uploading your shots
to the Internet at a cyber café — seems attractive. You likely need to explore a
resolution other than the highest RAW resolution. For example, the following
list illustrates one possible scenario out of dozens, given a particular camera
(the numbers you can expect vary, depending on what camera you use):
 At the highest RAW setting, say this particular camera gets 246 shots
per 4GB card, or about 18 shots per day over two weeks. You’d need to
arm yourself with many, many memory cards and spend a good part of
your vacation time swapping out used cards for empty ones.
 At the highest JPEG setting, that same camera gets 460 shots per 4GB
card, or 33 shots per day over two weeks. So at this setting, the camera
gives you a more reasonable number of photos for a very slight loss of
quality. But this still might not be enough pictures per day for your two-
week vacation, even if you have three 4GB cards.
 At the second-best JPEG quality, say the 4GB card gets you 914 shots
with this particular camera, or 65 shots per day. This is a more reason-
able number of pictures, but on this camera, this quality limits prints to
sizes no bigger than 5 x 7 inches.
Your best solutions might be to pick up a fourth or even a fifth memory card
(for less than $50 each). Or use your digital SLR’s “second-best” JPEG quality
level for general shots, but switch to the highest JPEG quality level for any
shots or sequences that might be suitable for enlargements beyond 5 x 7
inches. That way, you can grab hundreds of snapshots for smaller prints but
still come home with a good selection of higher-resolution photos for those
special blow-ups.

Shooting for a low-resolution destination
You’re shooting a bunch of pictures for your eBay auctions or for display on a
Web page, and the largest final image size will be about 640 x 480 pixels. Most
of the time, having pixels and image quality to spare is good because you can
crop and edit to your heart’s content before shrinking the original shot down
to its finished size.
Auction or Web pictures sometimes are captured with fixed setups on a sort
of photo assembly line with the same background and settings, and there
really isn’t any need for the maximum in resolution and sharpness for your
main shots. In fact, all those extra pixels can slow you down. You might be
better off shooting at a lower resolution, such as 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, to
speed things up. If you’re really careful in your choice of composition and
lighting, you might even be able to get away with taking photos at something
very close to their finished size, say 640 x 480 pixels, eliminating most post-
processing altogether. Of course, the latest dSLRs probably don’t have a reso-
lution setting that low; 1,600 x 1,200 pixel options may be available only on
cameras with a maximum resolution of 6 to 8 megapixels.
Hurrying along
The highest resolution/lowest compression settings take longer to store on
your memory card and require extra time to transfer to your computer. The
huge size of the best images can affect your shooting in several ways:
 When shooting bursts of continuous shots: Some digital SLRs slow their
continuous shooting mode when saving images in RAW, TIFF, or
RAW+JPEG modes. Instead of 3 to 5 frames per second (fps), you might
be able to grab only 2 fps at the highest resolution. A camera with a
larger internal buffer or a memory card with a faster write speed might
help, but simply reducing the resolution or boosting compression might
give you speedier bursts with little loss of quality. The Nikon D2Xs
camera actually takes advantage of this phenomenon, cropping its
default 12 megapixel images down to 6.8 megapixels to increase its top
continuous shooting rate to 8 fps.
 When you transfer photos: Memory card readers are usually the fastest
way to transfer photos from your camera to your computer. Some dSLR
owners also depend on direct cable connections through a Firewire con-
nection or, more commonly, through a USB cable. Both card readers and
cable connections might use the latest USB 2.0 specification or limp along
with the slower USB 1.1 links. A few of the newest cameras use infrared
transmitters to transfer photos from camera to computer. All these meth-
ods are affected by the size of the file: A JPEG image might be only a few
megabytes in size, whereas a RAW file can easily be 5 to 10MB or more, and
TIFF files can top 20MB each. If you’re in a hurry — for instance, you’re
covering a fast-breaking news event for your local newspaper — you might
find that a compromise in picture quality can save valuable time.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
 When working on your computer: Huge image files take longer to load,
longer to process in an image editor, and longer to save when you’re fin-
ished with them. If you want to speed your image along to its final desti-
nation, such as your printer, smaller file sizes can be your friend.
Stop! What’s That Sound?
For the digital photographer, no sound
is sweeter than the authoritative clicks
that resound when a picture is taken.
Flipping mirrors and sliding shutter
curtains mean that, once again, you’ve
captured your vision as digital bits.
Then, reality sets in — did you use the
right shutter speed?
A speed that’s too slow means any
movement of the subject or the pho-
tographer’s hands can result in shaky,
blurry photos. A speed that’s too high
might remove all sense of movement,
creating a sports picture, for example,
that might as well have pictured a
statue. A speed faster than your
camera’s electronic flash sync speed
might mean your picture shows a
shadow of the focal plane shutter
rather than a complete frame. The
right shutter speed with flash pictures
can also mean that ambient light in
the background produces a pleasing
effect, but the wrong speed can pro-
duce ghost images.
As a digital SLR photographer, you
have the responsibility to use the
enhanced powers and control at 
your disposal to optimize your
photos, and that includes choosing a shutter speed that’s appropriate for 
the picture you want to create. Figure 14-2 shows how changing from 1⁄30 of a
second (top) to 1⁄125 of a second (bottom) can affect an image of a moving 
subject taken under existing light.
Working the Right F-Stop
Mark Twain never said, “The difference between the almost-right f-stop and
the right f-stop is like the difference between the lightning bug and the light-
ning.” But, he might have said that if he’d been a digital photographer.
Figure 14-2: A monopod steadied the camera,
but the shutter speed had to be bumped for 1⁄30
of a second (top) to 1⁄125 of a second (bottom)
because of subject motion.

Sometimes, stopping down one or two aperture settings or opening up one or
two stops can make a world of difference, so choosing the right f-stop can be
an important part of optimizing your finished picture. Here are some examples:
 A couple stops can boost sharpness. Lenses designed especially for
their speed — say, a 28mm f/1.4 or a 400mm f/2.8 lens — are also
designed to provide excellent sharpness when they’re wide open.
However, most other optics are their sharpest when they’re closed down
one or two f-stops from wide open. A 50mm f/1.8 prime lens or an
80–200mm f/4-5.6 zoom lens that produces pretty good results at maxi-
mum aperture might excel with an aperture that’s two stops smaller.
 A few stops can help you stop camera or subject motion. Going the
other way, the ability to open up an extra stop or two can do your pic-
tures a world of good if it lets you use a faster shutter speed. Try shoot-
ing a basketball game indoors at ISO 400 and settings of 1⁄60 of a second at
f/5.6. Then compare your results with similar pictures taken 1⁄250 of a
second at a wider aperture like f/2.8. If the second set of images is care-
fully focused, the subjects are a lot sharper. It doesn’t matter that your
first batch of pictures has more depth-of-field (which I discuss in
Chapter 6). You won’t even notice that with the subject blur.
 A couple stops can stretch your depth-of-field usefully or trim it for
creative effects. This is especially true when shooting macro (close-up)
photos when depth-of-field is sharply limited. Stopping down or opening
up an f-stop or two can produce dramatically different results.
 Too small is as bad as too large. Shooting wide open costs you depth-of-
field and can impact lens sharpness, but using the smallest possible f-
stop can be just as bad. After you stop down past f/8 or f/11, most lenses
suffer from defraction, and any sharpness you think you gain in depth-of-
field is lost to the resolution-robbing effects of too-small f-stops. It’s
almost as if your image had a fixed amount of sharpness, and the smaller
f-stop is simply spreading it out over a larger range of depth. In addition,
small f-stops can accentuate the appearance of any tiny dust motes on
your sensor that, at larger apertures, are fuzzy and virtually invisible.
Focus Is a Selective Service
Knowing how to use the right aperture to control depth-of-field is only half
the battle. You’ll also want to explore exactly how you can apply that depth
creatively.
Improve your photography by casting a wide depth-of-field (DOF) net to cap-
ture a broad range of subject matter, or focus on a specific object by narrow-
ing depth-of-field to a more selective range. Although there are many different
techniques for emphasizing or de-emphasizing parts of an image, applying
depth-of-field creatively is one that’s easy to master and almost unlimited in
its potential.
277
Chapter 14: Ten Ways to Improve Your dSLR Photography

278
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You need to become familiar with the DOF characteristics of each of your
lenses, their zoom settings, and their apertures. I’m not suggesting you mem-
orize all kinds of figures and distances. Just work with, say, your favorite
zoom lens and use photos you take or glimpses with the depth-of-field pre-
view to know approximately the sharpness range at, perhaps, f/2.8, f/8, and
f/16 when shooting close up, at 5 to 10 feet, and at infinity using 25mm,
50mm, or 100mm zoom settings. Then you’ll have a better handle on how
focal length, aperture, and distance choices affect your shot before you frame
a picture.
Playing the Angles
Good composition often involves playing all the angles — all of them. Don’t
be satisfied with the different perspectives you get with a 360-degree walk-
around. Climb on a nearby rock or ladder, stand on a chair, or experiment
with the view from a handy balcony. Or, stoop low, lie on the ground, or get
under your subject to see what a worm’s-eye view looks like. Everybody
shoots flowers from above the blossoms; you can take a picture down at the
flower’s level, as shown in Figure 14-3.
You might be surprised at how different everything looks from a new vantage
point. Even hackneyed and clichéd subjects can take on new life if you
choose the right angle. If you find yourself at a popular tourist location and
all the people are clustered around a recommended “Picture Spot” while
you’re flat on your back on the grass, you’re probably on the right track.
Figure 14-3: Shoot blossoms from the side rather than above for a new perspective.

Through a Glass Brightly
There’s a reason why digital SLR photographers frequently succumb to a lens
lust compulsion, which is the irrational need to add yet another interchange-
able lens to one’s camera bag, at the expense of luxury items, such as food or
clothing.
As I discuss in Chapter 6, lenses are the most powerful tools at your disposal,
and you should discover how to leverage the capabilities of your optics even
if you own only the lens that came with your camera kit. That lens is likely to
be a zoom, which makes it many lenses in one, so even if your camera truly is
a single-lens reflex, you can use lots of capabilities built into your lenses. Here
are some of the capabilities that lenses have:
 Make subjects appear to be
closer: Special macro lenses can
capture life-size images of sub-
jects from only a few inches
away, but you’ll find that many
non-macro zooms and prime
lenses focus close enough to
provide a large image, like the
one shown in Figure 14-4. The
world of the close-up is one
that’s worth exploring, whether
you’re photographing flowers,
insects, your stamp collection,
or the texture of the rocks in
your driveway. Even mundane
objects gain interest when pho-
tographed up close.
 Bring distant things close:
When you want to keep your distance from an erupting volcano, capture
images of timid wildlife from 50 yards away, or take soccer pictures from
the stands that look like they were grabbed from the sidelines, a tele-
photo lens can do the job for you.
 Make close things appear farther away: When your back is up against the
wall and you can’t squeeze everything you want into your image, a wide-
angle lens can make your subjects back off to a more manageable distance.
 Flatter your portrait subjects: A short telephoto lens or zoom setting
in the 85mm to 105mm range (using 35mm equivalent focal lengths)
provides a more flattering perspective of human subjects. Your victims
will like the way their ears and noses don’t look out of proportion.
Depending on the lens cropping (“multiplier”) factor of your camera,
this 85mm to 105mm range might be 53mm–65mm (with a 1.6X factor) to
65mm–81mm (with a 1.3 factor). A full-frame dSLR has no factor at all,
and you can use your 85mm–105mm lenses. (See Chapter 1 for an intro-
duction to the lens cropping effect.)

normal view can bring a new perspective to the
familiar.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
 Insult or distort your subjects: A wide-angle lens causes apparent dis-
tortion in portrait subjects that can be used for comical effect. With non-
human subjects, you can have some creative fun by enlarging things that
are very close to the camera while providing a seemingly distorted per-
spective on objects only a small distance away.
 Compress distances: Telephoto lenses tend to compress the apparent
distances between objects, so you can make those utility poles seem as
if they’re right on top of each other, or make those approaching cars
separated by 10 to 20 feet look as if they’re cruising along bumper to
bumper.
 Manipulate depth-of-field: Telephoto lenses have less DOF at a given
aperture, but wide-angle lenses have more. Choose your weapon and
you’re choosing the amount of depth-of-field you have to work with.
Feel the Noize
If you’re old enough to remember Slade or Quiet Riot, you know that noize
rocks — as long as you’re looking for a bit of multicolored speckly texture in
your images. Like grain back in the film era, a bit of digital noise in your
images can be used for artistic effect. Rather than avoid noise, you might
want to enhance it. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a satiny smooth
finish on your digital images, you might want to minimize it. Fortunately, the
techniques for adding or avoiding noise involve the same sets of concepts:
 ISO setting: To increase the amount of noise in your photos, switch to a
high ISO setting, such as ISO 1,600 or ISO 3,200. The higher the setting,
the more noisy speckles you see in your images. To decrease the amount
of noise, use a lower ISO setting, such as ISO 100 or ISO 200.
 Exposure time: Longer exposures (from 1 second to 30 seconds or more)
increase the amount of noise in an image when the sensor heats up and
begins to register that heat as spurious image information. If you want to
minimize noise, use a larger f-stop if you can to shorten the exposure time.
 Software: Applications, such as Photoshop or Elements, include Add
Noise filters that you can use to spice up your photos with a little
random grain (multicolored or monochrome, as you prefer). On the
other hand, tools like Noise Ninja (www.picturecode.com) can remove
excess noise to a certain extent when you don’t want it. Chapter 11
offers an introduction to using noise filters in an image editor.
Editing, Retouching, and Compositing Images
Sometimes your best photographic techniques aren’t enough to create the
image you want. There’s no shame in turning to an image-editing program to
manipulate your photos.

High-quality image editors can perform three main kinds of modifications:
 Basic editing: This kind of work includes fixing colors and tonal values,
rotating or resizing images or portions of images, adding textures and
special effects with filters, and other easy fixes.
 Retouching: If you’re looking to remove red-eye effects, soften bad com-
plexions, delete unwanted artifacts or people, and make other improve-
ments to your images, the realm of retouching might be your best choice.
 Compositing: With this kind of editing, you combine several images into
one, move objects from one place to another in your photograph, add a
more interesting background (see Figure 14-5), and create a brand new
picture that might bear little resemblance to the originals.
Figure 14-5: Simple compositing techniques provided a more interesting sky 
background to this shot.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Of course, a lot of overlap is among what can be done with editing, retouch-
ing, and compositing, and sometimes you’ll use all three when you work on a
particular image. You might find yourself using all three techniques with
some images.
In Chapter 11, you find an introduction to image editing and image editors.
For more complete details on applying these modifications with a specific
image editor, check out other For Dummies books, such as Photoshop CS3 All-
in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Barbara Obermeier (Wiley).
Reading the Funny Manual (RTFM)
If you’re like me, you find the manual that’s furnished with a digital SLR to be
particularly unappealing when you first get the camera. The manuals are usu-
ally confusing, and finding what you really need to know can be difficult. I’m
always anxious to get shooting, and I’ve used enough different digital cameras
that I can usually fumble my way through their operation without using the
manual. While I familiarize myself with a dSLR for the first few weeks, I refer to
the instructions only when I can’t figure out how to do some particular task.
However, any dSLR is a complex machine, and after you become comfortable
with its basic operation, the manual that perplexed you so much at first sud-
denly makes a lot of sense. You can find tricks you never thought of (“Oh, I
can reformat a memory card by pressing these two buttons simultaneously!”)
and capabilities you didn’t even know existed (“The depth-of-field button is
where?”).
So, the best advice I can give you for becoming an expert in the use of your
particular digital SLR is that eventually you’ll want to Read the Funny Manual.

special. One way to add excitement to your hum-
drum photos is to apply some techniques you prob-
ably never even thought of. This chapter provides a
quick introduction to ten cool techniques.
Capturing the Unseen with 
Infrared Photography
If you’re looking for a new type of photography to play with, infrared imaging
with digital cameras can easily become your new playground. By ignoring vis-
ible light and capturing subjects solely by the infrared light they reflect, you

284
Part V: The Part of Tens 
can picture the unseen — in more ways than one. That’s because, thanks to
the magic of the digital SLR, you’ll likely be shooting blind. The same tech-
niques that shield your sensor from visible light also keep you from seeing
anything through the viewfinder. Fortunately, workarounds exist.
Infrared photography lets you render foliage in eerie shades of white, and the
sky in an unearthly black color. Human skin takes on a soft, fuzzy glow. You’ll
either love or hate the effects.
The first thing to do is to get your camera set up for infrared photography.
Because digital camera sensors are highly sensitive to infrared illumination,
most camera vendors try to filter this light out by placing a filter called a hot
mirror in front of the sensor. Some hot mirrors are more effective than others.
You can test your dSLR for infrared compatibility by taking a picture of a TV
remote control pointed at the camera with a button depressed. If a spot of
light shows up in your image, your camera is sensitive to infrared light.
After you know whether your camera can take infrared photos, the following
steps can help you get started:
1. Get yourself a filter that blocks visible light while letting the infrared
illumination through.
I like the Hoya R72 filter, but others have reported success with Wratten
#87, #87C, #88A, and #89B filters.
2. Set up your camera on the tripod, compose your image, and then
place the infrared filter on the lens.
Unfortunately, after you place the filter on your camera, the view
through your finder is completely black.
Infrared exposures are likely to be very long anyway (up to several 
seconds in duration), so be sure to use a tripod.
3. Set your white balance manually (check your camera’s user guide to
see how to do this) by using a subject that reflects a lot of infrared.
Grass is a good choice.
4. Take a few pictures by using manual exposure.
I recommend using a small f-stop because the infrared focus point isn’t
the same as for visible light, and your autofocus mechanism doesn’t
work when the filter is in place anyway. Small f-stops lead to even longer
exposures, but your tripod keeps the camera steady. Start with an expo-
sure of 0.5 to 1 second and then double the exposure time for each suc-
cessive picture. You might be able to see an image on your camera’s LCD
after the shot and gauge exposure that way.

Initially, your infrared images will be highly tinged with red, as shown in the
picture on the left in Figure 15-1. Play around with them in your image editor
to adjust brightness, contrast, and color. (Chapter 11 introduces how to make
these adjustments by using an image editor.) The picture on the right in
Figure 15-1, for example, shows the same shot rendered only through the Red
channel in an image editor (which indeed makes the image look gray, in case
you aren’t familiar with channels).
Figure 15-1: Infrared shots initially look, well, red! You can also produce an eerie gray image
like the one on the right in an image editor.
Lighting for All in Tents and Purposes
One of the challenges of shooting close-up pictures of small objects is provid-
ing even lighting. You can arrange one or two (or even more) lights but might
end up with unsightly shadows, harsh illumination, and reflections. There’s a
better way.
285
Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Pros use handy setups, or tents, to provide soft, even illumination for their
close-up pictures. These are exactly what they sound like — tent-like arrange-
ments of translucent material, such as cloth, arranged to cloak your item so
that it can be illuminated from all sides through the covering. Just remember
to leave a hole big enough for your lens to shoot through!
You can make a tent out of coat-hangers, bed sheets, or more elaborate
devices. Plastic friction-fit plumbing pipes and joints make a good skeleton
for tents of many sizes. You can assemble such a tent and tear it down on a
moment’s notice.
For small objects, I prefer a free-standing tent, such as the one shown in
Figure 15-2, which is made out of a translucent plastic milk bottle. I cut off the
bottom so I could fit the tent over the object being photographed, and
removed the spout and enough plastic from the neck to insert my dSLR’s
macro lens. My milk-bottle tent can be illuminated from all sides and creates
a soft, even lighting effect, like the one shown in Figure 15-3.

a tent for shooting small objects.

other shiny objects are often best photographed 
inside a tent.
Turning Your dSLR into a Pinhole Camera
You probably paid at least a few hundred dollars for the lens mounted on
your dSLR right now. How would you like to play with a “lens” that cost you,
maybe, five bucks? Now you, too, can turn your digital SLR into a pinhole
camera by using the technique I explain in this section.
If you come to digital cameras from the film world, you might be way ahead
of me. You likely experimented with pinhole cameras when you figured out
exactly how images are produced. You can also use digital cameras as 
pinhole cameras. All you need is a pinhole!
An easy way to create a pinhole “lens” is to poke a hole in a body cap that’s
used when no lens is mounted on your camera. (You might have to buy a 
real body cap if your camera came with a cheap plastic translucent cover
instead.) The body cap already has a flange that fits your digital SLR’s lens
mount. Find the exact center of the
cap and cut a hole in the center.
That hole is likely to be too large:
the smaller and more precisely
made your pinhole is, the sharper
your pictures will be.
So, cover the hole you made with 
a piece of metal, as shown in Fig-
ure 15-4. Then, poke a tiny hole in
the metal. I used a piece of aluminum
foil pierced with a sewing needle, 
but you can use a piece cut from a
cookie sheet or other thin metal —
Figure 15-4: A hole pierced in a body cap can
make a nifty pinhole “lens.”

288
Part V: The Part of Tens 
the thinner the better. If you have a hobby hand drill with tiny bits, you can
probably cut a precise hole in the metal sheet. Experiment with several differ-
ent sizes until you get one that produces the sharpest image.
After you mount your pinhole lens, you can look through the viewfinder and
see a fuzzy, dim image. If you have extension tubes, you can try mounting one
between your camera body and your pinhole lens to change the “focal
length” of the lens. The “f-stop” of the pinhole is so small that you don’t have
to worry about focusing after you establish the correct distance away from
the sensor to mount the pinhole. Virtually everything is in focus.
Of course, your aperture is so small you’ll have to mount the camera on a
tripod and shoot time exposures, even in bright daylight. Figure 15-5 shows
an image exposed for three seconds at f-whatever, using my own pinhole rig.
(Actually, a quick calculation based on the normal exposure times in bright
daylight, I’d estimate that my pinhole is approximately f/256!) I always use
manual exposure to make my pinhole pictures. If you’re using your camera’s
meter, you might need to cover the viewfinder eyepiece to keep extraneous
light from venturing inside and affecting the metering system.

Warping Time with Time-Lapse Photography
Time-lapse photography is a great way to show a flower unfolding, the sun
marching across the sky, the process of building construction, and, over the
course of a year, the change of seasons. You can take time-lapse photos in
two ways. One of them is pretty easy, works only with some dSLR cameras,
and might require special software. The other way can be used with any
dSLR, needs no special gadgets or applications, and is a whole lot of work.
The easy way usually requires tethering your camera to a computer through
a USB cable, and working with software that can automatically trigger the
camera to take a picture at intervals. The Nikon and Canon dSLRs have appli-
cations that can do this for you.
The images are automatically downloaded to the computer when they’re
taken, so you can take many more pictures in sequence than you could fit on
a single memory card. Having your dSLR connected to an AC power source is
a good idea because even cameras that use very little juice eventually
deplete their batteries if left on and connected to a computer for hours at a
time. (Your dSLR uses much more power when linked to a computer than
when operating in standalone mode.)
The other way to shoot time-lapse photos calls for more effort on your part.
No special software is needed, nor do you need to connect your camera to a
computer. Instead, you can use a digital tool (the index digit of your right
hand) to trigger each picture. Set your camera on a tripod and press the shut-
ter release (or use a remote control/cable release) to take a picture at the
interval you select. This can be a tedious process and is actually best suited
for longer-term sequences, such as construction progress pictures or the
“changing seasons” shots shown in Figure 15-6, which shows the same river
bend in winter (top) and summer (bottom).
To take a series, you need to set up your camera in the exact same spot at
intervals. The easiest way to do this is to mount the camera on a tripod and
record the height the legs have been set, the extension of the center pole, and
the tilt and angle of the tripod head. Then, mark the position of the tripod legs
on the supporting surface. Then you can repeat your setup any time you want
and take a series of pictures over the course of a few days or, in this case, a
year. Be sure and use the same lens or zoom setting for each photo, too!

Expanding Your Creativity 
with Slow Shutter Speeds
Ordinarily, blurry images are considered a bad thing. When I use a shutter
speed that’s so slow that my subjects are rendered as a big blur, I tend to say
something like, “Oh, I meant to do that! I was showing the fleetingness of time
against the backdrop of our fast-paced society.” Yeah, that’s the ticket.
On the other hand, you can get some interesting images by using a slow 
shutter speed if you allow some portions of your image to blur while other
portions remain razor-sharp. The classic application of this concept is the
photograph of the babbling stream, with the woodsy surroundings rendered
in sharp detail, while the flowing water merges into a ghostly blur.
The secret, of course, is to mount the camera on a tripod and use a slow
shutter speed. Anything that moves is blurred, but the stationary surround-
ings are, in contrast, very sharp. Figure 15-7 shows a street scene, with blurry
car headlights and tail lights adding some foreground interest.
Figure 15-7: With a slow shutter speed, moving objects blur, while stationary objects are sharply rendered.
291
Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR

292
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you look around you, you can find lots of subjects that can become more
interesting if you let them blur a little. Be sure to mount the camera on a
tripod. Try different shutter speeds, reviewing your results on your dSLR’s
LCD until you find the speed that produces the effect you want. Use shutter
priority mode and select a range of speeds from 1⁄30 of a second to about 
1 second.
Capturing an Instant in Time 
with Fast Shutter Speeds
Some subjects move so quickly that normally the human eye could never
observe them. However, a very fast shutter speed can freeze a moment in
time. Falling water, breaking light bulbs, bullets penetrating an apple, and
other events that are over in an instant lend themselves to hyper-freezing
techniques. Figure 15-8 shows the ripples and splashes produced by a drop
of water landing in a glass. I illuminated it by placing an electronic flash off to
the left and triggering an exposure manually. This method involves a lot of
trial and error, but with digital cameras, you can easily take 30 or 40 pictures
to get the exact one you want.
Figure 15-8: A tiny-fraction-of-a-second exposure can freeze the quickest action.

Most digital SLRs have shutter speeds of at least 1⁄4,000 of a second; some have
speeds of 1⁄8,000 to 1⁄16,000 of a second. You can get even briefer “shutter speeds” by
taking advantage of the fleeting duration of an electronic flash unit when used
in close-up mode. Many strobes wink on and off in as little as 1⁄50,000 of a second
when used up close. That’s because only a very quick flash is needed to prop-
erly expose an image from that range, but you can use the effect to stop
action.
If you want to try freezing action with an electronic flash, use one that you
can operate off-camera, connected with a cable. Or, try mounting your
camera on a tripod, darkening the room, and shooting a time exposure.
During the exposure, trip the flash manually by pressing the Test button.
Because the room is dark, only the illumination from the flash is used for the
exposure.
Making Your Own Effects Filters
Believe it or not, filters were originally something you put on the front of 
your lens — not a plug-in mini-application found in image editors, such as
Photoshop. Certainly, software filters can duplicate many of the effects of
their glass or gelatin real-world counterparts, but that doesn’t mean you have
to abandon the joy of using real, actual filters on your lens. Lots of special
effects are tricky to duplicate in an image editor, such as polarization to
remove reflections or split-filter gradients to even out the bright sky and
dimmer foreground.
You don’t even have to pay for special effects filters. You can make your own.
Manufacture them out of ordinary, fairly useless filters, like skylight or UV
(ultraviolet) filters, or better yet, purchase a Series x adapter ring. Series
adapter rings come in various sizes to suit the front filter diameter of your
lens, with the x replaced by the number of the ring suitable for your lens,
such as Series V, Series VI, Series VII, or Series VIII.
A Series x adapter ring comes in two parts: 
 One part has a thread that screws into the front of your lens. 
 The second part screws into the first part, usually with a filter of your
devising between the two, forming a little sandwich of two metal rings
and your custom filter inside.
293
Chapter 15: Ten Things You Never Thought of Doing with Your Digital SLR

294
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Roman numeral designations show the relative size of the ring set. For
example, Series IX rings are sized to fit lenses with filter threads of 72mm,
77mm, and larger. Series VIII rings are good for lenses with 62mm to about
67mm filter threads. 
You can purchase step-up and step-down adapters so you can use, say, a
Series IX ring on a lens with a 62mm thread. Mounting a larger ring on a
smaller lens thread is always better, and you’ll want to make sure the rings
don’t cause vignetting (darkening) in the corners of your image (which can be
a particular problem with wide-angle lenses).
Here are some ideas for special effects filters that you can create on your own:
 Starry night: Use a piece of window screen cut to fit the Series rings to
create a star filter that transforms each pinpoint of light into a star
effect.
 Color your world: Cut a piece of gelatin filter material into a circle to fit
in the Series ring to create a color filter.
 Color your world times two: Use two pieces of filter material of different
colors to create a split-color filter. For example, you can use orange-red
on top to give the sky a sunset color and blue on the bottom to add cool
tones to the foreground. The
“real” (expensive) filters of this
type have a smooth gradient
between the colors, but a quick-
and-dirty split filter approach
can work, too.
 Life’s a blur: Smear the outer
edges of a piece of round glass
(or another filter) with petro-
leum jelly to create a romantic
blur filter. This method is great
for portraits of females and
teenagers with complexion
problems.
 Feature your filters: Try shoot-
ing through a feather or other
textured material to create
interesting effects.
Figure 15-9 shows some of these filters.
Figure 15-9: Create your own star filter 
(upper left), smudgy portrait filter (upper right),
or split-field color filter (bottom).

Shooting the Works!
You don’t have to wait until Independence Day to shoot fireworks. Lots of
other events and celebrations, including baseball games and auto races, are
commemorated with an aerial display. Perhaps you’ve avoided shooting fire-
works because you thought capturing skyrockets in flight was too difficult.
Or, maybe you just wanted to watch the show rather than fiddle with your
camera. I’m here to tell you that you can do both!
The secret to shooting fireworks is to do a little planning. Here are some tips:
 Choose your spot. You can position yourself up close and capture the
display from underneath the exploding canopy, or get farther back and
shoot the fireworks against a skyline. 
Both approaches work great. What you don’t want is a view that is
obstructed by buildings, trees, or very tall fellow observers.
 Use a tripod. Set your camera on a tripod so it remains rock-steady
during exposures that can last several seconds.
 Check it out. Take a few pictures at the beginning of the display and
evaluate them to make sure your exposures are reasonable. Try two to
three seconds at f/8 for starters. Focus on infinity!
 Go long. Use longer exposures to capture multiple bursts in one frame,
as shown in Figure 15-10.
 Shoot RAW. Use your dSLR’s RAW option so you can adjust exposure
and other parameters as the image is imported into your photo editor.
 Don’t use noise reduction. If your camera kicks into noise reduction
(NR) mode automatically, disable it. Don’t manually activate NR, either.
The extra time required to create the noise reduction “dark frame” can
cause you to miss the next blast-off. 
Even a several-second exposure still looks good without this extra step.
 Enjoy the show. After you set up your camera and frame an area of the
sky where the bursts will appear, just watch the display without peering
through the viewfinder. Trigger your shots by pressing the shutter
release button or using a remote control or cable release (if your dSLR
can be used with one).

Figure 15-10: A long exposure can capture multiple bursts.
Going for Baroque
Normally, you’ll want to set your camera’s controls to get the best-exposed,
most realistic image. However, at times you might want to go for baroque and
get a really over-the-top image right in the camera. Simply adjust your set-
tings to get some off-the-wall results. Of course, if you shoot RAW, you can
manipulate your images when importing them to your image editor to get
much the same effects, but adjusting the camera’s controls is faster and
repeatable.
Here are some things to try:
 Boost saturation/change the hue. Set your camera’s color saturation
controls to the max to generate rich, unrealistic colors. Film photogra-
phers favored Kodak Ektachrome films for this very reason, and digital
shooters can do the same thing electronically. Increasing saturation can
also provide good color on dull, overcast days. Or, you can go overboard
and really pump up the color richness while manipulating hues to create
an otherworldly effect, as shown in Figure 15-11.

Figure 15-11: Crank up your color saturation and manipulate the hues to 
produce an offbeat look.
 Enhance contrast. Your dSLR probably has a contrast control intended
to give you acceptable images of low-contrast subjects, but which can
be subverted to produce high-contrast results of normal subjects. You
lose detail in highlights and shadows, but that’s what you’re going for
with this effect.
 Add grain. High ISO ratings can add unwanted noise to your images,
except when it’s wanted noise because of a creative decision. Crank your
camera’s sensitivity up all the way and then experiment. In bright light,
you generally have to use high shutter speeds, small apertures, or both,
but most digital SLRs can shoot photos on the beach at high noon at ISO
1,600 even if it means using 1⁄4,000 of a second at f/16.

Going Crazy with Your Image Editor
Many digital SLR users have more
experience fiddling with images in
Photoshop than they do taking pic-
tures with a dSLR. After all, Photoshop
has been around since 1990 and was
an excellent tool for modifying
scanned film images long before digi-
tal cameras began hitting their stride a
decade later.
So, odds are, you have no fear of
image editing and you might, in fact,
be striving to create an image that’s
as close to your vision as possible in
the camera in order to reduce the
time you spend in post-processing.
All the more reason to take your
image editor to its limit and work on
special effects (like the one shown 
in Figure 15-12) that unleash your
creativity.
Figure 15-12: Every picture tells a story, but 
even the best story can be spiced up with
editing.

O
ne of the advantages of using a digital SLR is
that, in terms of new ideas, new techniques,
new applications, and new add-on gadgets, the sky’s
the limit. Certainly, an imaginative photographer
finds it challenging to wring every last bit of poten-
tial out of a non-SLR digital camera and can spend
years doing so. But if the possibilities of an ordinary
point-and-shoot camera are vast, the tricks you can
do with a digital SLR are easily twice as vast. The
expandability and versatility of a dSLR mean you have no
excuse for doing things in a half-vast way (ahem).
One tool you’ll want to avail yourself of is the Internet, with its
unlimited treasure trove of ideas, showcases for your photos, equipment
tests, and places to buy or sell dSLRs, lenses, and accessories. This chapter
gets you started by introducing ten of the best online resources. (Although I
give only ten resources the full feature treatment, I sprinkle in a couple bonus
sites here and there.)

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
I provide all the links here, but you don’t have to go to the trouble of typing
them into your browser. Instead, go to www.dbusch.com/dslrlinks.htm,
where you’ll find a page full of clickable links for these sites and many more.
All Your PBase Are Belong to Us
www.pbase.com
A ton of image-hosting sites out there let you upload your photos to a Web
page album so anyone with access to the Internet can view them. However,
most of these are aimed at consumers, not serious photographers. Album and
image size might be limited, and the things that you can do with the albums
might be confined to a few levels of sharing (that is, you might be able to
share with everyone in the world, with a fixed list of users, or only by invita-
tion). These sites are great if you want to share a few pictures online and per-
haps order some prints, personalized calendars, or photo coffee mugs.
PBase has become wildly popular for a good reason: It goes well beyond the
album sites to provide true online photo galleries — and a lot more besides.
Here’s a sampling of the features:
 Explain your settings: You can specify that the EXIF (image data) para-
meters of each photograph are available to viewers, so other photogra-
phers can see the settings you used to create a particular picture.
 Search by keywords: A search engine enables visitors to look for pho-
tographs — including yours — by using specific keywords.
 Upload batches of photos at once: You can upload batches of photos
that have been compressed into archives (such as .zip files) to save
time. (Most of the album sites ask you to upload non-zipped photo files
individually and limit you to five to ten images.)
 Link galleries: You can link galleries that you create. So if you start a
gallery showing off your sports photos, you can subdivide it into foot-
ball, baseball, tennis, or other appropriate categories.
 Link your photos to other forums: If you frequent any of the various
online discussion forums, such as those shown in Figure 16-1, you can
link directly to your photos.
Many compatible sites can display PBase photos right in your postings,
with buttons to zoom in and out.
PBase is even a terrific information resource. It publishes a magazine com-
piled entirely from the efforts of members. The premiere issue highlighted
the work of two photographers and provided some useful tips on sensor
cleaning.

Figure 16-1: Forums in PBase are devoted to topics, like Digital Cameras.
Of course, something this good isn’t free. You can check out PBase for 30
days with 10MB of online disk storage. If you like it, a hefty 500MB of storage
(enough for more than 2,000 images of an average 250 KB size) costs $23 a
year (less than $2 a month) at the time of this writing. If you need 1,500MB of
online space, that’s $60 a year, and you can add more storage in 500MB incre-
ments for a reasonable cost.
Digital Photography Viewed and Reviewed
www.dpreview.com
An incredible free resource is Digital Photography Review (usually called just
DPReview). DPReview is a top-notch site for information about any digital
SLR camera. A British chap named Phil Askey publishes this site with help
from a knowledgeable staff and thousands of avid fans and visitors.
Amazon.com recently purchased this site, but it’s too soon to see what
changes — if any — the new parent company will make. Phil was advertising
for new reviewers and technicians to beef up the content when this book
went to press.
301
Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Visiting DPReview needn’t cost you anything but your time, which is well-
spent. However, you can donate funds through any credit card or PayPal, or
you can support the effort by purchasing a t-shirt, coffee mug, tote bag, or
whatever.
It’s no exaggeration to say I spend a minimum of 30 minutes at this site virtu-
ally every day of the year. Here are the kinds of useful features at DPReview
that will keep you coming back for more:
 User forums: You can find individual forums for all the key digital SLR
cameras (as well as non-dSLRs) from Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax, Kodak,
Fuji, and Sigma. There are even separate forums for topics, such as
Canon SLR Lens Talk, Nikon SLR Lens Talk, Lighting, Storage and Media,
and Retouching. Those who own a particular camera model enjoy the
specialized forums for groups of cameras, such as the Nikon D40/D40x/
D50/D70/D80, Nikon D1/D2/D200, Canon 300/350/400, Canon 10D/20D/
30D, and so forth. Even with all these subdivisions, most of the forums
have hundreds of fascinating posts a day. I spend most of my time on this
site just trying to keep abreast of the interesting discussions.
 Camera comparisons: The site has separate pages for each digital
camera vendor, listing all the most recent models, with complete specifi-
cations for every camera and links to reviews. For example, the Nikon
page lists 33 different Nikon models in detail and links to 17 discontin-
ued models. You can compare the features of cameras from different
vendors, too, as shown in Figure 16-2.
Be sure to use this trove of information to compare cameras. For exam-
ple, if you want to know the sensor size of the Canon Digital Rebel XTi
compared to that of the Nikon D40x, simply retrieve that information
with a couple clicks.
 Comprehensive reviews: The DPReview evaluations of cameras are
among the most complete and thorough available on the Internet. For
example, the review of one recent Nikon dSLR is 26 pages long and
includes a description of every feature, screen shots of each menu, tests,
sample images, and an evaluation of the software that comes with the
camera. You can even listen to the sound the shutter makes if that’s
important to you. These reviews don’t appear the instant a camera
comes on the market, but they’re worth waiting for.
 Daily news updates: The main page provides a listing of the main digital
photography news stories of the day and more than a few rumors. You
can find things, like notices of the latest firmware updates for your
camera, new product introduction announcements, and other breaking
stories.
 An online glossary: Wonder what bokeh is? You can find a glossary on
the DPReview site that explains this and just about any other term you
care to look up.

Figure 16-2: DPReview’s Side-by-Side comparison feature lets you pit one camera’s features 
against another’s.
As I write this, DPReview is fast closing in on 750 million visitors since 
it began keeping track in January 1999. You should jump on the band-
wagon, too.
For the Shutterbug in You
www.shutterbug.net
If you’re an old-line photographer, someone who was a serious photo hobby-
ist back when people had to use something called film, you’ll appreciate the
full-spectrum viewpoint provided by this venerable resource. It’s an online
adjunct to Shutterbug magazine, and as such, it covers digital photography in
depth as well as recent and classic film cameras, photo techniques, and other
topics of interest.
303
Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Like DPReview, Shutterbug’s strength lies in its forums, which, like the maga-
zine and Web site, span a broad range of interests. You can find forums dedi-
cated to Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, and Sony digital SLRs. Shutterbug
also offers several forums for the film SLR counterparts (always a good
source for information about compatible lenses and accessories), along with
forums for inkjet, dye sublimation, and traditional silver halide printing.
Color management, lighting and exposure, and collectible cameras are also
covered.
Whereas DPReview’s product evaluations are mostly devoted to digital cam-
eras, Shutterbug looks at all kinds of items, including equipment bags, gad-
gets, books, and photo shows. You can find interesting monthly columns, too.
Pop Goes the Photo!
www.popphoto.com
Popular Photography & Imaging magazine has been the most authoritative
resource for serious amateur photographers for longer than most of us have
been alive. Indeed, long-time editor and columnist Herbert Keppler, who has
been providing insights since the 1950s, understands the progress that’s been
made in the photographic industry because he’s lived through much of it.
The addition of a Web site as a supplement to the magazine’s coverage and
increasing emphasis on digital photography prove that venerable doesn’t
have to equal stodgy or old-fashioned. Pop Photo remains as up-to-date as the
latest digital camera, and most of the time, it’s several steps ahead of the tech-
nology in its predictions. (In the interest of full disclosure, I should point out
that I’m a contributor to Popular Photography & Imaging from time to time —
but I’ve been a subscriber and avid reader ever since I was in high school.)
The Popular Photography Web site’s strength is its authoritative voice when
it comes to the technology. The editors really, really understand all the finer
points of digital and conventional photographic imaging, and their lab tests
of equipment are unmatched. When you read the performance figures on var-
ious lenses or other equipment, you have information at your fingertips that
you can use to go out and make purchases with confidence.
Nowhere else can you find solid information available in such depth. Can a
16.2MP digital SLR produce better results than a fine-grain ISO 100 film? What
are the seven most significant breakthroughs in tripod design? What are

some of the best photos taken in the last year? The answers are all available
at the Popular Photography Web site. The site offers forums, of course, but it
also provides lots of tips and tricks, how-to’s, workshops, and videos.
News Groupies
Internet newsgroups, known to old-timers as Usenet, are a wonderful, unbri-
dled resource where anything goes. Groups with names like rec.photo.
digital, rec.photo.digital.slr-systems, or rec.photo.digital.
rangefinder remind you of the Old West, full of gunslingers and common
folk, sheep-herders and cattlemen (think Canon users versus Nikon gun-
slingers). The only law in the land of Usenet anarchy is whoever wins has the
most time to spend posting.
Newsgroups are a little like the online forums sponsored by DPReview,
Shutterbug, or Pop Photo, only less focused. Posts range far and wide, and
you’re likely to see hundreds of different topics and comments in a particular
group on virtually anything — in a single day. One key strength of Usenet is
this diversity: You’re bound to stumble across information you’d never pick
up anywhere else, in a refreshing, serendipitous way. Another advantage is
the potential for speed: If you have a question, you can post it on a news-
group and sometimes get an answer in minutes.
Newsgroups operate in a way that’s a little different from purely Web-based
resources. The information doesn’t reside on a single, central Web server as
it does with pages that you access through a browser, such as Internet
Explorer. Instead, messages are received by a loosely connected network of
news servers scattered around the world. The news servers might be oper-
ated by your Internet service provider (ISP) for free access by the ISP’s cus-
tomers. AOL, Roadrunner, and other ISPs all operate their own news servers.
They also decide which newsgroups to carry. Or, you can access newsgroups
through free or fee-based services, such as TeraNews or GigaNews. These
sources often carry a larger and more varied selection of newsgroups than
those offered by ISPs and keep the postings available for longer periods of
time.
The most common way to access newsgroups is through a special program,
or client, called a newsreader. Among the most popular newsreaders are Free
Agent and the newsreader built into Outlook Express. However, you can also
search through newsgroup postings with a Web browser by accessing Google
Groups (http://groups-beta.google.com).
305
Chapter 16: Ten Online Resources for Digital SLR Photography

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
After you launch your newsreader, you need to tell it which news server to
use, connect to that server, and download a list of groups available from that
source. (Sources can number 50,000 or more!) Choose which groups you
want to monitor by subscribing. Then you can download the available mes-
sage headers (titles of the posts), sort through them, and mark specific 
messages for retrieval.
You can sort messages by parameters, including author and date, but mes-
sages are most frequently listed by thread, that is, all the messages stemming
from an original post. Viewing threads lets you follow a discussion easily. At
any time, you can respond to a post by typing a message of your own. After
you send your reply, it’s uploaded to your particular news server and then, in
minutes or hours, is distributed (or propagated) to all the other news servers
that carry that particular newsgroup.
Although the process might sound complicated, newsgroups are a great
resource for collecting a lot of varied information on many different topics.
Figure 16-3 shows a typical newsgroup search conducted from Google.
Figure 16-3: Google newsgroup searches can yield lots of good information.

Landscapes Can Be Luminous
www.luminous-landscape.com
Calling The Luminous Landscape a Web site devoted to landscape and nature
photography is a little like calling the Encyclopaedia Britannica a collection 
of articles. This site is, above all, amazingly comprehensive, with more 
than 2,000 pages of information, articles, tutorials, product reviews, and 
photographs.
This site has everything you’d want to know about nature photography but
goes far beyond that. Here are some of the features to check out:
 The site’s Understanding series of tutorials covers everything from SLR
viewfinders and how they work to sensor cleaning. You can discover
how to use unsharp masking, work with histograms, and use polarizing
filters effectively. 
 The Tutorial series covers digital workflow, pinhole photography, high
dynamic range photography, and other topics.
 You can find lists of workshops occurring around the world. (China,
Africa, Antarctica, Ireland, and Iceland are just a few destinations where
these workshops have been held in the past.)
 The descriptions of prime shooting locations for nature photography
help you find new places to take photos.
 Oh yeah — and don’t miss the essays, regular columns, and hundreds of
product reviews on cameras, tripods, and other essentials.
If you’re interested in nature, landscape, or documentary photography, you
must visit this site. However, everyone from sports photographers to portrai-
ture specialists can discover something by stopping by.
Photos That Don’t Bite
www.bytephoto.com
I include BytePhoto because it’s a slightly lesser-known site that deserves a
little more attention, if only for its quirkiness. It includes lots of features but
is especially strong as a portal to other sites. For example, BytePhoto offers
online galleries, but you can also find links to sharing services, including
307

SmugMug (www.smugmug.com), which is the strongest competitor to PBase.
BytePhoto gives you links to other interesting pages on external sites, a
Google search box for combing the Net, and a ton of ads with interesting
offers you might want to jump to.
BytePhoto offers news, reviews (not especially great, but interesting), and
photo contests. You can also find tutorials on image editing, Photoshop
Actions (macros), and the usual collection of forums. If you have old gear to
unload or things to buy, you might find the classified ads useful. (One of the
site’s forums contains the ads.) You might need to use the home page’s
search box to find a particular feature, but it’s worth the look.
Cult of Personality
When you search the Web, you’ll find a ton of sites founded and operated by
individuals, such as www.kenrockwell.com (good stuff, but focusing
mostly on Nikon and highly opinionated), www.fredmiranda.com, and
www.robgalbraith.com (which I discuss next).
Rob Galbraith
www.robgalbraith.com
Rob is probably best known for his exhaustive evaluation of CompactFlash
(CF) and Secure Digital (SD) card performance data. He has tested virtually
every CF and SD card available, with just about every camera on the market.
There are more than 20 pages of tables and data to pore through. If you want
to know how a SanDisk Extreme III 8GB CompactFlash card performs with a
Nikon D2Xs, you’ll find that information. These tests are quite literally the
Bible of the industry.
Although Rob no longer offers forums, as he did in the past, the site includes
a good list of links to other useful Web pages, from the American Society of
Media Photographers (ASMP) to National Geographic. There are authoritative
news and reports, links to software upgrades, and the usual array of ads that
help pay for the cost of publishing all this information online.
Most photographer-run sites focus more on promoting the photographer
than providing solid information, but this is one exception.

Charmin’ Miranda
www.fredmiranda.com
Another photographer who believes it’s better to give than receive is Fred
Miranda. His gorgeous site is bursting with valuable information, all arranged
logically and easy to access. Lots of digital photographers agree: On a recent
night when I logged in, nearly 1,500 other photographers were also using the
site at that exact moment!
Of course, Fred does hawk some amazing software, but in an unobtrusive
way. You almost have to stumble across the FM Software offerings, mostly
Photoshop plug-ins and Actions that do tasks such as reduce noise, resize
photos, or manage workflow.
You’ll be highly engaged by the forums, as shown in Figure 16-4, which are
some of the best available online, with contributions from more than 70,000
members. You can also find useful articles and reviews, as well as image host-
ing. Even if you don’t want to set up showcases of your own, you’ll definitely
want to browse the hosted galleries. You can get lots of ideas by viewing
other photographers’ best efforts.

Don’t Miss eBay
www.ebay.com
Once called “the nation’s garage sale,” eBay is one online resource that 
really pays if you have old equipment to unload. It’s also a great place for 
registered members to locate hard-to-find camera equipment at reasonable
prices. Although www.keh.com, a real camera dealer in Atlanta, www.
bhphotovideo.com, and www.adorama.com (all reliable dealers) are the
go-to organizations for much new and used stuff, nothing beats eBay for vari-
ety and, if you get caught up in bidding, excitement.
I know whereof I speak. I’ve had more than 8,000 transactions on eBay myself,
and I ended up writing a book about my experiences, The eBay Myth Buster,
available from the same John Wiley & Sons folks who brought you this tome.
(You can pick up a copy through my Web site at www.dbusch.com or visit
your local or online bookstore.)
eBay is a great place to locate new and used equipment at a price you’re will-
ing to pay, especially if you do some research ahead of time and have a good
idea of what an item is truly worth. The venue does best with supplies (such
as ink for inkjet printers), older cameras and lenses, and difficult-to-find
accessories. For example, when I picked up a used 170–500mm zoom lens
from my local camera dealer, no lens hood was available for it. The lens hood
I found on eBay was delivered to me in less than a week for quite a bit less
than my dealer would’ve charged for a special order.
Perhaps you’re looking for older, manual-focus (MF) lenses that are compati-
ble with your dSLR. A MF macro lens for $150 probably performs as well as a
new auto-focus (AF) version for two or three times as much, and you can
probably get away with manual focus for precision close-up work anyway.
Perhaps you’re upgrading to a new camera and want to sell your old one.
Your dealer or a company, like KEH, will be glad to buy it from you, but they
must offer enough less than the camera’s worth to allow for some profit when
they resell. Peddle the camera on eBay and your net might be a lot more than
you would’ve gotten as a trade-in or selling outright with a dealer.
Ever since I went all-digital, I’ve been slowly selling off my film cameras on
eBay. Figure 16-5 shows an edited version of an eBay auction I conducted for
a beloved old half-frame camera I wanted to relocate to a new home.

Figure 16-5: Sell your old film gear on eBay and use the proceeds to buy new digital stuff!
Here are a few keys to using eBay successfully:
 Check the seller’s feedback. Each eBay ID has a Feedback Rating
number next to it, which represents the net number of positive feed-
backs (that is, positives minus negatives) received. Click the number to
view the actual feedback comments. Sellers or buyers with 50 to 100 or
more positives and no negatives are probably reliable. Those with fewer
feedbacks or a few negatives might also be good eggs, but be sure to
check a little further. The venue recently added more detailed feedback
ratings that allow buyers to rate sellers on delivery promptness and
other aspects of the transaction.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
 Pay for your items by using your credit card through a service like
PayPal. Although eBay provides a modicum of buyer protection, if you
use your credit card through PayPal, you have two extra levels of secu-
rity. If a deal goes awry, PayPal might be able to get you a refund. If not,
you can go directly to the credit card company and frequently get a
chargeback that way. Scams are fairly rare on eBay in the overall scheme
of things. If you avoid deals that seem too good to be true (for example,
a Nikon D40x for $200), you won’t easily fall victim.
 Don’t expect sensational deals on cameras or lenses that have just
been introduced. It’s unlikely that “used” ones are available in any case,
and the new ones are probably being sold by dealers who have a profit
margin to make. New cameras are likely to be no more than about $50
cheaper than you’d pay locally (if that), but you can save on local sales
tax, unless you’re a New York resident. In most cases, you’ll do better on
newly introduced equipment at B&H Photo or Adorama.
 Don’t buy memory cards on eBay. There’s a robust trade is in counter-
feit memory cards (mostly purporting to SanDisk models), and an alarm-
ing percentage of rock-bottom CompactFlash or SD card offerings are
bogus. Even though eBay stomps out evil sellers almost as fast as they
appear, the odds are still against you. Unless a seller has hundreds or
thousands of favorable feedbacks, you’re better off buying your memory
cards elsewhere.
 When purchasing used equipment, see whether you can get a money-
back guarantee or an inspection period. This gear is frequently sold as-
is, which can be okay if the seller is well-respected (has a lot of positive
feedback), but risky if the seller is new.

Today’s digital SLRs make it simple to point and

the most basic dSLR is smart enough to save you from
your own mistakes when your ambitions don’t extend
beyond simple scenes, simple set-ups, and simple subjects.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
It’s when you want to spread your wings and try different techniques that
more advanced features and more advanced photographic concepts come
into play. At that point, it’s a good idea to become comfortable with that
jargon — not so that you can sound knowledgeable when hanging around
with other photographers, but so you can put those sometimes-confusing
concepts to work for you. I explain all the key terms throughout this book,
but here I single out a few of the trickiest relating to cameras, photography,
and image editing.
Ambient Lighting/Available Lighting
Ambient lighting is sometimes confused with available lighting or existing
lighting, which are themselves often confusing for those not steeped in photo
jargon. Available and existing lighting are the same thing (or should be) and
are most commonly defined as the illumination that’s already present in a
scene, whether it’s sunlight, street lights, moonlight (outdoors), or lamps and
other light sources (indoors), including light that streams into the room from
outside through windows, doors, or openings. Add-on sources — including
additional lamps or electronic flash — may be considered available (if you
have them on hand), but they’re not existing. (Hence the confusion.)
Ambient lighting, on the other hand, is something entirely different; although,
in most cases, you’d consider it to be available or existing light. In practice,
ambient lighting is nondirectional lighting that appears to come from “every-
where” rather than from a single source. It’s soft and diffuse, and is supplied
by light bouncing off the ceiling, walls, or other objects in a scene. When
used with a stronger primary light source, ambient light fills in dark shadows
and pares the rough edges off contrasty lighting transitions. Ambient lighting
is your friend, now that you know what it is and how to best use it.
Anti-Aliasing
Anti-aliasing is an edge-smoothing process applied by your camera and/or by
an image-editing program to account for the fact that the seamless analog
information in your original scene must be converted into discrete rectangu-
lar pixels when the picture is digitized.

Blocky little pixels work great for
reproducing straight lines but aren’t
so great for creating curves or diago-
nal lines. Without anti-aliasing, you’d
end up with ragged edges, like the
one shown at top in Figure 17-1. Anti-
aliasing creates partially transparent
pixels along these boundaries, which
merge into smoother, non-jaggy lines
when viewed (bottom of Figure 17-1).
Bracketing
Even small changes in settings can
make a difference to finicky photo-
graphers, and bracketing is a way of
providing several alternate “takes” 
at different exposures, color balance
settings, or using other parameters
so you can choose the one that best
suits your image.
Many (but not all) digital SLRs have
a bracketing feature that automati-
cally takes successive exposures at
incremental settings you specify. 
For example, you can choose to take
the first picture at the exposure setting determined by the camera’s meter
and a specified number of photos (typically three or five) at exposures that
are less and more than the calculated exposure. The bracketed exposures
can be taken by you one at a time (until the requested number of bracketed
shots are completed) or taken rapidly, one after another, when the dSLR is in
continuous shooting/burst mode.
Certain dSLRs may allow you to bracket parameters other than just exposure,
such as white balance or color; specify the order in which the bracketed
shots are exposed; or set the size of the increment between shots (such as
1⁄3 stop, 1⁄2 stop, or one full stop). You may also be able to bracket 
electronic flash exposures as well.
Figure 17-2 shows a series of bracketed exposures (top) and color balance
changes (bottom).

with anti-aliasing (bottom).

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 17-2: Many digital SLRs can bracket exposure (top), color (bottom), or both.
Chromatic Aberration
Chromatic aberration (CA), which produces colored blurs and/or green/
purple fringes around the outlines of an object, is usually most obvious in
backlit subjects, as shown by the purple fringes around the pine branches in
Figure 17-3. CA is caused by the inability of the lens to focus all the colors of
light at the same plane on the sensor. That splits the red/green/blue light into
separate components, like a prism, and the stray colors are diverted to one
side (with lateral chromatic aberration) or to form a color-tinged blur (with
axial or longitudinal chromatic aberration). Neither form is much fun to find in
your photographs.

Although you can partially reduce axial CA with a smaller f-stop, both types
are defects that you must avoid (by checking reviews before purchase to see
if a particular lens suffers badly from chromatic aberration), live with, or — 
if you have Photoshop or a specialized add-on tool — fix. Photoshop’s Lens
Correction filter can counter some chromatic aberration, and DxO Labs
(www.dxo.com) offers DxO Optics Pro, which has remedies for many types of
lens and perspective distortion.
Figure 17-3: Chromatic aberration can cause green or purple fringing.
Dodging/Burning
Back in the film era, a skilled darkroom worker who was an artful dodger
could hold back portions of an image while a print was made with an enlarger
(a type of vertical projector that casts an image through the negative or posi-
tive film on a piece of photosensitive paper). By moving the hands or various
light-blocking tools in the light path while the exposure was made, portions
of the image subjected to dodging ended up darker than they would’ve if the
exposure was allowed to proceed unhindered. The converse was true for
burning, in which all portions of an image were blocked except the portions
exposed for an added period of time.
317
Chapter 17: Ten (Or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Dodging and burning allowed darkening or lightening of only certain portions
of an image, thus toning down highlight areas that would otherwise be
washed out and preventing shadow areas to preserve detail. Similar tech-
niques are available in all image editors today, but many digital photogra-
phers confuse the two because they don’t know where the terms came from.
Now you know.
Fill Flash
Flash? Outdoors? What am I thinking? Actually, even if plenty of light is avail-
able for an acceptable exposure, that illumination may not provide a decent
picture. That’s especially true in bright sunlight or other situations in which
the highlights are much brighter than the shadows. The result? Shadows that
are way too dark. Providing extra exposure to those inky shadows doesn’t
help: The highlights are then washed out.
The solution is to flip up your camera’s built-in flash and let it do its stuff.
Digital SLRs are smart enough to recognize situations in which the electronic
flash should be used at a lower power setting to fill in shadows without wash-
ing out the highlights. Your camera may do this for you automatically or may
have a Fill Flash setting somewhere in the menus that tells the dSLR to throt-
tle back the strobe. The goal is to provide just enough of a kick with the flash
to brighten the shadows, without making it obvious that a flash was used. As
a bonus, you may find that the Fill Flash adds some useful sparkle to the eyes
of human subjects who are looking directly at the camera, as shown in Figure
17-4. A reddish filter placed over the flash can add some warmth, too.
Figure 17-4: Fill Flash brightens dark shadows.

Hyperfocal Distance
The hyperfocal distance is a quick way of stretching your available depth-
of-field so it’s most useful. This distance is a point of focus where everything
in your scene from half the hyperfocal distance to infinity appears to be
acceptably sharp.
For example, if a hyperfocal distance is six feet, everything from three feet to
infinity would look sharp at the most common print sizes and viewing dis-
tances. (Apparent depth-of-field varies, depending on how close you are to
the image and its magnification.) The actual hyperfocal distance varies by the
lens and the f-stop in use; Google hyperfocal length to find Web pages with
tables that list the distance for a particular focal length and f-stop.
Knowing the hyperfocal distance (even if only a rough estimate) is useful if
you want to be ready for a “grab” shot. Turn off your dSLR’s autofocus, set
the lens at the hyperfocal distance for the f-stop you’ll be using, and you can
snap off a picture quickly without having to wait for the camera to lock in
focus.
Lossy/Lossless Compression
Lossy and lossless are terms that cause confusion, partially because the
former uses a word that’s not officially a part of the English language (I know
lossy causes Microsoft Word fits until you add it to your custom dictionary).
Lossy compression is the opposite of lossless compression. Both schemes
squeeze down the size of image files (thus saving space on your memory
card and computer hard disk) by replacing the long strings of information
that represent the image data with shorter numbers.
The TIFF and compressed RAW file formats are examples of lossless or virtu-
ally lossless file formats (some dSLRs can also use an uncompressed RAW
format). Lossless methods do reduce file size, but retain all the information in
the original image so that the uncompressed version can be reconstituted at
any time.
Lossy compression, used in JPEG files and some other formats, takes an addi-
tional step and examines an image for redundant information that makes
little or no difference visually when the squeezed image is viewed. After
you’ve compressed an image and some of the image data is discarded, you
have no way to restore the original image. If you re-save the same image as a
JPEG file over and over, you lose some image quality each time.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Digital cameras and image editors that use lossy compression offer options
for selecting the amount of compression (and the amount of information
lost), so you can end up with an image that’s virtually undetectable from the
original (as shown on the left in Figure 17-5) or one that’s much smaller but
has a noticeable amount of image information missing (as shown on the right
in Figure 17-5), as well as every quality level in between.
Figure 17-5: Lossless compression (left) preserves all the original image information, unlike
lossy compression (right), which discards some information to reduce file size.
Moiré
As the old song goes, when a newscaster’s tie hits you right in the eye, that’s
a moiré. If you’ve ever gotten dizzy watching a television personality with a
checkered neckpiece on the tube, you’ll know exactly what moiré is. When
two patterns — such as the pattern of the tie and the scanning lines of the
television screen — interfere with each other, a maddening new pattern
appears.

Moiré can be produced when taking digital photos of subjects with a regular
pattern, which is why virtually all dSLRs have an anti-aliasing filter placed
over the sensor. This filter blurs the image slightly, reducing the moiré effect
that would otherwise be caused by interference patterns that result under
certain conditions when an analog visual image is converted to digital form.
One almost sure way to create moiré is to scan a picture that’s already been
published and, thus, printed through a halftone screen. The scanner’s own
pattern frequently produces the effect.
The best cure for moiré, whether it appears in a digital photo or scanned
image, is to blur the image slightly to disguise the interference. You can
sometimes improve scanned images by rescanning with the original at a
slight angle to reduce the interference.
Saturation
Take a perfectly good can of red paint, dump in an equal quantity of white,
and what do you have? Pink? Well, maybe. But in another sense, what you
have is a less-saturated red. Saturation is the purity of a color, from a full, rich
vivid hue, progressing down to duller, less rich colors until you reach gray.
When it comes to paint, you can reduce the saturation by adding white,
black, or gray paint or by mixing in the complement of the original hue to
dilute the color. With digital cameras and light, it’s a little more complicated.
Defining saturation isn’t easy using nothing more than the red, green, and
blue (RGB) channels in a digital camera image. You might think that an image
that has a 100 percent brightness level in, say, the red channel and a zero
brightness level in the green and blue channels would have 100 percent satu-
ration in the red. If all the channels were equal, the saturation would be zero.
Unfortunately, RGB color does a poor job of providing absolute saturation
values simply as the difference among the color channels because the results
aren’t linear and can vary, depending on what’s defined as the white point in
an image. Instead, those who care about such things divide the characteris-
tics of color into a different set of components: hue, saturation, and bright-
ness (or lightness/luminance), often called HSB or HSL. Hue is the absolute
color, as seen on the color wheel (as shown in Figure 11-16 in Chapter 11).
Saturation is intensity of the hue, and brightness is the amount of light 
produced.

Chapter 17: Ten (Or More) Confusing Concepts Clarified

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The distinctions are important to understand when you’re adjusting the
degree of saturation provided by the camera settings in your dSLR or are
modifying the saturation of an image in an image editor. A low degree of satu-
ration produces a low-key, pastel image (as shown on the left in Figure 17-6)
whereas exaggerated saturation creates a garish look (as shown on the far
right in the figure).
Threshold
Thresholds do more than provide a rite-of-passage for newly married cou-
ples. In digital imaging, thresholds determine how a given pixel is represented
in an image. By understanding how thresholds work, you can better under-
stand, for example, why some of your images lack shadow detail or have
blown-out highlights.
Figure 17-6: Low saturation (left), normal saturation (middle), and high saturation (right).

For example, when you take a photo, the individual photosites in the sensor
begin collecting photons the instant the shutter opens. If fewer photons at a
given pixel position are collected than the sensor’s threshold, that pixel is
represented as black. Thousands of photons might have dropped into the
photosite “bucket” while a neighboring photosite might have collected only a
few, but unless the sensor’s threshold is reached, that pixel is black in your
finished picture.
After the threshold is passed, additional photons allow the pixel to show up
as brighter shades of gray, then midtones, and finally, white, at which point,
another threshold is reached. Any additional photons collected don’t register
at all unless they happen to spill out of the bucket into adjacent photosites
(producing a blooming effect). Increasing the ISO setting effectively lowers
the threshold by multiplying the number of pixels actually collected until
they can be counted by the sensor. Thresholds are used in many different
ways, particularly in image editors when you use a threshold to specify a
contrast level that is used to apply, say, unsharp masking to an image.
Tolerance
Tolerance is an image-editing concept that confuses many. It generally refers
to the range of both color or tonal values that are selected by a particular
tool, such as the Magic Wand, Magic Eraser in Photoshop. (Many think toler-
ance involves only brightness, when in fact, color is also factored in.)
Tolerance is usually specified in values from 0 to 255 because that range is
used to represent both black-and-white and color brightness values (from 0,
which is black, to 255, which is white). Low tolerance settings mean that only
pixels that are very close in brightness or color value are selected. For exam-
ple, if you click a pixel with a value of 220 using the Magic Wand with the tol-
erance set to 10, adjacent pixels with color or brightness values within 10 of
that value are chosen; a value of 64 would select a much larger set of pixels.
When making selections in an image editor, set tolerance levels that are, like
Goldilocks’ choices, “just right.” With a low tolerance, you don’t select
enough pixels to be useful, whereas too high a tolerance selects pixels that
you really don’t want.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Unsharp Masking
The term unsharp masking often throws new photographers because the
process doesn’t make images less sharp — it makes them sharper. The confu-
sion comes from unsharp masking’s origins as a technique originally used
with photographic film.
Darkroom workers would take a sheet of negative film and create a positive
image that’s slightly blurred. Like any out-of-focus image, the blurred positive
spreads out a little. Then, when the original negative and positive were placed
together in a sandwich, the dark areas of the negative partially cancelled out
(masked) the equivalent light areas of the reversed positive, except at the
edges, where the blurring produced lighter and darker lines on each side of
the boundary between those edges. Copying the sandwich produced a new
image that emphasized the edges, enhancing the appearance of sharpness.
Image editors retain the name unsharp masking because photographers who
were familiar with the process were early users of the programs. However,
the Unsharp Mask filters do all their work electronically, searching for pixels
that differ in value from their surrounding pixels based on a threshold level
you specify. When pixels differ more sharply from their neighbors, the image
editor judges that an “edge” has been defined and increases the contrast to
make the edge seem sharper.
