PREFACE 
This second edition of Athenaze was produced on the basis of suggestions 
made by anonymous reviewers contacted by Oxford University Press and 
with inspiration from L. Miraglia and T. F. B6rri's Italian edition of 
Athenaze. We are grateful to these teachers and professors and also to the fol-
lowing, who read versions of the revised edition at various stages, offered in-
numerable helpful suggestions, and caught many errors, typographical and 
other: Elizabeth Baer of the Berkshire Country Day School, Jessica Mix Bar-
rington of the Northfield Mount Hermon School, James Johnson of Austin 
College, Cynthia King of Wright State University, Rosemary Laycock of 
Dalhousie University, Mark Riley of California State University at Sacra-
mento, Kolbeinn Sremundsson of the Menntask61inn i Reykjavik, and Rex 
Wallace of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Thanks also go to 
Latin teachers in Sunday afternoon Greek classes who used preliminary 
versions of the revised chapters and made many useful observations. 
The new features of the revised textbooks include the following: 
• Short passages from Classical and New Testament Greek in virtually 
every chapter 
• A strand titled Greek Wisdom, with sayings of the seven wise men of Ar-
chaic Greece at various points throughout Book I and fragments of Hera-
clitus at various points throughout Chapters 18-28 in Book II (Greek Wis-
dom in Chapter 29 contains material on Socrates) 
• Some rearrangement of the sequence in which grammar is introduced, so 
that the future tense and the passive voice are now introduced in Book I 
and the first three principal parts of verbs are now listed from Chapter 10, 
with full sets of principal parts being given in Book II, as before 
• Fuller grammatical and linguistic explanations throughout, including 
material on accents provided along the way, as needed for completing ex-
ercises accurately 
• New, descriptive terminology used for the tenses of verbs 
• Many new exercises, including periodic requests for students to photocopy 
blank Verb Charts at the ends of Books I and II and to fill in forms of re-
quested verbs, adding new forms as they are learned 
• New insertions in Book I titled PRACTICE, requesting that students write 
out sets of nouns or sets of nouns and matching adjectives 
• Presentation of most of the new grammar by Chapter 28 and consolidation 
of the extracts from Thucydides and Aristophanes' Acharnians in the last 
two chapters, 29 and 30 
The purposes of the course remain as they were in the first edition, as they 
are spelled out in the Introduction. We hope that inclusion of Classical and 
New Testament passages will attract more students to the study of Greek and 
that this revised edition will help expand interest in the study of Greek in 
North America.

INTRODUCTION 
Part I: 
About This Course 
The aim of Athenaze is to teach you to read ancient Greek as quickly, 
thoroughly, and enjoyably as possible, and to do so within the context of an-
cient Greek culture. This means within the context of the daily life of the an-
cient Greeks as it was shaped and given meaning by historical develop-
ments, political events, and the life of the mind as revealed in mythology, re-
ligion, philosophy, literature, and art. The stories that you will read in Greek 
provide the basic cultural context within which you will learn the Greek lan-
guage, and most of the chapters contain essays in English with illustrations 
drawn from ancient works of art and with background information to deepen 
your understanding of some aspects of the history and culture of the Greeks. 
The course begins with the story of an Athenian farmer named Dicaeopo-
lis and his family; they live in a village or deme called Cholleidae, located 
north of Athens. The events are fictitious, but they are set in a definite histor-
ical context-autumn 432 B.C. to spring 431. The Athenian democracy, led by 
Pericles, is at its height; the Athenians rule the seas and control an empire, 
but their power has aroused the fears and jealousy of Sparta and her allies in 
the Peloponnesus, especially Corinth. By spring 431, Athens and the Pelo-
ponnesian League are engaged in a war, which leads twenty-seven years 
later to the defeat and downfall of Athens. 
The story begins with life in the country, but with Chapter 6 a subplot of 
mythical narrative begins with the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. This 
mythological subplot continues in Chapter 7 with the story of Odysseus and the 
Cyclops and runs through Chapter 10 with further tales from the Odyssey 
briefly told at the end of each chapter. The main plot continues in Chapter 8 as 
the family visits Athens for a festival, and the tempo quickens. 
A terrible misfortune that strikes the family in Athens in Chapter 10 pre-
cipitates a plot that is interwoven with narratives of the great battles of the 
Persian Wars, based on the accounts of the historian Herodotus. As the main 
plot reaches its resolution in Chapters 18-20 of Book II, the family becomes 
embroiled in the tensions between Athens and Corinth that triggered the Pelo-
ponnesian War, and this sets the stage for the remaining chapters. 
The experiences of the family of Dicaeopolis at the beginning of the Pelo-
ponnesian War in Chapters 21-23 are based on the accounts of the war written 
by the historian Thucydides. When the son Philip is left behind in Athens to 
fUrther his education, we hear something of Plato's views on education 
(Chapter 24) and then read stories from a book of Herodotus's histories that 
Philip's teacher gives to him (Chapters 25-28). These are some of the most 
famous tales from Herodotus, including those dealing with Solon the Athe-
nian and his encounter with Croesus, king of Lydia. In Chapter 28 you will 
ix 

x 
Athenaze: Book I 
read the account by the lyric poet Bacchylides of Croesus's miraculous rescue 
from the funeral pyre. Chapter 29 returns us to the Peloponnesian War with 
Thucydides's descriptions of naval battles and the brilliant victories of the 
Athenian general Phormio. The course concludes with extracts from Aristo-
phanes showing us Dicaeopolis the peacemaker. From there you will be 
ready to go on to read any Greek author of your choice with considerable con-
fidence in your ability to comprehend what the ancient Greeks had to say. 
The Greek in much of the main story line has been made up to serve the 
instructional purposes of this book. Most of the subplots, however, are based 
on the ancient Greek writings of Homer, Herodotus, and Thucydides. They 
move steadily closer to the Greek of the authors themselves. The extracts 
from Bacchylides and Aristophanes are unaltered except for cuts. 
The readings in the early chapters are simple in content and grammati-
cal structure. They are so constructed that with knowledge of the vocabulary 
that is given before the reading passage and with help from the glosses that 
are given beneath each paragraph, you can read and understand the Greek 
before studying the formal elements of the grammar. After you have read the 
story out loud, understood and translated it, and discovered the new elements 
of its grammar for yourself, you will study formal presentations of the 
grammar that usually incorporate examples from the reading passage. 
There are then exercises of various sorts to help you consolidate your under-
standing of the grammar and give you skill in manipUlating the new forms 
and structures of the language as you learn them. 
Grammar is introduced in small doses to start with and should be re-
viewed constantly. We also recommend frequent rereading of the stories 
themselves-preferably out loud-as the best way to reinforce your fluency of 
pronunciation, your knowledge of the grammar, and your skill in reading 
new Greek at sight-which is the main goal of any course in Greek. 
At the beginning of each section of the narrative is a picture with a caption 
in Greek. From the picture you should be able to deduce the meaning of the 
Greek caption. Pay partiCUlar attention to these captions, since each has been 
carefully written to include and reinforce a basic grammatical feature or 
features of the Greek language that you will be learning in that particular 
chapter. It may help even to memorize the captions! 
The vocabulary given in the lists before the reading passages is meant to 
be learned thoroughly, both from Greek to English and from English to 
Greek. Learning the vocabulary will be easier if the words are always stud-
ied aloud, combining the advantages of sight and sound. The words given in 
glosses beneath the paragraphs in the readings are not meant to be mastered 
actively, but you should be able to recognize the meaning of these words when 
you see them again in context. Fluency of reading depends on acquiring a 
large, working vocabulary as soon as possible. 
Important words are continually reintroduced in the readings in this 
course to help you learn them. Your skill in recognizing the meaning of 
Greek words that you have not met will be greatly enhanced by attention to 
some basic principles of word building. We have therefore laid out some of 
Introduction 
xi 
these basic principles and incorporated a coherent set of word building exer-
cises in this course. 
One of the widely recognized goals of classical language study is attain-
ment of a better understanding of English. With regard to the study of Greek, 
this means largely a knowledge of Greek roots, prefixes, and suffixes that 
appear in English words. The influence of Greek on English has been espe-
cially notable in scientific and medical terminology, but it is also evident in 
the language of politics, philosophy, literature, and the arts. We have accord-
ingly incorporated word study sections in the chapters of this course, high-
lighting the influence of Greek on English vocabulary and providing prac-
tice in deciphering the meaning of English words derived from Greek ele-
ments. 
Finally, at the end of almost every chapter and sometimes in the middle 
of a chapter you will find passages from a wide variety of Classical Greek 
authors and from the gospels of Luke and John in the New Testament. These 
have been carefully chosen and are accompanied by glosses that will allow 
you to read the passages at the points in the course where they are located. We 
have also included sayings of the seven wise men of Archaic Greece at vari-
ous points throughout Book 1. You will thus be reading authentic Greek from 
the very beginning of the course and gaining access to the wisdom and the 
style of writing and thinking of the ancient Greeks and of the writers of the 
gospels. This is the icing on the cake, and we hope that you will enjoy it thor-
oughly and learn much from it.

Introduction 
xiii 
The symbol v will occasionally be used over a Greek vowel to indicate a 
vowel of short quantity. The symbol - indicates a vowel of long quantity (see 
ii, t, and ij in the right-hand column in the list above). Normally short vowels 
have neither mark above them (see a, t, and 1) in the right-hand column 
above). When these three vowels are long, they will usually be printed in 
Athenaze with long marks over them (ii, t, and ij). The long mark is referred 
to as a macron (Greek ~axp6v, long). A long vowel is held approximately 
twice as long as a short vowel. The vowels 1] and OJ are always long and are 
therefore not marked with macrons. 
The digraphs El and 01) represent two 
additional long vowels in Greek (see Long Vowel Digraphs below). The vow-
els £ and 0 are always short. 
All vowels marked with a circumflex accent C) or with an iota subscript 
(see below) are always long and will usually not be marked with macrons. 
In the Greek names for the letters of the alphabet given on the previous 
page, identify all long and all short vowels. Practice pronouncing the names 
of the letters, paying special attention to proper pronunciation of the long and 
short vowels. Hold the long vowels for twice the length of time as the short 
vowels. 
Breathings 
There is no letter h in the Attic alphabet, but this sound occurs at the be-
ginning of many Greek words. It is indicated by a mark called a rough 
breathing or aspiration, written over the first vowel of a word (over the second 
vowel of a diphthong), e.g.: 
I:v (pronounced hen) 
ou (pronounced hou) 
When an h sound is not to be pronounced at the beginning of a word begin-
ning with a vowel or diphthong, a smooth breathing mark is used, e.g.: 
EV (pronounced en) 
ou (pronounced au) 
Thus, every word beginning with a vowel or a diphthong will have a rough or 
smooth breathing. Initial p always has a rough breathing, e.g., pa~30S, wand. 
Diphthongs 
Diphthongs are glides from one vowel sound to another within the same 
syllable. Attic Greek has the following diphthongs:

Long Vowel Digraphs 
Digraphs are combinations of letters that represent a single sound. Two 
long vowel sounds are represented in Greek by the following digraphs:

as the sound in mood 
Iota Subscript 
Sometimes the letter t (iota) is written under a vowel, e.g., q" 11, and 'l' 
(these combinations are referred to as long diphthongs); when so written it is 
called iota subscript. In classical Greek this iota was written on the line after 
the vowel and was pronounced as a short iota. Its pronunciation ceased in 
post-classical Greek, and we usually do not pronounce it now. When it ap-
pears in a word that is written entirely in capital letters (as in the titles to the 
readings in this book), it is written on the line as a capital iota. Thus ltpO, "ti\ 
KP1\vll > IIPOL THI KPHNHI. Note that accents and breathing marks are not 
used when all letters are capitalized. 
Paired Consonants 
Paired consonants such as AA, ~~, ltlt, and tt should be pronounced double 
and held approximately twice as long as the single consonant, e.g., the ~~ in 
ya~~a. 
Exceptions are yy, yK, y~, and YX (where the first y is pronounced as the ng 
in sing), as in aYYEAo" messenger, and aYK"pa, anchor. 
Double Consonants 
Three consonants represent combinations of other sounds and are called 
double consonants: 
/;,=cr+1i 
~ = K + cr or y + cr or X + cr 
'" = It + cr or ~ + cr or 'I' + cr 
Aspirated Consonants 
Three consonants represent certain sounds followed by an h sound or as-
piration: 
6 = an aspirated, 
'I' = an aspirated It 
X = an aspirated K

Compare what is said about the double consonants ~ and", above. These lin-
guistic phenomena will be very important in understanding certain forms of 
nouns and verbs. 
Punctuation 
The period and the comma are written as in English. A dot above the line 
( .) is the equivalent of an English semicolon or colon. A mark that looks like 
an English semicolon (;) is used at the end of a sentence as a question mark. 
Accents 
Nearly every word in Greek bears an accent mark: an acute (,(,), a grave 
(,0), or a circumflex (bp&). These marks seldom affect the sense. They were 
invented as symbols to provide written aid for correct pronunciation; origi-
nally they indicated a change in pitch, e.g., the acute accent showed that the 
syllable on which it fell was pronounced at a higher pitch than the preceding 
or following syllables. Later stress replaced pitch, and now ancient Greek is 
usually pronounced with stress on the accented syllables (with no distinction 
among the three kinds of accents) instead of varying the pitch of the voice. 
For those who wish to use the pitch accent, we recommend the recording of 
Stephen Daitz, mentioned below. 
Note that the grave accent stands only on the final syllable of a word. It 
usually replaces an acute accent on the final syllable of a word when that 
word is followed immediately by another word with no intervening punctua-
tion, e.g., instead of,61i&pov, we write ,0 Ii&pov.

Transliteration 
Note the following standard transliteration of Greek into English letters: 
a=a 
l1=e 
v=n 
"=t 
~=b 
8=th 
s= x 
u=uory 
y= g 
t=i 
0=0 
<p=ph 
8=d 
K= k 
1t=p 
x= ch 
E=e 
A=l 
p=r 
1jI = ps 
S=z 
Jl= m 
a.~=s 
ro=o 
Remember the following: yy = ng; yK = nk; ys = nx, and yx = nch; atU, £u, llU, ou, 
m = au, eu, eu, ou, ui, but when u is not in a diphthong it is usually transliter-
ated as y, And note that Cf, 11, and 'l' are transliterated ai, ei, and iii, to distin-
guish them from the short diphthongs, ott, n, and Ot, transliterated ai, ei, and 
oi. 
[The recommendations for pronunciation given above (the restored pronunciation) are 
based on W. Sidney Allen, Vox Graeca: A Guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Greek, 
Cambridge University Press, 3rd ed., 1988, pages 177-179. For demonstration of the re-
stored pronunciation, including the pitch accents, students should consult the cassette 
recording of Stephen G. Daitz, The Pronunciation and Reading of Ancient Greek: A 
Practical Guide, 2nd ed., 1984, Audio Forum, Guilford, CT 06437 (U.s.A.).]

Writing Greek Letters 
Certain conventions may be observed in writing Greek letters. With prac-
tice one can write them with ease and speed. There should be no difficulty in 
imitating the printed forms of the capitals; the small letters may be written as 
indicated below. A small "s" indicates the point where each letter should be 
begun ("S1>" "S2," etc., are used if it is necessary to lift the pen or pencil), and 
an arrowhead (---» indicates the direction in which the pen or pencil should 
move. For convenience, the letters may be divided into four groups: 
(1) Eleven of the Greek small letters do not extend below the line of writ-
ing,and are approximately as wide as they are high (cf. English a, c, e, etc.). 
(The corresponding capitals are given first, then the printed forms of the small 
letters, then the "diagrams" for imitation.)

not, in general, cause confusion.

WORD STUDY 
Many English words are derived from Greek. Often these derivatives are 
scientific and technical terms formed in English from Greek stems because 
the precision of the Greek language makes it possible to express a complex 
concept in a single word. 
What Greek words from the story at the beginning of this chapter do you 
recognize in the following English words? Define the words, using your 
knowledge of the Greek: 
1. 
anthropology 
2. 
polysyllabic 
3 . 
philosophy 
4. 
microscope 
English words such as those above often contain more than one Greek 
stem. Which of the words above contain stems of the following Greek words?

GRAMMAR 
1. Verb Forms: Stems and Endings 
Greek verbs have stems, which give the meaning of the word, and 
variable endings, which show such things as number and person. In ad-
dition to singular and plural number, Greek has dual number, used when 
referring to two people or things; it is fairly rare, however, and will not be 
taught in this course. 
Number: 
Singular 
Plural 
Person:

I 
we 
2nd 
you

3rd 
he, she, it 
they 
This chapter introduces only the third person singular of the present 
tense, e.g., helshelit is. 
The Greek verb for loosen, loose will serve as an example of a regular 
Greek verb; the verb for love will serve as an example of a contract verb (a 
type of verb in which the vowel at the end ofthe stem contracts with the ini-
tial vowel of the ending). The irregular verb for be is also given. 
SteDl: AU-, loosen, loose 
3rd singular 
A ;l-et 
he I she loosens, is loosening, does loosen 
SteDl: <ptAe-, love 
3rd singular 
cptAE-Et > q>tAit he I she loves, is loving, does love 
Note that> means "becomes." 
SteDl: EG-, be 
3rd singular 
he I she litis 
*EO"dv is used when followed by a word beginning with a vowel or when coming as 
the last word in a clause. The -v is called movable v. The word £O''tt(v) is enclitic, 
which means that it ''leans upon" the previous word and often loses its accent. The 
rules for accenting enclitics and the words that precede them will be presented as 
needed for writing Greek in the exercises. 
2. Nouns: Genders, Stems, Endings, Cases, and Agreement 
a. Grammatical Gender 
Greek nouns are usually masculine or feminine or neuter 
(neither masculine nor feminine) in gender. Some words such as 
dtlCat01tOAtS, which is masculine, have natural gender; the gender of 
1. 
0 
d I K A I 0 II 0 A I 1: 
(a) 
5 
other words such as aypoS is not determined by the gender of the thing 
referred to. Such words have what is called grammatical gender, this 
one being masculine. In learning vocabulary, always learn the arti-
cle with the noun; this will tell you its gender: 6 for masculine; it for 
feminine; and <0 for neuter. In this chapter all the nouns listed in the 
Vocabulary are masculine and are therefore accompanied by the 
masculine definite article, o. 
b. Stems, Endings, and Cases 
Greek nouns, pronouns, and adjectives have stems, which give the 
meaning of the word, and variable endings, which show the function 
of the word in the sentence. The endings of nouns, pronouns, and ad-
jectives are called cases. 
There are five cases in Greek (nominative, genitive, dative, ac-
cusative, and vocative); in this chapter we focus on the use of two of 
them-the nominative and the accusative. 
SteDl: lCATlPO-, farm 
Nominative Ending: -so lCATlPO- + -s > lCAfipos. This case is used 
for the subject of the verb and the complement after the verb "is," 
e.g.: 
~ect 
6lCAfipos 
The farm 
Verb 
CODlpleDlent 
fttlCPo.· 
small. 
Accusative Ending: -v. lCATlPO- + -v > lCAfipov. This case is used 
for the direct object of the verb, e.g.: 
~ect 
6 (iv8pomoc; 
The man 
Verb 
yecopye'i 
cultivates 
Direct O~ect 
<ov lCAfipov. 
the farm. 
Note that it is the endings of the words and not the order in which 
they are placed in the sentence that builds the meaning of the sen-
tence. The first sentence above could be written fttKPOS EGnv 6 lCAfipos 
(the definite article marks 6 lCAfipos as the subject). The second sen-
tence could be written <ov lCAfipov yecopye'i 6 iiv8pco1tos, with a change in 
emphasis but no change in basic meaning. 
c. Agreement 
Definite articles and adjectives agree with the nouns they go with 
in gender, number (singular or plural), and case, e.g.: 
6 lCaMS aypOS: masculine singular nominative 
'tov IltlCPOV otlCOV: masculine singular accusative

3. Labeling Functions of Words in Sentences 
In exercises you will be asked to label the functions of words in sen-
tences. Label the subject S, the complement C, and the direct object DO. 
Label linking verbs such as Ea,i(v) LV. Verbs that take direct objects, 
such as YEroPYEt in the sentence above, are transitive and are to be labeled 
TV (Transitive Verb); verbs that do not take direct objects, such as OiKEt in 
the sentence below, are intransitive and are to be labeled IV (Intransitive 
Verb): 
S 
IV 
b IltKat01tOAtS oiK" EV 'OtS aypOtS. 
Note that the complement can be either an adjective as in the sentence 
b KAfipos Ean J.llKPOS above or a noun as in the following sentence: 
S 
C 
LV 
4. Use of the Definite Article 
The definite article is sometimes used in Greek where it is not used in 
English, e.g., b IltKat01tOAtS = Dicaeopolis, and sometimes it can be trans-
lated with a possessive adjective in English, e.g.: 
b iiv8pro1toS YEropy" TOV KAfipov. 
The man cultivates his farm. 
Exercise la 
Copy the following sentences and label the function of each noun and verb

The Athenian Farmer 
Dicaeopolis lives in a village in Attica called Cholleidae, about ten miles 
or sixteen kilometers north of Athens. Although Athens and its port, the Pi-
raeus, formed a very large city by ancient standards, the majority of the 
Athenian people lived and worked in the country. The historian Thucydides 
(2.14) says that when Attica had to be evacuated before the Peloponnesian in-
1.

III K A I 0 IT 0 A I L 
(a) 
7 
vasion of 431 B.C. "the evacuation was difficult for them since the majority 
had always been accustomed to living in the country." 
Most of these people were farmers like Dicaeopolis. Their farms were 
small; ten to twenty acres would be the average size. What they grew on their 
farms would depend partly on the district in which they lived. On the plain 
near Athens no doubt the staple products would have been vegetables and 
grain, but most of Attica is hilly; this poorer land would be more suitable for 
grape vines, olive trees, sheep, and goats (cows were not kept for milk). All 
farmers aimed at self-sufficiency, but few would have attained it (two-thirds 
of the grain consumed by the Athenians was imported). If they had a surplus, 
e.g., of olive oil or wine, they would take it to the market in Athens for sale 
and buy what they could not produce themselves. 
For purposes of administration, the Athenian citizens were divided into 
four classes, based on property. The top class, the pentacosiomedimnoi or 
"millionaires," a very small class, were those whose estates produced five 
hundred medimnoi of grain a year (a medimnos = about one and a half 
bushels or fifty-two to fifty-three liters). The second class, also s'mall, were 
the hippeis, "knights," whose estates could support a horse (t1t1toS); these pro-
vided the cavalry for the army (see illustration, page 162). The third and 
largest class were the farmers like Dicaeopolis, called the zeugitai, who kept 
a team of oxen U;EiiyoS). These provided the heavy infantry of the army. The 
fourth class were the thetes, "hired laborers," who owned no land or not 
enough to support a family. 
Our sources represent the farmers as the backbone of the Athenian democ-
racy-sturdy, industrious, thrifty, and simple, but shrewd. In the comedies of 
Aristophanes they are often contrasted with self-seeking politicians, deca-
dent knights, and grasping traders. The name of our main character, Di-
cae opolis, contains the concepts oiKalO-, just, and 1tOAtS, city, and means 
something like honest citizen. He is taken from a comedy of Aristophanes 
called the Acharnians; the play was produced in 425 B.C., and at the end of 
this course you will read extracts from it.

" YeIDpyO, 
" cpiA.o, 
Attic Greek has three kinds of accent marks: acute', grave', and cir-
cumflex ". The acute accent will be found only on one of the last three syl-
lables of a word, e.g.: iiv8pID1tO,. AEYet, ~(j;KPO,. An acute accent on the final 
syllable of a word will be changed to a grave accent if it is followed im-
mediately by another word with no punctuation (comma, semicolon, or 
period) in between, thus aX)"'&' + KuA6, > uAM. KuA6,. 
An important exception to this rule occurs when enclitics, words such 
as e("i(v), which usually lose their accent and instead "lean upon" the 
previous word for their accent, follow words with an acute accent on their 
final syllable, e.g.: 
xaAe1tO, + e,,,i(v) becomes xaAeno, eatl(v). 
The acute on the final syllable of XUAe1tO, does not cbange to a grave 
when the word is followed by an enclitic, and the enclitic loses its ac-
cent. 
Note also what happens when words accented like iiv8pIDno,. novo" and 
OtKO, are followed by enclitics: 
iiv8pdl1tO, + I:,,,i(v) becomes iiv8pID1tO, eatl(v). 
An acute accent is added to iiv8pdl1tO" and the enclitic loses its accent. 
novo, + ea~i(v) remains novo, ea~i(v). 
The enclitic keeps its accent. 
atKa, + ea~i(v) becomes ot.:o, eatl(v). 
An acute accent is added to OtKO" and the enclitic loses its accent.

GRAMMAR 
1. Verb Forms: Indicative Mood; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Persons Singular 
The moods indicate whether an action is viewed as being real or 
ideal. The indicative mood is used to express statements and questions 
about reality or fact: 
EAUUVro .ou<; poliS. I am driving the oxen. 
.i Ka6EUOEt<;; Why are you sleeping? 
The different endings of the verb show not only who or what is per-
forming the action (I; you; he/she/it; we; you; they) but also how the action 
is being viewed (mood). In the following examples we give only the sin-
gular possibilities (I; you; he/she/it) in the indicative mood: 
Stem: AU-, loosen, loose 
1st singular 
A ii-ro 
2nd singular

Since the endings differ for each person, subject pronouns need not be 
expressed in Greek, e.g.: 
EAauvOJ = I drive. 
EAauvw; = you drive. 
EAaUVEt = he / she drives. 
But they are expressed if they are emphatic, e.g.: 
8ym ~ev novro, au lie KaSeuliw;. I am working, but you are sleeping.

2. Proclitics 
The negative adverb OU, OUK, OUX is called a proclitic. Proclitics nor-
mally do not have accents but "lean forward" onto the following word (cf. 
enclitics, page 4), e.g., ti ou aneuliets; (Exercise 2a, no. 3, above). When 
the proclitic ou is followed by the enclitic ei~i (1st person singular), the en-
clitic retains an accent on its second syllable, e.g., OUK ei~l &pyoS 
(Exercise 2a, no. 4, above). When OUK is followed by the enclitic Eati(v) 
(3rd person singular), the enclitic receives an acute accent on its first syl-
lable, e.g., 61i0uAOS OUK eattv &pyoS (Exercise 2a, no. 9, above). 
Exercise2~ 
Translate into Greek. Do not begin your Greek sentence with an enclitic.

Slavery 
The adult male population of the city-state of Athens in 431 B.C. has been 
calculated as follows: citizens 50,000, resident foreigners 25,000, slaves 
100,000. The resident foreigners (metics, ~EtOtKOt) were free men who were 
granted a distinct status; they could not own land in Attica or contract mar-
riages with citizens, but they had the protection of the courts, they served in the 
army, they had a role in the festivals, and they played an important part in 
commerce and industry. 
Slaves had no legal rights and were the property of the state or individu-
als. 
The fourth-century philosopher Aristotle describes them as "living 
tools." They were either born into slavery or came to the slave market as a re-
sult of war or piracy. They were nearly all barbarians, i.e., non-Greek (a 
document from 415 B.C. records the sale of fourteen slaves-five were from 
Thrace, two from Syria, three from Caria, two from Illyria, and one each 
from Scythia and Colchis). It was considered immoral to enslave Greeks, 
and this very rarely happened. 

16 
Athenaze: Book I 
The whole economy of the ancient world, which made little use of ma-
chines, was based on slave labor. Slaves were employed by the state, e.g., in 
the silver mines; they worked in factories (the largest we know of was a 
shield factory, employing 120 slaves); and individual citizens owned one or 
more slaves in proportion to their wealth. Every farmer hoped to own a slave 
to help in the house and fields, but not all did. Aristotle remarks that for poor 
men "the ox takes the place of the slave." 
It would be wrong to assume that slaves were always treated inhumanely. 
A fifth-century writer of reactionary views says: 
Now as to slaves and metics, in Athens, they live a most undisciplined 
life. One is not permitted to strike them, and a slave will not stand out of 
the way for you. Let me explain why. If the law permitted a free man to 
strike a slave or metic or a freedman, he would often find that he had mis-
taken an Athenian for a slave and struck him, for, as far as clothing and 
general appearance go, the common people look just the same as slaves 
and metics. (Pseudo-Xenophon 1.10) 
Slaves and citizens often worked side by side and received the same 
wage, as we learn from inscriptions giving the accounts of public building 
works. Slaves might save enough money to buy their freedom from their 
masters, though this was not as common in Athens as in Rome. 
In the country, the slaves of farmers usually lived and ate with their mas-
ters. Aristophanes' comedies depict them as lively and cheeky characters, by 
no means downtrodden. We have given Dicaeopolis one slave, named Xan-
thias, a typical slave name meaning "fair-haired."

WORD BUILDING 
In the readings you have met the following prepositions: dC;, into; 10K, out 
of; i:v, in; and IlPOC;, to, toward. These prepositions may be prefixed to verbs to 
form compound verbs, e.g.: 
~u{VEt, he / she walks, steps 
£K~U{VEt, he / she steps out 
Deduce the meaning of the following compound verbs: 
1. 
Ilpompepet 
4. 
1tpo,,~u{vet 
2. 
i:K<pEpet 
5. 
i:uuAe, 
3. 
IlpOaEAuUVEt 
6. 
dcrEACXUVEt 
You can easily deduce the meanings of many more compound verbs of 
this sort, which are very frequent in Greek. Right from the start of your study 
of Greek you should begin to recognize the meaning of many new words from 
your knowledge of ones with which you are already familiar. To encourage 
you to develop and use this skill, the meaning of compound verbs will not be 
given in the chapter vocabularies when the meaning is clear from the sepa-
rate parts of the word. When compound verbs have special meanings, they 
will be given in the vocabulary lists.

N.B. The endings for the neuter nominative, accusative, and voca-
tive cases are the same. 
"Not a definite article, but an inteIjection used with the vocative. 
5. Uses of the Cases 
The subject of the sentence and the complement of the verb "to be" are 
in the nominative case, e.g., b aypoe; KUAO<; Eanv = The field is beautiful. 
b AtKUt6"OAt~ U;,~0\)py6~ Eanv. Dicaeopolis is a farmer. 
The genitive case is at present used only after certain prepositions, 
including those that express motion from a place, e.g., ElC~U(Vet h ~ou 
otKO\) = He I She steps I comes out of the house. 
The dative case is also at present used only after certain prepositions, 
including those that indicate the place where someone or something is or 
something happens, e.g., lCUSCUOCt Ev ~q, OtKtp = He I She sleeps in the 
house. 
The accusative case indicates the direct object of a transitive verb 
(e.g., lCuAcl ~ov OOUAOV) and is used after certain prepositions, including 
those that indicate motion toward someone or something, e.g., "po<; ~ov 
OtKOV ~aO(~Ct = Hel She walks toward the house. 
The vocative case is used when addressing a person, e.g., EASe ocupo, 
if> OOUA£ = Come here, slave! It is usually preceded by if>, which need not 
be translated. 
6. Persistent Accent of Nouns and Adjectives 
The accents of nouns and adjectives are persistent, i.e., they remain 
as they are in the nominative case unless forced to change because of one 
of several rules. One such rule is that nouns and adjectives such as those 
in the chart above, if they are accented in the nominative with an acute on 
the final syllable, change their accent to a circumflex on the final sylla-
ble in the genitive and dative cases. Note how this rule applies to the ad-
jective KuA6<;/lCUMv and to the noun aypo<; above. (Of course, the adjective 
KuMe;/lCUMv as written above in the nominative, accusative, and vocative

cases has changed its acute to a grave because of the nouns immediately 
following.) Note also that the definite article follows a similar rule and 
has a circumflex accent on the genitive and dative.

7. Recessive Accent of Verbs 
More will be said about accents on verbs later in this course (e.g., 
Chapter 5, Grammar 2, pages 56-57), but for now observe that the forms 
EAUUVro, EA.aUVCte;, and EA.UUVCl have accents on the next to the last syllable, 
when the final syllable has a long vowel or diphthong. When the final 
syllable is short, as in the imperative, the accent recedes to the third sylla-
ble from the end, thus, eA.ullvc. In the second paragraph of story ~, find six 
verbs accented on the third syllable from the end.

Exercise 2'1\ 
Translate into Greek. When you need to use /ltv and another postpositive 
word together, always put /ltv before the other postpositive (see line 5 of the 
story above): 
l. 
Dicaeopolis no longer (o;'K~n) works but loosens the oxen. 
2. 
And (use OE, postpositive) then he calls the slave and says: "Don't 
work any longer (J.L1Jdn) but come here and take the plow. 
3. 
"For I (use personal pronoun) on the one hand am driving the oxen to 
the house, you (au) on the other hand carry (imperative) the plow." 
4. 
So on the one hand Dicaeopolis drives the oxen out of the field, and on 
the other hand the slave takes the plow and carries (it) toward the 
house.

The Deme and the Polis 
As we have seen, Dicaeopolis lives in a village about ten miles or sixteen 
kilometers north of Athens called Cholleidae, situated between Mount Parnes 
and Mount Pentelicon. Such districts were called demes, and at the time of 
our story there were about 170 of them in Attica, differing greatly in size and 
population. Each deme had its own assembly, to which all adult male citizens 
belonged. This assembly elected a demarch (o~flapxo<;, mayor or sheriff) and 
passed decrees on local affairs, both secular and religious. It kept a record of 
all births; a man's rights as a citizen depended on his beirig registered in a 
deme when he reached adulthood. In all official contexts a man gave his 
name together with that of his father and deme, e.g., IIep'KJ..ij<; 8av8(1t1totl Xo-
J..apyeu<; (Pericles, son of Xanthippus, of the deme of Cholargus). 
The houses that composed these villages were mostly small and unpreten-
tious, as far as our evidence goes. A typical house would consist of a court-
yard surrounded by single-story rooms, and in one corner a storage-tower 
with an upper floor; this upper floor would form the women's quarters, to 
which women would retire if strangers called. There would be no source of 
water within the house itself; it had to be fetched every day from a public 
fountain. Light would be provided by clay lamps fired by olive oil, which was 
also used for cooking and washing. We may assume that the majority of the 
farmers lived in the village and went out to work on their farms every day, as 
farmers still do in parts of Greece and Italy today, where houses are as a gen-
eral rule not in the fields but clustered together in hilltop villages.

APOT01: (a) 
The men worked most of the day in the fields, and no doubt in the 
evenings they spent their time in the wineshop in the agora or marketplace, 
discussing farming and politics with their friends. Life was enlivened by a 
succession of religious festivals. An inscription from the deme of Ercheia 
records a list of over fifty public sacrifices performed annually, and a public 
sacrifice usually entailed a public feast. In the winter, at the festival of the 
Rural Dionysia, touring companies from Athens even brought plays out to the 
demes. There were also private functions performed with traditional rituals, 
especially celebrations of birth, marriage, and death. 
The farmer's horizon was by no means bounded by the deme. When he 
produced a surplus of any product such as wine or olives, he would go to 
Athens to sell it and to buy necessities he could not produce himself. There 
were religious festivals at regular intervals throughout the year at Athens 
(see Chapter 10), which he could attend with his wife and family; these in-
cluded musical, dramatic, and athletic competitions. 
There were important political functions that, as an Athenian citizen, the 
farmer was bound to perform. Forty times a year there were regular meet-
ings of the Athenian Assembly, attended by all adult male citizens. The 
farmer would in fact have been prevented by his work from attending all of 
these, but he would certainly have gone to some of them. Every year the as-
sembly of the deme chose representatives for the Council of 500, which was the 
executive committee of the Assembly. Councilors had to be over thirty years 
old, and no man could serve more than twice in his lifetime. It has been cal-
culated that sooner or later nearly every farmer would have to take his turn in 
this office. This might involve residence in the city since the Council met ev-
ery day. 
Lastly, the farmers provided the heavy armed infantry, the hoplites 
(o"J..ha,), of the army. On reaching manhood they would have to do military 
training, since fighting in a hoplite line involved much practice and good 
discipline. In the fourth century every citizen did two years military service 
from the age of eighteen and thereafter was liable to be called up in an emer-
gency. 
At the end of the first year of the great war between Athens and Sparta 
(about a year after our story begins), the Athenian leader Pericles made a fu-
neral oration over those who had been killed in the war. Most of his speech 
was devoted to praise of the ideals of Athenian democracy for which they had 
died. In the course of this he says: "The same people [i.e., the whole citizen 
body] are concerned not only with their domestic affairs but also with politics 
[i.e., the affairs of the city]; and although employed in different occupations, 
they are adequately informed on political matters. We alone consider a man 
who plays no part in these not as one who minds his own business but as use-
less" (Thucydides 2.40). The farmer's life under the Athenian democracy, 
despite primitive physical conditions, was far from drab.

Note: 
1. 
In the neuter singular the nominative, accusative, and vocative all 
end in -ov; in the plural these cases all end in -a. The other neuter 
case endings are the same as for the masculine. 
2. 
The genitive and dative, singular and plural, of the definite article 
have circumflex accents. 
3. 
When adjectives and nouns of the type seen above are accented on the 
final syllable in the nominative case (e.g., KaM<; and aypo<;), they 
change that accent to a circumflex in the genitive and dative, singu-
lar and plural (see Chapter 2, Grammar 6, page 20).

The acute accent can normally stand on the third syllable from the 
end of a word only when the final syllable has a short vowel (not a long 
vowel or a diphthong), thus, iivapm1to<;, iivapm1tov, and iiVapm1tE. The accent 
of nouns and adjectives is persistent (see Chapter 2, Grammar 6, pages 
20-21), which means that the accent remains as it is in the nominative 
case unless forced to change because of one of several rules. One ~il:ch 
rule is that when the final syllable of a word with its accent on the third 
syllable from the end in the nominative, such as iivapm1to<;, becomes long 
(i.e., has a long vowel or a diphthong), the accent shifts one syllable to-
ward the end of the word, thus the genitive and dative singulars, aVapOO1tOIl 
and aVapOO1lCp, and the genitive, dative, and accusative plurals. However, 
the masculine nominative plural ending -Ol, although a diphthong, is 
counted as short in determining the accent, and therefore the nominative 
plural is iiVapmnol. 
If a word is accented on the next to the last syllable and that syllable is 
long and the final syllable is short, then the accent is a circumflex, as in 
otKO<;, oh:ov, etc. When the final syllable becomes long, the accent changes 
to an acute, as in OtKou, otlCr.p, OtKIDV, OtKOtC;, and OtKO'U<;. Note OiKot.

What is said above about O\KO<; applies to verbs as well. Thus we have 
c",e"IlEt with an acute accent but the imperative (meilOE with a circumflex, 
since the final syllable is now short.

Menander of Athens (344-ca. 292 B.C.) wrote over 100 comedies of the type 
noW called New Comedy, concerned with the every-day life of ordinary Athe-
nians. One of his most famous sayings is the following (Twice a Swindler,

N.B. Verbs with stems ending in -E- (e.g., 'Pt"E-) are called contract 
verbs, because the vowel of the stem contracts with the vowel of the ending 
(remember that Et and 01) represent long vowels; see page xiv). You have 
observed this with verbs such as 'Pt"EOO from the beginning of the course. 
The following rules for contractions may be observed: 
1. E+OO>OO 
2. 
E+Et>£t 
3.E+E>" 
4.E+O>01) 
5. E+01»01) 
The reading passage above contains the following -E- contract verbs: 
KCt"et, 1tpoaxoopouatv, and aEoopEtV. Locate all examples of these verbs in the 
reading. 
The reading passage also contains examples of a contract verb of an-
other type, with stem ending in -0-, namely, the verb 1t"1\pooo, I fill. Locate 
three examples of this verb in the reading. For another example of a verb 
with its stem in -0-, see apou" (213:16). There are few verbs of this type, 
and their forms need not be learnef now but will be presented in Chapter 
15.

2. Declensions of Nouns and Adjectives 
Greek nouns and adjectives are divided into three groups or decle;'-
sions. In the reading passage at the beginning of this chapter are three 
feminine nouns (il 1<pTjVI], il uopia, and il MO.lna), which are said to belong 
to the 1st declension, which has nounS with stems that originally ended in 
-a or -a (this group of nouns is therefore sometimes called the alpha de-
clension). In nouns like il 1<pTjVI] , the original a of the stem has been 
changed to I] in the singular in Attic Greek. 
In Chapters 2 and 3 you saw charts of masculine and neuter nouns 
and adjectives (1<aAo<; aypa<; and KaAov oevopov) that are said to belong to 
the 2nd or omicron declension. 
Nouns such as avTjp, yuv", 9uya'l]p, and ~"'I]P, which you have met in 
the reading at the beginning of this chapter, are said to belong to the 3rd 
declension. The endings of 3rd declension nouns will be presented in 
Chapter 7; for the time being you can identify their case and number by 
observing the article that accompanies them. 
3. Feminine Nouns and Adjectives of the 1st Declension 
Most nouns of the 1st declension are feminine in gender. It is conve-
nient to divide them into the following four types (masculine nouns of the 
1st declension will be presented in the second half of this chapter). 
Type 1: r, X:P1)vlJ 
The original a of the stem has been changed to I] in the singular in 
Attic Greek:

Note: 
1. The genitive and dative, singular and plural, of the feminine definite 
article have circumflex accents, just as do those forms of the mascu-
line and neuter (see Chapter 3, Grammar 2, pages 31-32). 
2. When adjectives and nouns of the 1st declension are accented on the 
final syllable in the nominative case (e.g., KaATj), they change that 
accent to a circumflex in the genitive and dative, singular and plural 
(again, see Chapter 3, Grammar 2, pages 31-32, for the same thing 
with masculine and neuter adjectives and nouns). 
3. The accent of nouns and adjectives is persistent (see Chapter 2, 
Grammar 6, pages 20-21). However, in any Greek word, when the 
next to the last syllable is long and receives the accent and the final 
syllable is short, the next to the last syllable will have a circumflex 
instead of an acute accent (see Chapter 3, Grammar 3, page 32). The 
nominative plural ending -at, although a diphthong, is counted as 
short in determining the accent, thus KPiivat has a circumflex accent. 
Remember that the nominative plural ending of masculine nouns 
and adjectives of the 2nd declension, -01, is also counted as short (see 
Chapter 3, Grammar 3, page 32). 
4. The genitive plural of all 1st declension nounS has a circumflex ac-
cent on the final syllable; the original -amy ending contracted to -rov. 
Type 2: r, v{;p{ii 
After e, I, or p, the original -a of the stem was retained in Attic Greek: 
Nom. 
il 
uopia

The word Kapl], girl, is an exception to this rule; it has the same end-
ings as KpTjVI] above. 
Type 3: r, /leAlna 
A third group consists of nouns ending in -a, as MeAlna; as a com-
mon noun meaning bee, this noun is declined as follows: 
Nom. 
il 
~eAlna 
ai 
~eAlnal

Women 
When Pericles drew to the end of his funeral oration, he finally had a 
word for the widows of the dead: "If I should say a word on the duties of the 
wives who will now be widows, I will sum up the whole in a short piece of ad-
vice: your great glory is not to fall beneath the nature you have been given, 
and hers is the greatest glory who is least talked about among the men for 
praise or for blame." Women lived in the shadows of their men. This is 
clearly seen from their legal position; they were treated in law as minors, be-
ing under the tutelage of their fathers or guardians until they were married 
and thereafter under the tutelage of their husbands. They could not own 
property in their own right; they had no place in public life, no vote in the 
Assembly, and no seat on the juries. 
Their life centered on the oikos, and here they were important and re-
spected figures. The fourth century Athenian writer Xenophon in a work 
called Oikonomikos (which means "management,of the oikos," not "econom-
ics" in its modern sense) gives this advice to a young bride: 
Two girls, one holding a writing tablet 

44 
Athenaze: Book I 
Your business will be to stay indoors and help to dispatch the servants who 
work outside, while supervising those who work indoors. You will re-
ceive incoming revenue and allocate it to any necessary expenditure; you 
will be responsible for any surplus and see that the allocation for the 
year's expenses is not spent in a month. When wool is delivered to you, 
you will see that garments are made for those who need them, and you will 
take care that the dried grain is kept fit for consumption. And there is 
another of your duties that I'm afraid may seem to you rather thankless-
you will have to see that any of the servants who is ill gets proper treat-
ment. (Oikonomikos 7.35-37) 
The duties of a farmer's wife were similar, though instead of organizing 
slaves she had to do the work herself. The work was endless and gave women 
little leisure. 
Marriages took place early; a girl might be betrothed at five and married 
at fifteen, and marriages were arranged by parents, often with considera-
tions of property in mind. 
Nevertheless, Athenian art shows us many scenes of contented domestic 
life, and inscriptions testify to happy marriages: "In this tomb lies Chaere-
strate: her husband loved her while she was alive and grieved for her when 
she died" (G. Kaibel, Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conlecta, 44, 2-3, Pi-
raeus, fourth or third century B.C.). The husband was his wife's protector and 
kept her safe from the dangers of life that lay outside the oikos. Even in the 
house she had no contact with men outside the family; if strangers called, she 
would retire to the women's quarters. In the opening scene of Euripides' 
tragedy, Electra, Electra is talking to womeu of the village outside her house, 
when two strange men appear. She immediately says to the women: ''You flee 
down the path and I will take refuge in the house." Later her husband, a 
farmer, appears when she is talking to the men who claim to have brought 
news of her brother; he says: "Who are these strangers at our door? Why have 
they come to our country dwelling? Do they want me? (to Electra) It's a dis-
grace, you know, for a woman to stand around with young men." 
But women's lives were not as confined as we have so far suggested. They 
attended the religious festivals in both deme and city, including, probably, the 
dramatic festivals. They had important functions in religious rites; they 
were priestesses in more than forty public cults, and they formed choirs and 
played a leading role in processions. Some of the most powerful figures in 
Greek tragedy are women, and all three of the great tragedians, especially 
Euripides, show deep insight into the character of women and portray them 
sympathetically. Despite the restrictions that hedged her around, the Athe-
nian woman was no cipher. The sixth-century poet Semonides writes of the 
good woman: 
The gods made her of honey, and blessed is the man who gets her. His 
property flourishes and is increased by her. She grows old with a husband 
she loves and who loves her, the mother of a handsome and reputable fam-
ily. She stands out among all women, and a godlike beauty plays around

her. She takes no pleasure in sitting among women where they tell stories 
about love. (Semonides 7.83-91)

-Tj<; or -a<; in the nominative singular, in -ou in the genitive singular, 
and in -a or -a (or sometimes -Tj, not shown here) in the vocative singu-
lar. The ending -a<; occurs after stems ending in e, t, or p. Otherwise they 
have the same endings as tcpfJvTj and illipla. As examples, we give 0 lie-

Remember: 
1. The accent of adjectives is persistent, i.e., it stays where it is in the 
nominative masculine singular unless forced to move. 
2. 1st and 2nd declension adjectives with an acute accent on the ultima 
circumflex the genitive and dative singular and plural. 
3. Unlike nouns of the 1st declension, these adjectives do not circumflex 
the ultima of the genitive plural (e.g., p<;<OICOV) unless the accent is al-

7. FonnationofAdverbs 
Many adverbs may be formed in Greek by changing the last letter of 
the genitive plural of the corresponding adjective from v to " e.g.: 
KaArov > KaAro" beautifully; well 
Exercise 41 
Find five adverbs ending in -m, in the reading passage on pages 46-47. 
8. The Definite Article as Case Indicator 
Along with your study of 1st and 2nd declension nouns on pages 31 
and 40 you have learned all the forms of the definite article. Review them 
in the following chart: 
Nom. 
Gen. 
Singular 
M. 
F.

it 
too 
til, 
N. 
to

In your reading of Greek you should take full advantage of the defi-
nite article as a case indicator, which enables you to determine the case of 
nouns that you have not yet learned to decline. For example in the phrase 
tou avO po, the definite article tau tells you that avopo, is genitive singular. 
Remember that the vocative, which is not accompanied by the definite ar-
ticle, is usually preceded by .1. 
Exercise 4x:

GRAMMAR 
1. Contract Verbs in -(It-
In the story at the beginning of this chapter you have seen two contract 
verbs, ~oaco and apaco, with stems in -a- instead of in -e-, as were the 
contract verbs presented in earlier chapters. Contract verbs in -a- show 
their endings as follows (we use the verb tlJ.laCO, I honor, as a model): 
Stem: tlJ.la-, honor 
fudicative 
Imperative 
Infinitive 
Singular 
1st 
tLJ.HX-Ol > 
'tl/lro 
'ttl·ui-ttv > 'tt/l(Xv 
2nd 
tWa-et<; > 
tlJ.lq:S 
, 
'tiJ.LCi 
't'tllCX-e > 
3rd 
ttlla-n > 
"Ctll~ 
Plural 
1st 
tlJ.la-OJ.lev > 
tlJ.l&J.lev 
2nd 
'tt,.uX-E"CE > 
'ttIlCt"CE 
'tLI·UX-E'tE > 'tlJ.lCt'tE 
3rd 
tlJ.la-OUat(v) > tlJ.l&at(V) 
The following rules for these contractions may be observed: 
1. 
a + (0, 0, or ou > ro, 
2. a + et > 'f (the infinitive is an exception to this rule). 
3. a + e > iX. 
The third type of contract verbs:having stems in -0-, like 1tA.l1pOCO, I 
fill, will be presented in Chapter 15. There are few verbs ofthis type. 
2. Recessive Accent of Finite Verbs 
While the accents of nouns and adjectives are persistent (see Chapter 
2, Grammar 6, pages 20-21), the accents of finite forms of verbs (i.e., 
forms limited by person and number) are recessive (see Chapter 2, 
Grammar 7, page 21). This means that the accent of these forms recedes to 
5. 
0 
A Y K 0 L 
(a) 
the third syllable from the end of the word if the final syllable is short, but 
only to the second syllable from the end of the word if the final syllable is 
long. 
Thus, in the uncontracted form tWa-co the accent cannot stand on the 
third syllable from the end because the final syllable is long; it therefore 
stands on the second syllable from the end. In the uncontracted form 
tlJ.la-OJ.leV, however, the final syllable is short, and the accent recedes to the 
third syllable from the end. The uncontracted form of the singular im-
perative clearly shows how the rule operates; this is the only f~rm on the 
chart in which the accent falls on the first syllable of the verb: tlJ.la-e. 
When forms contract (as they do in the Attic dialect), an acute accent 
over the first of the vowels to contract becomes a circumflex over the re-
sulting contracted vowel, thus tlJ.la-CO > tlJ.l&. 
Study the charts of verbs in Chapter 4, Grammar 1, pages 38-39, and 
observe how these rules operate in the forms presented there, except in the 
enclitic forms of the verb to be, which by convention receive an acute on 
the final syllable in charts of forms. 
Exercise5a 
1. Locate seven -a- contract verb forms in the reading passage at the be-
ginning of this chapter. 
2. Make two photocopies of the Verb Chart on page 282 and fill in the pre-
sent indicative, imperative, and infinitive forms of f3oaco and opam. 
Keep these charts for reference.

3. Article at the Beginning of a Clause 
The article + lie is often used at the beginning of a clause to indicate a 
change of subject; the article is translated as a pronoun, e.g.: 
6 llEV o.f)V "ApyoC; UA£lK'tEt Kcd Ot(l:))CEt 'tOY 'Aayrov, 0 l5e q>euyet ava 'to opOC;. 
And so Argus barks and pursues the hare, but it (i.e., the hare) flees up 
the hill. 
6 oeO'n6tll<; 'tOY OOUAOV lCIXI\£1:, b oe au ~apE(J'ttv. 
The master calls the slave, but he is not present. 
o "ati]p ti]v KOpT]V Ka)"e1, i] liE taxeoos "poaxoopei. 
The father calls the girl, and she approaches quickly. 
4. Elision 
If a word ends in a short vowel, this vowel may be elided (cut oft) when 
the following word starts with a vowel, e.g., litex oA,(you > Ot' o),,(you. Note 
that the elision is marked by an apostrophe. Further examples; 
eXpa E8e)"ets > eXp' EEle)"ets 
a)"),,a loou > a),,),,' lliou 
If the following word begins with an aspirated vowel (Le., a vowel 
with a rough breathing), the consonant left after elision is itself aspirated 
if possible, i.e., " becomes <p, and t becomes 9. Thus: 
5. 
0 
A Y K 01: (a) 
alto 'E)"Mlios !.from Greece) > a<p' 'EUaoos 
l1eta i]11ii\v (with us) > l1e8' i]11ii\v 
Kata i]l1epiiv (by day = day by day, daily) > Ka8' i]l1epiiV 
59 
Kata o)"ou (on the whole, in general) > Ka8' OMU or K(86)"ou, which 
gives English catholic, "comprehensive, universal." 
Elision usually occurs when a compound verb is formed by prefixing 
a preposition that ends in a vowel to a verb that begins with a vowel, e.g.: 
ava- + a'(pro > Ctvaipro 
(11to- + EAauvro > CX1tEAauvro 
E:1tt- + a;tpro > budpro 
tlno- + atpeco > acpatpeOl 
1tapa- + Ei, .. Li > 1tapet~t 
Ka'tct- + oparo > Kcx90paco 
Exceptions: ""pt- and "po-, prefixes that you will meet later, do not elide, 
e.g., "ept- + opaoo > "eptopam, I overlook, disregard, and npo- + epxol1at > 
npoepxol1Ctt, I go forward, advance. 
Gods and Men 
When Dicaeopolis was about to start plowing, he first made a prayer to 
Demeter, goddess of grain. When he is about to take his family to Athens to 
the festival of Dionysus, god of wine, he first goes to the altar in the courtyard

Athenaze: Book I 
of his house and pours a libation (drink offering) to Zeus, father of gods and 
men. Religion permeated Greek life; prayer and offerings were daily obli-
gations. Hesiod, the eighth-century poet, says: 
Appease the immortal gods with libations and sacrifices, when you go to 
bed and when the holy light returns, so that they may have a kindly heart 
and spirit toward you, and you may buy other people's land and not have 
someone else buy yours. (Works and Days, 338-341) 
The Greeks were polytheists (that is, they worshiped many gods), and 
their religion was an amalgam of many elements. 
For instance, when 
Greek speakers first entered Greece from the north about 2,000 B.C., they 
brought with them as their principal deity Zeus the Father (ZEi,<; nomlP = Latin 
Iuppiter). The religion of the older inhabitants of Greece centered around a 
goddess, the Earth Mother, worshiped under various names, including 
Demeter. Eventually the various deities of different localities and different 
origins were united into the family of the twelve Olympian gods. They were 
called Olympian because they were thought to live on the top of the heavenly 
mountain Olympus, and each god had his (or her) special sphere of influence. 
Zeus was lord of the thunderbolt and father of gods and men; Hera was his 
wife and the patron goddess of women; Athena was his daughter and the god-
dess of wisdom and crafts; Apollo was the god of light, prophecy, and healing; 
Artemis, his sister, was a virgin huntress and goddess of the moon; Poseidon, 
Zeus' brother, was god of the sea; Aphrodite was goddess of love; Hermes was 
the messenger of the gods and bringer of good luck; Hephaestus was the god of 
fire and smiths; Ares was the god of war; Dionysus was the god of wine; and 
Demeter was the goddess of grain (for the Greek names, see page xix). Be-
sides the great Olympians, there were many lesser gods, such as Pan and the 
nymphs, and many foreign gods whose worship was introduced to Greece at 
various times and who joined the pantheon. 
There were in Greek religion no church, no dogma, and no professional 
full-time priests. Temples were built as the homes of the deity to which they 
were dedicated; no services were held inside, and the altar at which offerings 
were made stood in the open outside the temple. The gods were worshiped with 
prayer and offerings, both privately by the family and publicly by the deme 
and state at regnlar festivals recurring throughout the year. The usual offer-
ing in private worship was a libation of wine poured over the altar or a pinch 
of incense burnt in the altar fire. Public ritual culminated in animal sacri-
fice by the priest of the cult, often on a large scale, followed by a public ban-
quet. 
The gods were conceived in human form, and human characteristics 
were attributed to them. They were immortal, all powerful, and arbitrary. 
They were primarily interested not in the behavior of humans toward each 
other (morality) but in the maintenance of the honors due to themselves, and 
in this respect they were demanding and jealous. If you gave the gods the 
honors and offerings that were their due, you could expect them to repay you 
with their help and protection. At the beginning of Homer's Iliad, Chryses, 
r

whose daughter the Greeks have captured and refuse to return for ransom, 
prays to Apollo: 
Hearken to me, God of the Silver Bow, protector of Chryse and holy Cilia, 
mighty ruler of Tenedus, Smintheus, if ever I have built a temple pleasing 
to you, if ever I have burned the rich thighs of a bull or a goat for you, ful-
fill now my prayers: may the Greeks pay for my tears through your ar-
rows. 
Chryses prays to Apollo by two of his cult titles (the meaning of the second, 
Smintheus, is not known for certain) and three of the centers of his worship 
(the gods were not omnipresent, and Apollo might be resident in anyone of 
these places). Chryses reminds Apollo of past services and only then makes 
his request, that Apollo may punish the Greeks by striking them down with 
disease (Apollo's arrows brought sickness and death-since he was the god of 
healing, he was also the god who sent sickness). The prayer was answered, 
and the Greeks were struck by a plague.

are used at the beginning of clauses and in expressing contrasts, e.g.:

These forms are usually used after prepositions, e.g.: 
6 A.UKas 6pfli'f E1t' £~E. The wolf rushes at me.

refer to things, the gender of the pronoun depends on the gender of the 
noun to whic1t it refers, e.g.: 6 SavS(as a'(pet ,bv A.[Sov. d(pEt ai>~6v (He 
lifts it). The word au,6v is translated it, but it is masculine because it 
refers to the masculine noun A.(Sav. Translate the following examples:

7. Attributive and Predicate Position 
a. Attributive Position 
Note the position of the adjective in the following phrases: 
Both phrases mean the beautiful house. The adjective is said to be in 
the attributive position in these examples, in which it is placed either 
between the article and the noun or after the repeated article. 
b. Predicate Position 
In the following examples the adjective stands outside the article-
noun group. The following examples constitute complete sentences 
(note that the verb "to be" may be omitted in simple sentences of this 
sort), and the adjective is said to be in the predicate position. Both 
sentences mean The house is beautiful. 
8. Possessives 
The following possessive adjectives correspond to the personal pro-
nouns above: 
1st Person Singular 
e~6<;, -r,. -ov my, mine 
2nd Person Singular 
0'6e;. -r,. -ov your, yours 
Here are some examples: 
1st Person Plural 
11IlE'tEPOC;. -0:, -ov our, ours 
2nd Person Plural 
~1 .. lIhepo<;, -0;, -ov your, yours 
6 J,.lEV EJ.LOC; Kumv 'tOy A,{ncov ou.o1<£t, 6 oE KUroV 6 aoc; 1tpOC; 1:11 oOC? Kae{~El.

Our father works in the {ield, but your (father) is lazy. 
6 KUroV EJ.LOC; EO"'ttV, au O'oe;.

In the first two examples the possessive adjectives occupy the attributive 
position, while in the third they occupy the predicate position.

These possessive genitives occupy the predicate position, i.e., they stand 
outside the article-noun group to which they belong, and they refer to 
someone other than the subject ofthe verb (they are not reflexive), e.g.: 
6 mXrmoc; 1tpOC; 'tOY nutoa 'tpeXEt, 6 oE '[TtV Ilaxatpav a-o'tou Aa)l~avEt.

The boys stay in the field, but the fathers lead their (i.e., the boys') dogs 
home. 
The genitives of the personal pronouns (see above, Grammar 6, page 
65), used to indicate possession, also occupy the predicate position, e.g.: 
"au it" uio~ IlOU 0 aya1t11to<;." (Luke 3.22; see page 23) 
Note that Greek frequently does not use possessives if the possessor is 
the same as the subject of the verb, e.g.: 
o <!>iAI1t1tO<; tl]v ~uXCllpav Aall~aVEt !Cat tU1ttEl tOV AU1COv.

1. We no longer see many wolves in the hills, and they rarely 
(a1tavime;) come down (use Kampaivm) into the fields. 
2. So we are amazed that Philip has killed (&dK~OV£(V}) a wolf. 
3. The same boy guards the flocks well (eii), but he does not always speak 
(say) the truth «a .xATjOi]).

j. Greek Wisdom 
The Seven Wise Men 
The Greeks recognized seven "wise men" or "sages" Campoi), who lived in 
the early decades of the sixth century B.C. To each was attached a piece of 
proverbial wisdom, which is quoted on the page of this book to which reference 
is made opposite each name in the following list (the names are given in the 
order in which they were listed in antiquity): 
0a;l,.iie; (of Miletus)

Classical Greek 
Anacreon 
Anacreon of Teos (fl. 535 B.C.) was a lyric poet, whose work included 
many love poems. Long after his death, a collection of poems was published 
that were written in his style and called Anacreontea, including the follow-
ing (no. 34), written to a cicada (,en;:~), a type of Mediterranean grasshopper.

2. Verbs: Voice 
a. Active Voice 
You have met many verbs that are active in voice and take direct 
objects, e.g.: 
6 M;:vom~"po<; EaOiEt UVBpOlllOIl<;. 
The Minotaur eats men. 
b. Passive Voice 
Sentences of this sort can be turned around so that the direct object 
becomes the subject, e.g.: 
Men are eaten by the Minotaur. 
The verb is now said to be passive in voice, and the subject of the sen-
tence is acted on rather than being the actor. The passive voice of 
Greek verbs will be presented later in this course. 
c. Middle Voice 
In Greek, verbs may be in a third voice termed middle. The mid-
dle voice is often reflexive, denoting that the subject acts on or for it-
self, e.g.: 
Active: 
Middle: 
6 na'i<; 'tov lCuva AOUEt. 
The boy washes the dog. 
o na'i<; AouE'tal. 
The boy washes himself or The boy washes. 
In this case the subject is thought of as acting on itself, and the verb in 
the middle voice implies a reflexive direct object in the accusative 
case, himself. The middle voice verb here can also be translated as 
intransitive, with no direct object, simply, The boy washes. 
Here is another set of similar examples: 
Active: 
it Muppiv1l 'tOY av8pa E'YEiPEt. 
Myrrhine wakes up her husband. 
Middle: 
6 dllem6nOAt, £yeipuat. 
Dicaeopolis wakes himselfuplwakes up. 
In the above examples, the middle voice verbs are reflexive 
accusative sense. 
Verbs in the middle voice, however, may also be transitive 
take direct objects: 
Active: 
6 nat, ~O apo~pov <pEpel. 
The boy carries the plow. 
with 
and 

76 
Athenaze: Book I 
Middle: 
0 1tatS '" &BA.oV cp£p£~al. 
The boy carries off the prize for himself 
The boy wins the prize. 
Here the subject is thought of as acting for itself, in its own interests, 
to its own advantage, and the verb, which takes a direct object, is re-
flexive with an implied dative of reference, for himself 
In the above example, the middle voice verb is reflexive with da-
tive sense. 
Verbs in the middle voice may occasionally have a causative 
sense. Here the subject of the verb causes someone else to do some-
thing. Compare the following sentences: 
Active: 
o1tatS A.{;n 'OUS ~OUS. 
The boy looses/frees the oxen. 
Middle: 
0 1ta,~p '''v 1tatOa A{;£~al. 
The father causes his son to be set free. 
The father ransoms his son. 
3. Verb Forms: Middle Voice 
Verbs in the middle voice can easily be recognized from their end-
ings, which are different from the endings of the active voice that you 
learned in Chapters 1-5. Almost any verb can be used in the middle 
voice, and as samples of verbs in the middle, we will use our familiar A.,]co 
and 'IltA.ECO. As shown above, A.;}co in the middle voice may mean I ransom. 
In the case of the verb CP1A.ECO there is no real difference in meaning be-
tween the active and middle voices; they are both transitive, and they both 
mean I love (someone or something). The verb ,Waco is used in the mid-
dle voice as a legal term in estimating or proposing a penalty; you may 
meet it later when reading Plato's Apology. 
In the following sets of forms note the thematic or variable vowels (0 or 
e) between the verb stem and the endings. In the second person singular 
indicative and the singular imperative, the a between the two vowels 
(intervocalic sigma) is lost, and the vowels then contract: e + at> £1 or 11, 
and e + 0> au. The diphthong at in the endings below is counted as short 
in determining placement of accents, e.g., A.,]-O-lla1.

Athenaze: Book I 
Remember that when contraction takes place, an acute accent over the 
first of the vowels to contract becomes a circumflex over the resulting 
contracted vowel (see Chapter 5, Grammar 2, page 57), and remember that 
et and 01l represent long vowels (see page xiv); thus in the chart above 
'PtA.E-O-~at > 'PtA.OU~aL An acute accent over the second of two vowels that 
contract remains acute in the contracted form, thus in the chart above 
'PtA.e-6-~Eea > 'PtA.OU~Eea. 
Explain the accents in each of the forms above. Remember that the 
diphthong at is counted as short in these forms. 
4. DeponentVerbs 
There are many Greek verbs that have some of their forms only in the 
middle voice; they are said to be deponent, as if they had "put aside" (Latin 
deponere) or lost their active forms. In the vocabulary list and the first 
reading passage in this chapter you have met the following deponent 
verbs: 
acptKVeO~at, I arrive; + eL; + ace., I arrive at 
POUA.O~at + infin., I want; I wish 
ytyvo~at, I become 
ytyvemt, he I she I it becomes; it happens 
SeXO~at, I receive 
EpXO~at, I come; I go 
anEpXO~at, I go away 
These verbs have no active forms. The verbs nEieO~at and 'POPEO~at, how-
ever, which have similar endings, do not belong in this list because they 
may be used in the active voice and therefore are not deponent: nEieco = I 
persuade X, and 'POPECO = I put X to flight; I terrify X. 
Exercise6a 
Locate thirteen verbs in the middle voice in the reading passage at the be-
ginning of this chapter, and translate the sentences in which they occur. 
Identify the verbs that are deponent. 
Exercise6~ 
Make three photocopies of the Verb Chart on page 2B2 and fill in the present 
indicative, imperative, and infinitive forms of the deponent verbs 
y{yvo!'al and arp'KV80!,a, and the forms of the verb op!,ao!,a" I hasten, which 
you will meet in the next chapter. Write only the contracted forms. Keep 
these charts for reference.

Myth 
The Greek word J.luSO, means story, and the Greeks were great story-
tellers. Many of the stories were of immemorial antiquity, told to all chil-
dren at their mothers' knees. There were stories about the times before man 
existed at all, about times when men and gods were on much closer terms 
than they are today, and about the gods and the heroes of old. The myths in-
cluded stories of widely differing types. Some, like the creation myths, were 
concerned exclusively or primarily with the gods. 
For instance, Hesiod 
(Works and Days 42-105) relates how the demigod Prometheus, in pity for 
mankind, stole fire from heaven and gave it to man: . 
Zeus the Cloud-Gatherer, angry with Prometheus, said to him: 
"Prometheus, wise beyond all others, you are very pleased to have stolen 
fire and to have deceived me, but it shall be a cause of suffering both to you 
and to men to come. In return for the theft of fire, I shall give them a great 
evil, in which they shall all rejoice, hugging to themselves their own trou-
ble." So spoke the Father of men and gods and laughed aloud. He ordered 
Hephaestus with all speed to mix earth and water, to put in it the speech 
and strength of a human, and in face to give it the fair, delightful form of 
a young girl like the immortal goddesses. He told Athena to teach it crafts 
to enable it to weave the rich web on the loom; he told golden Aphrodite to 
pour over its head grace aud troublesome desire and pains that melt the 
limbs; but he bade Hermes put in it the mind of a dog and a deceitful 
character. 
The gods and goddesses did as they were told, and Hermes called the 
woman Pandora, "because all (1tav",,) the gods who live on Olympus gave 
(Elirop1]crav) her a gift (liiOpov) for men who eat bread." 
The Father sent the swift messenger of the gods, who took the gift to 
Epimetheus (Prometheus's brother). Epimetheus did not reflect on how 
Prometheus had told him never to accept a gift from Olympian Zeus but to 
send it back, lest it bring some evil to mortals. After he had received the 
evil, he remembered. 
Athena decks out Pandora before sending her to Epimetheus. 

82 
Athenaze: Book I 
Before this men lived on earth free from troubles and hard toil and the 
grievous diseases that bring destruction. 
But the woman took the lid off the great jar and scattered the contents, and 
so she brought suffering on the people. Hope alone remained inside in her 
indestructible home beneath the rim of the jar and did not fly out, for Pan-
dora put the lid back before Hope could escape, through the will of Zeus the 
Cloud-Gatherer. Countless troubles roam among the people. The earth is 
full of evils, and full is the sea. Diseases come upon men in the day and 
others come at night, bringing suffering to mortals, silently, since Zeus 
has taken from them the power of speech. It is impossible to escape the will 
of Zeus. 
This myth offers an explanation of why men suffer diseases and other 
troubles. (Why, for instance, should men have to work for their food? In the 
Golden Age earth produced all manner of food spontaneously.) The story is 
told in allusive style: Pandora takes the lid off a great jar, from which all 
troubles fly out, but we are told nothing about this jar or about how it got there 
and why Pandora took the lid off. Hesiod's audience presumably knew the 
story, and he had no need to ten them. Nor is it clear why Hope is said to re-
main in the jar. Is the human condition hopeless? 
Other myths are based on history or what the Greeks believed to be history. 
The story of Theseus and the Minotaur falls into this class. Theseus was an 
early king of Athens, around whom a whole cycle of myths crystalized. He 
belonged to the generation before the Trojan War and was thought to be re-
sponsible for the unification of Attica. Minos, king of Knossos in Crete, was 
also believed to be a historical figure. Thucydides discusses the extent of his 
sea-power in the introduction to his history. Labyrinthos means in the an-
cient Cretan language House of the Double Axe, which may have been the 
name of the great palace at Knossos, where the double axe frequently appears 
as a religious symbol. The large size and complicated plan of this palace 
may account for the change in meaning of the word labyrinth to its later sense 
of "maze." Bull-jumping played an important part in Cretan ritual and is 
often portrayed in works of Cretan art. The bull-jumpers may well have been 
young captives taken from Athens and other places. We thus find in the myth 
of Theseus historical elements strangely transmuted in the course of time. 
In another foreign adventure, Theseus is said to have accompanied Hera-
cles on an expedition to fight the Amazons, a race of female warriors living 
on the south shore of the Black Sea; according to some accounts, Theseus led 
the expedition himself. He captured the queen of the Amazons and brought 
her back to Athens, but the Amazons came in pursuit and laid siege to Athens. 
They were defeated, but the queen of the Amazons bore Theseus a child, 
named Hippolytus, who was destined to be the cause of much sorrow for The-
seus. 
The myth of Odysseus and the Cyclops (Chapter 7) is taken from Homer's 
Odyssey, which is mainly concerned with the adventures of Odysseus during 
his journey home to Ithaca from Troy. It illustrates a third strand often found

in Greek myth: folk tale. The story of the little man who outwits a one-eyed 
man-eating giant is found in the folk tales of many other peoples, and t~e 
whole structure of the story as told by Homer shows the symmetry common In 
folk tales. 
The making of myths seems to be a universal human activity, and myths 
are said to enshrine the corporate wisdom of primitive peoples. Their inter-
pretation remains a vexed question, on which no two scholars agree. The 
strands that go to form the corpus of Greek myth are so many and various that 
any attempt to form general rules for their in~erpretation seems dOOl~ed to 
failure. However we look at them, they are stories that have caught the Imag-
ination of Western man throughout recorded history.

6. Some Uses of the Dative Case 
a. The indirect object of verbs of giving, showing, and telling is in the 
dative case, e.g., oihoo yap ~ip MlvQ)~aup<p <Jhov napExou<JtV = In this 
way they supply food to the Minotaur or In this way they supply the 
Minotaur with food. Here the word <Jl'ov is the direct object of the verb 
napexou<Jw, and the words '0 Mtvootaup<jl are the indirect object. 
b. The dative case may be used with linking verbs, such as t<J,f(v) and 
yfyv,"ott, to indicate the person who possesses something, e.g., e<J~tv 
a,,~ip nalS ns 6voJ.lan 8TJ<JEUS, lit., there is for him a child. . . . = he 
has a child . ... This is called the dative of the possessor. 
c. The Greek sentence in b above shows another use of the dative case, the 
dative of respect: bvoJ.lan 8TJ<JeuS, lit., Theseus with respect to his 
name = called Theseus. 6 Mtvono<upos oewoe; t<Jnv OljlEt Kat IpQ)VU = 
The Minotaur is terrible with respect tolin appearance and voice. 
d. The dative case may be used to indicate the means or instrument by 
which an action is carried out, e.g., ~U J.lEv yap apt<J~Ep~ AaJ.l~avE~ott 
,fie; ~oii IlTJpfou KEcpaAfie;, ~U oE OE~t~ ,0 <J'fiSoe; ,un"t = with his left hand 
he takes hold of the head of the beast, and with his right hand he strikes 
its chest. 
e. The dative case may be used to indicate the time when an action takes 
place, e.g., ~U ;'<J~Epa{'i' = on the next day. Note that the Greek does 
not use a preposition here. 
f. The dative case is used after certain prepositions, especially those that 
indicate the place where someone or something is or something hap-
pens, e.g., EV -en apt<J'tepCf and 1tpO~ 'tn vllt 
g. The dative case is used with certain verbs, e.g.: Ot ~oee; ~ip aypip 
np0<Jxoopoii<Jtv = the oxen approach the field. 
Your English translation will use a direct object in the accusative 
case, e.g., 6 Atyeue; nefSe,at a,,~ip = Aegeus obeys him; ene<JSE J.lOt 
avopefooe; = follow me bravely; and l]YEltat a,,~o'ic; etc; ~av Aa~UptVSov = 
he leads them into the labyrinth. 
Verbs that take the dative case: 
gnoJ.lott, I follow 
~oTJS£oo, I come to (someone's) aid 
i]y£OJ.l(>:l, I lead 
nefSoJ.l{](t, I obey 
np0<JXOOp£oo, I go toward, approach

7. Prepositions 
While, as seen above, prepositions that take the dative case usually re-
fer to the place where someone or something is or where some action takes 
place, prepositions that take the genitive often express ideas of place from 
which, and prepositions that take the accusative often express ideas of 
place to which. Observe the following examples that have been given in 
the vocabulary lists so far: 
With genitive: ano, from; t1(/t~, out of; J.le,a, with (with this last ex-
ample there is no sense of motion from a place) 
With dative: EV, in; on; bti, upon, on; 7tpOC;, at, near, by; uno, under 
With accusative: ava, up; EiC;, into; to; at; E1ti, at; against; KQ'ta, 
down; ~E'ta, after; 1tpOC;, to, toward; imo, under

New Testament Greek 
Luke 13.10-16 
We begin with an English translation of the first verses of the passage: 
Jesus was teaching in a syoagogue on the sabbath and cured a woman who 
had been bowed by an infirmity for eighteen years. He laid his hands on her 
and said, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity," and immediately 
she stood up straight. But the ruler of the syoagogue, objecting because Jesus 
had cured her on the sabbath day, said to the crowd: 
"ilS it~epott eialv EV ate; Oet EpyaSea6at· EV a'''ot'e; oilv Epx6~evot Sepa7tEUEaSe

bound for eighteen years, should she not have been freed from this bond on the 
sabbath day?"

WORD STUDY 
Identify the Greek stems in the English words below and give the meanings 
of the English words: 
1. myth 
2. mythology 
3 . polytheist 
(what does 6 8EOs mean?) 
4. pantheist 
(what does n(Xv mean?) 
GRAMMAR 
1. Substantive Use of Adjectives 
5. monotheist (what does 1l0VOS mean?) 
6. atheist (what does a- mean?) 
7. theology 
Adjectives, especially in the plural, are often used as substantives, 
thus functioning as nouns, and can be translated by supplying words such 
as "men," ('women," or "things," depending on the gender of the adjective, 
e.g.: 
£V aE 'ii 60ijl "o~~o;,S 6pro1lEV. 
We see many (men) on the road. 
"pOS 'i]v Kpf]VTjV no~~at "apiaS <pepo1l(Hv. 
Many (women) are carrying water jars to the spring. 
£V aE 'li baijlno~~a Kat liewa nucrxo1l(HV. 
On the journey they suffer many terrible (things). 
Note also that Greek uses the conjunction Kai here, while English does not 
use a connective.

2. Nouns: Declensions 
As you have seen, Greek nouns are divided into three large groups or 
declensions. You have already studied nouns of the 1st or alpha declen-
sion (e.g., 11 lCPTtVll. ft uopta, ft ).!EAt't'tU. ft llaXo:tpo:, b OE:cr7tO't1lC;, b 3IXvetac;, and 6 
veavias) and of the 2nd or omicron declension (e.g., 6 aypoS and ,0 
oevlipov). Nouns of the 1st declension are feminine, except for those whose 
nominatives end in -1l~ or -at;. such as 6 3ecrrco-t11<;, 6 Eav8{a<;, and 6 veCtviuc;; 
most nouns of the 2nd declension are masculine (e.g., 6 aypOS), a few are 
feminine (e.g., iJ 606s, i] vilaos, and iJ nap8evos), and some are neuter (e.g., 
,0 oevopov). 
The 3rd declension has many nouns of all three genders, and it is not 
easy to predict the gender from the ending of the nominative singular, as 
it is with 1st and 2nd declension nouns. Some 3rd declension nouns can 
be either masculine or feminine, such as 6 or it n(Xtt;, boy; girl; son; 
daughter; child. 
The stems of 3rd declension nouns end in a consonant or in vowels or 
diphthongs. Nouns of the 3rd declension can be recognized by the ending 
-os or -OlS in the genitive singular, e.g., nats, genitive, natOOS and nOAtS, 
genitive, no~eOl~. By removing the genitive singular ending, you find 
the stem, e.g., "'ltO-. 
To help you identify the declension to which a noun belongs and to 
help you determine the stem of 3rd declension nouns, we will henceforth 
list nouns in the vocabulary lists with their nominative and genitive 
forms, as follows: 
1st Declension: 
(stems in -a or -a) 
2nd Declension: 
(stems in -0) 
3rd Declension: 
i] Kpf]VTj, 'tils Kpf]VTjS, spring 
i] ;'Spia, 'tils ;'opiaS, water jar 
i] lleAt"a, 'tils lle~i"TjS, bee 
i] IlUXatpa, 'ils Ilaxaipas, knife 
6 oeO"1to'tT\<;. 'tou BeanO-tau, master 
6 vEaviaC;, t!pu veO;v{ou, young man 
6 aypoS, ,oil aypoil, field 
i] 606S, 'ils ~aoil, road; way; journey 
,0 oEvapov, foil aevapou, tree 
e or it reate;, 'tou or t11<; rc<Xt86C;, boy; girl; son; 
daughter; child 
i] no~tS, 'ils no~eOlS, city 
3. 3rd Declension Consonant Stem Nouns: Velar and Dental Stems 
The stems of many 3rd declension nouns end in consonants . You 
frod the stem by dropping the -os ending from the genitive singular. The 
3rd declension endings shown in the chart of forms below are then added 
to the stem.

Note that the vocatives are the same as the nominatives. Note that in 
the nominative and vocative singular and the dative plural the lC of the 
stem and the ,/cr of the ending produce the combination of sounds repre-
sented by the letter S (see page xv). And note that, as is the case with most 
nouns, the accent is persistent; in the genitive plural the accent cannot 
stand on the third syllable from the end because the final syllable is long 
(see Chapter 3, Grammar 3, page 32).

Note that monosyllabic nouns of the 3rd declension usually have an 
accent on the final syllable of the genitive and dative cases, singular and 
plural. Note that the vocatives are the sanie as the nominatives. Note that 
in the nominative and vocative singular and the dative plural the y and 
9cr produce the combination of sounds represented by the letter S. And note 
the circumflex accent over the diphthong of the stem when it is accented 
and followed by a short syllable (see Chapter 3, Grammar 3, page 32).

Remember that all dental stops are lost before cr (see page xv); thus in 
the nominative singular and the dative plural of nat, the eS is lost before 
the 9cr of the endings. The vocative singular is the stem without the -eS (all 
stop consonants are lost in word-final position; the only consonants with 
which Greek words can end are v, p, " or one of the double consonants S 
and '1'). Note that while monosyllabic nouns of the 3rd declension usually 
have an accent on the final syllable of the genitive and dative cases, sin-
gular and plural (see a ats on the opposite page), in this word the accent of 
the genitive plural is persistent and remains on the first syllable. 
PRACTICE: Write the complete set of the forms of iJ eA.n'" TIl, l:A.n(eSo" 
hope. 
The following is an example of a neuter dental-stem noun of the 3rd 
declension. Note the ways in which it is similar to and different from the 
masculine/feminine nouns above:

Remember that in neuter nouns the nominative, accusative, and 
vocative singular forms are identical, as are the corresponding plural 
forms, which end in a as do 2nd declension neuters. Third declension 
neuter nouns do not add, to the stem in the nominative singular as do 
masculine and feminine velar and dental stem nouns. Instead, the, of 
the stem is lost (see above), as it also is before the cr of the dative plural end-
ing. The vocative singular is the stem without the -, (cf. a; "at).

pronouns creautov, yourself, and EautOV, himself, are called reflexive 
since they are used to refer to or reflect the subject of the verb. Usually in 
English we use a word ending in -self to translate reflexive pronouns, but 
note the following example in lines 21-22 of the first story in this chapter: 
ocb8EKa otiv trov Eta{prov KEAEuet e<xut41 'nw8at, and so he orders twelve 
of his companions to follow him. 
Reflexive pronouns combine elements of the personal pronouns (see 
Chapter 5, Grammar 6, page 65) with the intensive adjective <X!ltOe; (see 
Chapter 5, Grammar 9, page 6B), thus crE,YOU + autov, self> crEaUtOv,your-
self. 
In the 1st and 2nd persons, the reflexive pronouns have masculine 
and feminine forms only; in the 3rd person there are neuter forms as 
well. There are no nominatives.

Homer 
The earliest poems in Western lit-
erature (and according to some, the 
greatest) are the Iliad and the 
Odyssey. These are epics, that is to 
say, long narrative poems; each of the 
poems contains twenty-four books, the 
books varying in length from 450 to 
900 lines. They tell stories about the 
age of the heroes, and both center upon 
the Trojan War. 
The Iliad tells the story of the 
wrath of Achilles, the greatest of the 
Greek heroes who fought at Troy. 
Homer 
After besieging Troy for nine years, Achilles and Agamemnon, leader of 
the Greek host, quarrel at an assembly of the army. Agamemnon takes away 
Achilles' prize, a captive girl whom he loves. Thus insulted, Achilles refuses 
to fight any longer and stays by his ships, with disastrous consequences for 
both himself and the rest of the Greeks. 
Without his help the Greeks suffer heavy losses and are driven back to 
their ships. Achilles still refuses to fight but is at last persuaded to allow his 
closest friend, Patroclus, to lead his men into battle. Only when Patroclus

has been killed by Hector, the greatest of the Trojan heroes, does Achilles turn 
his anger from Agamemnon and fight against the Trojans. To avenge the 
death of Patroclus, he leads his men into battle, causing terrible carnage. He 
sweeps the Trojans back into the city and kills Hector in single combat before 
the walls of Troy, even knowing that with Hector's death his own death is 
imminent. He then ties the corpse of Hector behind his chariot and drags it in 
front of the walls of Troy before the eyes of Hector's father, Priam, and his 
mother and wife. 
Achilles' anger does not cease until the aged Priam, alone and at night, 
makes his way through the Greek camp to Achilles' tent and begs him to re-
turn the body of Hector for burial. Achilles, overcome by pity for the old man, 
consents and allows a truce for his burial. 
The Odyssey tells the story of the return of Odysseus from Troy to his 
home in Ithaca. The plot is more complex than that of the Iliad. It starts in 
Ithaca, where Penelope, Odysseus's wife, has been waiting for twenty years 
for her husband's return (Odysseus was fighting before Troy for ten years 
and spent another ten on the journey home). She is beset by suitors who are 
competing for her hand and the kingdom. Her son, Telemachus, sets out to 
look for his father, who, he believes, is still alive. 
Odysseus, meanwhile, is held captive by a nymph, Calypso, on a far-off 
island. She is at last persuaded by the gods to let him go and helps him build a 
raft. He sails off, only to be wrecked on the island of Phaeacia. Here the king 
receives him kindly, and at a banquet given in his honor Odysseus recounts 
the adventures he has undergone since he left Troy. The Phaeacians load 
him with gifts and take him home to Ithaca, where they leave him sleeping on 
the shore. The second half of the Odyssey tells how he returned to his palace 
disguised as a beggar and with the help of Telemachus and a faithful servant 
slew the suitors arid was reunited with Penelope. 
The Greeks attributed both of these great poems to Homer. Scholars have 
shown that the poems are in fact the culmination of a long tradition of oral po-
etry, that is of poetry composed without the aid of writing. The tradition proba-
bly originated in the Bronze Age, and in every succeeding generation poets 
retold and embroidered the stories about the heroes. Finally, Homer com-
posed these two great poems, which are on a far larger scale than oral poetry 
usually is, in an age when writing had just been reintroduced to Greece. 
The internal evidence of the Iliad suggests that it was composed between 
750 and 700 B.C. in Ionia. Modern scholars are not agreed on whether the 
Odyssey was composed by the same poet; there are considerable differences 
in style and tone between the two poems. Both poems show characteristics of 
oral poetry that make them very different from literary poetry. They were 
composed to be recited or sung aloud to the accompaniment of the lyre. The 
stories themselves, the recurrent themes, and a large proportion of the actual 
lines are traditional, but the structure of the poems, the clear and consistent 
characterization of the leading figures, and the atmosphere of each poem, 
tragic in the Iliad, romantic in the Odyssey, are the creation of a single poet.

GRAMMAR 
1. Participles: Present or Progressive: Middle Voice 
In addition to the indicative mood, the imperative, and the infinitive, 
which you have studied so far in this course, verbs have adjectival forms 
known as participles (verbal adjectives). These may be used in several 
ways: 
a. Participles may describe some circumstance that accompanies the 
main action of the sentence, e.g.: 
6 OOUA.DC; tip OE<J1tOtT\ £7toflEvo<; to apotpov 'PEpet. 
The slave, following his master, carries the plow. 
'tOY 1t(X1t7tOV OprocHv EV 'tip 1CTtnq> ep'Ya~6J.LEVoV. 
They see the grandfather as/while he is working in the garden. 
This use is called circumstantial; the participle is in the predicate po-
sition (see Chapter 5, Grammar 7b, page 66), and it agrees with the 
noun it modifies in gender, number, and case. 
8. 
II POL 
TO 
A L T Y (a) 
115 
b. Participles in the attributive position (see Chapter 5, Grammar 7a, 
page 66) may simply modify nouns or pronouns like any other adjec-
tive, agreeing in gender, number, and case. When so used, they are 
called attributive, e.g.: 
0; autoupyo, 0; £V tip ciypip Epya~oflEVOt flUA.a lCUI1VOUatv. 
The farmers working in the field are very tired. 
c. Participles may be used to complete the meaning of a verb, e.g.: 
6 OOUA.o<; ou ~aUEtm Epya~oJ-LEVoC;. 
The slave does not stop working. 
This use is called supplementary, since the participle fills out or com-
pletes the meaning of the verb. The participle agrees with the stated or 
implied subject of the verb in gender, number, and case. 
Present participles do not refer to time as such but describe the action 
as in process, ongoing, or progressive. 
The sentences above contain participles of deponent verbs, which have 
their forms in the middle voice. The following charts give the full sets of 
forms of present / progressive middle participles. Each form has a stem, a 
thematic vowel (0), the suffix -flEV-, and an ending. The endings, which 
indicate gender, number, and case, are the same as those of 1st and 2nd 
declension adjectives such as KaA.Oc;, -1\, -6v (see page 48).

Athens: A Historical Outline 
1. The Bronze Age 
Athens grew around the Acropolis, the rocky hill that rises precipitously 
in the middle of the later city. Archaeologists have shown that in the Bronze 
Age the Acropolis was fortified and was crowned by a palace, which was no 
doubt the administrative center of the surrounding district, like the palaces at 
Mycenae and Pylos. Tradition says that Theseus united Attica in the genera-
tion before the Trojan War, but in the Iliad there is scant mention of Athenian 
heroes, and this suggests that Athens was not an important center in the 
Bronze Age. 
2. TheDarkAge 
Bronze Age civilization collapsed soon after the end of the Trojan War, 
about 1200 B.C. In the troubles that ensued, the so-called Dorian invasions, 
Athens, according to tradition, was the only city not sacked. Certainly, in 
this period Athens grew in size, and we are told that the emigration (ca. 1050 
B.C.) that peopled the islands and coast of Asia Minor with Greeks was from 
Athens, which later claimed to be the mother city of all Ionian settlements. 
3. The Renaissance of Greeee (ca. 850 B.C.) 
As Greece slowly recovered from the Dark Age, population increased, and 
other states sent out colonies that peopled much of the Mediterranean coast 
from southern France to the Black Sea (750-500 B.C.). Athens played no part 
in this movement and seems not to have experienced those problems that led to 
emigration from other parts of Greece.

Athenaze: Book I 
4. The Reforms of Solon 
Monarchy had been succeeded by the rule of the nobles, who oppressed the 
farmers until revolution threatened. In this crisis the Athenians chose an 
arbitrator named Solon (chief archon in 594/593 B.C., but his reforms may 
date to twenty years later), who worked out a compromise between the conflict-
ing interests of the nobles and farmers. Solon was not only a statesman but a 
poet, and in a surviving fragment (5) of his poetry he defends his settlement: 
To the people I gave as much power as was sufficient, 
Neither taking from their honor nor giving them excess; 
As for those who held power and were envied for their wealth, 
I saw that they too should have nothing improper. 
I stood there casting my sturdy shield over both sides 
And allowed neither to conquer unjustly. 
His settlement included important economic reforms, which gave the farmer 
a new start, and constitutional reforms, which paved the way for the later 
democracy. It was he who divided the citizens into four classes according to 
property qualifications and gave appropriate rights and functions to each; in 
this way, wealth, not birth, became the criterion for political privilege, and the 
aristocratic monopoly of power was weakened. 
5. Tyranny-Pisistratus 
Solon's settlement pleased neither side, and within half a generation, a 
tyrant, Pisistratus, seized power and ruled off and on for 33 years (561-528 
B.C.). Under his rule Athens flourished; the economy improved, the city was 
adorned with public buildings, and Athens became a greater power in the 
Greek world. His son, Hippias, succeeded him but was driven out in 510 B.C. 
6. Cleisthenes and Democracy 
Three years later Cleisthenes put through reforms that made Athens a 
democracy, in which the Assembly of all male citizens was sovereign. The 
infant democracy immediately faced a crisis. Hippias had taken refuge with 
the King of Persia, whose empire now reached the shores of the Aegean and 
included the Greek cities of Ionia. In 499 the Ionians revolted and asked the 
mainland cities for help. Athens sent a force, which was highly successful 
for a short time, but the revolt was finally crushed in 494 B.C. 
7. The Persian Wars 
In 490 B.C. the Persian king Darius sent an expedition by sea to conquer 
and punish Athens. It landed on the east coast of Attica at Marathon. After an 
anxious debate, the Athenians sent their army to meet the Persians and won a 
spectacular victory, driving the Persians back to their ships. Athens alone 
defeated this Persian expedition; it was a day the Athenians never forgot, and 
it filled the new democracy with confidence. (See map, page 230.)

Ten years later Darius's son, 
Xerxes, assembled a vast fleet and 
army with the intention of conquer-
ing all Greece and adding it to his 
empire. 
The Greeks mounted a 
holding operation at Thermopylae 
(August, 480 B.C.), before abandon-
ing all Greece north of the Pelopon-
nesus, including Attica. 
Athens 
was evacuated and sacked by the 
Persians, but in September the com-
bined Greek fleet, inspired by the 
Athenian general Themistocles, de-
feated the Persian fleet off the island 
of Salamis. Xerxes, unable to supply 
his army without the fleet, led a re-
treat to Asia, but he left a force of 
100,000 men in the north of Greece 
under the command of Mardonius 
with orders to subdue Greece the fol-
lowing year. In spring, 479 B.C., the 
Greek army marched north and met 
and defeated the Persians at 
Plataea; on the same day, according 
to tradition, the Greek fleet attacked 
and destroyed the remains of the 
Persian navy at Mycale in Asia 
Minor. 
8. The Delian League and the Athenian Empire 
Persian soldiers 
119 
These victories at the time seemed to the Greeks to offer no more than a 
respite in their struggle against the might of the Persian Empire. Many out-
lying Greek cities including the islands and the coasts of the Aegean, were 
still held by the P~rsians. In 478 B.C. a league was formed at the island of De-
los of cities that pledged themselves to continue the fight against Persia under 
Athenian leadership. 
. 
The Delian League under the Athenian general Cimon won a s,:r.,es. of 
victories and only ceased fighting when the Persians accepted humIlIatmg 
peace terms in 449 B.C. Meanwhile what had started as a league of fre.e a~d 
independent states had gradually developed into an Atheman empIre. m 
which the allies had become subjects. Sparta was alarmed by the growmg 
power of Athens, and these fears led to an intermittent war in wI;ich S~arta 
and her allies (the Peloponnesian League) fought Athens in a serIes of mde-
cisive actions. This first Peloponnesian war ended in 446 B.C., when Athens 
and Sparta made a thirty years' peace.

9. Pericles and Radical Democracy 
In this period Pericles dominated Athens; from 443 until he died in 429 he 
was elected general every year. At home he was responsible for the measures 
that made Athens a radical democracy. In foreign policy he was an avowed 
imperialist, who reckoned that the Athenian Empire brought positive benefits 
to its subjects that outweighed their loss of independence. 
After the Thirty Years' Peace, 
Athens embarked on no more impe-
rial ventures. She controlled the seas, 
kept a tight hand on her empire, and 
expanded her economic influence 
westwards. Sparta and its allies had 
good reason to fear Athenian ambi-
tions, and Corinth, whose prosperity 
and very existence depended on her 
trade, was especially alarmed by 
Athenian expansion into the western 
Mediterranean. There were danger-
ous incidents, as when Corfu, a colony 
of Corinth, made a defensive alliance 
with Athens and an Athenian naval 
squadron routed a Corinthian fleet 
(434 B.C.). In the autumn of 432 B.C. 
(when our story of Dicaeopolis and his 
family begins) there was frantic 
diplomatic activity, as both sides pre-
pared for war.

Note that these nouns do not add <; in the nominative singular. Note 
also the accents on the final syllables in the genitive and dative singulars 
(regular with monosyllabic stems) and the recessive accent in the voca-
tive singulars. The nominative and vocative plurals all have accents on 
the next to the last syllable. 
3. Two Important Irregular Nouns: n YIlVn, ~fi~ YIlVat1C6~, woman; 
wife, and n Xeip, ~fi~ xetp6~, Iumd 
For i] yuv1], note that the nominative is not formed from the stem plus 
-<;, as is usual with velar stem nouns such as q>uAaIC-<; > q>uAa~; the accent 
in the genitive and dative, singular and plural, falls on the final sylla-
ble; and the vocative singular consists of the stem minus the final IC, since 
all stop consonants are lost in word-final position. For i] Xeip, note the 
shortened stem in the dative plural.

For the nominative and vocative masculine singular forms, the -Vt at 
the end of the stem is lost because of the e;, and the stem vowel lengthens. 
Remember that all stop consonants in word-final position are lost; thus 
the stem "avt- gives "av in the neuter nomiJ"ative, accusative, and 
vocative singulars with loss of the t; the stem vowel was probably length-
ened because of the masculine "ae; and the feminine ,,(Xaa. In the dative 
plural the -Vt is lost before the a of the ending -at(v), and the stem vowel 
lengthens. Note the following uses ofthis adjective: 
Predicate position: 
"crvtee; oi 8eot or oi 8eat "crvtee; = all the 
gods 
,,(Xaa f] vaile; or f] vaile; "aaa = the whole 
ship, i.e., all of its parts 
Attributive position (rare): f] "aaa "OA.te; = the whole city (regarded 
collectively as the sum total of its 
parts) 
Without definite article:

The numbers from five to ten are indeclinable adjectives; that is, they 
appear only in the forms given above no matter what gender, case, or 
number the noun is that they modify. For the number one, there is a full 
set of forms in the singular, given at the left below, with the masculine 
and neuter showing 3rd declension endings, and the feminine showing 
1st declension endings similar to those of ~aXll1pa (see Chapter 4, Gram-
mar 3, page 42). Compare the declension of 1ta~, 1tacra, 1taV above. The 
word OUliEi~, ouoE~ia, oMev or ~Tjoe\~, ~TjoE~ia, ~Tjoev means no one; nothing 
as a pronoun and no as an adjective. 
Stems: tv- for masculine and neuter; ~l- for feminine

Translate into Greek: 
1. When we arrive at the island, I go to the house of Aeolus. 
2. And he, when he sees me, is very amazed and says: "What is the 
matter (= what are you suffering)? Why are you here again?" 
3. And I answer: "My comrades are to blame. For they loosed (~A.\iO'av) 
the winds. But come to our aid, friend." 
4. But Aeolus says: "Go away (annE) from the island quickly. It is not 
possible to come to your aid. For the gods surely (01]ltou) hate (use 
I1tcrem) you." 
Classical Greek 
Sappho: The Deserted Lover: A Girl's Lament 
These lines are quoted by a writer on Greek meter (Hephaestion, 2nd 
centnry A.D.) without giving the author. Some scholars ascribe them to Sap· 
pho of Lesbos (seventh century B.C.), the greatest female poet of Greek litera· 
ture. The passage (D. A. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, page 52) is given at 
the left as it is quoted by Hephaestion in the Attic dialect and then at the right 
with Sappho's Aeolic forms restored.

GRAMMAR 
1. Participles: Present or Progressive: Active Voice 
In the last chapter you learned the forms of the present, progressive 
participle in the middle voice, e.g., AiiD~evo<;, Aiio"EVIl, AUD"evoy, which has 
the same endings for case, number, and gender as the adjective lCaAD<;, 
K<xI\;t1, K<xA.6v. 
In the reading passage at the beginning of this chapter you have met 
many forms of the present active participle, e.g., (J1tEUOovn,<;, hurrying, 
l3oii\v~a<;, shouting, and "owuvta<;, making. Present active participles, 
like present middle participles, do not refer to time as such but describe the 
action as in process, ongoing, or progressive. 
Present active participles, like the adjective "iX<;, "iXO'a, "iXv (Chapter 8, 
Grammar 4, page 126) have 3rd declension endings in the masculine and 
neuter and 1st declension endings in the feminine. They have the suffix 
-Ovt- in the masculine and neuter and the suffix -oua- in the feminine. 
There is no -<; in the nominative masculine singular. The t is lost in the 
masculine and neuter nominative and vocative singulars, since all stop 
consonants are lost in word-final position, and in the masculine the a is 
lengthened to m; thus for the verb ei", the masculine participle (stem, 6v~-) 
is roy and the neuter is av. In the masculine and neuter dative plurals, the 
yt is lost before the 0', with a resulting spelling of o-oO't(v). Present active 
participles are declined as follows:

The City of Athens 
The city to which Dicaeopolis and his family journeyed was largely built 
after the battle of Salamis, since the earlier city and its temples were de-
stroyed when the Persians occupied and sacked Athens. A visitor coming by 
sea would arrive at the Piraeus, the greatest port in Greece and perhaps its 
finest natural harbor. The fortification of the Piraeus was begun by Themis-
tocles in 493-492 B.C. It was completed after the Greek victory at Plataea, 
when the city of Athens was rebuilt and connected to the Piraeus by the Long 
Walls, making Athens virtually impregnable as long as she controlled the 
seas. 
Leaving the harbor quarter, visitors would have made their way through 
the marketplace and town of Piraeus to the road that led between the Long 
Walls, and then they would have walked the seven miles or ten kilometers to 
Athens through continuous traffic of mules and ox-carts carrying goods to 
and from the city. From a distance they would have seen the Parthenon dom-
inating the Acropolis and perhaps the spear of the great statue of Athena in 
full armor, which stood outside the Parthenon. 
Entering the city, they would see on their left close to the city wall the 
PnYK, a large open slope where the Assembly met (see map, page 132). They 
would then pass between the Areopagus (Hill of Ares), a bare outcrop of rock of 
immemorial sanctity, and the Acropolis into the agora. This was the center 
of Athens. On the left stood the Strategeion or Generals' Headquarters (to the 
left of and not shown in the model on the facing page) and then (see model) the 
Tholos (the round magistrates' clubhouse), the Metroon (Archive), the temple 
of Apollo Patroos, and the stoa of Zeus; behind the Metroon stood the Bouleu-
terion (Council Chamber); on the right (not shown in the model) were the law 
courts. On the hill behind the Bouleuterion there still stands the temple of 
Hephaestus, the best preserved of all Greek temples. In the agora itself were 
great altars to Zeus and to the ten eponymous heroes of Athens, and there were 
also fine marble colonnades (staas), where people could rest and talk in the 
shade. 
The agora was not only the seat of government but also the market and 
mercantile center of Athens. Here you could buy anything, as a comic poet of 
this time wrote: 
You will find everything sold together in the same place at Athens: figs, 
witnesses to summonses, bunches of grapes, turnips, pears, apples, givers 
of evidence, roses, medlars, porridge, honeycombs, chickpeas, lawsuits, 
puddings, myrtle, allotment-machines, irises, lambs, waterclocks, laws, 
indictments. 
Pushing their way eastwards through the crowds of people conducting 
business or strolling in conversation, our visitors would reach the Pana-
thenaic Way, which led to the Acropolis (see map, page 132, and illustrations, 
page 141). As they climbed to the top ofthe steep road, they would see on their 
right the little temple of Athena Nike, built to commemorate victory over the 

140 
Athenaze: Book I 
Persians (see model, page 141, and photograph, page 280). They would then 
enter the great monumental gateway, the Propylaea, designed by Mnesicles to 
balance the Parthenon but never completed, since work was interrupted by the 
outbreak of war in 431 B.C. Even so, it was a beautiful and impressive build-
ing, which included a picture gallery. 
On leaving the Propylaea, our visitors face the Parthenon and in front of 
it the great bronze statue of Athena Promachos. The temple takes the tradi-
tional form of a cella, in which stood the statue of the goddess, surrounded by a 
peristyle of Doric columns. The architect, Ictinus, incorporated many subtle-
ties in the basically simple design, and these give the temple a unique grace 
and lightness, despite its great size. The sculptures that adorned the two ped-
iments, the 92 metopes, and the frieze running around the cella were designed 
by Pericles' friend Pheidias. On the frieze was depicted the great Pana-
thenaic procession, in which every fourth year representatives of the whole 
people of Athens brought the offering of a new robe to their patron goddess. In-
side the cella was the great statue of Athena, standing in full armor, made of 
ivory and gold, so awe-inspiring that none could look on it without fear and 
admiration (see reconstruction, page 132). 
To the north of the Parthenon stood the Erechtheum, sacred to Erechtheus, 
the founder-king of Athens, and to Poseidon and Athena. The temple is ir-
regular in plan, having three porticoes, each in a different style; it stood on 
the site of the most ancient shrine on the Acropolis. Here could be seen the sa-
cred olive tree that Athena had given to the people of Athens and the sacred 
serpent, which embodied the spirit of Erechtheus. 
Crossing to the southern edge of the Acropolis, behind the Parthenon, our 
visitors would look down on the precinct of Dionysus (see photograph, page 
144). There was the theater (not built in stone until the following century) and 
the temple of Dionysus. 
All these buildings, and others, were part of Pericles' master program. 
They were paid for by the tribute of the subject allies. His political opponents 
said, "The treasure contributed for the necessity of war was being squandered 
on the city, to gild her all over and adorn her like a harlot, with precious 
stones and statues and temples." Pericles answered that the people were not 
obliged to give any account of the money to the allies, provided that Athens 
maintained their defense and kept off the Persians. His program gave em-
ployment to an army of workmen and artists and made Athens a worthy cen-
ter of her empire, "an education to Greece."

instead of a in the accusative singular of 1tOA.tS. Contraction takes place 
in five of the forms. 
Note that nouns of this type, as well as a few other words such as IA.eros, 
propitious, accent the third syllable from the end in the genitive singular 
and plural even though the final syllable is long. Originally the genitive 
singular was 1t0A.110S, and this became 1tOA.EroS by quantitative metathesis, 
with the original accent retained. The genitive plural 1toA.erov accents its 
first syllable in imitation of the singular. 
PRACTICE: Write the complete sets of the forms of 6 !lav'ttS, 'toii !lav'teros, 
seer, and of 6 1tfixuS, 'toii 1tijxeros, forearm.

5. Uses of the Genitive Case 
a. 
b. 
The genitive is frequently used to show possession, e.g., 0 tou Itonlios 
Kumv = the boy's dog, the dog of the boy. Note that the genitive is usu-
ally placed in the attributive position between the article and the noun 
(see Chapter 5, Grammar 7 a, page 66) or after the repeated article: 0 
Kumv a <ou Itatoos. Exception: the possessive genitives ainou, ainijs, 
and ainrov, of him/ of it, of her, and of them occupy the predicate posi-
tion (see Chapter 5, Grammar 7b, page 66), e.g., 0 Kumv a;,tou, his dog. 
The genitive is used to express the whole of which some part is men-
tioned; this is the genitive of the whole or the partitive genitive, e.g., 
trov ltap6vtmv noA.A.oi = many of those present. 
c. The genitive case is used after certain prepositions, often (but by no 
means always) expressing ideas of place from which, e.g., anD, from; 
lila, through; BK, B~, out of; ~E<a, with; and 1mEp, on behalf of, for. 
d. The genitive is used with certain verbs, e.g.: 
e. 
it 'Aptaovll. E1tEl1tPOO1:0V oPi?: 'tOY 811CJecl, £p~ au'tou. 
Ariadne, when she first sees Theseus, loves him. 
b 8TjaEUS <Ii apta<EP'f A.a~~aVE<at tije; <ou 8Tjpiou KEcpaA.fjs· 
Theseus takes hold of the head of the beast with his left hand. 
For the genitive of time within which, see Chapter 8, Grammar 6, page

Athenaze: Book I 
6. Some Uses of the Article 
a. You have already met the followiug uses of the article (see Chapter 5, 
Grammar 3, page 58): 
ooe = andlbuthe 
ftOE= andlbutshe 
O\OE = andlbutthey 
a\ot =andlbutthey 
offthO I'Ev ... offtho oe = the one . . . the other 
oila\h&. I'Ev ... oilail<&. oe = some ... others 
b. The article + an adjective can form a noun phrase, e.g.: 
Adjectives: 
avopElo<;, -a, -ov = brave 
aroq>pOJv, awq>pov = prudent 
q>C\.o<;, -Yj, -ov = dear 
nOA.EI'1O<;, -a, -ov = hostile 
Noun Phrases: 
0\ avopElot = the brave men 
a\ aroq>povE<; = the prudent women 
0\ q>lA.ot or a\ q>lA.al = the friends 
0\ 7tOA.Ef!1Ol = the enemy 
c . The article + an adverb, prepositional phrase, or genitive can form a 
noun phrase, e.g.: 
0\ viiv = the now men = the men of today = the present generation 
0\ ",'A.al = the men of old 
a\ ev "ii ayop(f = the women in the agora 
a\ npo<; <n KPl]Vll = the women at the spring 
o pacnUOJ<; = the (son) of the king = the king's son 
<&. £laOJ = the things inside = the inside 
<&. TIi<; nDA.EOJ<; = the things (i.e., the affairs) of the city = politics 
d. The neuter of an adjective + the article is often used as an abstract 
noun, e.g.: 
'to KClt...6v ;;;;; beauty; virtue; honor 
'to aiaxp6v = dishonor; disgrace; vice 
<a aA.Yj8E<; or <&. aA.Yj8ii = the truth 
'[0 8tKctWV = justice 
'[0 EV ;;;; the one;;;; unity 
e. The article + a participle forms a noun phrase that may be translated 
by a relative clause in English, e.g.: 
0\ napDv,"<; = the ones being present = those who are present 
0\ ev <ip aypip epya~DI'Evol = the in the field working (men) = the 
men who are working in the field 
o \EpEU<; 0 <nv Suatav not01lf!EvO<; = the priest who is making the sacri-
fice 
These participles are said to be attributive, serving as simple adjec-
tives; see Chapter 8, Grammar 1b, page 115.

they were taking spoils of war (u1<poSivta) from Sparta to Delphi as an offering 
to Apollo (0 <!>oi~oS). Since the men were lost at sea and the hull of their ship

PREVIEW OF 
NEW VERB FORMS 
Most of the verbs in the stories up to now have been in the present tense. In 
the stories in the remainder of this course you will also meet verbs in the im-
perfect, future, aorist, perfect, and pluperfect tenses. 
The following is a brief overview of the Greek verbal system. It will give 
you a framework within which you will be able to place the various new verb 
forms. Note that only active voice forms are shown in the lists below. 
First we give sample forms of J. ilOl, which is typical of many Greek verbs 
that have past tense formations called sigmatic 1st aorists: 
Present: J.il-Ol = I loosen, am loosening, do loosen 
Imperfect or Past Progressive: ~-J.ii-ov = I was loosening 
Sigmatic Future: J.il-IJ-Ol = I will loosen, will be loosening 
Sigmatic 1st Aorist: ~-J.ii-IJa = I loosened, did loosen 
Sigmatic 1st Aorist Imperative: J.ii-IJOV = loosen! 
Sigmatic 1st Aorist Infinitive: J.u-IJat = to loosen 
Sigmatic 1st Aorist Participle: J.il-IJd~ = having loosened, after loos-
ening, sometimes, loosening 
-Ka 1st Perfect: J.e-t..U-Ka = I have loosened 
-"'1 1st Pluperfect: £-J.£-J."-K'I = I had loosened 
Some verbs have past tense formations without a a as in the aorists above 
but with a thematic vowel (0 or f) between the stem and the endings. These are 
called thematic 2nd aorists; here are the present and aorist tenses of such a 
verb (note the different stem in the 2nd aorist; see Chapter 11, Grammar 1, 
page 176): 
Present: J.e{1t-0l = I leave, am leaving, do leave 
Thematic 2nd Aorist: e-J.t1t-o-V = I left, did leave 
Thematic 2nd Aorist Imperative: J.(1t-f = leave! 
Thematic 2nd Aorist Infinitive: J.t1t-ftV = to leave 
Thematic 2nd Aorist Participle: J.t1t-rov = having left, after leaving, 
sometimes, leaving 
Notes on the lists above: 
1. The imperfect or past progressive (e.g., ~-J.ii-OV) is formed from the pre-
sent stem, which is augmented by adding the prefix e- or by lengthening 
the initial vowel, e.g., ar-Ol > ~r-o-v. Augmenting in one of these two 
ways signals past time. (For the imperfect or past progressive tense, see 
I:;hapter 13.) 
2. The future tense is usually formed by adding -a- to the stem and adding 
the same endings as for the present: e.g., J.il-a-Ol. (See Chapter 10.) 
154 
Preview of New Verb Forms 
155 
3. The sigmatic 1st aorist (e.g., ~-J.ii-aa) is formed with the suffix -aa and 
with augment, which shows past time and appears only in the indicative 
mood. (See Chapter 12.) Augment is absent from the aorist imperative 
(J.ii-aov), which does not refer to past time, from the infinitive (J.~-O"at), 
which usually does not refer to past time, and from the participle (J.ii-IJd~), 
which usually describes an action that was completed prior to the action of 
the main verb but may describe an action without reference to time 
(further details in Chapters 11 and 12). 
4. In thematic 2nd aorists (e.g., e-J.t1t-o-v) there is a change in the stem of 
the verb, a thematic vowel (0 or f), and no -au suffix. (See Chapter 11.) 
Aspect 
Aspect or the wayan action is looked upon is very important in Greek. 
There are three aspects: (1) progressive, of action in process or ongoing, e.g., 
"John runs/is running/was running"; (2) aorist, of simple action, sometimes 
in past time, e.g., "John ran," and sometimes not, e.g., "Run, John!"; and (3) 
perfective, with emphasis on the enduring result of a completed action, e.g., 
"John has won the race"= "John won the race and is now the winner." 
Voice 
In Chapter 6 you learned that there are three voices in Greek, active, mid-
dle, and passive. In the present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect tenses, 
middle and passive forms are spelled the same and are distinguishable o~ly 
by the context iu which they are used (see Chapter 16). In the future and aonst 
there are different forms for the passive (see Chapter 17, Book II). 
. 
Verb Stems and Principal Parts 
In many verbs the stem of the present tense is different from the stem or 
stems from which the other tenses are formed, as in the verb <pepOl, I carry: 
Present tense, <pep-Ol: stem, <pep-
Future tense, at-a-co: stem, Ot-
Aorist, T)VEYK-O-V: stem, eveYK:-
In order to make it easier 'for you to learn the principal parts of Greek 
verbs, i.e., the forms that you need to know in order to make the various 
tenses, we will give in subsequent vocabulary lists the stem or stems when 
they are different from what is seen in the present tense, e.g.: 
<pepOl, [0\-] 0\0"0l, [eVerK-] i\V£'YlCOV, I carry 
We will not give stems when they are the same in the other tenses as they 
are in the present. 
. 
Greek verbs normally have six principal parts, but in the vocabulary lIsts 
in the remainder of Book I we will give only the first three, as above. They 
should be memorized carefully.

GRAMMAR 
1. Verb Forms: Verbs with Sigmatic Futures 
Most verbs form the future tense by adding the suffix -a- and adding 
the same endings as in the present tense, e.g.: 
Future Active 
Indicative 
A,'iI-a-ro, I will loosen 
A,'iI-a-w;, you will loosen 
A,'iI-a-el, he / she will loosen 
A, 'ii-a -0 ~ev, we will loosen 
A,'iI-a-e<e, you will loosen 
A,'iI-a-ouat(v), they will loosen 
Future Middle 
A,'iI-a-o-~at, I will ransom 
A,f,-a-et or A,'iI-cr-11, you will ransom 
A,'iI-cr-e-w.t, he/she will ransom 
A,\i-cr-6-~eea, we will ransom 
A,'iI-cr-e-cree, you will ransom 
A,'iI-cr-o-v<at, they will ransom 
There is no future imperative. 
Infinitive 
A,'iI-a-etv, to be 
about to loosen 
A, f,-cr-e-creat, 
to be about to 
ransom 
Participle 
/...i>~O'-OlV, 
",;3-o-ouO'a. 
A,u-a-ov, 
gen., A.;)-O'-ov't-o~, etc., 
being about to loosen 
A,u-cr-6-~ev-o<;, -T], -ov, 
being about to 
ransom 
The diphthong at in the endings is counted as short for purposes of ac-
centuation. 
In the following, note what happens when the stem ofthe verb ends in a 
consonant instead of a vowel, as does A,'iI-ro above: 
a. If the stem ends in a labial (~, n, '1'), the labial + the future suffix 
-cr- produces the combination of sounds represented by the letter \jI, 
e.g.: 
~A,En-ro, I look; I see, ~U\jlo~at 
1tEJ.l1t-OO, I send, n:eJ.l'l'm 
ypa'I'-ro, I write, ypa\jlm 
b. If the stem ends in a velar (y, K, X), the velar + the future suffix -cr-
produces the combination of sounds represented by the letter ~, 
e.g.: 
A,EY-ro, I say; I tell; I speak, A,e~m 
o"",,-ro, I pursue, Iit<D~m 
'I'uA,anro, I guard, [q>uA,aK-l op1lA,a~ro 
oEx-o~al, I receive, lie~o~at 
Note: £x-ro, I have; I hold, has two future forms: 
/!~m 
(irregular), I will have, and [crxe-] a"flam,! will get. 
10. 
H 
L Y M '" 0 P A 
(a) 
1:;9 
c. If the stem ends in a dental (0, e, <) or I; (= cr + 0), the dental or I; ts 
lost before the -cr- of the future, e.g.: 
O'1tE{)O-OO, I hurry, O'1teUaID 
netS-co, I persuade, 'ltEiaID 
"a«ro, I sprinkle, [na<-]naam 
napcxO'KEuaS-ro, I prepare, n:apaoKEueXaco 
2. Verb Forms:TheAsigmatic Contract Future of Verbs in -{~Ol 
If the present tense form of a verb ends in -il;ro, its future stem ends in 
-le-, e.g., Ko~il;ro, future stem, KO~le-. The future suffix -cr- is lost be-
tween the vowel at the end of the stem and the vowels of the personal end-
. jngs. The vowels then contract as in the present tense of -e- contract 
verbs such as 'I'tA,Ero. We call futures formed this way asigmatic contract 
futures, e.g.: 
Ko~il;-ro, I bring; I take, KO~tE-(cr)-ro > KO~tii), KO~Ie'i<;, KO~te'i, etc. 
Ko~il;-o-~at, I get for myself, acquire, KO~IE-(cr)-o-~at > ",o~to\i~at, 
KOJ.Ltet/1COJ.Ltn. KOJ.Ltet"CCXt, etc. 
3. Verb Forms: The Sigmatic Future of Contract Verbs 
Contract verbs lengthen the final stem vowel and then add -cr-, e.g.: 
'I'tA,E-ro, I love, optA.flam, q>tA,~cret<;, q>tA,~cret, etc. 
Exception: ",aA,E-ro, I call, KaA,ii), KaA,el<;, KaA,el, etc. (an asigmatic 
contract future with no difference in spelling between the present 
and the future) 
ftYE-o-~at, I lead, fty~cro~at, ,,~cret/fty~cr11' ft~cre<at, etc. 
'ttJ.La-ro, I honor, 't'iJ.lTtO'Cll, '[t~1:fto"Et<;, 'tlJ.LTtaEt, etc. 
N ote: eeao~at, I see, watch, look at, eeficro~at (note that because of 
the e the a lengthens to &. rather than T]) 
A few verbs lengthen the e of one form of their stem and add -cr-, e.g.: 
yiyvo~at, I become, [yeve-l yev~cro~at, yev~cret/11' yev~cre<at, etc. 
.eEA,ro, I am willing; I wish, [EgeA,e-] eeeA,flam, .eeA,~cret<;, .eeA,~cret, 
etc. 
4. Verb Forms: Verbs with Deponent Futures 
Some verbs, active in the present tense, have futures that are middle in 
form but active in meaning (i.e., deponent), often with a different stem, 
e.g.: 
a.Ko-Uro, I hear, cXKo,]aOJ,lctt 
~a1)(l;ro, I walk; I go, [~alitE-] ~alito\i~at

Festivals 
In the course of his praise of the democracy, Pericles says in his funeral 
oration: "We provide more recreations for the mind from toil than any other 
state, with competitions and sacrifices throughout the year." There were in 
fact over sixty days in the year that were holidays in Athens, when festivals 
were held in honor of the gods. These involv.ed all members of the population, 
citizens and metics, men and women, children and slaves. Many festivals 
entailed processions, and most culminated in public sacrifice, followed by a 
feast in which all present joined. 
The greatest of all the processions is represented on the Parthenon frieze. 
Here we see all classes of Athenians playing a part. The knights are shown, 
at first preparing for parade, then moving off, and later entering the proces-
sion at a canter. Stewards are portrayed, marshaling the procession. Next 
comes a group of elders, led by lyre players and flutists. Ahead of them are 
young men bearing jugs of holy water and others with trays of offerings. 
Girls carry wine jars, bowls for pouring libations, and incense burners. Thl) 
victims are led toward the central scene on the east side, where in the middle 
stand the priestess and a magistrate with the robe that has been offered to 
Athena. On either side of them are seated larger figures, looking outward 
toward the procession; these are the twelve Olympian gods, watching and en-
joying the procession. 
SaCrifice was performed at the altar, which stood outside every shrine, in 
accordance with a set ritual. Priest and victims wore garlands. There was a 
call for holy silence. The altar and participants were sprinkled with water. 
Then the priest scattered sacred grain over the victim's head and cut a lock of 
hair from it, which he burnt in the altar fire. The victim was lifted up by at-
tendants and stunned with a blow from a club. Then, while music played, the 
priest cut the victim's throat and caught the blood in a dish; this was poured as 
an offering over the altar. Next the victim was skinned and cut up. The 
inedible parts (the thigh bones wrapped in fat) were burned on the altar for the 
gods, and the rest was cooked and divided among the people to eat. Thus, gods 
and men shared the sacrificial banquet.

Every festival had its own ritual. Many, perhaps all, were celebrated 
with music and dancing. At some there were athletic competitions, notably at 
the Panathenaea. At the most important festival of Dionysus, the Greater 
Dionysia, the ten tribes into which the Athenian people were divided each put 
on a chorus, five of men and five of boys, which sang and danced in competi-
tion. Later in the festival, which lasted six days in all, there were three days 
of drama. On each of these days, three tragedies were performed in the morn-
ing, followed in the afternoon by a satyr play (an old form of drama in which 
the chorus consisted of satyrs, half-man, half-goat) and a comedy. The the-
ater held between 17,000 and 20,000 people, so that a large proportion of the citi-
zens could be present. 
Classical Greek 
Theognis 
Theognis (fl., 550 B.C.) was a noble of Megara; he was exiled when there 
was a democratic revolution. Several of Theognis's poems, such as the fol-
lowing (lines 567-570) lament the transience of youth and the imminence of 
death. Indeed, such thoughts are characteristic of much Greek literature.

5. Verb Forms: The Asigmatic Contract Future of Verbs with Liquid 
and Nasal Sterns 
If the stem ends in a liquid (A., p) or a nasal (j.l, v), an E is added to the 
stem, the future suffix -a- is lost between this vowel and the vowel of the 
endings, and contraction takes place, e.g., j.lEV-E-(a)-ro > j.lev&. This is 
an asigmatic contract future like the future of verbs in -(~ro (page 159).

j.lEVE-(a)-E" > 
j.lEVEtU: 
j.lEVE-( a)-ouat(v) > j.lEvoiim(v) 
The present and future of liquid and nasal verbs are thus distinguished 
only by the circumflex accent in the future, except in the 1st and 2nd per-
sons plural and most forms of the participle, where contraction produces a 
different spelling as well. The future middle forms of liquid and nasal 
verbs are also contract forms; see lCaflvro below. 
In most liquid and nasal verbs, however, the stem not only has an e 
but is spelled differently in the future, e.g.: 
a'{pro, I lift, [dpe-] dpro 
u7tolCpivoj.lat, I answer, [lCpWE-] U7tolCpwoiij.lat 
u7tonEivro, I kill, [nEvE-]a7tOlCuv& 
~aAA.ro, I throw, [~aA£-] ~aA& 
EyEipOJ, I wake X up; middle, I wake up, [EYEPE-] Eyepro 
lCaj.lvro, I am sick; I am tired, [lCaj.lE-]lCaj.loiij.lat 
The verb j.laX0j.lat, although not a liquid or nasal stem verb, also has ~ 
an asigmatic contract future: j.laX0j.lat, I fight, [j.laxe-] j.laxoiij.lat, j.laXEtln, 
, .. uxXBt'teXl, etc. 
The verb 'A.atlvro, I drive, is a nasal stem verb but is irregular in the 
future: tAro, 'A</:S, ,A.</:, etc. Compare the present of -a- contract verbs.

6. The Irregular Verb dILl 
The verb d~l in the indicative refers to future time and means I will 
go. In Attic Greek it is used as the future of 'pxo~al. Thus: 'PXO~at, I come; 
I go; future, d~l, I will come; I will go 
Here are the forms of Ei~l. Note that the verb has a long-vowel stem El-
(compare Latin ire) and a short-vowel stem l-: 
Stems: d-/l-, come; go 
Ei~l, I will come; I will go

As noted above, the indicative forms of d~l refer to future time. The 
imperative, infinitive, and participle, however, are used in Attic Greek in 
place of the corresponding present forms of 'pxo~al; the infinitive and 
participle usually refer to present time, the imperative always. The 
imperative, infinitive, and participle of 'pxo~al are not used in Attic 
Greek. 
Here are six common compounds of the verb 'PXO~at:

7. Future Participle to Express Purpose 
The future participle may be used to express purpose, often preceded by 
<0<;. In English we use a simple infinitive, e.g.: 
EV "4> ,«net J.levro ro<; "1;.<; "paY'1'oia<; geiicroJ.lEvO<;. 
lit., I will remain in the city as being about to watch the tragedies.

8. Impersonal Verbs 
Greek has a number of verbs that are used in the 3rd person singular 
with an impersonal subject, often an infinitive or infinitive phrase. 
They are often translated into English with it as subject. You have met the 
following in the reading passage above: 
Impersonal verb with infinitive phrase as subject: 
&p' e~£O''ttV Tt)ltV tv 'to (ian:! uEVEtV; 
Is to stay in the city allowed/possible for us? 
Is it allowed/possible for us to stay in the city? 
May/Can we stay in the city? 
Impersonal verb with accusative and infinitive phrase as subject:

GRAMMAR 
1. Verb Forms: Past Tense: The Aorist 
Both English and Greek have several different past tenses, e.g., "I 
was coming," "I came," "1 have come," "I had come." The term aorist (= 
a-, without + " opOS, boundary) means without boundaries, without limits 
and is used to describe forms of verbs that express simple action, in con-
trast, for example, with the present tense, which expresses progressive, 
ongoing action. In the indicative mood, aorist forms usually express 
simple action in past time, e.g., ~A.eOV, I came or I went; the simple past 
tense in English. 
There are two ways of forming the aorist in Greek, corresponding to 
two ways of forming the simple past tense in English: 
1. A suffix is added to the verb stem, e.g.: 
Present: A. t-m, I loosen 
Sigmatic 1st Aorist: E-A.ti-acx,! loosened 
2. The verb stem is changed, e.g.: 
Present: A.e(1t-m, I leave 
Thematic 2nd Aorist: E-A.l1t-O-V, I left 
Most Greek verbs have sigmatic 1st aorists, some have thematic 2nd 
aorists, and a few have both. 
In the aorist indicative an e is placed before the stem of verbs that be· 
gin with consonants. This is called an augment, and it indicates past 
time. If the stem of the verb begins with a vowel, the stem is augmented by 
lengthening the vowel, e.g., the aorist stem of aym, namely aycxy-, is 
augmented to Ttyay- (see Grammar 8, pages 190-191). Note in the lists of 
forms below that the augment is not present in the forms ofthe imperative, 
infinitive, and participle.

2. Verb Forms: The Thematic 2nd Aorist 
Thematic 2nd aorists have thematic vowels (0 or e) between the stem 
and the ending in the indicative. The personal endings for the thematic 
2nd aorist indicative active are slightly different from those for the pre-
sent indicative. The present endings are called primary, and the the-
matic 2nd aorist endings are called secondary. The latter should be 
memorized as follows: 
Secondary: -v, OS, -, -~ev, -'te, -v 
The endings for the active and middle thematic 2nd aorist impera-
tive, infinitive, and participle are similar to those you have learned for 
the present tense. 
The aorist middle indicative has secondary endings, four of which 
are different from the primary ones you have learned for the present mid-
dle indicative. Memorize both the primary and the secondary middle 
endings as follows: 
Primary: -J.1at, -crat, -'t<Xt, -J.1e9a. -cree, -v'tC(t 
Secondary: -~llV, -cro, -'to, -~eea, -cree, -v'to

Note: 
1. Thematic vowels come between the stems and the endings in many of 
these forms, just as in the present middle forms (see Chapter 6, 
Grammar 3, pages 76-77). 
2. Note the accents of the active infinitive and participles. Compare the 
accents of the present active infinitive and participles (see page 152). 
3. The accent of the singular aorist middle imperative is irregular: 
yevoii. 
4. Note that thematic 2nd aorist middle infinitives are always accented 
on the next to the last syllable, e.g., yevEaem. Compare the present and 
future middle infinitives, ,,\lmem and ,,\laeaem. 
Exercise 1m 
In the reading passage at the beginning of this chapter, locate two exam-
ples of an aorist of the verb 1f(xo'Xm and two aorist forms of the verb 
r{YVO/lal. 
Exercise 11/3 
1. Make photocopies of the Verb Charts on pages 282 and 283 and copy the 
aorist active forms of }'d"m given above on the second chart. Then 
fill in the present active and future active forms of this verb that you 
have learned to date. 
2. On the chart that you filled out with the future forms of r{rvo/luz 
(Exercise 10u.2), fill in the aorist indicative, imperative, infinitive, 
and participle of this verb. Be sure to keep all of your charts for refer-
ence, 
Exercise 11y 
1. Make two photocopies of the Verb Charts on pages 282 and 283 and fill 
in the present, future, and aorist active forms of ",xaxm (aorist if-"uO-
a-v) that you have learned to date on one set of charts. 
2. On your second set of charts fill in the present and aorist middle 
-...... 
forms of }.u/l{3avo/lal, I take hold of, aorist, e-}.u{3-6-/lT)v, that you have 
learned to date. Keep these charts for reference. 
3. Aspect 
a. Indicatives 
Notice that the indicatives in the charts on the previous page are 
translated I left, you left, etc. In the indicative mood the aorist usually 
designates simple action in past time. 
Occasionally the aorist indicative is used to express general 
truths and is translated with a present tense. This is called the 
gnomic aorist (cf. at yv&~at, maxims, aphorisms), e.g.: 
11. 
0 
I A T POL (a) 
naeffiv v"nto, El1aeev. A fool learns by experience. 
b. Imperatives 
179 
Notice, however, that with the imperatives, which have no aug-
ment the translations are the same as those for the present tense. 
This is because the aorist imperative differs from the present not in 
time but in aspect, that is, in the way in which the action of the verb is 
conceived in the mind. The present tense is progressive and is used of 
an ongoing process; the aorist is used of simple action, e.g.: 
Present, progressive imperative: 
Ib:oll. tOV l1ii8ov. Listen to the story! 
(The listening is conceived of as a process that will take place over 
a period of time.) 
Aorist imperative: 
Aal30ii 'til, filii, xetp6,. Take my hand! 
(The reference is to the simple action itself.) 
c. Infinitives 
Present infinitives express progressive, ongoing action, e.g.: 
viiv 8E-6",' yap fanv-8d Ttl1u, lCaeeuS.tv. 
But now-for it is late-it is necessary for us to be sleeping. 
Aorist infinitives usually express simple action without reference 
to time, e.g.: 
6 AtlCat6noA.tc; tOY na1t1tOv E1tEtcrev OtKctOe £1t(xvEA,geiv. 
Dicaeopolis persuaded grandfather to return home. 
d. Participles 
Present participles express progressive, ongoing action, e.g.: 
n MeA.tt'tct cpepo'UO'(X ~v uop{av ibt'tcxtO'E Kat o:i:)'tllV Ka'tE~~/"'ev. 
Melissa, carrying her water jar, stumbled and dropped It. 
Usually the aorist participle describes a simple action that pre-
ceded or was finished before the action of the main verb, e.g.: 
Ot oE 7ta.v'tu 1;a 'YEvoJ,LEVa aiycip etltov. 
They told him all the things that had happened. 
Aorist participles sometimes designate simple ~ction .without r?f-
erence to time (the following example uses an aSlgmahc 1st aOrIst 
participle, to be introduced in the next chapter): 
"ltOlCplval1£vo<; dnev. Not Having answered, he said, but An-
swering, he said or He said in reply. 

180 
Athenaze: Book I 
Here are further examples of aorist participles: 
6 oE aOEA<jlOS 1tpOS TIjv eupav fAOchv Kat 'ov fHKat01tOAtV i/)mv, "XatPE, 
~ l:ioEAcpe," e<pll. 
And his brother, having come/after coming/coming to the door 
and having seen/after seeing/seeing Dicaeopolis, said, "Greet-
ings, brother.» 
Here the actions described by the aorist participles clearly took 
place before the brother greeted Dicaeopolis, and so we may translate 
them having come / after coming and having seen / after seeing. But 
they are simple actions and so may also be translated simply coming 
and seeing. Present, progressive participles would be inappropriate 
here because the actions are not continuous or ongoing. 
4. Thematic 2nd Aorist Active and Middle Participles 
The thematic 2nd aorist active participle has the same endings as the 
present active participle (see Chapter 9, Grammar 1, page 136, but it differs 
in accent: 
Nom., Voc. 
Al7t-roV

At1t-OUOt(v) 
Ace. 
At1t-ov,as 
At1t-ouoas 
At1t-OV-Ca 
The thematic 2nd aorist middle participle has the same endings as the 
present middle participle (see Chapter 8, Grammar 1, page 115): 
Nom. 
YEV-O-I!EV-OS 
yEV-O-I!EV-T] 
YEV-O-I!EV-OV 
etc. 
5. Verb Forms: Common Verbs with Thematic 2nd Aorists 
Learn the following verbs, paying particular attention to the differ-
ence between the verb stems in the present tense and those in the future 
and aorist. Remember that some verbs that have active forms in the pre-
sent tense are deponent in the future (see Chapter 10, Grammar 4, pages 
159-160). Vie give the aorist participles bere and in the vocabulary lists 
in the remainder of Book I in order to remind you that the augment occtifS' 
only in the indicative forms. Remember that stems beginning with vow-
els or diphthongs augment in the aorist indicative by lengthening the 
initial-vowel (see Grammar 8, pages 190-191).

Healing: divine and secular 
The inscription at the bottom of this relief says that it was dedicated by Aeschinus to the 
hero healer Amphiaraus. On the right, the patient sleeps in the sanctuary and is visited 
by Amphiaraus and his divine serpent, which licks his wound. On the lett a doctor (or the 
god himself?) operates on the wound. 
Greek Science and Medicine 
The beginnings of Greek science are to be found in the speculations of the 
philosophers who lived in the Ionian city of Miletus in the sixth century B.C. 
The first of these thinkers was Thales, one of the seven wise men or sages of 
archaic Greece, whose floruit can be dated confidently, since he predicted an 
eclipse ofthe sun that took place on 25 May 585 B.C. He and his successors 
were primarily interested in questions of physics. They all sought for a uni-
fying principle underlying the multifarious appearances of the physical 
world; in simple terms, they asked, ''What is the ultimate constituent of mat-
ter?" Thales answered that this was water. He conceived of the earth as a flat 
disc floating on water (the ocean), with water above (rain falling from the 
sky). Water, when rarefied, becomes steam or mist. He speculated that air, 
when rarefied, becomes fire. Water condensed takes on a solid form, ice or 
mud; further condensed it becomes earth and stone. The interest in Thales' 
theory lies not in its truth or falsehood but in the boldness with which he sought 
for an answer in terms of natural causation to questions that had been tradi-
tionally answered in terms of myth. 
The speculations of the Ionian philosophers had no practical end in view, 
and here they differed from Greek medicine, which had developed from early 
time as an art; the doctor (iatpos = healer) was a craftsman. There were al-
ready famous doctors before we hear of any theory of medicine. The best 
known is Democedes, whose story as told by the historian Herodotus is given 
at the end ofthis chapter. 

184 
Athenaze: Book I 
The man whom the Greeks looked upon as the founder of medical science 
belonged to the next century. This was Hippocrates (fl. 430 B .C.), who founded 
a famous medical school on the little island of Cos (see map, page 272). To 
him is ascribed a large collection of writings that cover all aspects of 
medicine including anatomy, physiology, prognostics, dietetics, surgery, 
and pharmacology. They include a book of precepts on how doctors should be-
have toward their patients and the famous Hippocratic oath, which was taken 
by all students of medicine: 
I will pay the same respect to my master in the science as to my parents 
and share my life with him and pay all my debts to him. I will regard his 
sons as my brothers and teach them the science, if they desire to learn it, 
without fee or contract .... I will give treatment to help the sick to the best 
of my ability and judgment .... I will not give lethal drugs to anyone if I 
am asked ... nor will I give a woman means to procure an abortion .... 
Whatever I see or hear that should not be spoken to any person outside, I 
will never divulge .... 
The oath both gives an insight into how the medical schools were organized (a 
system of apprenticeship) and also shows the ethical principles to which an-
cient Greek doctors subscribed. 
None of the writings can be confidently ascribed to Hippocrates himself, 
but many, perhaps most, were written in the fifth century and contain some 
strikingly enlightened features. The case histories recorded in the Hippo-
cratic writings are particularly interesting, showing the close observation 
and careful recording on which all sound diagnosis must depend. For in-
stance: 
At Thasos, pythion had a violent rigor and high fever as the result of 
strain, exhaustion, and insufficient attention to his diet. 
Tongue 
parched, he was thirsty and bilious and did not sleep. Urine rather dark, 
containing suspended matter, which did not settle. Second day: about 
midday, chilling of the extremities .... (Epidemics 3.2, case 3) 
The patient's condition and symptoms continued to be recorded until the tenth 
day, when he died. 
Greek doctors did not claim to be able to effect cures in many cases. Their 
remedies were simple. 
Drugs, usually purgatives, were used sparingly. 
Surgery made steady advances, although anatomy was held back by reluc-
tance to perform dissection of the human body. Bloodletting was a common 
remedy, and great importance was attached to diet and exercise. Despite its 
limitations, Greek medicine was rational in all aspects and rejected the be-
lief that sickness was caused by evil spirits, still current in the Palestine of 
New Testament times. If a Greek doctor could not cure a patient, the only re-
course for the patient was to visit one of the healing sanctuaries, where a com-
bination of medical care and faith healing resulted in some remarkable 
cures, if the tablets put up by patients are to be believed.

6. Verbs with Thematic 2nd Aorists from Unrelated Stems 
The thematic 2nd aorists you have studied so far use stems that are re-
lated etymologically to the stem seen in the present tense, e.g. A.a~Jiavw 
and eA.aftov, like English take and took. A few Greek verbs form their 
aorists from a completely different root, etymologically unrelated to that 
seen in the stem used for the present tense, as does English with, for ex-
ample, I go (present) and I went (past). The following are the most com-
mon such verbs in Greek, and you have already seen some of their aorist 
imperatives and participles in the readings: 
aipEw, I take, aip1\aw, [EA.-] dA.oV (irregular augment), EA.mV 
epxo~at, I come; I go, [Ei-li-] d~t (irregular), [EA.B-] ftA.Bov, EA.SmV 
A.EyW, I say; I tell; I speak, A.E~W, [e,t-] Ehov (irregular augment), 
einmv (augment retained) 
opaw, I see, [6n-] O'l'O~at, [ili-] dliov (irregular augment), ilimv 
<PEXW, I run, [8pa~E-] 8pa).Loii~at, [lipal1-] elipa).Lov, lipa~mv 
<PEPW, I carry; of roads, lead, [oi-] OlGW, [EvEYlC-] ijVEYlCOV, EVEy"mv 
Note that the accent of compound verbs never recedes beyond the aug-
ment; thus the aorist of EnaVEpXO).Lat is EnavfjA.Sov.

1. Make photocopies of the Verb Charts on pages 282 and 283 and fill in 
the forms of epxop.al, future, f fp. I, and aorist, ~A.eOV, that you have 
learned to date. 
2. On your charts with the future of exw and opaw (Exercise 1 Oa.2), fill in 
the aorist forms that you have learned to date. 
7. Accents on Thematic 2nd Aorist Active Imperatives 
The aorist imperatives of most verbs with thematic 2nd aorists have 
regular recessive accents, e.g., A.inE, A.in"E (see Grammar 2, page 177). 
The accents of the aorist imperatives of epxo).Lat, A.EyW, opaw, Eupia"w, and 
A.a~~aVW, however, are irregular in the singular in that they are not re-
cessive. In the plural the accents of all five of these words are recessive:

Note that in the singular the accent of the compound forms of these im-
peratives is recessive, e.g., £naveASe (from £"aVepXOI.l(xt).

8. Augment 
To indicate past time in the aorist indicative, as we saw in Grammar 
1 above, Greek puts an e before the stem of verbs beginning with conso-
nants. This is called a syllabic augment. If the stem begins with a vowel 
or diphthong, the initial vowel is lengthened in spelling or sound. This is 
called temporal augment, because long vowels are held for a longer time. 
The following list compares present and aorist indicatives and shows 
how the stems of verbs beginning with vowels and diphthongs are aug-
mented. A number of these verbs are sigmatic or asigmatic 1st aorists (to 
be introduced in the next chapter) and are cited merely as examples of 
temporal augment.

Remember that the thematic 2nd aorist stems of alp em, Aeym, and 
apam, namely, eA-, £n-, and io- augment irregularly to Et, giving .lAov, 
.Inov, and .Ioov and that d"ov retains its augment in its imperative, 
e11tE/et1tE'te, infinitive, einE'iv, and participle, etmov (see Grammar 6, page 
1B9). Some other verbs may also augment E to et, e.g., £pyal;o)lat, I work,

GRAMMAR 
1. Verb Forms: Past Tense: The Sigmatic 1st Aorist 
Most Greek verbs have sigmatic 1st aorists, rather than the thematic 
2nd aorist formations studied in the last chapter. Sigmatic 1st aorists are 
formed by adding the suffix -aa to the verb stem, e.g., '-Au-aa. (In cer-
tain types of verbs the a is lost and one;finds only -a and not -aa; these 
asigmatic 1st aorist formations will be studied in the second half of this 
chapter.) As with the thematiC2rid'aorists, the verb stem is augmented 
only in the indicative. Compare the forms below with those of the thematic 
2nd aorist (see Chapter 11, Grammar 2, page 177).

Note: 
1. The letter a is characteristic of sigmatic and asigmatic 1st aorists, 
and it occurs in all forms except the 3rd person singular of the active 
indicative (eAuaE(v» and the singular imperative (Ailaov). 
2. Sigmatic and asigmatic 1st aorist active infinitives are always ac-
cented on the next to the last syllable, e.g., Aila"-t and lCEAEilaat (the 
diphthong -at is short here for purposes of accentuation). 
3. The -at of sigmatic and asigmatic 1st aorist middle infinitives is 
also counted as short, and the accent may thus stand on the third syl-
lable from the end, e.g., ADaaaSat (compare YEvEaSat, Chapter 11, 
Grammar 2, page 177, ADWSat, Review of Verbs, page 152, and 
A{;aWSat, Chapter 10, Grammar 1, page 158). 
, 
When the stem ends in a consonant, the same rules apply as in the 
formation of the sigmatic future (see Chapter 10, Grammar 1, pages 158-
159). Here are the present, future, and aorist of the same verbs given as 
examples of the future in Chapter 10, Grammar 1, pages 158-159: 
a. If the stem ends in a labial (~, ", <p), the labial + -a- produces the 
combination of sounds represented by the letter 'I' in the future and 
aorist, e.g.: 
~AE"ro, I look; I see, ~AE'I'O~at, e~J..E'I'a 
1tE).L1t-ro, I send, 1tE~.l\J1ro, E7tEIl'VCX 
ypu<p-ro, I write, ypu'l'ro, eypa'l'''-
h. If the stem ends in a velar (y, K, X), the velar + -a- produces the 
combination of sounds represented by the letter ~ in the future and 
aorist, e.g.: 
AEYro, I say; I tell; I speak, AE~ro, eJ..eSa 
lhroK-ro, I pursue, Otro~ro, Eo{rosa 
<pIlAUnro, I guard, [<pIlA"-K-J <PIlAU~ro, E<puAasa 
8EX-o~at, I receive, 8E~o~at, E1iE1;u~Tjv 
c. If the stem ends in a dental (8, S, ,) or S, the dental or S is lost before 
the -a- of the future and aorist, e.g.: 
cmEuo-ro, I hurry, O"1tE:ucrro, eO"7tE'\)(JQ

Note: KOlli1;-ro, I bring; I take, [KOJ.LtE-] K0J.Lt&, [KOllt-] hOlltOa 
Contract verbs lengthen the final stem vowel and then add 0 for the 
future and the aorist, e.g.:

Trade and Travel 
In the late Bronze Age the Achaeans traded extensively throughout the 
eastern Mediterranean. The Dark Age that followed (ca. 1100-800) was gen-
erally a period of isolation, in which there was little overseas trade and dur-

ing which contacts with the East were broken. Early in the eighth century 
B.C., two Greek settlements were being made specifically for trade, the first 
in the East at AI Mina at the mouth of the Orontes River in Syria, the second in 
the West on the island ofIschia outside the Bay of Naples about 775 B.C. Both 
were probably made for trade in metals, essential for manufacturing arms 
(copper and tin from the East; copper, tin, and iron from Etruria in the West), 
AI Mina was strategically placed to tap trade both inland up the Orontes to 
Mesopotamia and down the coast to Phoenician cities and Egypt. Its founda-
tion was followed by a flood of Eastern imports into Greece, not only metals 
and artefacts, but also craftsmen and ideas, notably the alphabet, adapted by 
Greeks from Phoenician script about 750 B.C. The period was one of rapid 
change and development in Greece, a kind of renaissance. The polis (city-
state) developed from unions of villages. Aristocracy replaced monarchy in 
most states. There was a revolution in warfare: hoplites (heavy armed in-
fantry fighting in close line) replaced cavalry as the main fighting force. 
Growth in population led to emigrations; cities sent out colonies that peopled 
the coasts of the Mediterranean wherever there was no strong power to keep 
them out. These colonies, though founded primarily to provide land for suJ:::, 
plus population, soon grew into prosperous, independent cities (e.g., Syracuse, 
founded in 733 B.C. by Corinth) and further stimulated trade, especially in 
grain, to supply the increasing population of the mainland. Italy from the 
Bay of Naples south and almost the entire coast of Sicily were studded with 
Greek colonies, and the area became known as Greater Greece. The leading 
states in this movement were Chalcis and Eretria in Euboea, Aegina, and 
Corinth. Miletus and other East Greek states were active in the north of the 
Aegean and the Black Sea. 
The story of Colaeus of Sam os, who voyaged out through the Straits of 
Gibraltar and landed at Tartessus in the Bay of Cadiz, was told by Herodotus 
and is given at the end of this chapter; it shows the enterprise of these traders. 
The new market in the West opened up by Colaeus was developed by another 
Ionian state, Phocaea, located on the western coast of Asia Minor (see map, 
page 272). Phocaeans founded Massilia (Marseilles) about 600 B.C. and soon 
after entered into profitable trade with the king of Tartessus. This western 
expansion of Greek trade was curtailed by the Carthaginians, who succeeded 
in pushing back the Greeks and monopolizing the route through the Straits of 
Gilbratar to Spain, Brittany, and Britain. 
Trade with Egypt developed in the seventh century, encouraged by a 
friendly pharaoh, Psammetichus I (664-610 B.C.). From Egypt the Greeks 
imported grain; their exports were olive oil, wine, perhaps silver, and cer-
tainly mercenary soldiers. 
Psammetichus employed a regular force of 
Greek hoplites, and two reigns later his grandson, Psammetichus II still used 
Greek mercenaries. A Greek settlement was made at the mouth of the Nile 
and was named Naucratis. It was given a charter by the pharaoh Amasis 
(570-526 B.C.). Naucratis developed into the largest port in Egypt, a flourish-
ing center of trade and tourism. Egypt, with a culture of immemorial antiq-
uity, fascinated the Greeks, and many visited it out of curiosity as well as for 

202

trade. When the family members of the poet Sappho were exiled from their 
native Lesbos, she went to Sicily, but her brother went to Egypt, where he fell in 
love with the most famous courtesan of the day and spent his fortune on her. 
Sappho's contemporary, the poet Alcaeus, also went to Egypt during his exile, 
but his brother Antimenidas served as a mercenary in the army of Neb-
uchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and took part in the campaign that culminated 
in the capture of Jerusalem (587 B.C.) and the exile of the Jews. Antimenidas 
became the army's champion and slew the enemy's Goliath. 
At the time of our story, the Piraeus was the greatest port in Greece and, 
indeed, in the whole Mediterranean. In Chapter 14 we will explain how 
Athens came to take the lead from Corinth as a naval and mercantile power. 
The harbor must have been always crowded with ships both Athenian and for-
eign, both Greek and barbarian. The most important single item of import 
was grain, which came from the great grain producing areas of the ancient 
world: Egypt, Sicily, and the steppes of south Russia (Scythia). Athens had 
treaties with the princes of Scythia that gave her a monopoly of this trade. 
Shipbuilding timber was imported in large quantities both for building mer-
chantmen and for the great Athenian navy (300 triremes). Attica did not pro-
duce any metals except for silver from the mines at Laurium. She exported 
olive oil, silver, and fine pottery (her black and red figure vases had driven 
out all competitors by 550 B. C .). 
Although commerce and far-flung trade thrived, we should not forget that 
only a minority of the people were involved in it. The farmers stuck to their 
farms, and the attitude of Dicaeopolis to seafaring may have been not uulike 
that of Hesiod three centuries before. The only voyage he ever made was to 
cross the straits between Boeotia and Euboea to take part in a poetry competi-
tion. You can only sail safely, he says, in the fifty days following the sum-
mer solstice (21 June). You might also, he says, risk a voyage in spring:

I don't recommend it. It has no attraction for me-it must be snatched, 
and you are unlikely to avoid trouble. But men will do it in the foolish-

WORD BUILDING 
The prefix <'<- (a-privative) may be attached to the beginning of many verbs, 
nouns, and adjectives (<'<v- is prefixed to words beginning with vowels) to 
negate or reverse their meaning or to express a lack or absence, e.g., ouva,6<;, 
possible, aouva,o<;, impossible. Compare moral and amoral ("without 
morals"; compare immoral) in English. 
From the words at the left, deduce the meaning of those to the right: 
1. 
<Xl"Cto<;, -a., -ov 
,,-.... ,', 
~.,' 
avcxtno<;, -ov ; ,- '. 
2. 
a~tO<;, -E<, -ov (worthy) 
<'<va~IO<;, -ov 
3. oiKalO<;, -E<, -ov (just) 
aOtKo<;, -ov 
4. <'<vopeto<;, -E<, -ov (from 6 <'<VTlP, 'ou <'<vop6<;) 
avavopo<;, -ov 
Note that adjectives compounded with a-privative have no separate feminine 
forms; the masculine forms are used with either masculine or feminine 
nouns.

The large landlocked harbor to the northwest was Cantharus, the main commercial port; 
the smaller harbors to the south, Zea (left) and Munychia (right), were for warships.

3. Verb Forms: The Asigmatic 1st Aorist of Verbs with Liquid and 
Nasal Stems 
You will recall that verbs with stems ending in a liquid (A., p) ora 
nasal (Jl, v) have asigmatic contract futures with stems often different 
from the stem seen in the present tense (see Chapter 10, Grammar 6, pages 
166-167). In the aorist of these verbs e is not added to the stem as it is in the 
future, and the a ofthe -aa aorist suffix is lost; this causes the stem vowel 
(seen in the future) to lengthen (if it is not long already). Because of the 
loss of the a, we call these asigmatic 1st aorists. 
atpro, I lift, [&pe-] &pro, [&p-]ftp-a (E< of the stem does not change) 
a1toKplv.OJlat, I answer, [KptVe-] a1tOKptVoUJlat, [KplV-] Ot1tEKplV-a-l111v 
(r lengthens to i) 
Ot1tOK,eiVro, I kill, [neve-] <'<1tOK1EVro, [KUtv-] Ot1tEK'tEtv-a 
(e lengthens to El) 
hefpro, I wake (someone) up; middle, I wake up, [eyepe-] eyepro, 
[EyElp-] ijYElpa (E lengthens to El) 
JlEVro, I stay; I wait, [Jlev£-] Jlevro, [I1Etv-] EI1EtV-a (e lengthens to et) 
lj>aivoJlat, I appear, [lj>ave-]lj>avouJlat, [Ij>I1V-] EIj>I1V-a-JlI1V (a lengthens 
to 11) 
As an example, we give the verb atpro, I lift, which in the middle voice 
may mean I carry off for myself; I win (e.g., a prize).

GRAMMAR 
1. Verb Forms: The Imperfect or Past Progressive Tense 
a. Regular and Contract Verbs: 
For regular and contract verbs, the imperfect or past progressive tense 
is formed by augmenting the verb stem as found in the present tense and 
adding the thematic vowels and the secondary personal endings. Com-
pare the formation and endings of the thematic 2nd aorist, which is simi-
lar except that it is based on a different stem. The imperfect tense has 
forms only in the indicative; there are no imperfect imperatives, infini-
tives, or participles.

2. Aspect 
The imperfect or past progressive indicative usually looks on the ac-
tion of the verb as an ongoing process in past time, just as the present tense 
looks on the action as an ongoing process in present time; note that these 
two tenses use the same stem. The aorist indicative, on the other hand, 
usually looks on the action as a simple action or event in past time. Note 
the following uses of the imperfect or past progressive: 
a. The imperfect tense usually indicates continuous or incomplete 
action in past time. When so used it can be translated by the En-
glish imperfect, e.g.: 
enElnpoO"exropoul1ev, ot Q)1) .. aKee; tae; nu)..ae; hA,etov. 
When we were approaching, the guards were shutting the gates. 
Compare the aorist: 
enEl ei0"11A,90l1ev, ot cpu)..aKee; tae; nu)..ae; EKA,etO"av. 
When we went in, the guards shut the gates. 
The imperfect can also be translated with phrases such as used 
to ... , was / were accustomed to ... of repeated or habitual action, 
e.g.: 
01. ~6e~ EJ.lEVOV EV 'tcp Ctypip. 
The oxen used to stay/were accustomed to staying in the field. 
b. The imperfect may also be used to indicate the beginning of an 
action in past time, e.g.: 
dC; 'tOY aypov EicrEA.86v'tEC; £7tOV01)v. 
Entering the field, they began to work. 
This is called the inchoative imperfect, from the Latin verb in coho, 
"I begin." 
The aorist may also be used with certain verbs to indicate the 
entrance into a state or the beginning of an action, e.g., f] MuppivT] 
ElhxKpiiO"e, Myrrhine burst into tears. This is called the ingres-
sive aorist, from the Latin verb ingredior, "I begin." 
c. The imperfect may also be used to indicate an attempt to do some-
thing in past time, e.g.: 
tOY natEpa Ene!90I1EV OtKaOe enave)..getv· 6 oe Q1)K f]SE)..T]O"eV. 
We tried to persuade father to return home, but he did not want to.

The Rise of Persia 
The events that led to the sudden emergence of Persia as a world power are 
complex, involving the fall of three ancient empires in quick succession. 
Until the sixth century, the Persians were a wandering mountain tribe, the 
name of which occasionally crops up in contemporary records as the tribe 
gradually worked its way southeast from Russia down the mountains of west-
ern Iran. By 550 B.C. the Persians were settled east of the mouth of the Tigris 
as a vassal kingdom of Media. To understand their rapid rise to power it is 
necessary to go back to the middle of the seventh century, a turning point in 
the history ofthe ancient world. 
By 650 B.C. the Assyrian Empire, which had ruled Mesopotamia, Egypt, 
and Syria, began to crumble. In Egypt Psammetichus led a national revival 
and threw off the Assyrian yoke with the help of Greek mercenaries (ca. 650 
B.C.). The Medes, united under King Phraortes (675-653 B.C .), became a 
formidable power, extending their kingdom on all sides. In Lydia, Gyges 
(685-657 B.C.) founded a new dynasty and expanded westward to Ionia, where 
he defeated some of the Ionian Greeks, and eastward to the river Halys (the 
northeastern border of the Lydian Empire as marked on the map). Babylon, 
which a thousand years earlier had ruled all of Mesopotamia, revolted from 
Aasyria about 625 B.C. and made an alliance with the Medes. In 612 B.C. the 
Babylonians and Medes took the Assyrian capital Nineveh and proceeded to 
divide up their empire. Babylon took the south; their king, Nebuchadnezzar, 
controlled all of Mesopotamia. He defeated the Egyptians at the great battle of 
Carchemish (605 B.C.) and drove them from Syria. When the Jews revolted, 
he took and destroyed Jerusalem (587 B.C.) and carried the tribes of Judah 
into captivity in Babylon. Assyria itself and the lands to the west up to the 
borders of Lydia fell to the Medes. On these borders the Medes fought several 
battles with Lydians, the last of which (28 May 585 B.C.) was broken off when 
the eclipse of the sun predicted by Thales occurred.

Median ampire 
The stage was now set for the rise of Persia. In 556 B.C. Cyrns, king of the 
Persians, defeated the Medes and became king of the Medes and Persians, 
founding the dynasty of the Achaemenids, who were to rule the greatest em-
pire the world had ever seen, until they were overthrown by Alexander the 
Great two hundred years later. 
Croesus, king of Lydia, alarmed by the growing power of Cyrus, decided 
to make a pre-emptive strike. He consulted the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, 
which answered that if he crossed the river Halys, he would destroy a great 
empire. Thus encouraged, he led his army over the river and was met by 
Cyrus near the city of Pteria, about 60 miles or 100 kilometers east of the 
Halys. A bloody but indecisive battle followed, after which Croesus led his 
troops back to Sardis, intending to invade again the following year with 
larger forces. Cyrus, however, pursued him hotfoot, defeated him, and took 
the city of Sardis (546 B.C.). Many of the Greek cities of Aaia Minor submitted 
at once. Those that did not were reduced the following year by the general 
whom Cyrus left behind when he returned to Persia. 
When Cyrus had consolidated his empire in Iran, he was ready to move 
against Babylon, which was suffering from discord. He came as a liberator, 
for example, of the Jews: "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith God .... 
Comfort Jerusalem, for her time of humiliation is ended"-so prophesied Isa-
iah (xl), welcoming the coming of Cyrus as the savior sent by God. Babylon 
fell in 539 B.C., and there followed a peaceful and orderly occupation. Cyrus 
was proclaimed king of Babylon the following year: "I am Cyrus, king of the

world, the Great King, the legitimate king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer 
and Akkad, king of the four corners of the earth" reads an inscription found 
on a cylinder at Babylon. One of his first decrees allowed the Jews to return to 
Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple. He died in 530 B.C., much lamented; he 
had been no mere conqueror but the father of his people. 
His son Cambyses consolidated Persian power in the Levant arid invaded 
and defeated Egypt (525 B.C.). In March of 522 B.C., shortly before he died, 
there was a rebellion led by a Persian who called himself Bardiya, son of 
Cyrus. By July most of the empire acknowledged him, but in September a 
conspiracy was formed by seven great Persian nobles, who maintained that 
Bardiya was a pretender. They murdered him and set on the throne one of 
their number: Darius. Darius had to put down revolts all over the empire be-
fore his position was secure. He consolidated the empire and extended it in 
the East from Afghanistan into India (the Punjab) and opened up a sea route 
from the mouth of the Indus to the Persian Gulf and Egypt. 
Darius then turned his attention northwest. In 513 B.C. he led his army 
into Europe across the Hellespont, subdued most of Thrace, and marched 
north to the mouth of the Danube. He crossed the river by a bridge of boats, 
built by his Greek engineers, and he disappeared into the steppes of Russia, to 
deal with the nomad Scythians, who were harassing the northern borders of 
his empire. He was gone for over sixty days, and the Greeks who were guard-
ing the bridge discussed whether they should break up the bridge and leave 
him to his fate but decided it was wiser to remain at their post. Eventually he 
returned with the survivors of his army, having accomplished little against 
the hit-and-run tactics of the Scythians. He returned to Persia, leaving a 
general to complete the conquest of Thrace. This was accomplished in one 
campaign, which brought the Persians up to the borders of Macedonia. By 
now most of the islands of the Aegean Sea were held by the Persians. The 
threat to mainland Greece was uncomfortably close. 
In 499 B.C. the Ionian Greeks revolted, expelling the tyrants whom the 
Persians had installed to control them. The revolt was led by Aristagoras, 
tyrant of Miletus, who was in trouble with the Persian authorities. Aristago-
ras visited the mainland to beg for support. At Sparta, King Cleomenes re-
fused, but at Athens the assembly of the newly founded democracy was won 
over by his appeal and voted to send an expedition of twenty ships. These 
joined the Ionian forces at Ephesus, and the allies marched up country and 
took and destroyed Sardis, the capital of the satrapy. When a Persian relief 
force arrived, they retreated rapidly to the coast. The Athenian contingent, 
satisfied with their exploit, returned to Athens. The Ionians kept up the strug-
gle for four more years with varying success until the Persians eventually 
crushed all resistance and took Miletus (494 B . C .). 
Darius is said to have ordered one of his officials to say to him every day: 
"Remember the Athenians." Retribution was assured. In 492 B.C. a large 
force was dispatched by land and sea. Thrace and Macedonia submitted, but, 
when the fleet was wrecked off Mount Athos, the expedition against Greece 
was called off. Two years later a second expedition sailed straight across the

Aegean, landed near Eretria in Euboea (Eretria had sent five ships to help the 
Ionians), and took and destroyed the city. They then landed on the coast of 
Attica at Marathon. After heated debate, the Athenian Assembly at the urging 
of Miltiades decided to send their army out to meet the Persians at Marathon 
rather than to shut themselves up in the city. The Athenians, though greatly 
outnumbered, faced the Persians alone (apart from a small contingent sent 
by their ally Plataea). Sparta sent a force to help, but it arrived too late for the 
battle. By brilliant tactics, the Athenians routed the Persian force and pur-
sued them to the sea, inflicting heavy casualties for small losses (490 B. C .). 
This day was never forgotten. To have fought at Marathon was an Atheni-
an's proudest boast. Aeschylus, the great tragic poet, makes no mention of his 
poetry in his epitaph; he simply says: "Of his glorious courage the groves of 
Marathon could speak, and the long-haired Mede, who knew it well." The 
dead were buried beneath a great mound still to be seen on the site of the battle. 
Darius' preparations to take revenge on the Greeks were thwarted first by 
a revolt in Egypt and then by his death. It was not until 483 B.C. that his suc-
cessor, Xerxes, began to assemble the vast force that was intended finally to 
settle Persia's score with Greece. 
Darius, the Persian king, holds an audience. 
His son and successor, Xerxes, stands behind his throne.

sages, e.g.:

Relativedtauses are adjectival or descriptiveiclauses that are intro-
duced by relative pronouns, of which English has the forms who, whose, 
whom, which, and that. In Greek the relative pronoun 'may appear in any 
of the following forms:

Be careful not to confuse relative pronouns with definite articles. 
may wish to compare the forms and accents of relative pronouns 
those of the definite article (Chapter 4, Grammar 8, ~). Note 
t the 
relative pronoun never begins with the letter, and -G'tlie mascu' e and 
25 
13. 
lIP 0 r 
T H N r A A A MIN A 
(~) 
225 
feminine nominative singular and plural definite articles do not have 
accents. 
Note the following rule: the relative pronoun, which introduces the 
relative clause, agrees with the noun, noun phrase, or pronoun to which it 
refers in the main clause (i.e., its antecedent) in gender and number, but 
its case is determined by its function in the relative clause. 
Thus, in sentence a above, the noun phrase oEKa vijEe; ftaKpa( 
(feminine plural) is the antecedent of the relative pronoun, which must 
accordingly be feminine and plural. The relative pronoun is the subject 
of the verb in its own clause UmopEuono) and must accordingly be in the 
nominative case; the correct form is therefore at (feminine, plural, nom-
inative). 
In sentence b above, the noun phrase KaKav UV8pOl7tOV is the antecedent 
of the relative pronoun, which must accordingly be masculine and singu-
lar. The relative pronoun is the object of p17t'ElV in its own clause and 
must accordingly be accusative; the correct form is therefore OV 
(masculine, singular, accusative). 
The suffix -7tEP may be added to the forms of the relative pronoun 
given above for emphasis. 
Exercise 13~ 
In the first two paragraphs of reading passage /3, locate five relative 
clauses. Identify the antecedent of each relative pronoun, and explain 
why the relative pronoun is in its gender, number, and case. Two of the 
five examples have already been analyzed above.

4. 3rd Declension Nouns and Adjectives with Stems in -£0'-
Some 3rd declension nouns and adjectives have stems ending in -ea-, 
from which the a is lost before the endings, allowing the e of the stem to 
contract with the vowels of the endings, e.g., "" 1dxoS (stem 1etxea-). The 
usual contractions occur, as follows:'" 
e + E > £1 
e+o>ou 
e+a>ll 
£+oo>ro 
Stem: 1etxea·, wall 
Singular

Neuters with stems in -ea- have -os in the nominative, ac-
cusative, and vocative singular.

The genitive plural borrows its accent from the other forms, and the 
accusative plural borrows its form from the nominative plural. 
The adjective aA.TjBTJs (stem aA.TjBea-) has only two sets of forms, the 
first to go with masculine or feminine nouns and the second to go with 
neuter nouns. It also loses the a of the stem before the endings and shows 
the same contractions as the noun above:

5. lst13rd Declension Adjective with 3rd Declension Stems in -n- and 
-E-
As does the adjective nas, naaa, nay (Chapter 8, Grammar 4, page 
126), the adjective 1axus, 1axda, 1axu, quick, swift, has masculine and 
neuter forms that are 3rd declension, while the feminine is 1st declension 
(with a, because the stem ends in t; compare the declension of ~"xatpa, 
Chapter 4, Grammar 3, page 42). For the 3rd declension forms, compare 
the declensions of nOA.ts and lia1u, Chapter 9, Grammar 3, page 145.

1. Comparison of Adjectives 
5. Dorothea 
6. Ophelia 
Adjectives have three degrees, e.g., "beautiful" (positive), "more 
beautiful" (comparative), and "most beautiful" (superlative) or "brave" 
(positive), "braver" (comparative), and "bravest" (superlative). 
In Greek the comparative and superlative of adjectives are regularly 
formed by adding -tEpOS, -tepa, -tEPOV and -tatos, -tatT], -tatov to the stem 
ofthe positive: 
Positive 
Comparative 
avopdo~. -ii, -OV, brave 
Stem: civllpEto-
avllpE,o-tEPOs, -a, -ov 
braver 
xaA.EltOS, -1], -ov, difficult 
Stem: xaA.."o-
xaA.."ro-tEPOS, -a, -ov 
more difficult 
Superlative 
avSpEt6-"Ca:to~, -11, -ov 
bravest 
XClAE1tro-"CCl'tO<;, -'Il, -ov 
most difficult 
Note that in 1st and 2nd declension adjectives as in the examples 
above, the 0 at the end of the stem of the positive is lengthened to Ol if the syl-
lable preceding it is regarded as short (e.g., coptains a short vowel).

3rd Declension: 
aA.T]81]s, aA.T]8es, true 
Stem: aA.T]8ea-
aA.T]8eO-tEpOS, -a, -ov 
truer 
Note what happens when the stem ends in -ov-: 
Superlative 
aA.T]8eo-tatos, -T], -ov 
truest 
arocppOlv, oiii<ppov, of sound mind; prudent; self-controlled 
Stem: OOl<ppOV-
OOl<ppov-eO-tEpOS, -a, -ov 
OOl<ppov-eo-tatos, -T], -ov 
more prudent 
most prudent 
The endings -eO-tEpOS, -a, -ov and -eo-tatOS, -T], -ov are constructed by 
analogy with aA.T]8eQ-tEOOC, -a, -ov and aA.T]8eo-tlXto., -T], -ov. 
2. Irregular Comparison of Adjectives 
Some adjectives are irregular in their formation of comparatives and 
superlatives and show forms ending in -tOlV or -OlV (masculine and fem-
inine) and -tOY or -ov (neuter) for the comparative and -tOtOS, -,otT], -'OtOV 
for the superlative. The comparatives are declined like Oro<ppOlV, oiii<ppov 
(see Chapter 7, Grammar 7, page 107), with some alternative forms that 
will be presented later.

3. Comparison of Adverbs 
As you learned in Chapter 4 (Grammar 7, page 50), the positive degree 
of an adverb is regularly the same in spelling and accent as the genitive 
plural of the corresponding adjective, but with S instead of v at the end, 
e.g., adjective, gen., pI., KaAiiiv > adverb, KaAiiis. The comparative de-
gree of the adverb is the neuter singular of the comparative adjective, and 
the superlative degree of the adverb is the neuter plural of the superlative 
adjective, e.g.: 
Positive 
Comparative 
Superlative 
Regular: 
avopdros 
avOpetO'tEpOV 
UVOPEtO'tU'tlX 
bravely 
more bravely 
most bravely

4. Uses of Comparatives and Superlatives 
a. Comparatives 
Jld~ova mpa~ov tlXEV " 8epQl,1\ nunE, ot "EUllVE,. 
Xerxes had a bigger army than all the Greeks. 
Here the conjunction i\, than, is used; in this construction the two 
things being compared (underlined in the examples above and below) 
14.

are in the same case. Here is another example: 
6 veuv{aC; 'tOY <l>tAt1t1tOV eX'YPuil1:epov i:htnVEV t1 'tOY UA.A.OV veuv{av. 
The young man hit Philip more fiercely than (he hit) the other youn~ 
man. 
The following examples show how the genitive case (genitive of com-
parison) may be used instead of the conjunction i\: 
6 UV1lP J.LE{~mv EO''tt 'tau 1tato6c;. 
The man is bigger than the boy. 
oi 6:8&vc('tot ou8ev af.1Etvov E1tpCtt'WV 'COlV IfA:Arov. 
The Immortals were faring no better than the others. 
b. 
Superlatives 
" AEroviol]S 1tuv~rov ~iiiv (npanro~iiiv aptato<;; ~v. 
Leonidas was the best of all the soldiers. 
The genitive used with superlatives, as above, is a partitive genitive. 
c. Strengthened Comparisons 
An adjective in the dative case may be used to enhance a comparison, 
e.g.: 
1tOAACP/flaKPCP fld~ova a~pa~ov EixEV " 8ePSl]S 1\ 1tuv,"S ot "EAAl]VES. 
Xerxes had a much/far bigger army than all the Greeks. 
This is called the dative of degree of difference; lit., bigger by much/ 
by far. An adverb may also be used, e.g.: 
6 Aeo.wloTlC; 1tav'tOJv 'troY O''tPCl'ttffi'CroV 7tOA.U aptO''toc; ~v. 
Leonidas was by far the best of all the soldiers. 
d. Superlatives with tbt; 
Note the following: 
cbS ~UXta~a, as quickly as possible 
cbS avopEt6~a~a, as bravely as possible 
cbS 1tAEi:a~Ot, as many as possible 
e. Special Meanings of Comparatives and Superlatives 
Sometimes comparatives are used when no explicit comparison is be-
ing made; the comparative softens the statement, e.g.: 
Ot ~up~apot avo pEt6~Epoi £law. 
The barbarians are rather/somewhat brave. 
Sometimes superlatives are used to indicate a very high degree of a 
quality when no explicit comparison is being made, e.g.: 

238 
Athenaze: Book I 
ot a8c:iv(l'tOt civlipElo'tC<'toi tim.v. 
The Immortals are very brave.

The Rise of Athens 
Athens played no part in the colonizing movement of the eighth and sev-
enth centuries; she controlled a larger area than any other Greek state except 
Sparta and so had less need to send out colonies. She was also at this time 
somewhat backward. An attempt was made to establish a tyranny at Athens 
by Cylon (632 B.C.), but he failed to win popular support. 
14.

Forty years later in the 590s, the discontent of the farmers threatened to 
lead to civil war in Attica, and Solon was appointed arbitrator to find a solu-
tion (see page US). Although his legislation pleased neither farmers nor no-
bles, his reforms had a lasting and profound effect both constitutionally and 
economically. Athens enjoyed a new prosperity. She began to export both 
olive oil and fine pottery; Attic black figure pottery, which had begun to appear 
about 600 B.C., gradually drove out Corinthian ware, and achieved a 
monopoly throughout the Greek world and beyond. 
A renewed threat of civil war allowed Pisistratus to establish a tyranny, 
but Athens continued to grow in prosperity and power throughout his tyranny 
(546-527) and that of his son, Hippias. Hippias was driven out in 510, and 
three years later Cleisthenes put through the reforms that established a 
democracy. Immediately Athens was attacked by enemies on every side. 
The Spartan king Cleomenes led the army of the Peloponnesian League 
against her but turned back at the border, because the Corinthians refused to 
fight in an unjust war. Meanwhile the Boeotians had invaded Attica from the 
north and the Chalcidians from the east. As soon as Cleomenes had turned 
back, the Athenian army hurried north, defeated the Boeotians and then 
crossed to Euboea and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Chalcidians, taking 
and destroying their city. 
When Aristagoras arrived in Athens to ask for help in the Ionian revolt 
against Persia, the Athenian people were confident enough to accept his ap-
peal (see page 220). Since Hippias had taken refuge with the Persians, their 
motives were not entirely disinterested. Less than ten years later, Athens 
faced the might of Persia alone at Marathon, and her victory there fIlled the 
democracy with boundless pride and confidence. 
Although Athens was now powerful by land, her navy was still inconsid-
erable. The founder of Athenian sea power was Themistocles, the victor of 
Salamis, who foresaw that the future of Athens lay by sea and who, as archon 
in 493/492 B.C., had begun the fortification of the Piraeus. Ten years later an 
exceptionally rich vein of silver was found in the state mines at Laurium. It 
was proposed to divide this windfall up among the citizens, but Themistocles 
persuaded the Assembly to use the money to build a new fleet. Two years later 
at Salamis we find that Athens had a fleet of 200 triremes, more than half the 
whole Greek force of 350 ships. 'Themistocles as admiral of the Athenian 
contingent had the greatest influence in the allied councils and devised the 
tactics that won victory at Salamis in 480 B.C. If Sparta remained the greatest 
land power among the Greeks, from now on there could be no doubt that 
Athens would take the lead by sea. 
When representatives of the thirty-one loyal Greek states had met at 
Corinth in 481 B.C. to plan resistance to Xerxes' imminent invasion, the al-
lies agreed without dispute to give Sparta command by both land and sea. 
News of Xerxes' preparations must have reached Greece a good time before 
this. He had summoned contingents from all over his empire and spent the 
winter of 481/480 at Sardis assembling and preparing his invasion force. Ac-
cording to Herodotus, his navy consisted of 1,207 ships and his army of 

240 
Athenaze: Book I 
1,700,000 fighting men. The figure for the navy may be approximately cor-
rect, but that for the army is absurd. It may have numbered 200,000. To bring 
this great host into Europe, Xerxes' engineers constructed two bridges of boats 
across the Hellespont (480 B.C.). When they were destroyed by a storm, two 
new and stronger bridges were built, and the army crossed the Hellespont and 
proceeded along the coast, supplied by the navy. At Mount Athos,off which the 
Persian fleet had been wrecked in 492 B.C., a canal had been dug across the 
promontory, one and a half miles or two and a half kilometers long, to fore-
stall a similar disaster (see map, page 230). The invading force continued 
inexorably through Macedonia and into Thessaly. There was no resistance; 
the Greeks had abandoned any idea of making a stand anywhere north of 
Thermopylae, the only place where geography made it possible to hold off the 
Persians by a combined operation by sea and land. The next defensible point 
was the Isthmus of Corinth, but withdrawal to this would mean abandoning 
Attica. Even the wall across the Isthmus would not provide effective defense, 
if the position could be circumvented by a landing of the Persian fleet south of 
the Isthmus. 
Around the outside of this cup four Athenian warships are being rowed, with dolphins 
leaping beside their prows. They are not triremes, which with 170 oarsmen were too 
complicated for any artist to draw on a vase, They are penteconters, which had fifty 
oarsmen. Note the helmsmen holding the steering oars, the high platform in the bows 
where the lookout stood, and the bronze beaks that were used for ramming the enemy.

Note that these demonstrative adjectives require the definite article to 
be used with the noun and that the adjectives stand outside the definite ar-
ticle-noun group, i.e., in the predicate position (see Chapter 5, Grammar 
7b, page 66), e.g.: 
. 
olitor; 6 av1\p or 6 aVf]p olito, = this man 
£lC£{Vl1 11 yuvft or it yuvi) ElCe{vl1 = that woman 
~61le to EPYOY or to EPYOV t61lE = this work

6. Interrogative and Indefinite Pronouns, Adjectives, and Adverbs 
In Chapter 7 (Grammar B and Grammar 9, pages 10B-109) you 
learned the interrogative pronDun «" «, who? what? and the cDrrespond-
ing indefinite adjective n" n, meaning a certain, a, Dr an. The inter-
rDgative prDnDun always has an acute accent, while the indefInite adjec-
tive is enclitic. 
InterrDgative adverbs also have cDrrespDnding indefInite, enclitic 
fDrms: 
InteITOgative Adverbs 
Indefinite Adverbs

when? 
, 
at some time, at one 
nOtE 
time, once, ever 
1tOle;; 
how? 
1t0l, 
somehow, in any way .. 
These indefInite adverbs cannot stand fIrst in their clause, and they 
attach themselves to' SDme impDrtant word as enclitics. 
If an enclitic is follDwed by anDther enclitic, the fIrst receives an ac-
cent but the secDnd does nDt, e.g.: Ouva<ov eo« 1tD,", it is ever passible. 
(Remember that eo« is enclitic.) If an enclitic is fDllowed by more than 
one enclitic, all but the last receive acute accents, e.g.: Ouva<ov eo« OD( 
1tD,", it is ever passible for you.

GRAMMAR 
1. Athematic 2nd Aorists 
The following common verbs form their aorist indicatives, impera. 
tives, and infinitives by adding the appropriate endings directly to a 
long·vowel stem without a thematic vowel in between. The participles are 
formed on the short-vowel stem. We call these athematic 2nd aorists. 
The aorist of ~atvro is used only in compounds in Attic Greek:

Translate into Greek, using athematic aorist verbs from page 252 with the 
prepositional prefixes <iva-, Bia-, iK:-, and Em- as appropriate (check the 
vocabularies at the end of the book as necessary). Participles and infini-

3rd Declension Nouns with Stems in -EO-
In Chapter 13, Grammar 4, pages 226-227, you learned the declension 
of nouns with stems in -ea-, such as ~O ~e'ixos (stem ~etxea-) and 1] ~Pt11P1lS 
(stem ~pt11pea-). The noun a eeILta~Ol<Aiis, ~oil eeILta~OKAEoUS also has a stem 
in -ea-, but with a preceding e so that the following contractions occur: 
Stem: eqlta~OKAe-ea-, Themistocles

Voc. 
c1 
eeILta~6KAe-ea- > 
eEJ.L1.0""C6lCA.et~ 
As usual, the intervocalic a is lost. The last two vowels then contract in 
the usual ways, except that after e the vowels e + a > ii, and not 11, thus ~ov 
eqlta~OKAeii. The names 'HpaKAiis, ITeptKAiis, and LO<pOKAiis are declined 
the same way.

Aeschylus's Persae 
255 
Aeschylus, the first of the three great Athenian writers of tragedy, had 
fought at the battle of Marathon and probably also at Salamis. He certainly 
saw the battle, and he has left us an eyewitness account of it. Eight years after 
the battle, he entered his play The Persians (JUpaat) in the dramatic contest at 
the festival of Dionysus in 472 B.C. This is our earliest extant Greek tragedy, 
and it is unique in that it has an historical theme; all other extant tragedies 
draw their plots from myth. For Aeschylus, human events were interwoven 
with the divine; he saw the defeat and humiliation of Xerxes as the supreme 
example of hubris (human pride) punished by Nemesis (Divine Vengeance). 
The scene of the play is Susa, the Persian capital, where the Elders anx-
iously wait for news of Xerxes' expedition. Since he left, they have heard 
nothing, and their hearts are heavy with foreboding as they wonder what has 
happened to the host that went forth in pride to cast the yoke of slavery on 
Greece. As they speculate gloomily, they see Atossa, the Queen-mother, ap-
proaching. She tells them that ever since her son left, she has been troubled by 
dreams and that now she has had a dream of unmistakable significance: she 
saw Xerxes yoke two women to his chariot, one in Asian dress, the other in 
Greek. The Asian woman was proud of her harness and was obedient to the 
reins, but the Greek struggled, tore the harness from the chariot, threw off the 
bridle, and broke the yoke. When Atossa woke and went to the altar to pray 
for deliverance from evil, she saw another terrible omen: an eagle (the king 
of birds = Xerxes) flew to Apollo's altar, pursued by a falcon (= the Greeks), 
which clawed at its head, while it cowered unresisting. 
As the Elders attempt to calm and comfort Atossa, a messenger is seen ap-
proaching in haste, who without preamble reveals the news they have 
dreaded: "Cities of all the lands of Asia, by one blow your great prosperity has 
been destroyed and the flower of the Persians is fallen and gone; the whole 
host has perished." 
While Atossa is stunned to silence, the Elders lament wildly until the 
queen recovers and with quiet dignity asks the messenger how it could have 
happened since the Persians surely outnumbered the Greeks. The messenger 
replies (337-347, tr. Podlecki): 
Be sure of this, that in a matter of sheer numbers, 
The ships on our side would have conquered, for the Greeks' 
Entire total of ships was only three hundred ten .... 
But the multitude of ships in Xerxes' fleet-I know 
The facts-were no less than a thousand, those in speed 
Surpassing, two hundred seven. This is the total sum. 
Was it here you think we were surpassed when battle came? 
No, not by numbers, but some Spirit crushed the host, 
Threw in an evil fate against us in the scales. 
The gods are keeping the Goddess Pallas' city safe. 
The messenger then describes the battle as follows (386-430, tr. Podlecki): 

256 
Athenaze: Book I 
But when the white-horsed chariot of dawn appeared 
And filled the entire earth with radiance to behold, 
The first thing was a sound, a shouting from the Greeks, 
A joyful song, and to it, making shrill response, 
From the island rocks about there came an antiphony 
Of echoes; fear stood next to each one of our men, 
Tripped up in their hopes: for not as if in flight 
Were the Greeks raising then a solemn paean-strain, 
But rushing into battle with daring confidence; 
A trumpet, too, blazed over everything its sound. 
At once, with measured stroke of surging, sea-dipped oar, 
They struck the brine and made it roar from one command, 
And quickly all of them were visible to sight. 
Their right wing first, in order just as they had been 
Arranged, led off, and next the whole remaining force 
Came out to the attack, and with the sight we heard 
A loud voice of command: "0 sons of Greeks, go on, 
Bring freedom to your fatherland, bring freedom to 
Your children, wives, and seats of your ancestral gods, 
And your forebears' graves; now the struggle is for all." 
Of ·course, on our side, too, a roar of Persian tongues 
Went forth in answer; the moment would not brook delay. 
Immediately ship struck its brazen-plated beak 
On ship. The ramming was begun by a Greek ship 
And it snapped off from one of the Phoenicians the whole 
Curving stern, and men on both sides shot their spears. 
At first the streaming Persian force withstood the shocks; 
But when their crowd of ships was gathered in the straits, 
And no assistance could be given one to another, 
But they were being struck by their own brazen rams, 
They kept on breaking all their eqnipage of oars, 
And the ships of the Greeks, with perfect plan and order, came 
Around them in a circle and struck, and hulls of ships 
Were overturned; and the sea no longer was visible, 
Filled as it was with shipwrecks and the slaughter of men. 
The beaches, too, and the reefs around were filled with corpses. 
Now every ship that came with the Persian armament 
Was being rowed for quick escape, no order left. 
And they kept striking us, deboning us, like tunnies 
Or a catch of fish, with broken fragments of oars, or bits 
Of flotsam from the wrecks; and all this time, moaning 
And wailing held control of that area of sea, 
Until the eye of black night took it away. 
So great a crowd of ills, not even ifI took 
Ten days in order to tell, could I tell the tale in fulL

The following rules for these contractions may be observed: 
1. 0+ E, 0, or ou > DU. 
2. 
0 + Et, ot, or'll> at. 
3. o+1]orro>ro. 
There are only a few contract verbs in -0-; examples are aporo, I plow, 
111]Aoro, I show, eAeugeporo, I free, set free, 1l0uA.6ro, I enslave, and 1tA1]poro, I 
fill. 
The futures and aorists obey the usual rules for contract verbs, 
lengthening the stem vowel. 
Exercise 15li 
Locate four examples of -0- contract verbs in reading passage f3 in this 
chapter and identify the form of each.

Translate into Greek: 
1. When the Athenians learned that the Persians were advancing (use 
present tense) toward Attica, they sent messengers to Delphi (use 0\ 
6EA.<pO{). 
2. These, having gone into the temple, asked the god what the Athenians 
must (Bet) do. 
3. The god, answering (use aorist participle), said: "Athena is not able 
(0" Buva,at) to save you. The barbarians will take Athens. Only 
the wooden (use ~UA.tVOC;, -ov) wall will be unsacked (use alt0pSllto<;, 
-ov). " 
4. The messengers wrote these words and having returned to Athens 
announced them to the people (dative). 
5. Themistocles, having stood up, said: "Hear, Athenians, what the ora-
cle (to XP1l0tT]ptov) means (A.EYEt); the ships of the Athenians are the 
wooden wall; for these will save the city." 
6. Having spoken thus, he persuaded the Athenians not to yield to the 
barbarians but to fight by sea.

• The preposition ,m6 + the genitive case, meaning by, will often be found with verbs in 
the passive voice, e.g., {mo 'trov ~app6:prov En £'{xov'tO, they were still being held by the 
barbarians. In the present and imperfect tenses the passive voice, introduced in this 
chapter, has the same forms as the middle voice, which you have seen since Chapter 6. 
In the following reading you will find a number of verbs with middle voice endings, 
with which you are familiar, but being used in the passive voice. The context will tell 
you whether the verb is being used as middle or passive; if it is accompanied by a 
prepositional phrase with lm6 + the genitive case, it is most likely passive.

GRAMMAR 
1. The Passive Voice 
For the concepts of active, passive, and middle voice, see Chapter 6, 
Grammar 2, pages 75-76. 
In the present and imperfect tenses, the passive forms of verbs are 
spelled the same as middle voice forms. In the aorist and future tenses, 
the forms are different, and those forms will be introduced in Book II of 
this course. For the present and imperfect tenses, the context will make 
clear whether the verb is middle or passive in meaning, e.g.: 
Active Voice: 
~ YUVTt ,bv avlipa Eyetpet. 
The woman wakes her husband. 
Middle Voice: 
6 aVflp eyeipe'tcn. 
The husband wakes himself up/wakes up. 
Passive Voice: 
6 avTtp uno m<; YUVUtlCOC £yelpe'tat. 
The husband is woken up by his wife. 
Note that the agent by whom the action is performed is expressed with 
the preposition uno + the genitive. The thing with which or by which the 
action is performed is expressed by a noun in the dative case (dative of 
means or instrument) without a preposition (see Chapter 6, Grammar 6d, 
page 88): 
6 A:()1(Q~ ltcqaioq 'ttJ7t'tE'tcn uno 'tau 1tuuS6<; 
The wolf is struck with a knife by the boy. 
Here is a set of examples with the imperfect tense: 
Active Voice: 
~ flTt""P 'OUs "allias ~A.01lEV. 
The mother was washing her children. 
Middle Voice: 
Ot na'icec; EA.O-UOV'to. 
The children were washing themselves/were washing. 
Passive Voice: 
Ot 1tciicec; uno 'CUe uU'too<; EAOUOVtO. 
/ 
The children were being washed by their mother.

The Athenian Empire 
During the invasion of Xerxes, the loyal Greeks had accepted without 
question the leadership of Sparta by both land and sea; for she was still the 
dominant power in Greece. In spring of 479 B.C., the allied fleet, led by a 
Spartan general, was based at Delos and, invited by the Samians, sailed to 
Ionia, defeated the Persians at Mycale, and liberated the Ionians, who re-
volted from their Persian masters (see map, page 230). The following year 
the allied forces were led by Pausanias, the Spartan commander at Plataea. 
In a brilliant campaign he first liberated most of Cyprus from Persian rule 
and then sailed north and took Byzantium, the key to the Black Sea. Here he 
fell victim to hubris; he adopted Persian dress, intrigued with the Persian 
authorities, and alienated the allies by his outrageous and tyrannical behav-
ior. In consequence, the allies appealed to the Athenians for protection, and· 
Pausanias was recalled to Sparta and later executed. 
Meanwhile the Athenians took over the leadership of the allies. Repre-
sentatives met at Delos and agreed to form a voluntary league (the Delian 
League) to carryon the war against Persia under the leadership of Athens. 
Each member state was to provide 'ships or money in proportion to its means, 
of which an assessment was made. The representatives threw lumps of lead 
into the sea and swore to maintain the League until the lead swam. 
Led by Cimon, their Athenian general, the fleet of the League had a series 
of very successful campaigus, expelling the Persian garrisons wherever they 
remained and finally defeating them in the great battle of the Eurymedon 
River on the southern coast of Asia Minor when they tried to make a come-
back (ca. 467 B.C.). As the Persian danger receded, some members became 
less willing to contribute ships or money .. Around 469 B.C. the important is-
land of N axos seceded from the League; the allied fleet blockaded the island 
and forced it back into the League on terms that made it a subject of Athens. 
This was the first step of the Athenians on the road to empire.

The Athenian Empire 
As time went by, more and more members ceased to provide ships and 
contributed money instead, and soon only three large and wealthy islands 
(Lesbos, Chios, and Samos) were independent members contributing ships. 
The rest had become tributary allies, in whose internal affairs Athens began 
to interfere. In 454 B.C., a highly significant step was taken when the treas-
ury of the League was transferred from Delos to Athens, ostensibly because 
the defeat of the Athenian expeditionary force in Egypt in 456 B.C. left the 
Aegean exposed to danger. 
A number of inscriptions carved on stone have been found in Athens that 
throw much light on the development and organization of the Empire in these 
years. These include records of the annual tribute paid by each member from 
454 B.C., when the treasury of the League was moved to Athens, until 415 B.C. 
We find that the Empire included nearly all the Aegean Sea and stretched 
from the coast of the Black Sea to the south of Asia Minor. In 449 B.C., the 
Athenians made peace with Persia; the purpose of the Delian League had 
come to an end. The following year the tribute list is very short; many mem-

bers must have refused to pay. We then find a decree that introduced mea-
sures for tightening up the collection of the tribute, and the next year's tribute 
list is long; recalcitrant members had been forced to pay up. At the same 
time, evidence accumulates of Athenian interference in the internal affairs 
of League members. Uniform coinage, weights, and measures are imposed 
by decree; democracies are installed in some cities under the supervision of 
Athenian officials; garrisons of Athenian troops are stationed at some dan-
ger points; settlements of Athenian citizens are made on allied territory; and 
judicial cases involving an Athenian and an ally are referred to Athenian 
courts. All such measures infringed the sovereignty of "independent" allies, 
who were being reduced to the status of subjects in what the Athenians now 
openly called their Empire (it apxit). 
These developments were inspired by Pericles, who dominated the Athe-
nian democracy for nearly thirty years, until his death in 429 B.C. They were 
largely responsible for the great war between Athens and the Peloponnesian 
League led by Sparta, for the Peloponnesians not only feared the ever-grow-
ing power of Athens but also condemned the "enslavement" of fellow Greeks. 
The final ultimatum sent by Sparta to Athens said: "The Spartans want 
peace; and there would be peace, if you let the Greeks be independent." Even 
at Athens not all approved of the Empire, despite the economic and military 
advantages it brought. Not even Pericles himself sought moral justification 
for it. In a speech to the people shortly before his death, he said: "The Empire 
you hold is a tyranny, which you may think it was wrong to acquire, but it is 
dangerous to give it up." 
Athenian tribute list 
This fragment records the tribute paid in 440/439 B.C. by the HeUespontine district of the 
Empire. In the columns below the heading (HEAAE~[]ONTlO~ <l)OPO~) are listed on the 
left the amount of tribute and on the right the name of the city concerned.

Mter the defeat at Salamis, Xerxes accompanied his army on the retreat

SYLLABLES AND ACCENTS 
A Greek word has as many syllables as it has vowels and diphthongs, e.g.: av-8pro-
1CO<;. 
In dividing words into syllables, single consonants go with the following vowel (note 
-noc;; in (Xv-apm-noe;; above); a group of consonants that cannot stand at the beginning of 
a word is divided between two syllables (note how the consonants yep are divided in av-
apm-noe; above); and double consonants are divided between syllables, e.g., 8a-AC(t-tlX. 
The final syllable is called the ultima, the next to the last, the penult, and the third 
from the end, the antepenult. These terms are useful in discussing the placement of ac-
cents. 
A syllable is said to be long (1) ifit contains a long vowel or diphthong or (2) if it con-
tains a short vowel followed by two or more consecutive consonants or by one of the 
double consonants ~, S. or lI', Exceptions to these rules are the diphthongs at and Ot, 
which are regarded as short when they stand as the final element in a word (except in the 
optative mood, to be studied in Book II). Note that 11 and ro are long vowels, E and a are 
short vowels, and Ct, t, and u may be either long or short-when long they are marked 
with a macron in this book. 
For the three types of accents, see Introduction, page xv. The acute accent can stand 
on any of the last three syllables of a word; the circumflex can stand on either of the last 
two syllables; and the grave can stand only on the ultima. The grave accent replaces an 
acute on the ultima when that word is followed immediately by another word with no in-
tervening punctuation, except when the following word is an enclitic (see below). 
The accent on finite forms of verbs is recessive, i.e., it is placed as far toward the be-
ginning of the word as is allowed by the rule in dl below. The accent on a noun, adjec-
tive, or participle is persistent, i.e., it remains as it is in the nominative case unless forced 
to change by one of the rules in d1 and d2 below. The placement of the accent in the nOID-
i~ative must be learned by observation, e.g.: a.v-8pm-1to~, 6-At-yO~, KCl-AO~, AU-O-J.lE-VO~, 
A:u-mv, and At-rcWV. 
Placement of Accents 
a. 
On the antepenult 
Only an acute accent may stand on the antepenult, e.g.: a.v-8pm-1to~. 
b. 
On the penult 
If the penult is accented, it will have a circumflex if it contains a diphthong or a long 
vowel and if the vowel or diphthong of the final syllable is short, e.g.: Ot-KO~, at-Kat. 
Otherwise, it will have an acute, e.g.: av-8pm-rcov, rco-vou. 
c. 
On the ultima 
If the ultima is accented, its accent will be an acute (changed to a grave as noted 
above) or a circumflex (by special rules, particularly in contract verbs). 
d. 
Shifts and changes of accent 
1. 
The acute cannot stand on the antepenult if the ultima is long. Therefore, a.v-
8pm-rco~ becomes nv-8pm-rcou in the genitive case. 
2. 
Since the circumflex can stand on the accented penult only if the vowel or diph-
thong of the ultima is short, the circumflex on ot-KO~ changes to an acute in the 
genitive case (Ot-KOU). 
284 
ENCLITICS AND PROCLITICS 
Enclitics lean upon the preceding word, and the two words taken together are 
accented to some extent as if they were one word. Enclitics met in Book I of Athenaze 
include the short forms of the personal pronouns (J.l0U, J.lOt, J.lE; crou, crat, crE); the 
indefinite pronoun and adjective 'tt~, n; the indefinite adverbs 1tO'l), 1tm~, 1to,d, noSEY, and 
not; the particle yE; the conjunction tE; and the forms of dJ.ll and <i>11J.ll in the present 
indicative (except for the 2nd person singular). 
a. 
An acute accent on the ultima of a word preceding an enclitic does not change to a 
grave, and the enclitic has no accent, e.g.: 
aypo~ n~ 
aypot nVE~. 
b. 
If a circumflex stands on the ultima of a word preceding an enclitic, the enclitic has 
no accent, e.g.: 
ayprov 't"tvmv 
_, 
c. 
A word with an acute on its penult does not change its accent when followed by an 
enclitic, but a disyllabic enclitic will require an accent on its ultima (an acute accent if 
the ultima is short and a circumflex ifit is long), e.g.: 
novo~ 'tt~ 
av8pO:l1t0'l) ttvO~ 
av8pmnmv nvrov 
The acute on the ultima of the enclitic will, of course, change to a grave if the enclitic 
is followed by another word with no intervening punctuation. 
d. 
A word with an acute on its antepenult will need to add an acute to its ultima to 
support an en.clitic, e.g.: 
a.vepmrc6~ 'tt~ 
liv8pw1tOl 'ttVEC; 
The enclitics need no accents. 
e. 
If a word has a circumflex on its penult, an acute accent is added to its ultima to 
support a following enclitic, e.g.: 
otKO~ 'tt~ 
olKol 'ttVE~ 
f. 
If an enclitic is followed by another enclitic, the first receives an acute accent but the 
second does not, e.g.: 
O'l)VCl'tOV Ecr'tl 0"01-
If an enclitic is followed by more'than one enclitic, all but the last r~ceive acute 
accents, e.g.: 
Buva'tov Ecrtt crOt note 
g. 
The enclitic Ecr'tt(V) receives an acute acent on its penult: 
1. 
when it stands at the beginning of its sentence or clause, e.g., ecrn AUKO~ EKEt. 
There's a wolf there. 
2. 
when it follows OUK, e.g., aUK ecrn AUlCO~ EKE1.. There isn't a wolf there. 
3. 
when it means it is possible, e.g., cr1tEUSE, i11t1i'tEp· au yap ecrnv O:1tEAaUVetv 'tOY 
AUlCOV. Hurry, father; for it's not possible to drive the wolf away. 
Note: the other enclitic forms of Ei~t retain their accents when they follow OUK, and 
the proclitic has no accent, e.g.: aUK d~l ttpyoC;. I am not lazy. See neXt page. 
285 

286 
Athenaze: Book I 
Proclitics 
Proclitics are words of a single syllable that normally do not have accents, e.g., au 
and d. The following words are proclitic: the adverbs ou, aUK, OUX; the definite articles 0, 
il, ai, and at; the prepositions EV, dC;, E1(, and f:S; the conjunctions Ei and 00<;; and the adverb 
roc;. When followed by enclitics, they must be accented, e.g.: 
Et tv; 
au ne; 
Exceptions: D1lle followed by an enclitic form of ei).Li, e.g., oine el).Ll. fipyoc;. I am not 
lazy. See the previous page for aUK followed by EO"-ri(v). Here is how the six forms of d).Ll 
are accented with OUK: 
01n. ei).Li

aUK eanCv) 
aUK EO'JlEV 
aUK eate

VOCABULARY 
We do not give principal parts of contract verbs except when they are irregular. 
For the principal parts of most compound verbs, see the corresponding simple verb. 
We give the principal parts of other regular and irregular verbs, with their stems 
when their stems are different from what is seen in the present indicative fonn and with 
their aorist participles. 
For compound verbs we give in brackets the prefix and the simple verb when elision 
or elision and assimilation take place, e.g. a<pucveoj.tcn [= a1to- + bCVEOj.tat}.
