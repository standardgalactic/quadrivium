ABOUT THE AUTHOR
My analytical core and love of all things virtualization related have helped me
excel through a career spanning over 20 years and specifically with VMware
products, starting from their first tentative steps into the market with GSX in
2001 right up to today’s vSphere 6.5 version. I am passionate, versatile, goal
driven and fanatical with process control. I believe in working hard but playing
harder, I am a family man and keen endurance runner.
