Preface
Solar energy is clean, environmentally friendly and freely available over the planet
earth. Life on earth also owes its existence to solar energy. Solar energy is used to
produce thermal as well as electrical power. If fossil fuels continue to be depleted at
the present rate, they will be exhausted soon. The use of fossil fuels is also largely
responsible for increasing pollution and resulting climate change. Solar energy and
other renewable sources, enable us to meet the demand for energy, while offering a
cleaner and greener footprint.
In the recent past, there has been rapid development in solar thermal tech-
nologies and photovoltaic (PV) materials. This development brought cost effec-
tiveness to solar devices. Based on the developments in the ﬁeld of solar
technology, we decided to compose a handbook of solar energy, which goes
beyond the usual and brings together a myriad of current topics such as
Day-lighting, Solar cell materials, Photovoltaic thermal (PVT) systems, Energy
conservation, Solar power generation, Thermodynamics, Solar cooling of houses,
Energy and exergy analysis, CO2 credit, Energy Matrices, Life Cycle analysis with
and without CO2 credit.
The main objective of writing this book is to create a comprehensive and
easy-to-understand source of information on the advances in this rapidly growing
research area. This book includes enough information on the basics to be used as a
textbook undergraduate coursework in for engineering and the sciences. The
inclusion of advanced concepts and research trends will also make it useful as a
reference for scientists and professionals. An attempt has also been made to give
solved examples and exercise problems with hint and objective questions at
appropriate place in each chapter for better understanding of solar energy
applications.
This book consists of twenty chapters. The basics of hourly, daily, monthly solar
radiation on horizontal and inclined surfaces and sun-earth angles have been dis-
cussed brieﬂy in Chap. 1. The various natural day lighting system with examples
have been discussed in Chap. 2. Chapter 3 deals with the basic elements of heat
transfer mechanisms, laws of thermodynamics and exergy which have been used
vii

throughout text. Effects of nano-particles with water as a base ﬂuid have also been
discussed brieﬂy. Chapter 4 discusses different solar cell materials, PV modules, PV
arrays and its applications in various sectors. Solar ﬂuid collectors namely con-
ventional ﬂat plate collectors (FPC’s), solar concentrators and evacuated tubular
collectors (ETC’s) are dealt with in Chaps. 5−7. Chapter 8 discusses industrial solar
water heating systems for different modes of operation. The modeling of PVT solar
air heaters and their applications are reported in Chap. 9. The various passive
concepts of heating/cooling of a house with approximate methods and solar cooling
houses have been brieﬂy discussed in Chaps. 10 and 11, respectively. Chapters 12
and 13 cover other solar thermal applications namely solar crop drying and solar
distillation systems with basic heat transfer, thermal modeling and examples.
Energy analyses of solar thermal and PV systems have been covered in Chap. 14.
Solar energy storage in different modes is discussed in Chap. 15. Solar power
generation by means of photovoltaic (grid and off-grid) and solar concentrating
have been considered in Chap. 16. Chapters 17 and 18 report applications of solar
thermal energy, which has not been covered in preceding chapters and cover energy
conservation in different sectors. Study of exergy, CO2 mitigation, carbon credit,
and life cycle cost analysis of some solar thermal and PV system, which is the
backbone of its success, is included in Chaps. 19 and 20, respectively.
SI units are used throughout the book. Some conversion units, various physical
and chemical properties of water, air, metals and non-metals are also given as
appendices.

Solar Radiation
Abstract Solar energy from the Sun gives life to human beings and all living
organism on planet Earth. The existence of an atmosphere with greenhouse gases
(GHG) between the Sun and the Earth is responsible for the survival of human
beings in the terrestrial region. The Sun is responsible for all renewable energy
sources on Earth, which meet the needs of human being. Solar radiation is treated as
an electromagnetic wave with wavelength between 0.30 and 3 μm as well as
photons in a visible wave length.

General Introduction

Basic Concept of Energy
Today, energy is one of the major needs of society. The total amount of energy in
the universe is constant. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be
transformed from one state to another. For example, two billiard balls colliding may
come to rest with the resulting energy becoming sound and perhaps a bit of heat
during collision.
Energy, the environment, and economic development of a country are closely
related. The proper use of energy requires consideration of social impacts as well as
technological ones. Indeed, the sustainable economic growth of a country may be
possible only by the well-planned and efﬁcient use of fossil fuel and locally
available natural resources such as solar energy, wind, hydro, and biomass. This
improves the quality of everyone’s lives on planet Earth.

1.1.2
Source of Solar Energy
The source of solar energy is the Sun [1], which is the largest member of the solar
system with other members revolving around it. The Sun, having a diameter of
1:39  109 m, is at an average distance of 1:5  1011 m from the Earth. It is a sphere
of intensely hot gaseous matter. The Sun rotates on its axis approximately once
every 4 weeks.
It is known that 90 % of the Sun’s energy is generated in a spherical region
having a radius 0.23 times the Sun’s radius. The average density (ρ) and the
temperature (T) in this region are 105 kg=m3 and approximately 8  40
ð
Þ  106 K,
respectively. Energy generated in the region is due to several fusion reactions. In
fusion, two hydrogen molecules (i.e., four protons) combine to form one helium
nucleus at approximately 107 K. The mass of the helium nucleus is less than that of
four protons. The mass, having been lost in the reaction, is converted into energy by
the relation given by Einstein, i.e., E ¼ mc2. The fusion reaction is given by
H2 þ H2 ¼ He þ 25 MeV
ð1:1Þ
The produced energy E ¼ mc2
ð
Þ is transferred to the outer surface of the Sun by
convection. The temperature and the density drop, respectively, to approximately
1:3  105 K and 70 kg=m3 from the centre to 0:7R. Therefore, in the region beyond
0.7R, convection dominates the heat transfer; hence, the region from 0.7R to R is
termed the “convective zone.” The outer layer of the convective zone is known as
the “photosphere.”
The periphery of the photosphere has low density. Above the photosphere there
is a layer of cooler gases called the “reversing layer.” Outside the reversing layer,
there is a layer referred to as the “chromosphere.” The Sun has an effective
black-body temperature Ts
ð

Solar energy is radiated into space, which is calculated using the following
formula:
E ¼ rT4
s
ð1:2Þ
ε and σ are, respectively, the emissivity of the surface and the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant.
Solar energy from the Sun can be classiﬁed as a heat (electromagnetic waves)
and light (photons), respectively. Basically, the Sun is responsible to produce
directly most of the renewable energy sources (Fig. 1.1) [2]. It is also responsible
for providing indirect sustenance for nonrenewable sources such as fossil fuels.
Fossil fuels are actually solar energy stored millions and millions of years ago.
A schematic diagram of the structure of the Sun is depicted in Fig. 1.2a [1].

Formation of the Atmosphere
The Earth, another member of the solar system, came into existence some
4.6 × 109 years ago. The Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical shape once
per year as shown in Fig. 1.2b [2]. The Earth is almost round in shape and has a
diameter of approximately 13,000 km. The Earth is inclined at 23.5° and rotates
about its self-axis (Fig. 1.2c [2]). The inner core of the Earth is a solid comprising
iron and nickel unlike the Sun. Its outer core constitutes a melted state of iron and
nickel. The outer core is the Earth’s mantle comprises solid rock. The outermost
crust that covers the mantle also constitutes solid rock. The oldest rocks of sedi-
mentary origin appear to be approximately 3.7 × 109 years old. Nearly 70 % of the
Earth is covered by water, and the remaining 30 % is land. It is estimated that the
black-body temperature of Earth is approximately 288 K ð15 CÞ.

General Introduction

The Earth’s crust and uppermost mantle form the lithosphere.
According to plate tectonic theory, the rigid outer shell, or lithosphere, of the
Earth is divided into plates, which pull away from each other, slide past each other,
or move toward each other. The various gases stored inside the Earth might have
escaped 1 million years back into atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases
(GHG). The GHG are ozone (O3), oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide
(CO2), carbon mono-oxide (CO), and water vapour (H2O). GHG move toward the
Sun and becomes stable between the Sun and the Earth. The region of these stable
gases between the Sun and the Earth is known as the “atmosphere,” (Fig. 1.3),
which is porous in nature. It is also referred as the “Earth’s atmosphere” due to it
being nearer to the Earth.

Solar Radiation

The atmosphere has two unique properties:
(i) It transmits short-wavelength radiation (0.23–2.26 μm) coming from the Sun.
(ii) It behaves as opaque for long-wavelength radiation (>2.26 μm).
The region between the Sun and atmosphere is known as the “extraterrestrial
region.” The terrestrial region is deﬁned as the area between the atmosphere and
the Earth.

General Introduction

Half of the Earth is lit by short wavelength sunlight at a time. The Earth con-
stantly spins around its axis. The inclined axis (at approximately 23.5°) of the Earth
causes variable lengths of day and night.
Solar radiation coming from the Sun is reﬂected back to space from the Earth
(approximately 4 %) and its atmosphere (26 %). The amount of radiation reﬂected
back to space is known as “albedo.” The amount of albedo depends on type of soil,
plantation cover over the Earth’s surface, and cloud distribution [3].
1.1.4
Solar Spectrum
The emitted solar spectrum (solar radiation having wavelength from zero to inﬁnity)
from the Sun is obtained due to the combined effect of solar radiation emitted and
absorbed in different layers. Most of the solar spectrum (solar radiation) is emitted
from the photosphere. The photosphere is opaque and strongly ionized; hence, it
can absorbs and emit the whole spectrum of radiation. The spectral distribution of

The variation of Ekb for temperature of 6000 K (the Sun’s temperature) and

respectively. Furthermore, the comparison between two results is shown in
Fig. 1.5c.
It should be noted from Figs. 1.5a that the wavelength of solar radiation emitted
from the Sun at approximately 6000 K varies from zero to inﬁnity in the absence of
the
atmosphere.
However,
only
solar
radiation
of
wavelength
between
0:23 and 2:26 lm is allowed to pass through the atmosphere from the extraterrestrial
region to the terrestrial region. The remaining solar radiation is either reﬂected from
the top of atmosphere (albedo) or absorbed by the atmosphere. The solar radiation
of wavelength between 0:23 and 2:26 lm is known as “short wavelength radiation.”
The wavelength of radiation emitted by the Earth at 288 Kð25 CÞ lies in the range
of more than 3 lm and it is referred to as “long wavelength radiation,” which is not
allowed to pass through the atmosphere from the terrestrial region to the extrater-
restrial region. Some time, the atmosphere is also referred to as device that traps the
desired solar radiation in the terrestrial region. The comparison of this radiation
from the Sun and the Earth is shown in Fig. 1.5c.

Due to elliptical orbit of the Earth’s motion around the Sun, the Sun‒Earth distance

1.7 %. The solar intensity (solar radiation/solar irradiance) in the extraterrestrial
region has been measured (by NASA through satellite). For the nth day of the year,

where Isc is the solar constant deﬁned as the radiant solar (energy) ﬂux received in
the extraterrestrial region on a plane of unit area kept perpendicular to the solar

1367 W/m2.
For June 22, 2013, n = 173, Iext ¼ 1322:49 W=m2 (Eq. 1.6)
For December 21, 2013, n = 355, Iext ¼ 1411:43 W=m2 (Eq. 1.6)
It should be noted that for leap year, February month has 29 days and,
accordingly, the value of n is increased by 1 in Eq. (1.6) after February 28. For a
normal year, the variation of extraterrrestrial radiation on the Earth’s surface for end
of each month using Eq. (1.6) can be determined as follows (Fig. 1.6):

Air Mass
It is important to mention that the solar radiation in the extraterrestrial region has a
certain direction. When the radiation passes through atmosphere consisting of
GHG, there is atmospheric attenuation. The amount of attenuation is governed by
the air mass. The air mass is a ratio between the paths travelled by the solar
radiation through the atmosphere to the mass travelled by the solar radiation if the
Sun is at its zenith. For noon time, this ratio is unity. The larger values of air
mass implies greater attenuation. An expression for air mass referring to Fig. 1.7 is
given by

the 21st compared with other days as expected.
1.1.7
Solar Time
Solar time is a reckoning of the passage of time with reference to the position of the
Sun in the sky, which has the fundamental unit of a day. Solar time is of two types,

namely, apparent solar time and mean solar time (clock time or standard time).
The difference in minutes between solar time and standard time is
Solar time  standard time ¼ 4 Lst  Lloc

ð1:8aÞ
where Lst is the standard meridian for the local time zone. Lst for India has the
value 81°44′. Lloc is the longitude of the location in question (in degrees west)
(Table 1.1), and E is the equation of time (in minutes), which is given by the
expression:

Sun‒Earth Angles
A better understanding of Sun‒Earth angles is essential for estimating solar
intensity throughout year for any surface at any place with a desired inclination and
orientation. These Sun‒Earth angles are deﬁned below.
Latitude (ϕ): The latitude of an observer (location) on the Earth’s surface is the
angle made between the radial line joining the observer (location) with the centre of
the Earth, and its projection on the equatorial plane as shown in Fig. 1.9. For an
observer in the northern hemisphere, latitude is positive, whereas for the southern
hemisphere it is negative. The latitude for some places in world are given in
Table 1.1.
Declination (δ): Declination is deﬁned as the angle between the line joining the
centres of the Sun and the Earth, which also determines the direction of the direct
rays coming from the Sun and their projection on the equatorial plane as shown in
Fig. 1.9. Declination is due to the rotation of the Earth around an axis, which makes
an angle of either 66:5 with the plane or 23:5 with normal rotation around the Sun
as shown in Fig. 1.9. The declination is calculated by the following relation [4]:
d ¼ 23:45 sin 360

The variation of the declination angle with the nth day of year is shown in
Fig. 1.10. The maximum value of d is 23.45° (June 21), and minimum value of d
is −23.45° (December 21)
Hour angle (ω): This is the angle between projections of the Sun’s rays (solar
meridian) and the line running south‒north through centre. The south‒north line is
also referred to as the “line due south.” In other words, the hour angle is deﬁned as
the angular displacement of the Sun from the local meridian because of the Earth’s
rotation around its own axis. The hour angle corresponding to 1 h is 15°. The
values of the hour angle in the northern hemisphere are listed in Table 1.2.
Expression for the hour angle is given by

respectively.
Zenith (θz): The angle between Sun’s rays; the line perpendicular to a horizontal
plane is known as the “zenith angle” (Fig. 1.9).

Altitude or solar altitude angle (α): The angle made between a horizontal plane
and the Sun’s rays is known as the “altitude angle.” Referring to Fig. 1.9,
a ¼ 90  hZ.
Slope (β): This is the angle between the plane surface under consideration and
the horizontal surface (tangential plane at observer), Fig. 1.11. Its numerical value
is considered positive for slope toward the south and negative for slope toward the
north.
Surface azimuth angle (γ): The angle made between the line due south and the
projection of normal to the inclined surface on the horizontal plane (tangential plane
at observer on the surface of the Earth, Fig. 1.11) is termed the “surface azimuth
angle.” In the northern hemisphere, conventionally γ is negative (positive for the
southern hemisphere) for projections in east of south and positive (negative for
southern hemisphere) for projections falling west of south. The values of γ for some
orientations are given in Table 1.3.

Solar azimuth angle (γs): The angle made between the projection of beam
radiation on the horizontal plane and the line due south is known as the “solar

same as the sign convention of the surface azimuth angle.

sunrise to sunset. It is deﬁned in terms of the hour angle as

Here 1 h = 15°.
Angle of incidence (θi): The angle made between normal to the inclined surface

It is important to note here that the values of N cannot be determined at u ¼ 90;
hence, N should be calculated for values less than 90°.

1.2.1
Solar Radiation
Solar radiation, while passing from the extraterrestrial region to the terrestrial region
through the Earth’s atmosphere, suffers scattering losses and atmospheric absorp-
tion. After absorption by the atmosphere, the rate of normal solar ﬂux (normal solar
radiation/irradiance) reaching the Earth’s surface is determined by
IN ¼ Iext  exp  m:e:TR þ a
ð
Þ
½

ð1:13Þ
where m is the air mass. This is given by Eq. (1.7b), and TR, the turbidity factor, is
deﬁned as the cloudiness/haziness factor for the lumped atmosphere. The values of
TR and a for different weather and ﬂat-land conditions (cases a, b, c and d as
deﬁned earlier) are given in Appendix IIIA. These values were calculated from the
10-year average data obtained at the airport, which is the only ﬂat condition from
the Indian Metrological Department (IMD), Government of India, Pune, India.

Solar Radiation

These values have been calculated for New Delhi, but they valid for latitude after
meeting the weather conditions deﬁned previously.
The expression for ε, known as the integrated optical-thickness of the terrestrial
clear and dry atmosphere/Rayleigh atmosphere (dimensionless), is given by
e ¼ 4:529  104  m2  9:66865  103  m þ 0:108014
The a in Eq. (1.13) is known as “lumped atmospheric parameters,” which
accommodate further attenuation of direct normal irradiance in the terrestrial zone
because of cloudiness/haziness level, anisotropic behaviour, and unpredictable
changes in atmospheric conditions while reaching toward the Earth’s surface. The
values of a for different weather conditions are given in Appendix IIIA. Case “e” in
the appendix is the average value of all weather conditions.
The additional depletion in direct normal irradiance can be attributed to the
reasons given below:
(i) the variation of particle content and size or both in aerosol;
(ii) irregular variation of disturbances in the terrestrial region due to different
temperatures in different layers.
For a ¼ 0; TR ¼ TL and Eq. (1.13) reduces to the classical equation given by
Linke [7]. It is important to mention here that the value of TL is taken by consid-
ering the combined effect of aerosol and other particulate matter in the clear sky.
Furthermore, Perez et al. [8]. have proposed another correlation to predict direct
normal irradiance (solar radiation) in the terrestrial region, which is given by
IN ¼ Iext  exp

ð1:14Þ
The Linke turbidity factor TR
ð
Þ for different months and for different conditions,
namely, city, ﬂat land, and mountain, are given in Appendix IIIB. It is also
important to mention that the value of the Linke turbidity factor
TR
ð
Þ is for
clear-sky conditions only. Furthermore, one can see that the values of TR (Appendix
IIIB) for clear (case a) sky and ﬂat condition only are nearly same. Differences in
values occur because of a in Eq. (1.13).
The wavelength range of normal irradiance/solar radiation (IN) in the terrestrial
region is between 0:23 and 2:26 lm.
Nearly (30 %) of the normal solar irradiance/radiation coming toward the
Earth’s surface is reﬂected back into the atmosphere without changing its wave-
length range (0.23–2.26 μm) and is further allowed passage from the terrestrial
region to the extraterrestrial region. The remainder of normal solar radiation is
absorbed by the Earth’s surface. The extraterrestrial, atmosphere, and terrestrial
regions are depicted in Fig. 1.13a. Nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases present in the
ionosphere absorb X-rays and very small ultraviolet radiations. Ultraviolet radia-
tions (λ < 0.40 μm) are absorbed by the ozone, and infrared radiations (λ < 2.3 μm)
1.2

are absorbed by water vapor. Therefore, after passing through the atmosphere, the
wavelength below 0.29 μm and above 2.3 μm in solar radiation will be almost
completely absorbed. Solar radiations are further attenuated due to scattering by
water vapour, air molecules, and other particulates. This scattered solar radiation is
known as “diffuse radiation.” Figure 1.13b represents the attenuation of solar
radiation as it propagates through the atmosphere from the extraterrestrial to the
terrestrial region. It also depicts the solar radiation emitted from the Sun and Earth
(which is also referred as “radiosity/radiant existence” (W/m2)).
Therefore, the wavelength range of solar radiation available in the terrestrial
region for the use of solar energy applications is 0.29–2.3 μm. Due to scattering in
the atmosphere, solar radiation has two components (beam and diffuse radiation) in
the terrestrial region.
Beam radiation (Ib): This is a normal component of solar radiation (normal
irradiance) in W/m2 propagating along the line joining the receiving surface and the
Sun on a horizontal/inclined surface. It has a direction and also termed “direct
radiation.”
Diffuse radiation (Id): This is the solar radiation (in W/m2) scattered by aerosols
and other particulates; diffuse radiation does not have any deﬁnite direction.

The total radiation (I): This is the sum of the beam (direct) and diffuse radiation
in W/m2. It is also known as “global radiation.”
Irradiation (radiant exposure): The incident solar radiation/irradiance on a
surface in J/m2 per hour or per day is known as “irradiation.” It is obtained by
integrating beam/diffuse/total radiation over 1 h or day.
Equation (1.13) gives the magnitude of normal irradiance (solar radiation) in the
terrestrial region. This means that the magnitude of diffuse radiation, which has no
direction due to scattering from below the atmosphere, will depend on Iext  IN
ð
Þ.
Therefore, the expression for diffuse radiation in W/m2 has been proposed by Singh
and Tiwari [9] as follows:
Id ¼ K1 Iext  IN
ð
Þ cos hZ þ K2
ð1:15Þ
where the numerical values for K1 and K2 for different weather are given in
Appendix IIIA. Equation (1.15) is applicable to a horizontal surface (tangential
surface to the observer at the outer surface of the Earth).
Furthermore, weather classiﬁcations for a given climatic condition are deﬁned
according to sunshine hours (N) and ratios of daily diffuse to daily global radiation.
These are brieﬂy described as follows:
(a) Clear day (blue sky): For clear days, the ratio of daily diffuse radiation in
J/m2 to daily total (global) radiation in J/m2 is ≤0.25 and for sunshine hours
(N) is ≥9 h.
(b) Hazy day (fully): For hazy days, the ratio of daily diffuse radiation in J/m2 to
daily total (global) radiation in J/m2 is between 0.25 and 0.5 and for sunshine
hours (N) is between 7 and 9 h.
(c) Hazy and cloudy (partially): For hazy and cloudy days, the ratio of daily
diffuse radiation in J/m2 to daily total (global) radiation in J/m2 is between 0.5
and 0.75 and for sunshine hours (N) is between 5 and 7 h.
(d) Cloudy day (fully): For cloudy days, the ratio of daily diffuse radiation in
J/m2 to daily total (global) in J/m2 radiation is ≥0.75 and for sunshine hours
is ≤5 h.
Example 1.9 Determine the average temperature of the Earth in the absence of
atmosphere.
Solution
In the absence of atmosphere, there is neither extraterrestrial region nor terrestrial
region. The average normal irradiance (beam/direct) will be equal to the solar
constant (ISC) i.e., 1367 W/m2.

case, it will be a frozen world. This shows that the existing atmosphere between the

Example 1.10 Calculate the fraction of outgoing radiation from the Earth that is
blocked by the atmosphere.
Solution
The albedo from the Earth and atmosphere is nearly 30 %; therefore, only 70 % of

Energy and Environment
During the conversion of nonrenewable energy (fossil fuels) from one form to
another (high-grade energy, i.e., electricity), there is an emission of pollutants,
which generally affects the environment. The study of energy, particularly solar
energy, must include the impact of energy production/use on the environment.
Currently fossil fuels are an essential necessity for industrial growth and day-to-day
activities, but they have undesirable ill effects on environment. The environment
has been paying a heavy price for humans using high-grade energy (electricity) to
meet their energy-based requirements.
During the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gases, vehicle
engines, furnaces, and even ﬁreplaces) for producing power, the emitted pollutants,
namely carbohydrates, are strongly responsible for smog, acid rain, global warm-
ing, and climate change. The high level (>400 ppm) of environmental pollution is a
serious concern for human health, plant growth, and wildlife. Air pollution caused
by the emission of GHG creates problems for human health as well as that of
wildlife. Air pollution also damage the ozone layer, which leads to ill effects on the
environment and its assets. The impact of air pollution is independent of the source
of air pollution, i.e., it may affect places other than the source of the pollution.
Pollutants responsible for the air pollution along with their sources are listed below.
Carbon
monoxide
(CO):
This
is
produced
from
the
combustion
of
carbon-based fuels as well as some natural and synthetic products. It has very bad
effects on human health.
Carbon dioxide (CO2): This is emitted mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFC): Prime sources of CFCs are refrigeration and
air-conditioning systems. These gases are mainly responsible for deterioration of
the ozone layer.
Lead: The major sources of lead are lead batteries, gasoline, petroleum, paints,
and dye products, etc.
Ozone (O3): This is produced from the reaction between volatile organic
compounds and oxides of nitrogen emitted from vehicles and industries.
Nitrogen oxide (NOx): This is produced due to the combustion of fossil fuels
such as diesel, coal, and petroleum.
Suspended particulate matter (SPM): These are very ﬁne solid particles sus-
pended in air in the form of vapour, smoke, and dust.
Sulphur dioxide (SO2): This is a gas produced from burning coal in different
process and industries. The major sources of sulphur dioxide production are metal
industries, paper industries, and thermal power plants.
The major areas of environmental problems may be classiﬁed as follows:
• Water pollution
• Ambient air quality
26

Solar Radiation

• Hazardous air pollutants
• Maritime pollution
• Solid waste disposal
• Land-use and land-siting impacts
• Acid rain
• Stratospheric ozone depletion
• Global climate change (greenhouse effect).

Instruments to Measure Solar Radiation
Instruments used to measure solar radiation are as follows:
1.4.1
Pyrheliometer
Solar radiations are measured by comparing the temperatures of two identical
blackened Manganin strips. Each strip is connected with a thermocouple and electric
heater (Fig. 1.14). For measuring the radiation, one strip is shaded and heated by an
electrical current passing through it, whereas the other is heated by absorbing the
solar radiations incident on it. The roles of strips are interchanged for second set of
observations to nullify the effect of unavoidable minor differences in the properties
of the strips. When the temperatures of both strips are same, the electrical energy
used in heating the ﬁrst strip will be equal to the solar energy absorbed by the second
strip. Solar radiation absorbed by second strip is obtained by dividing the electrical
energy with the product of the strip area and its absorptivity.

Energy and Environment
27

1.4.2
Pyranometer
A pyranometer is used to measure the global solar radiation received from the entire
hemisphere on a horizontal surface as shown in Fig. 1.15. The working principle is the
same as that of a pyrheliometer. In this case, the sensitive surface, i.e., hot junction
(blackened multijunction circular thermopiles) is exposed to total (beam + dif-
fuse + reﬂected from Earth and surroundings) radiations. The temperature difference
between hot and cold junctions is a function of the solar radiation falling on the
surface. The sensitive surface is covered by two concentric hemispherical glass
domes. This shields it from wind and rain. and also reduces the convection currents.
A pyranometer measures diffuse radiation with an occulting disc. This disc
blocks the beam radiation from the surface. It may be noted that the pyranometers
are calibrated to measure the solar radiation on a horizontal surface.
The output voltage corresponding to the incident solar radiation is detected and
measured by a potentiometer. Electronic integrators are used to record the solar
radiation during a certain time period. Pyranometers based on the silicon solar cell
are commonly used for solar-energy measurement because the light current in these
solar cells linearly varies with incident solar radiation.
For the measurement of diffuse solar radiation, a shading circular ring is used
over a sensor of the pyranometer to block all incoming direct/beam solar radiation.
The position of the shading circular ring is ﬁxed for a particular day due to ﬁxed
path of Sun’s motion for a given nth day of the year.

1.4.3
Sunshine Recorder
This is an instrument for measuring the duration of bright sunshine in hours. It
consists of a glass sphere mounted in a section of a spherical brass bowl with grooves
to hold the recorder cards. The sphere burns a trace on the card after being exposed to
the Sun. The length of the trace is a direct measure of the duration of bright sunshine.
There are sets of grooves to take three sets of cards, namely, (i) a long curved card for
summer, (ii) a short curved card for winter, and (iii) straight cards for equinoxes.

Here, the solar radiation (Io) incident on a horizontal plane in the extraterrestrial

For estimating diffuse radiation from the hourly, daily, and monthly data of solar
radiation, one must know the clearness index parameters as follows:
(i) Hourly clearness index (kT)
This is the ratio of hourly data of solar radiation, Eq. (1.21a), in the terrestrial
region to hourly data solar radiation, Eq. (1.17), in the extraterrestrial region. I(t) It
is given by
kT ¼ I

where I is the measured hourly solar radiation, and Io is obtained from Eq. (1.18).

the estimation of hourly total solar radiation on any inclined surface, the hourly
values of beam and diffuse radiation on a horizontal surface are required.

Solar Radiation on an Inclined Surface
1.6.1
Conversion Factors
For any inclined surface, there are three type of solar radiation, namely, (i) beam,
(ii) diffuse, and (iii) reﬂected solar radiation from a horizontal surface and the
surfaces surrounding it. Hence, there are three conversion factors, namely, for beam
(Rb), diffuse (Rd), and reﬂected (Rr) solar radiations. These conversion factors
convert the beam and diffuse solar radiations of a horizontal surface to those of an
inclined surface. These conversion factors are as follows:
For beam radiation: The conversion factor for beam radiation (Rb) is deﬁned as
the ratio of beam radiation incident on an inclined surface I0
b
 
in W/m2 to that on a
horizontal surface in W/m2, Eq. (1.20) Ib ¼ IN  cos hZ
ð
Þ.
The ﬂux of beam radiation incident on an inclined surface (I0
b) is given by
I0
b ¼ IN cos hi
ð1:25Þ
where hz and hi are the angles of incidence on the horizontal and inclined, surfaces
respectively (Fig. 1.11), and IN is the intensity of normal irradiance/solar radiation
incidence to the inclined surface (Eq. 1.3). Now, (Rb) for beam radiation can be
obtained as,
Rb ¼ I0
b
Ib
¼ cos hi
cos hz
ð1:26Þ
Depending on the orientation of inclined surface, the expression for cos hi and
cos hz can be obtained from Eqs. (1.10) and (1.11), respectively.
The variation of Rb with nth days of the year for is shown in Fig. 1.16.
For diffuse radiation: The conversion factor for diffuse radiation (Rd) is deﬁned
as the ratio of diffuse radiation incident on an inclined surface in W/m2 to that on a
horizontal surface in W/m2. Lack of any established method for ﬁnding the dis-
tribution of diffuse radiation over the sky makes its estimation very difﬁcult.
However, diffuse radiation can be estimated by considering the sky as the isotropic
source of diffuse radiation. For a tilted surface at an angle b from the horizontal
surface, the conversion factor for diffuse radiation is given as follows:
Rd ¼ 1 þ cos b
2
ð1:27Þ
For reﬂected solar radiation: Reﬂected solar radiations are radiations reﬂected
from the ground and other objects near surface of interest. Assuming that reﬂected
radiations are diffuse and isotropic, the conversion factor for reﬂected solar radia-
tion (Rr) is given by:

It may be mentioned here that both the beam and diffuse components of solar
radiation undergo reﬂection from the ground and the surroundings. The variations
of (Rd) and Rr with inclination b
ð Þ are shown in Fig. 1.17.
For total solar radiation: The ratio of total solar radiation incident on a
inclined/tilted (IT) surface to that on a horizontal surface, I(t), is the conversion factor
of total solar radiation on inclined/tilted surface, R0, which is calculated as follows:
R0 ¼ IT
I tð Þ ¼ IbRb þ IdRd

Total Solar Radiation on an Inclined/Tilted Surface
For any inclined surface, Liu and Jordan [13] estimated total solar radiation using
the following relation:
IT ¼ IbRb þ IdRd þ qRr Ib þ Id
ð
Þ
ð1:30Þ
Ib and Id are calculated using Eqs. (1.20) and (1.15) respectively; Rb, Rd, and Rr
are estimated using Eqs. (1.26–1.28). The value of the reﬂection coefﬁcient q is 0.2
for ordinary ground, and for snow-covered ground its value is 0.6.
Equation (1.30) can only be used for known measured data of hourly beam and
diffuse solar radiation as discussed in Sect. 1.4.2.
If measured data of hourly beam and diffuse solar radiation are not available,
then the following expression is used to determine the total radiation on an
inclined/tilted surface of arbitrary orientation. It is given by:
IT ¼ IN  cos hi þ IdRd þ qRr IN  cos hZ þ Id
ð
Þ
ð1:31Þ
where an expression for hourly variation of IN and Id can be obtained from
Eqs. (1.13) and (1.15), respectively. In addition, the hourly values of cos hi and
cos hZ can be determined from Eqs. (1.10) and (1.11), respectively. Various radi-
ation models for solar radiation calculation are given in Appendix IIIC [14–43].
Example 1.16 Calculate the beam, diffuse, reﬂected, and total solar radiation on a
south-oriented tilted surface inclined at 45° at a place having latitude 40°N for 2:00

Daylighting
Abstract Solar energy directly provides illumination (lux) inside a building
without any additional heat (thermal energy) source, unlike artiﬁcial lighting, and
saves the use of conventional (fossil) fuels. This can be treated as one method to
conserve available fossil fuels.

2.1
Introduction
Daylighting is the general practice of having vertical windows and openings in a
wall exposed to incoming solar radiation to receive natural light inside the room
during the day time. The reﬂective surfaces outside the building can also provide
effective internal lighting through an opening in the wall. This process of having
natural light inside a room is known as daylight harvesting.
Windows in an exposed wall are the most common way to allow daylight into a
living space as shown in Fig. 2.1. The amount of solar radiation (daylight in lux)
available on the vertical window (b = 90°) and with any orientation for known c
(wall azimuth angle) can be evaluated as discussed in Chap. 1. This means that the
window selectively allows for direct and diffuse sunlight for different hours and
days of the year. Different manufacturing technologies and process treatments
improve the transmissivity of the glass, which in turn increases the amount solar
radiation transmitted from the window.
A clerestory window is a band of narrow windows placed at the top of a high
wall as shown in Fig. 2.2. The solar radiation transmitted from the clerestory
windows illuminate the interior walls. Radiations falling on interior walls are fur-
ther reﬂected to the living space. Light obtained using this method provides more
diffuse radiation, which reduces shadow formation.
Daylight obtained using the concept of a skylight is very simple. These concepts
are widely used in residential, community, and commercial buildings. Greater use

of daylighting ensures less use of artiﬁcial light, thus saving signiﬁcant nonre-
newable (electrical) energy. Hence, this concept is cost-effective and environment
friendly.
2.2
History of Daylighting
Architectural design of building for daylight was an art and science for harnessing
the visible portion of the solar spectrum into the built environment. Our historical
buildings exhibit good daylight uses. Daylighting has important advantages such as
creating psychological visual comfort in a living space [1]. It also reduces electrical
energy consumption kWh for artiﬁcial lights [2]. This consequently reduces the
sensible heat gain associated with artiﬁcial lights. Hence, the cooling requirement of
the building decreases due to the provision of natural daylight. The daylight
coefﬁcient concept offers a more effective way of computing indoor daylight

illuminance in lux [3]. Similarly, Joshi et al. [4] gave a brief review on different
mathematical models for the estimation of daylight in buildings.
Reddy and Manish [5] modeled the variation of global solar radiation with space
and time using an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model. The validation results and
comparison of ANN model with other models showed that the ANN model is more
suitable compared with other classical regression models for predicting global solar
radiation. Solar radiation for any place and weather condition (Sect. 1.2.6) can be
predicted using an ANN model.
In modern architecture, daylighting is an inescapable concept used for meeting
the visual needs and thermal comfort of the occupants and ensuring energy-efﬁcient
buildings [6]. Daylighting concepts provide maximum possible natural light to the
occupant, which is strongly needed for visual as well as mental comfort. The
openings provided for daylighting through a window also visually connect occu-
pants to the outside environment, which confers a positive psychological effect.
The high consumption of electricity in buildings for many applications, viz.,
cooling, heating, illumination, etc., is directly or indirectly related to pollution and
global warming due to the electricity produced mainly from conventional fuels [7].
In the US, energy consumption is almost 14 % of total energy required in resi-
dential applications as shown in Fig. 2.3. The lighting contribution is approxi-
mately 11 % of building energy consumption [8] as shown in Fig. 2.4.
Approximately 20–40 % of the total energy consumption of the building is due
to lighting; hence, it is a prime source of carbon emission in buildings [9, 10].
Various researchers and architects have proved that the daylighting is also a good
solution for illumination in buildings (through windows, skylights, wind tunnel,
etc.) and for saving electrical energy based on fossil fuels during the daytime.
Daylight is the visible part of solar radiation as perceived by the human eye. It is
composed of a spectral power distribution (SPD) of electromagnetic radiation in the

visible wavelength range (0.38–0.78 µm) of solar radiation [11]. Daylight is one of
the cheapest and efﬁcient ways of using solar energy in buildings. Architects and
building designers are also concerned about energy conservation in buildings due to
the use of daylight [12]. It is reported that daylighting improves student perfor-
mance and health in schools [11] because natural light gives more comfort and is
beneﬁcial for human health. With smart control systems, the use of conventional
lighting can be considerably reduced and even eliminated inside a community
center or ofﬁce building. Daylight proportion can vary due to the structure of the
house or building because the position, direction, and area of the windows play
major factor in inﬂuencing the amount of natural light inside a room of a house.
Nevertheless, arrangements made for daylighting have direct and indirect
impacts on the heating and cooling loads of building [13]. The optimization of
daylight has been studied by many researchers [14–16]. The effects of daylighting
optimization on thermal loads are also presented in the literature [17]. Some
material-based optimization solutions with innovative approaches for lighting
energy savings have also been reported [18–20].
The approach adopted for the optimization of daylighting inside a building must
be as universal as much as possible so that it can be applicable to most of the building
[21]. For the prediction of daylighting, building-simulation software [22] can be
used. The annual variation in the availability of daylight at any place is important,
particularly for daylight optimization for the annual performance of building
[23, 24]. Stokes et al. [25] presented a simple model for the estimation of daylight
throughout the year. The existing building can be retroﬁtted for the inclusion of
daylighting concepts; a study regarding the economic analysis of retroﬁts has been
performed by Mahlia et al. [26]. The amount of daylight inside a building strongly
depends on the building design and the materials used for the openings for day-
lighting. Orientation of the living space with respect to light source, geometry of the

living space, optical properties of interior surfaces of the living space, obstructions
outside the room, and optical characteristics of glazing play a major role in har-
nessing daylight [27]. The daylight coefﬁcient for complex fenestration has been
examined, and it was concluded that the daylight coefﬁcient does not depend on
luminance distribution in the sky [28, 29]. The illuminance level from natural light
has been estimated by Rosa et al. [30] for overcast sky conditions.
2.3
Components of Daylighting (Natural Light)
2.3.1
Daylight Factor (DF)
The estimation of illuminance inside a living space can be predicted by an
expression for the daylight factor, which is given by
DF ¼ SC þ ERC þ IRC
ð2:1Þ
where SC, ERC, and IRC are the sky, external, and internal reﬂection components
falling on a building as shown in Fig. 2.5a. The sky component (SC) is the sum of
beam and diffuse solar radiation coming from the Sun and the external (ERC) and
internal (IRC) reﬂection components that are only beam/direct solar radiation
coming from the Sun due to its direction.
The daylight factor (DF) is a guideline to determine the quantitative suitability
(characteristic) of daylight in a particular room (work space) in terms of illuminance
(lux). Based on this, there can be some changes in the design of the working space
through the size of the windows.
2.3.2
Daylight Factor Due to Sky Components
The daylight factor due to the sky component (SC) is a ratio of inside illuminance,
Li (lux), on the horizontal work plane and outside diffuse illuminance, Lo (lux), on a
horizontal surface.

Equation (2.3) is applicable to CIE overcast conditions (completely cloudless
conditions, weather condition ‘a’ as described in Chap. 1). Furthermore, the
Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) is denoted SC by DF
because they have not considered external (REC) and internal (IRC) reﬂection
components falling on a building where:
• s is the transmittance of window materials (s ¼ 0:8, and 0.7 for single- and
double-glazed clear glass, respectively). This also depends on the thickness of
the window materials. The numerical value of s decreases with an increase in
the thickness of the window materials.
• Aw is the area a window in m2, which is inversely proportional to s.

medium-white wall, and 0.4 for a dark wall). High reﬂectance confers a double

distribution of daylight.

dow facing north‒south, the value of OF is 0.77 and 1.20, respectively; other-
wise OF ¼ 1 for a vertical east‒west window.
The various parameters in Eq. (2.3) were tabulated with their numerical values
for skylight components (SC) in an experimental dome-shaped mud house for a
working place at the centre of the ﬂoor at IIT Delhi (Fig. 2.6) in Table 2.1. The
left-hand side of Fig. 2.6 is a view of the sky component at the top of the mud
house in a conical shape, and the right-hand side is the view of the central table as a
working place. The conical shape at the top of the dome has been considered
equivalent to a vertical window. In this case, an external reﬂection component
(ERC) falling on the building can be neglected.
Equation (2.3) was modiﬁed by Chel et al. [31] by considering the effect of height
(of a workplace from the ﬂoor of mud house) and the time of day x; Eq. (1.9b). The
modiﬁed daylight factor for the sky component (SC) is given as follows:

Daylight Factor Due to External Reﬂection
Components (ERC)
External reﬂection components (ERC) will be zero if the building is not surrounded
by any outside obstruction as shown in Fig. 2.6. In the presence of any outside
obstruction, there will be a non-zero ERC value. To obtain this value, one can use

the same as deﬁned in Eq. (2.3), for a dome-type mud-house construction,
Rcw [ Rfw. Due to the poor reﬂectance of the ﬂoor, it may be slightly higher.

Different Concept of Daylighting
Generally, most conventional buildings have vertical windows in walls depending
on the availability of solar ﬂux on the wall. However, there are many other concepts
to have natural daylight in a living space. These are as follows:
2.4.1
Modern Sky Light
Skylights are a light-transmitting fenestration from outside a building into a
building living space through the roof as shown in Fig. 2.7a. It can be ﬁxed or
Fig. 2.7 a View of skylight
on inclined roof of a building.
b A pair of skylights installed

Daylighting

operable (for ventilation) glazing area on the roof of a building. Unit skylights and
the sloped glazing in the centre of the roof are used to convey abundant daylight or
top lighting into a living space. A skylight, if operable, can also serve for ventilating
fresh air inside the building able.
The structure to be installed (ﬁxed or operable) on a skylight opening is termed
“unit skylight.” It is made from transparent glass or plastic (ﬁxed with frame) in
different shapes and sizes as per the building requirement.
2.4.2
Solar Pipe (SP)/Light Tube
Solar pipes/light tubes have less surface area exposed for heat transfer; therefore,
the use of solar pipes reduces heat transfer from the outside environment. In
addition, they provide light on a focused area (Fig. 2.8) of interior space of a
building.
2.4.3
Semitransparent Solar Photovoltaic Lighting System
(SSPLS)
In this case, a semitransparent photovoltaic (PV) (Sect. 4.4.1) module with a rea-
sonable nonpacking factor (NPF) is considered. A set of semitransparent
Fig. 2.8 View of solar pipe/light tube/tubular daylighting device (TDD)
2.4
Different Concept of Daylighting
63

photovoltaic (PV) modules connected in series and parallel combination is inte-
grated with an inclined roof to receive the maximum solar radiation for daylighting
and electrical power required by the building as shown in Fig. 2.9. There is a
daylighting effect inside the building through the nonpacking area of the PV
module. Such roof- integrated semitransparent photovoltaic (PV) modules also
provided a greenhouse effect, which can be used for many applications such as
(i) Daylighting
(ii) Solar crop-drying
(iii) Sun bath
(iv) Electrical power
2.4.4
Light Shelves
Light shelves are an effective way to enhance the daylighting provided through
windows on a wall exposed to incoming solar radiation. A highly reﬂective metal
light shelf is attached to the outside of the window at the top as shown in Fig. 2.10.
This arrangement with the window will protect direct solar radiation coming into
the living space during summer season due to projection.
This arrangement is also referred as a “light shelf.” Solar radiation falling on a
light shelf is reﬂected toward the ceiling of the living space; some radiation will be
absorbed (responsible for heating of ceiling an undesirable situation in the summer),
and the rest will be reﬂected back to the living space and illuminate the living area.
In case of intense solar radiation, glare-control techniques are needed for proper
daylighting.

2.4.5
Light Reﬂector
Figure 2.11 shows the manually adjustable light reﬂector, which was mostly used
in ofﬁce buildings in past. Currently it is seldom used. The adjustment of the
reﬂector depends on the season in order to have maximum daylighting into a living
space.

2.4
Different Concept of Daylighting
65

2.4.6
Tubular Daylighting Devices (TDDs)
Tubular daylighting devices (TDDs) are devices that provide daylight through
tubes integrated with walls or the roof of the building. These tubes collect daylight
from a transparent dome structure mounted on them. TDDs can be a simple tube
with a high reﬂective coating or ﬁlled with bundles of optical ﬁbers. The daylight
carried by TDDs is distributed using a diffuser assembly for the homogeneous
distribution of light in a whole living area. These devices are promising techniques
to provide daylighting in multistory residential and commercial buildings.
2.4.7
Sawtooth Roof
A sawtooth roof is very old concept used in old factories for using daylight inside
the building. It is an arrangement of vertical glass opposite the exposed area of the
roof. A sawtooth roof allows diffuse solar radiation. The prime disadvantage of
these structures is that the exposed area increases unwanted thermal losses during
winter seasons because it allows loss of thermal energy from the exposed glass.
2.4.8
Heliostats
A heliostat, as shown in Fig. 2.12, is a mirror that rotates with the motion of the
Sun. The heliostat move in phase with the direction of the Sun and reﬂects solar
radiation in a single direction. These advanced technology devices are used to shine
the glazed portion of the building such as the window, a skylight (Fig. 2.7), and
tight tubes (Fig. 2.8). The light received from these glazed portions is further used
Fig. 2.12 View of a heliostat
mirror
66
2
Daylighting

to illuminate the interiors of a room. A heliostat is more energy efﬁcient technique
because it uses maximum available solar radiation throughout day.
2.4.9
Smart-Glass Window
The glazing window made of smart-glass materials is known as a smart-glass
window. Smart-glass is a material that changes its optical properties signiﬁcantly on
application of a voltage to the material or by applying some mechanical treatment.
These materials can behave as a transparent glass sheet or as a reﬂective surface or
retro-reﬂective surface with a variation of voltage or mechanical treatment.
Therefore, these materials can be tuned per the daylighting requirement inside the
living space.
2.4.10
Fiber-Optic Concrete Wall (FOCW)
Fiber-optic concrete wall/translucent concrete wall, also known as a light-
transmitting concrete wall, is made of enhanced light-transmitting building
materials having compatibility with concrete. These materials are embedded with
optical ﬁber cables as shown in Fig. 2.13. Solar radiation falls on the outer portion
of the ﬁber-optic concrete wall and is captured by the optical ﬁber cables and
transmitted to the inner space of the wall. The quantity and quality of the daylight in
living space depend on the material as well as other structural properties of the
optical ﬁber.
Light-transmitting concretes are mainly used on windows and the interior sur-
face of walls. These materials are made by mixing ﬁne-grain concrete (approxi-
mately 95 %) with optical ﬁber cables (approximately 5 %). After casting
processes, these translucent concretes can be cut in the desired shape and sizes per
Fig. 2.13 View of
translucent concrete wall at

München/Germany
2.4
Different Concept of Daylighting
67

the building requirement using advanced machines. The mounting of translucent
concrete structures on the façade and walls of the building must be performed in
such a way that it results in a uniform distribution of day/artiﬁcial lighting inside
living area.
2.4.11
Hybrid Solar Lighting (HSL)
Hybrid solar lighting was developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL). This technology can eliminate the requirement for artiﬁcial light during
day time. Hybrid solar-lighting system comprise a light-collector system mounted
on the roof of building, optical ﬁber cables, and ﬂuorescent lighting ﬁxtures with
transparent rods attached to optical ﬁber cables.
During evening hours, when the intensity of the sunlight decreases, ﬂuorescent
ﬁxtures gradually turn on and maintain a nearly constant luminance level in the
interior space. At night hours, the ﬂuorescent lighting system is electronically
operated. The cost of these systems is a major concern that must be addressed. In
near future, hybrid solar lighting may become a promising technology for
daylighting.
2.4.12
Solarium
A solarium is a glass house attached to a building having orientation toward either
the south in northern hemisphere or the north in southern hemisphere to receive the
maximum solar radiation. In this case, the partition opaque wall between the
solarium and the building can have a provision of (i) glazed window (Fig. 2.1),
(ii) smart glass window, and (iii) Fiber-optic concrete wall (FOCW), (Fig. 2.13) for
daylighting. In addition to daylighting, the solarium can be used for many other
applications such as (i) daylighting (ii), sun bath, and (iii) heating of the attached
room, etc. There can be another application for producing electricity if glass mate-
rials are replaced by a semitransparent photovoltaic module as shown in Fig. 2.9.

dome-structure roof as shown in Fig. 2.14. Hourly illuminance levels were recorded
from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. inside two rooms having different surface areas of skylight.
The view of the large dome and the small dome are also shown in Fig. 2.14. The
large dome with the skylight had a conference room with a conference table as
shown in Fig. 2.6. Luxmeter (least count = 1 lx; accuracy ±6 % of reading ±1
minimum effective digit; range 0–999,000 lx) was used to record the hourly illu-
minance inside the rooms at the ﬂoor and planes >0.75- and 1.5-m heights from the
ﬂoor. Hourly variations of global and diffuse radiations were also recorded using
same luxmeter. A calibrated glass thermometer was used to measure the ambient air
and room air temperature. Experimental observations inferred that the luminance
levels inside the rooms were different at different heights from the ﬂoor surface. In
addition, the luminance level was different for different times (winter or summer) of
the year. However, only the results for winter (sun at low altitude) are shown in
Fig. 2.15.
Figure 2.15a shows the hourly variation of outside illuminance in lux and solar
ﬂux in W/m2 including the diffuse component for each case for a typical clear day
in winter. It can be observed from this ﬁgure that 1 W=m2 ﬃ100 lx. Furthermore, it
should be noted that the ratio of diffuse to total radiation is <0.25, which requires
clear-/blue-sky conditions (Sect. 1.2.6) for better daylighting.
The hourly illuminance inside the small and the large dome at a height of
(i) 0 cm (ﬂoor) (ii) 75 cm from the ﬂoor and (iii) 150 cm from the ﬂoor is shown in
Fig. 2.15b. It is observed that the level of illumination increases with height in the
small as well as the large dome due to the decrease in distance between the skylight
and the point of observation as expected. It can also be observed that the illumi-
nation level in the large dome has a lower value compared with that of the small

seminars, and conferences have been performed at this site to show the practical
utility of these structures under real operating conditions.
The illuminance level at the ﬂoor of the rooms varies from 100 to 250 lx for a
large-domed room and 200 to 400 lx for a small-dome room (Fig. 2.15) in month of
January. The illuminance levels inside the rooms were suitable for ofﬁce (working
hours) activities.
The experimental hourly values of the daylight factor (DF in %) due to skylight
condition can be determined by using Eq. (2.2) in terms of percentage. The results
are shown in Fig. 2.16.
From Fig. 2.16, one can conclude the following:
(i) The daylight factor (DF) due to the skylight at top of small dome is maximum
as expected.
(ii) The daylight factor (DF) due to the skylight for a large dome has a lower value
compared with a small dome.
For daylighting in a large-domed mud house, the size of the skylight system
should be increased and optimized.

The electrical energy equivalent corresponding to total luminous ﬂux (/) can be
found using Eq. (2.15). This equivalent electrical energy is the conservation of
conventional energy due to the incorporation of a skylight in dome-shaped building.

Total Lighting Power, PðWÞ
Luminous efﬁcacy ee lm/W
ð
Þ is a measure of visible light produced by a light
source. It is the ratio of luminous ﬂux
/
ð Þ to power (P) and is mathematically
expressed as
ee ¼ lm/W
ð
Þ ¼ /=P
ð2:14Þ
where / can be obtained from Eq. (2.13). In the case of daylighting, power (P) is
the solar radiation ﬂux on the given area; for artiﬁcial light sources, power (P) is the
electrical power consumed in a light source. In the case of daylighting, ee is also
termed the “luminous efﬁcacy” of solar radiation, and it is known as the luminous
efﬁcacy of the artiﬁcial source.
The luminous efﬁcacy of an artiﬁcial source (electrical) reﬂects the ability of a
source to convert electrical energy into visible light. The overall luminous efﬁcacy
depends on how efﬁciently the source generates electromagnetic radiation from
electrical energy and to what degree the human eye is susceptible to the radiation
emitted from the source. Luminous efﬁcacy of solar radiation is a measure of visible
light produced by electromagnetic radiation coming from the Sun.
The total electrical power savings P W

the measured illuminance level on a given horizontal surface can be obtained using
the following equation [35]:

where BF is ballast factor.
Equation (2.15) can be used to evaluate the daily, monthly, and annual power
consumed in kWh for a given illuminance.
Monthly and annual daylighting energy savings potential due to a skylight at the
ﬂoor of large-domed mud house is shown in Fig. 2.17. It can be observed that the
potential annual daylighting energy savings varies from 467 to 662 kWh. The
average annual potential daylighting energy savings for a large-domed mud house
is 564:5 kWh. The monthly energy savings in kWh is greater during the summer
months (April–September) due to a high level of insolation. The monthly average
energy savings in kWh is 70 during the summer months and 40:7 kWh during
winter months. This indicates that the monthly average energy savings in kWh
during the summer months 70 % higher than during the winter months (Fig. 2.18).
Similar trends were observed for a small-dome mud house. However, the
potential annual daylighting energy savings varies from 169 to 239 kWh. Thus, the
average annual potential daylighting energy savings for small-dome mud house is
204 kWh. It is also important to note that the average annual potential daylighting

energy savings for a large-domed mud house is 177 % higher than the average
annual potential daylighting energy savings for a small-dome mud house, which is
in contrast to the illuminance parameter
Furthermore, the total annual potential daylighting energy savings in kWh for
small-dome and large-domed mud houses were calculated for all weather conditions
(type ‘a’ to type ‘d’, Sect. 1.2.6) for ﬁve different climatic condition in India, and
the results are shown in Fig. 2.19. It is observed that the total annual daylighting
energy savings in kWh for small-dome and large-domed mud houses for Srinagar is
minimum due to the low level of insolation as well as sunshine hours.

Life-Cycle Cost Analysis for Skylight
in the Mud House
A similar analysis was used to determine the cost investment for a skylight over the
domed roof structures of the mud house. There were annual energy savings for
large and small domes of 923 and 339 kWh/year, respectively, which equals the
respective annual rate of returns (R) Rs: 4615=year and Rs: 1695=year, respectively,
with a unit energy savings cost of Rs: 5=kWh in India. There were total investments
in skylight transparent diffuse glass Pi
ð
Þ for 2:6 m2 a large dome of Rs. 5200 and
Rs. 1200 for a 1.5 m2 glass area for the skylight, including labor costs, for making a
pyramid-shaped skylight. Life-cycle cost analyses were performed for this skylight
for different rates of interest. The annual minor maintenance of the mud-house
skylight (M) was considered as Rs. 2400 for cleaning the skylight four times per
month at rate of Rs. 50 per washing and cleaning. The end-of-life salvage value of
the skylight glass was neglected with a 50-year lifetime for a pyramid-shaped
skylight. The payback period for different interest rates were determined as shown
in Fig. 2.20.
It can be seen that the payback period at lower rate of interest is minimum
(2.5 years) as per expectation. Energy matrices of a building by using the day-
lighting concept have also been studied by Sudan and Tiwari [36].

Law of Thermodynamics and Element
of Heat Transfer
Abstract Knowledge of thermodynamical law is a basic need to understand the
energy and exergy of solar thermal and photovoltaic systems. All heat-transfer
phenomena depend on these laws to derive the output/yield from any photovoltaic‒
thermal (PVT) system in terms of an overall energy and exergy efﬁciency.

Introduction
Energy transfer takes place in different forms for different processes, namely,
thermal, mechanical, electrical, and chemical. Energy transfer by thermal processes
is basically a heat-transfer phenomena. It is a well-established topic. It does not
require detailed deliberation due to the small operating-temperature difference ðDTÞ
in most solar thermal applications. Very few applications of solar energy are at a
high operating-temperature difference ðDTÞ, i.e., solar power generation.
Heat coming from the Sun is in the form of thermal energy. It can be transferred
generally from higher to lower temperature as a result of temperature difference
ðDTÞ. No net-heart transfer takes place between two mediums at the same tem-
perature. The rate of heat transfer in a particular direction is directly proportion to
the temperature gradient ðDTÞ in that direction.
In order to understand heat transfer phenomena’s, it is necessary to know basic
law of thermodynamics.
3.2
Law of Thermodynamics
A collection of a large number of atoms or molecules of a physical system is known
as a “thermodynamic system.” The macroscopic properties of a physical system are
the temperature T
ð Þ, pressure P
ð Þ, mass density q
ð Þ, and heat capacity (MC), etc.

The number of atoms or molecules contained in a physical system must be sufﬁ-
ciently large for higher volume of the system. The macroscopic properties of the
system are governed by the condition of the physical system within the system. In
principle, a physical system is considered to be inﬁnitely large where the volume of
the system is proportional to the number of molecules/atoms in the system.
Thermodynamic limit is the condition where the volume of the physical system and
number of atoms/molecules increases in a manner that keeps the density of
atoms/molecules constant.
In a thermodynamic process, macroscopic properties of the system, such as
volume, heat (thermal energy), and ﬂow of atoms or molecules of the system,
changes with time. In the absence of any thermodynamic process, the macroscopic
properties of the systems do not change with time, and the system is said to be in
thermal equilibrium.
There are basically four laws of thermodynamics as follows:
3.2.1
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
When two thermodynamic systems (A and B) independently in thermal equilibrium
are brought into thermal contact, either a thermodynamic process will take place or
no thermodynamic process will take place between them. In the absence of any
thermodynamic process, both systems will said to be in thermal equilibrium with
each other.
The Zeroth law of thermodynamics establishes an equivalence relation between
the two systems. If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with another
system, C, then systems A and B are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
This equivalence is governed by a common property between these systems known
as temperature.
3.2.2
The First Law of Thermodynamics
Suppose a macroscopic physical system reversibly changes its equilibrium state
from P1 to P2 on the addition of thermal energy Q, and W is the amount of
mechanical work performed on the system. This change can be achieved by fol-
lowing many ways (with different values of Q and W), but ﬁrst the law of ther-
modynamics states that the sum Q þ W
ð
Þ is independent of different paths as long
as the two equilibrium states are ﬁxed. For an inﬁnitesimally small change, quantity
d0Q þ d0W will depend on the initial and ﬁnal states of the system. d0Q þ d0W is
known as the change in internal energy dU
ð
Þ of the system as in goes from equi-
librium state P1 to state P2. Mathematically it can be expressed as:
86
3
Law of Thermodynamics and Element of Heat Transfer

dU ¼ UP2  UP1 ¼ d0Q þ d0W
ð3:1Þ
Mathematically, d0Q and d0W are path dependent, whereas the sum d0Q þ d0W is
path independent.
Equation (3.1) is valid for a closed system based on sign convention of
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
According to sign convention of Clausius for cyclic processes, Eq. (3.1) is
written as
DU ¼ Q  W
ð3:2Þ
where DU is the mechanical equivalent of heat; Q is the heat supplied, and W is the
work done by the system.
Furthermore, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is also termed as the “energy
conservation law for thermodynamic systems.”
Thermal analysis of solar energy systems is based on the law of conservation of
energy, which is also considered as the reversible process.
In this case, according to the law of conservation of energy,
The available solar energy ¼ the useful energy þ the lost energy
ð3:3aÞ
or
The rate of available solar energy ¼ the rate of useful energy þ the rate of lost energy
ð3:3bÞ
It is to be noticed that the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is applicable to the
medium operating temperature (<100 °C) of solar thermal systems.
3.2.3
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics gives a relation between heat supplied to the
system and work extracted on application of the heat. There are several statements
of the second law of thermodynamics; the most established statements are given
below:
Clausius’ principle: It is impossible to transfer heat spontaneously from a
colder to a hotter body without causing any other changes in the system.
Caratheodory’s principle: Any state inﬁnitesimally close to the thermal equi-
librium state cannot reached from it by adiabatic change.
Kelvin’s principle: Heat extracted from the hot reservoir cannot be completely
used to do work. The amount of heat that must be rejected to a cold reservoir is the
difference of heat extracted from a hot reservoir and work obtained from the system,
i.e., QC ¼ QH  W. It is impossible to extract an amount of heat ðQHÞ from a hot
3.2
Law of Thermodynamics
87

reservoir and use it all to do work (W). The remaining amount of heat ðQC ¼
QH  WÞ must be an exhausted/transfer to a cold reservoir. This is the basis of a
perfect heat engine. This is a measure of the amount of energy ðQC ¼ QH  WÞ
that is unavailable to do work, which is known as “entropy,” as shown in Fig. 3.1.
This is sometimes called the “ﬁrst form” of the second law of thermodynamics or
the Kelvin‒Planck statement of the second law.
Furthermore, the thermal efﬁciency of a heat machine/engine working between
two energy levels is deﬁned in terms of absolute temperature in Kelvin as:
g ¼
1  Tc
Th


ð3:4Þ
where g = the thermal efﬁciency of heat engine; Th = temperature of the hot
reservoir (K); and Tc = temperature the cold reservoir (surrounding) (K).
Here it is also important to mention that the second law of thermodynamics is
mostly used for a system with a higher range of operating temperature range
400 C
ð
Þ.
The second law of thermodynamics also leads to the concept of exergy, which is
deﬁned as the maximum possible work that can be extracted from the system as it
reaches equilibrium with the cold-reservoir/surroundings. For a system in equilib-
rium with the surroundings, exergy will be zero.
The ﬁrst law ensures that energy can never be destroyed, which can be achieved
only for reversible processes. On the contrary, exergy of the system depends on the
irreversibility of the system, which is directly proportional to the increase in entropy
of the system in its surroundings. When a process occurs between two different
temperatures, energy is destroyed. The destroyed energy is known as “anergy.”

Exergy analysis
Exergy analysis of any system incorporates irreversibility, which occurs at any part
of the process. Irreversibility causes entropy generation and an increase in the
entropy of the system and the surroundings. This entropy increase produces
unrecoverable loss of exergy. The total exergy destroyed from the system is the sum
of exergy destroyed at every point of the system.
For example, consider a water fall: When water falls from a height, the potential
energy is converted into kinetic energy and ultimately into thermal energy; in this
process energy is converted from one to another form, but it is conserved. At the
same time, no work has been extracted in this process, i.e., it is destroyed or lost,
and the lost quantity in this case is known as exergy.
The quality of energy directly relates to the exergy available from the system.
The exergy analysis of any thermal process (in scope of the present book, the solar
thermal process) takes into account the irreversibility at every point of system and
the inefﬁciency of each component of the system. The prime objective of exergy
analysis is the improvement of efﬁciency and a reduction in losses as much as
possible. The optimization of solar thermal systems after exergy analysis yields
insights into the quality of energy attainable from the system, and exergy-based
optimization provides a more efﬁcient system, which in turn yields greater return
and capital savings.
“Exergy is the property of system, which gives the maximum amount of
useful work obtained from the system when it comes in equilibrium with a
reference to the environment.”
The above deﬁnition infers that out of input thermal energy, some part is con-
verted into useful work and the rest is lost (i.e., cannot be recovered) to the envi-
ronment. Hence, one can have:
Heat supplied energy
ð
Þ ¼ Available energy exergy
ð
Þ þ unavailable energy ðanergy)
ð3:5Þ
Exergy of a process
For the process taking place between two temperatures [source T1 (in K)] and [sink

Wmax ¼ exergy ¼

Example 3.1 Calculate the maximum work available Wmax from the heat source at
T1 ¼ 40; 60; 80 C and ambient temperature = 20 °C when Q1 ¼ 150 kWh.
Solution
Using Eq. (3.6) for 40 °C, we have
Wmax ¼

40 þ 273


 150 ¼ 9:58 kWh
Similarly, for 60 and 80 °C,
Wmax ¼ 18 and 25:5 kWh; respectively:
It is concluded that the maximum work is available at higher source temperature
when the sink temperature is constant.
Exergy efﬁciency
Exergy efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of energy output to exergy input.
Performance of the system evaluated by incorporating exergy efﬁciency is based on
the second law of thermodynamics unlike energy analysis, which is based on the
ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. Exergy efﬁciency of the system is obtained by writing
the exergy balance of the system, which includes exergy input, exergy output, and
exergy destroyed from the system.
The exergy balance for any system can be given as follows:
X _Exin 
X _Exout ¼

Exergy efﬁciency is improved by minimizing the inefﬁciency and irreversibility,
which can be achieved by minimizing the term P _Exin  P _Exout. The concept of
“improved potential (IP)” due to the improvement of exergy efﬁciency is directly
related to the exergy efﬁciency and term P _Exin  P _Exout. It is deﬁned as follows:

where _Exdest is the rate of exergy destruction.
Solar radiation exergy
Exergy of any system is obtained due to the matter (substance) or ﬁeld (radiation
ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld, gravitational ﬁeld etc.) involved in the system. Exergy
depends on the temperature of the source if the sink temperature is taken to be
constant throughout out the process. Therefore, the term “exergy of heat” should
“change in exergy of the heat source” [2]. Solar radiation exergy is deﬁned as the
input exergy from the Sun that is available to solar thermal systems.
Solar radiations received from the Sun are utilized by human beings, wildlife,
plants, and by almost all processes on planet Earth. It can be converted into work,
heat, or other necessary process for life on Earth. The energy efﬁciency and exergy
efﬁciency can be calculated from the work or heat equivalent of thermal radiations
using the relations given in Table 3.1.
The uniﬁed efﬁciency expression ðUeeÞ expresses the capacity of the utilization
of thermal radiation. Uniﬁed efﬁciency expression ðUeeÞ for different input and
output is given in Table 3.2. Solar radiation exergy can be estimated using fol-
lowing relation:

3.2.4
The Third Law of Thermodynamics
The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of any system approaches a
minimum constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. In statistical
thermodynamics, entropy is associated with the degree of disorder in the system. As
the temperature of the system decreases, the thermal motion within the system also
decreases, which gives it a more ordered state. A highly ordered state gives a
minimum value of entropy at low temperature (near absolute zero). Furthermore,
absolute entropy cannot be deﬁned due to its constant minimum value of entropy
near absolute zero; hence, only the change in entropy can be obtained for different
systems at different temperatures.

Introduction
Heat/thermal energy is a very important area. It is freely available from the Sun
(Chap. 1). Furthermore, without heat/thermal energy, one cannot even imagine
deﬁning the concept of thermodynamic laws. To understand the mechanism for
heat/thermal energy transfer from a higher temperature to a lower temperature (see
the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics), it is necessary to ﬁrst understand
heat/thermal energy transfer by different modes, namely, (i) conduction, (ii) con-
vection, and (iii) radiation. It is also important to note the following:
(i) Each heat transfer mode acts independently; and
(ii) only one heat transfer mode behaves strongly in comparison to the others.
Usually all three methods are involved in overall heat-transfer problems [6]. All
three heat-transfer modes will be discussed in the next sections.
3.3.2
Conduction
Conduction is the transfer of heat/thermal energy from the more energetic particles
(means higher temperature) of a substance to the adjacent lower energetic (lower
temperature) ones. Conduction can take place in solids, liquids, or gases. Collision
between the molecules and the diffusion of molecule is responsible for thermal
conduction in liquids and gases. In contrast, thermal vibration and collision between
free electrons are responsible for thermal conduction in solids.
3.2

Fourier’s law of heat conduction
Let us consider steady-state heat transfer through a large vertical plane wall of
(a) thickness Dx ¼ L and (b) surface area A and DT ¼ T2  T1. On the basis of
experimentation, it can be shown that the rate of heat transfer _Q through the vertical
wall can be expressed as
Rate of heat conduction / cross sectional area
ð
Þ temperature difference/drop
ð
Þ
change in thickness of slab
or
_Q ¼ KA DT
Dx
ð3:16aÞ
where the constant K is the proportionality constant known as “thermal conductivity
of the materials” (Appendix V), and thermal conductivity is ability to transport
thermal energy from a higher temperature to a lower temperature through con-
duction. For limiting case, Dx ! 0, Eq. (3.16a) reduces to a differential form:
_Q ¼ KA dT
dx
ð3:16bÞ
Equation (3.16b) is known as Fourier’s law of heat conduction. Here dT
dx is the
slope (temperature gradient) of the temperature curve on a T–x diagram at point x.
The negative sign indicates the temperature decreases as one move from a higher
temperature point toward the lower temperature. The positive direction of x is taken
from the higher temperature to the lower temperature.
Thermal conductivity
Thermal conductivity of a material K
ð Þ is deﬁned as the rate of heat transfer per unit
of surface area ðA ¼ 1 m2Þ per unit of thickness ðDx ¼ 1 mÞ between two points
having unit temperature difference ðDT ¼ 1 CÞ. Higher value of thermal con-
ductivity give higher rate of heat transfer through the material. The thermal con-
ductivity of gases, liquids, and solids depends on temperature. Experimental studies
have shown that for many materials, the dependence of thermal conductivity on
temperature can be assumed to be linear.

where K0 is the thermal conductivity at temperature T0; and b is a constant for the
material. The values of K will increase for T [ T0 and decrease for T\T0; how-
ever, the value of K is unaffected during the medium temperature range of
renewable energy technologies in the present book.

Thermal diffusivity
Thermal diffusivity is property of the material that governs the diffusion of heat
through the material. The higher the value of thermal diffusivity, the greater the
diffusion of heat through the material. It is deﬁned as the ratio of thermal con-
ductivity to the heat capacity per unit volume. Mathematically it is expressed as
follows:
a ¼ Heat conducted
Heat stored
¼ K
qCp
m2=s

	
ð3:18Þ
where q and Cp are the density and speciﬁc heat capacity of the material, respec-
tively. The higher value of thermal conductivity conﬁrms that more heat is con-
ducted through the material and less heat is stored in the material. The thermal
diffusivity of some common materials is given in Appendix V.
Similarly, one dimensionless parameter, the Biot number Bi
ð
Þ, is also used in
heat-conduction problems, The Biot number is important in cases where a solid
body is immersed in hot ﬂuid for heating. In this situation, the outer surface of the
solid body is heated through convection, and the heat is transferred to the inner
parts of the body by conduction. This is deﬁned as the ratio of convective heat
transfer coefﬁcient at the surface of solid body to the conductive heat transfer
coefﬁcient through the solid material. Mathematically it is given as follows:
Bi ¼ hcL
K ¼ hc
K=L
ð3:19Þ
or
Bi ¼ heat transfer coefficient at the surface of the solid
internal conductance of solid across length L
In terms of thermal resistance, it is the ratio of thermal resistance faced by
conductive heat transfer to the thermal resistance faced by convective heat transfer.
A smaller Biot number implies lower thermal caused to the conduction through the
solid body.
Equation (3.16b) for the rate of heat transfer in W can be rearranged as follows:
_Qk ¼ A K

ð

Here −ve sign has been removed because the length has no negative sign.

temperature difference.
3.3.3
Convection
By using the deﬁnition of heat-transfer coefﬁcient due to conduction (Eq. 3.20c), it
becomes simpler to write an expression for the rate of heat transfer between the
ﬂuid and the boundary surface in W due to convection as follows:

Dimensionless heat-convection parameters
To evaluate the numerical value of hc, the following dimensionless numbers,
depending on the physical parameters of ﬂuid above the solid surface due to a
boundary problem, are used:
Nusselt number Nu
ð
Þ: The Nusselt number gives insight about the dominance
of convective heat transfer or conductive heat transfer for ﬂuids. It is an important
parameter for problems related to convective heat transfer. It is deﬁned as the ratio
of the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient to the conductive heat-transfer coefﬁcient
for ﬂuids. Mathematically it is expressed as follows:
Nusselt number; Nu ¼ hcX
K
ð3:22aÞ
In the above equation, K is the thermal conductivity of a ﬂuid above solid
surface; and hc is the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient between solid and ﬂuid.
Reynold’s number

Þ: Reynold’s number is deﬁned for the heat-transfer
problem in force mode of operation. It is the ratio of ﬂuid dynamic force qu2

signiﬁes the ﬂow behavior in forced convection. The value of the Reynold’s
number indicates the ﬂow type (laminar ﬂow/turbulent ﬂow) of a ﬂuid.
Prandtl number Pr

to the ﬂuid. It is deﬁned as the ratio of momentum diffusivity l=q

Now, the heat transfer by convection is further classiﬁed as free and forced
convection, which will be discussed as follows:
Free convection
The gravitational force and nonuniform density due to temperature difference
between adjacent layers of ﬂuid are the two prime factors responsible for ﬂuid
motion. The Nusselt number, as given in Eq. (3.22a), depends on the type of ﬂow
(free or forced).
For free convection,
Nu ¼ hL
K ¼ C0 GrPr
ð
ÞnK0
ð3:24Þ
The above relation is obtained using dimensional analysis at the boundary layer.
The values of C0 and n are estimated using experimental data for systems with same
geometrical shapes and size. For some geometrical shapes used in solar thermal
technology, given in Table 3.3, K0 governs the entire physical behavior of the
problem [7]. Some empirical relations used for free convention are also given in
Table 3.4.

Forced convection [9]
For forced convection, the rate of heat transfer is enhanced by circulating the ﬂuid
over the hot surface using an external source of energy such as pump (liquid) or fan
(air/gas). Externally supplied energy overcomes the pressure drop due to ﬂuid
motion and viscous force (frictional force) due to viscosity of ﬂuid. The heat
transfer is dominantly affected by ﬂow behavior (laminar/turbulent) and ﬂuid
motion (momentum diffusivity), which in turn is directly related to Reynold’s
number and Prandtl number, respectively. Therefore, the Nusselt number in forced
convection depends on Reynold’s number and Prandtl number. It is expresses by
the following correlation:
Nu ¼ C RePr
ð
ÞnK
ð3:25Þ
where C and n are constants for a given type of ﬂow and geometry; and K is a
correction factor (shape factor) added to obtain a greater accuracy.
The empirical relation for forced convective heat transfer through cylindrical
tubes may be represented as
Nu ¼ hD
Kth
¼ CRemPrnK
ð3:26Þ
where D ¼ 4A=P is the hydraulic diameter (m); P is the perimeter of the section
m
ð Þ; and Kth is the thermal conductivity W/m K
ð
Þ.
The values of C, m, n, and K for various conditions are given in Table 3.5.

The heat-transfer coefﬁcient calculated from this relation is the average value
over the entire length of the tube. When the tube is sufﬁciently long, the Nusselt
number approaches a constant value of 3.66.
For the plate heated over its entire length, the average Nusselt number is given
by

The thermo-physical properties of water (or any base ﬂuid) can be improved for
higher values of heat-transfer coefﬁcient by mixing nano-particles in water (or base
ﬂuid). The correlations [10–44] for the thermo-physical properties of nano-ﬂuid are
given in Appendix V.

Convective heat transfer due to wind
The correlation for the heat-transfer coefﬁcient for the ﬂat plates exposed to ambient
air/wind has also been studied by many researchers. The correlations for this case
depend on the wind speed (V). The typical correlation for this case is given as
follows:
hc ¼ 5:7 þ 3:8V
for
0  V  5 m s1
ð3:29aÞ
For zero wind speed, Eq. (3.29a) will give the heat-transfer coefﬁcient for nat-
ural convection. This correlation is an approximate correlation because it is valid
for wind blowing parallel to the exposed surface.
The correlation given in Eq. (3.29a) includes the effect of both convection and
radiation. The correlation for the heat-transfer coefﬁcient due to convection only is
given as follows:
hc ¼ 2:8 þ 3:0V
for
0  V  7 m s1
ð3:29bÞ
The sensibility of these parameters is also demonstrated through comparison,
and another expression for the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient is given by
hc ¼ 7:2 þ 3:8V
ð3:29cÞ
Several other correlations are also available in the literature, and generally hc is
determined from an expression in the form expressed as

3.3.4
Radiation
Radiation is transmitted/propagated through space/vacuum in the form of electro-
magnetic waves. Thermal radiation is the electromagnetic waves of wavelength
between 0.1 and 100 μm in the terrestrial region. All of the rules applicable to light
are also obeyed by thermal radiation. When thermal radiation strikes a solid surface,
it can be absorbed, reﬂected, or refracted according to the same rule as that for light.
Radiation involving real surfaces
When radiant energy, solar radiation in the present case, falls on a solid surface, a
part of it is reﬂected; another part is absorbed; and the rest is transmitted through it
if it is a transparent solid body. The conservation of energy states that the total sum
must be equal to the incident radiation; thus,
Ir þ Ia þ It ¼ IT
ð3:30aÞ
Dividing the above equation by IT, one gets
q þ a þ s ¼ 1
ð3:30bÞ
where q ¼ Ir
IT is the ratio of the solar energy reﬂected to the incident solar energy
(“reﬂectivity”); a ¼ Ia
IT is the ratio of the solar energy absorbed to the incident solar
energy (“absorptivity”); and s ¼ It
IT is the ratio of the solar energy transmitted to the
incident solar energy (“transmittance of the intercepting body”).
For an opaque surface, s ¼ 0, therefore q þ a ¼ 1. However, when q ¼ s ¼ 0;
a ¼ 1, that is, the substance absorbs the whole of the solar energy incident on it.
Such a substance is called the “black body.” Similarly, for a white body which
reﬂects the whole of the radiation falling on it, a ¼ s ¼ 0; q ¼ 1.
The energy absorbed is converted into heat, and this heated body, by virtue of its
temperature, emits radiation according to Stefan‒Boltzmann’s law. The radiant
energy emitted per unit area of a surface in unit time is referred to as the “emissive
power” ðEkbÞ as given by Eq. (1.2).
However, this is deﬁned as the amount of energy emitted per second per unit
area perpendicular to the radiating surface in a cone formed by a unit solid angle
between the wavelengths lying in the range dk; it is called the “spectral emissive
power”
E0k;b

	
as given in Eq. (1.4a). Furthermore, emissivity, deﬁned as the
3.3
Element of Heat Transfer
107

ratio of the emissive power of a surface to the emissive power of a black body of the
some temperature, is the fundamental property of a surface.
Kirchoff’s law
This law states that for a body in thermal equilibrium, the ratio of its emissive power
to that of a black body at the same temperature is equal to its absorptivity, i.e.,
Ebk
Eb
¼ a
or
e ¼ a
ð3:31Þ
Thus, a body can absorb as much incident radiation as it can emit at a given
temperature. However, this may not be valid if the incident radiation comes from a
source at a different temperature. Furthermore, it applies to surfaces bearing grey
surface characteristics, viz., radiation intensity is taken to be a constant proportional
to that of a black body. The radiative properties ak, ek, and qk are assumed to be
uniform over the entire wavelength spectrum.
Laws of thermal radiation
Some other thermal radiation laws were also deﬁned in Chap. 1.
Sky radiation
In order to evaluate radiation exchange from a horizontal body directly exposed to
the sky, a certain equivalent black-body sky temperature is determined. This
accounts for the fact that the atmosphere is not at a uniform temperature and that it
radiates only in certain wavelength regions. Thus, the net radiation exchange
between a horizontal surface ðT1Þ with emittance ðeÞ and area ðAÞ and the sky
temperature,Tsky, is given by
_Q ¼ Aer T4



ð3:32Þ
In order to express the equivalent sky temperature, Tsky, in terms of ambient air
temperature, various expressions have been given by different people. These rela-
tions, although simple to use, are only approximations. The sky temperature in
terms of local air temperature can be given by the relation,
Tsky ¼ 0:0552T1:5
a
ð3:33aÞ
where Tsky and Ta are both in degrees Kelvin.
Another commonly used relation is given as

Here, it is important to mention that the value of Tsky is nearly same for two
cases; hence, the numerical value of DR should be considered as 60 W/m2.
Heat-transfer coefﬁcient due to radiation

Example 3.9 Determine the radiative heat-transfer coefﬁcient between the surface
of a wall at 25 C and the room air temperature at Ta ¼ 24 C.

Evaporation (Mass Transfer)
In this case, one surface will be a wetted surface for mass transfer to either the
surrounding or any cooler surface unlike other cases discussed previously.
For the wetted surface, too, convective heat transfer will always be present. The
rate of heat transferred in this case is given as:
_Q ¼ hcw Tw  Ta
ð
Þ
ð3:35Þ
where Tw is the ﬂuid temperature; and Ta is the ambient air temperature. The
evaporation process involves the transfer of mass from one location of the system to
another location of the system. The rate of mass transfer is given as
_m ¼ hD q0

According to Lewis relation for a mixture of air and water vapor, we know that
hcw
hD

ð3:37Þ
By assuming Tw ¼ Ta ¼ T

Eq. (3.36) becomes

ð3:38Þ
The rate of heat transfer on account of mass transfer of water vapor is given by
_Qew ¼ _mL
ð3:39Þ
where L is the latent heat of vaporization and Pw and Pa are partial pressure of water
vapor and air respectively.
After substituting an expression for _m from Eq. (3.38) into (3.39), we get

where PT is the total pressure of the air‒vapor mixture. The values of the different

111

L ¼ latent heat of vaporization = 2200 KJ/kg; Cpa ¼ Speciﬁc heat of air 1.005
KJ/kg °C.
Mw ¼ 18 kg/mol (molar mass of water); PT ¼ Total pressure of air‒vapour
mixture ¼ 1atm.
1 atm ¼ 101;325 N/m2.
Substituting all of these values in Eq. (3.43) and solving
H0
hcw
¼ 0:013
The best representation of the heat- and mass-transfer phenomenon is obtained if
the value of H0
hcw is taken to be 16:276  103 instead of 0:013. Thus, the rate of heat
transfer on account of mass transfer is written as
_qew ¼ 16:276  103  hcw  Pw  Pa
ð
Þ
ð3:44Þ
If the surface is exposed to the atmosphere, then the above equation reduces to
_qew ¼ 16:276  103  hcw  Pw  cPa
ð

ð3:45Þ
where c is the relative humidity of air in fraction.
Furthermore, after linearization of Eq. (3.45), one can have
_qew ¼ hew Tw  Ta

(air) will be the sum of heat transfer by conduction (Eq. 3.20b), convection
(Eq. 3.21b), radiation (Eq. 3.34e), and evaporation (Eq. 3.46). As the thermal
conductivity of air is very small, conductive heat transfer from any solid surface to
the air can be neglected.
_qT ¼ _qc þ _qr þ _qew

perature of the solid dry/wetted surface as required in the analysis.
In Eq. (3.50), the sum of convective, hc, and radiative, hr, heat transfer coefﬁ-
cients, i.e., hc þ hr

h ¼ hc þ hr ¼ 5:7 þ 3:8V
ð3:51Þ
Equation (3.51) is also the total heat-transfer coefﬁcient without evaporation.
Sometimes it is denoted as ho.
With evaporation it becomes
h ¼ hc þ hr þ hew
ð3:52Þ
It can be deﬁned as the total heat-transfer coefﬁcient, which includes convective,
radiative, and evaporative transfer from the solid surface to the surrounding air.

Overall Heat-Transfer Coefﬁcient
Heat transfer from a medium (generally ﬂuid [air/water]) at higher temperature to
another medium (may be either air or ﬂuid) at a lower temperature may occur
between many layers with different thermo-physical properties and different
thicknesses. In addition, there may be more than one mode of heat transfer (con-
duction, convection, radiation, and evaporation) involved in the process. In such
cases, the concept of the overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient
U
ð Þ is adopted for the
evaluation of the heat-transfer coefﬁcient from one medium to a second medium by
way of a third medium.
(A) Parallel slabs [6]
Consider a composite wall with a hot surface at temperature TA and a cold
surface at temperature TB (Fig. 3.2). Heat is transferred from the hot surface to the
cold surface through different conducting slabs. Assuming a steady state, i.e., the
heat transfer rate, _Q, through structure is the same through each layer and it can be
written as
_Q ¼ Aha TA  T0

Abstract The photon energy (hm) of solar radiation in visible wavelengths creates
ionization in the depletion region of the n–p junction of solar cells for generating
direct (dc) power (current × voltage) to meet the basic high-grade energy demand
of human beings in underdeveloped regions for rural applications. Rural applica-
tions include streetlights, calculators, water pumping, and mobile charging, etc.

Introduction
A photovoltaic (PV) cell transforms the solar energy incident on it into electricity
due to the photovoltaic effect. Different technologies utilizing applications of solar
cell constitute the ﬁeld of photovoltaics. The solar radiation incident on the solar
cell separates the charge carriers in the absorbing material. The electric ﬁelds
present at the junctions or inhomogeneities in material provide the required EMF
for the ﬂow of electric current in the external circuit and hence the power
generation.
Photovoltaic devices are driven by the ﬂux of solar radiation and acts like a
current source. Photovoltaic cells are mostly made of silicon semiconductor junc-
tion devices. Thus, knowledge of the basics of semiconductors is a prerequisite to
understand photovoltaic cells, and this knowledge is outlined in subsequent sections
of this book.
The rudimentary unit of a PV generator is the photovoltaic cell or solar cell.
A PV generator is a system consisting of PV modules connected in different
combinations (series connected, parallel connected, or connected in both conﬁgu-
rations) depending on the requirements.
Depending on the nature of the electricity conduction, solids can be divided into
three categories: conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. These can be differ-
entiated on the basis of energy band gap between the valence band and the

conduction band. The energy band gap in the case of insulators (hm\Eg, h is the
Planck’s constant, and m is the frequency), is very large. Thus, electrons in the
valence band cannot reach the conduction band, which results in no conduction of
current. For a semiconductor hm [ Eg


, this gap is less than that of the insulator,
and the valence electron can cross this gap on acquiring thermal or light energy
(Fig. 4.1). For conductors ðEg  0Þ, no forbidden gap exists, and hence electron
can easily move to the conduction band.
The variation of the band gap with temperature is given by the relation:
EgðTÞ ¼ Egð0Þ  aT2
T þ b
ð4:1Þ
where the value of a and b for different materials are given in Table 4.1. At T ¼ 0,
EgðTÞ ¼ Egð0Þ, the materials behave as an insulator.
A variation of the band gap with temperature is shown in Fig. 4.2 for germa-
nium, silicon, and gallium arsenide.
Example 4.1 Evaluate the band gap in a silicon crystal at 50 °C.

Fundamentals of Semiconductor and Solar Cells
In this section, the fundamental of the semiconductor will be discussed ﬁrst and
those of the solar cell second.
4.2.1
Doping
The conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor can be increased by adding the
controlled amount of speciﬁc impurity ions. The doped semiconductors are known
as “extrinsic semiconductors.” Impurity ions, having valency less than that of the
semiconductor, produces electron acceptor sites, which trap free electrons. These
traps have an energy level near that of the valence band in the forbidden energy
band. These traps (vacancies) produce positively charged states called “holes,”
which contribute to the conduction of current through the material. Such a material
is called p-type material having holes as majority carriers and electrons as minority
carriers. The impurity ions, having valency greater than that of the semiconductor,
produce an extra electron. In this case, electrons are the majority charge carriers,
and holes are the minority charge carries. The resulting material is known as the
“n-type” material.
The semiconductor can again be divided into two categories:
(i) Intrinsic
Intrinsic (pure) semiconductors have Fermi-level in the middle of the conduction
and the valence band, i.e., the probability of a state being occupied is 0.5.
At thermal equilibrium, the concentration of electrons and holes is same and
equal to the intrinsic carrier concentration for intrinsic semiconductors, i.e.,
ne ¼ nh ¼ ni

Doping in a pure semiconductor affects the carrier concentration and other
electrical properties of the semiconductor. According to Maxwell‒Boltzmann
statistics, the electron and hole concentration is given as follows:

where EF is energy of the Fermi level; EC is the energy at the bottom of the
conduction band; and EV is the energy at the top of the valance band as shown in
Fig. 4.1. From Eq. (4.2), one can write an expression to relate them as follows:

an electron is equal to the Boltzmann factor ¼ exp  D E

electron, the hole, and the intrinsic carrier concentrations, respectively, then at

where the intrinsic carrier concentration ni depends on the material characteristics
and the operating temperature (for Si, ni  1:08  1010 cm3 at 300 K) [1].
4.2.2
Fermi Level
The Fermi level is the energy level that resides in between the donor (or acceptor)
level and the conduction (or valence) band of an extrinsic semiconductor. At a
given temperature T, the probability for the majority charge carriers to become
excited for conduction of the current varies as exp eu=kT
½
 where e is the elec-
tronic charge; and u is the electric potential difference between the Fermi level and
the valence or conduction band, k the Boltzmann constant (Table 4.2).
For n-type material,
EF ¼ EC þ kT ln ND

ð4:9Þ
where EF is the Fermi-energy level; EC is the conduction band energy (Fig. 4.1);
ND is the donor concentration; and NC is the effective density of states in con-
duction band (Eq. 4.6a) and is constant at a ﬁxed temperature T.
For p-type material,
EF ¼ EV  kT ln NA
NV
ð4:10Þ
where EV is the valence band energy; NA is the acceptor ion concentration; and NV
is the effective density of states in the valence band (Eq. 4.6b).

4.2.3
p–n Junction
The electronic inhomogeneity is the essential need for the conversion of solar
energy into electricity. The electronic asymmetry is created by putting the p-type
and n-type semiconductors in contact. At the junction between the p-type and
n-type semiconductors, the majority charge carriers ﬂow in the opposite direction,
thus creating a positive charge in the n-region and a negative charge in the p-region.
During the ﬂow of charge carriers, the recombination process results in a region
having no mobile charges; this region is known as the “depletion region.” The
steady state is achieved when the built-in potential across the junction opposes the
ﬂow of charge from either side.
The p–n junction (Figs. 4.3 and 4.4) is connected either in forward bias or in
reverse bias per the required application. In the forward bias condition (Fig. 4.5a),
the charge carrier faces reduced band potential difference VB, whereas in reverse bias
condition (Fig. 4.5b), the charge carriers must overcome increased band potential

difference VB. The electrons and holes generated by any means recombine after
moving a typical distance (diffusion length, L). The time difference between the
generation and recombination of electron and holes is known as “relaxation time τ.”
The typical order of relaxation time for an intrinsic semiconductor is as long as 1 s,
whereas for extrinsic semiconductors the order of relaxation time varies between
10−2 s and 10−8 s depending on the doping concentration as well as other factors.
Thermally or photo (light)-generated electrons and holes act as charge carriers in
the semiconductor (Fig. 4.6). The potential difference across the junction pulls the
minority charge carriers from the depletion region into the respective potential
gradients, which in turn cause the generation current Ig. In the absence of illumi-
nation, the generation current is mainly controlled by temperature.
In an isolated junction, a reverse recombination current Ir of equal magnitude is
produced from the bulk material to nullify the imbalance of current in the depletion
region. The recombination current slightly reduces the band potential VB. The
recombination current can be controlled by external bias across the junction
(Fig. 4.7).

Photovoltaic Effect
The electron‒hole pairs, generated in the depletion region due to the absorption of
solar radiation, are driven by the internal electric ﬁelds producing a photo current
(IL). The direction of the photocurrent is in a direction opposite that of the forward
dark current as shown in Fig. 4.8. This photocurrent ﬂows continuously even in the
absence of external applied voltage and is known as the “short circuit current” ISC
ð
Þ.
Absorption of more light produces more electron‒hole pairs; hence, this current
depends linearly on the light intensity. This effect is known as the photovoltaic
effect. The p–n junction with this effect is referred to as a solar cell.
The overall solar cell current, I; is the difference of the light-induced current IL
and the diode dark current ID.

Solar Cell (Photovoltaic) Materials
Solar cells consist of various materials with different structures to reduce the initial
cost and achieve maximum electrical efﬁciency. There are various types of solar cell
materials, namely, (a) single crystal, (b) polycrystalline, (c) amorphous silicon,
(d) compound thin-ﬁlm material, as well as other semiconductor absorbing layers,
which give highly electrical-efﬁcient solar cells for specialized applications.
Crystalline silicon cells (c-Si) are expensive. However, they are most popular
due to their easy availability. Amorphous silicon thin-ﬁlm solar cells are less
expensive. The amorphous silicon layer is used with both hydrogen and ﬂuorine
incorporated into the structure. The a-Si:F:H alloys are produced by the
glow-discharge decomposition of Si F4 in the presence of hydrogen. The efﬁciency
of a-Si module lies between 6 and 8 %.
Thin-ﬁlm solar cells can be manufactured by using a variety of compound
semiconductors. These compound materials include (a) copper‒indium selenide
(CuInSe2), (b) cadmium sulphide (CdS), (c) cadmium telluride (CdTe), (d) cop-
per sulphide (Cu2S), and (e) indium phospate (InP). The stability of the copper‒
indium selenide (CuInSe2) solar cell appears to be excellent. Combinations of
different band-gap materials in the tandem conﬁgurations lead to photovoltaic
generators with greater efﬁciencies.
Silicon (Si)
Crystalline silicon (c-Si) is the most extensively used bulk material for the man-
ufacturing of solar cells. Bulk silicon can be processed to obtain monocrystalline
silicon, polycrystalline silicon, or ribbon silicon using advanced processing
technologies.
(i) Monocrystalline silicon (c-Si): Monocrystalline silicon is cut from cylindrical
ingots made from the Czochralski process. The solar cells are cut in a
pseudo-square shape to minimize the waste of processed monocrystalline
silicon. Therefore, in a solar panel manufactured from monocrystalline silicon,
some portion of the module area is uncovered from the cell.
(ii) Polycrystalline or multicrystalline silicon (poly-Si or mc-Si): In polycrys-
talline or multicrystalline silicon, the crystal structure is not same throughout.
Solar

Polycrystalline silica is made from square ingots. The ingots are made by
cooling and solidifying the molten silicon in a controlled environment. The
wafers (of thickness approximately 180–350 µm) are cut from square ingots
4.2
Fundamentals of Semiconductor and Solar Cells
133

and used for manufacturing polycrystalline solar cells. Polycrystalline solar
cells are less expensive compared with monocrystalline solar cells, but these
solar cells have lower efﬁciency due to the grain boundaries present in solar
cells.
(iii) Ribbon silicon: Ribbon silicon is a thin ﬁlm made from molten silicon. It is
polycrystalline in nature. In the processing of ribbon silicon, there is no waste
of processed silicon as well as no sawing requirement; therefore, solar cells
manufactured from ribbon silicon are less expensive than polycrystalline solar
cells.
Reﬂection losses are reduced by using an antireﬂection coating that allows
higher absorbance of light into the solar cell. The antireﬂection coating is done by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) technique. Previously
titanium dioxide was used for an antireﬂection coating, but it is gradually being
replaced by silicon nitride. Textured surfaces also reduce reﬂection losses; there-
fore, textured front surfaces can be used (for monocrystalline as well as poly-
crystalline solar cells) as an antireﬂection coating.
Silicon thin-ﬁlms are grown by PECVD technique using silane and hydrogen
gas. Deposition parameters decide the nature of thin ﬁlm, namely, amorphous
silicon, protocrystalline silicon, or nanocrystalline silicon.
The dangling and twisted bonds in thin-ﬁlm silicon cause a deformation in the
conduction and the valence band. These bonds also lead to the formation of energy
levels in the band-gap region due to defects. The energy-conversion efﬁciency of
solar cells made from these materials tends to be lower than those of bulk silicon
solar cells. They are also less expensive to produce. Here the number of collected
charge carriers per incident photon is less; the quantum efﬁciency of thin-ﬁlm solar
cells is also lower.
Amorphous silicon (band gap,1:7 eV) dominantly absorbs the visible portion of
the solar spectrum. Nano-crystalline (nc-Si) and crystalline (c-Si) solar cells have
nearly the same energy band gap. Therefore, the layered structure of these materials
results in a layered structure of the solar cell, which is known as a “tandem solar
cell.” In theses solar cells, the upper layer (a-Si) mostly absorbs the visible part and
the bottom layer mostly absorbs the infrared part of the solar spectrum.
To enhance the efﬁciency of thin-ﬁlm solar cells, different techniques—such as
light-trapping schemes—have been deployed to maximize the absorption of sun-
light. At the same time, advanced thermal-processing techniques have been used to
improve the crystallinity and hence the electrical properties of solar cells. Thin-ﬁlm
solar cells with improved crystallinity are known as “thin-ﬁlm crystalline on glass”
(CGS) [1]. These solar cells are low-cast solar cells, which utilizes the
high-efﬁciency properties of bulk silicon.
Thin-ﬁlm solar cells with transparent top and bottom cover are potentially used
in building-integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) systems. These thin-ﬁlm solar cells can
be used in glazed portions of the building such as windows or the façade. Despite
all of the present technologies (i.e., generations of solar cells), ﬁrst-generation solar
134

Solar Cell Materials, Photovoltaic Modules and Arrays

cells abundantly ﬁll the photovoltaic market; hence, efforts are being made to
achieve a lowest cost per watt of solar cell.
Cadmium telluride (CdTe)
Amongst all the thin-ﬁlm solar cells, CdTe thin solar cells have high light-absorbing
efﬁciency. CdTe can be easily deposited on substrate and is suitable for large-scale
production. The toxicity of these solar cells due to presence of cadmium is a major
issue, which must be addressed for the use of this technology in the production of
solar cells. Scientiﬁc research performed at different laboratories, particularly at
National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL) in the USA, found that amount
of cadmium released into the atmosphere during the processing of CdTe solar cells
is comparatively lower than that of other solar-cell technologies [2].
Copper-indium selenide (CuInSe2)
These thin-ﬁlm solar cells are chemically resistant to the moisture and thermally
stable at higher temperatures (approximately 500 °C). The high light-absorbing
capacity, improved optical properties, and better electrical characteristics of
CuInSe2 make it a suitable option for the manufacturing of thin-ﬁlm solar cells.
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) multijunction
The multijunction thin-ﬁlm solar cell comprises thin ﬁlms of different materials
grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Different materials have different optical
properties, and the materials are chosen in such a way that the multijunction solar
cell absorbs the maximum incident solar radiation and converts it into electricity.
An example of this type of solar cell is the multijunction of GaAs:Ge:GaInP2 [3].
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) multijunction devices are the most efﬁcient solar cells.
The maximum achievable efﬁciency in the laboratory is 40.7 % [4].
Single crystal solar cell
Single-crystalline solar cells made from high-purity materials (solar grade) show
excellent efﬁciencies and long-term stability, but they are expensive.
Figure 4.9 shows the diagram of the silicon solar cell structure and mechanism.
The electric current generated in the semiconductor is extracted by contact to the
front and rear of the cell. The cell is covered with a thin layer of dielectric material,
an antireﬂective coating or ARC, to minimize reﬂection from the top surface.
The total series resistance of the cell can be expressed as:
Rs ¼ Rcp þ Rbp þ Rcn þ Rbn
ð4:17Þ
where Rcp is the metal contact to p-type semiconductor resistance; Rbp the bulk
p-type resistance (the bulk of p-type region is where the most electron‒hole pairs
are generated by the absorption of light and where minority carriers [electrons] are
transported by diffusion and partially lost by recombination); Rcn is the contact to
n-type semiconductor resistance; and Rbn is the bulk n-type resistance.

consists
of

dye
(light-absorbing material) and porous titanium dioxide (semiconducting material) in
liquid or solid electrolyte [5]. The performance of DSSC strongly depends on the
porous layer of titanium dioxide. Dye present in solar cell absorbs sunlight and
generates electrons, which are transported to the anode TiO2; photogenerated
electrons are further transported through the external load, then to the electrolyte on
the other side of the dye, and ﬁnally to the dye.
Most of the materials used in this type of thin-ﬁlm solar cell have low cost. It can
be manufactured by the less expensive roll-printing technique. The major

disadvantages of DSSC are instability, degradation, and use of platinum and
ruthenium (expensive materials). Although the conversion efﬁciency of DSSC is
low, the low cost has allowed this technology to grow on a commercial scale.
Organic/polymer solar cells
Organic solar cells are thin-ﬁlm polymer solar cells. The polymer solar cell is made
using organic semiconducting materials such as copper phthalocyanine, poly-
phenylene vinylene, and carbon fullerenes [6]. These solar cells are less costly, have
a high optical absorption coefﬁcient, and the energy band gap can be tailored by
changing the chain length of polymer. The energy-conversion efﬁciency of organic
solar cells is low compared with inorganic solar cells. Lower stability, smaller life,
and degradation are the major limitations of organic solar cells.
Nanocrystalline solar cells
Nanocrystalline solar cells consist of nanocrystals of semiconductor (Si, CIGS,
CdTs porous metal oxide semiconductors) grown on a substrate (Si, conducting
polymers, organic semiconductors, dyes). They are thin-ﬁlm solar cells with a very
high light-absorbing coefﬁcient. The nano-size dimensions of these solar cells are
responsible for their higher values of conversion efﬁciency. Earlier these solar cells
were synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy, but now a day spin coating (a less
costly technology) is used for the manufacturing of nanocrystalline solar cells.

Basic Parameters of the Solar Cell

Overall current (I)

Where ID is the diode dark current; and IL is the light induced current I0 leakage

Short circuit current (ISC)
The short-circuit current is the light-induced current that occurs when the load in the
circuit is zero, i.e., both terminals (positive and negative) of the solar cell are
connected together.
Open-circuit voltage (Voc)
The open-circuit voltage is the voltage across the solar cell when there is no current
ﬂowing in the circuit, i.e., there is inﬁnite resistance between the terminals of the
solar cell. This can be found from Eq. (4.21) and is expressed as follows:

[7]. For an ideal solar cell, the series resistance must be zero and the shunt resistance
must be inﬁnite. For better performance of a solar cell, the series resistance must be
kept as minimum as possible and the shunt resistance must be as large as possible. In
commercial solar cells, the shunt resistance is very large and is neglected compared
with the forward resistance of the diode.

Fill factor (FF)
The ﬁll factor gives an idea of the maximum power output withdrawn from the solar
cell for a given Voc and Isc. Mathematically it is given by Eq. (4.26). The value of
FF under ideal conditions is unity. Deviation from the ideal value is due to defects
and contact resistance. The lower the value of the FF, the less sharp will be the I–V
curve (Fig. 4.11). For an Si solar cell, the maximum value of FF is 0.88.

Solution
Power output = 0.16 × 1000 × 4.02 × 10−4 × 0.782 = 0.05 W.
Effect of solar cell temperature on solar cell efﬁciency
A fraction of the total solar radiation incident on a solar cell produces electricity,
and the remaining radiation is converted into thermal energy. A part of the pro-
duced thermal energy raises the temperature of solar cell, and the rest is dissipated
from top and bottom of the solar cell [7]. The temperature of the solar cell dete-
riorates the electrical performance of the solar cell. For unit area, the energy balance
can be written as follows:
asIðtÞ ¼ gcIðtÞ þ UL Tc  Ta
ð
Þ
ð4:31Þ
where s is the transmittivity of the cover of the solar cell; a is the absorptivity of the
solar cell; gc is the electrical efﬁciency of the solar cell; and UL is the overall loss
coefﬁcient, which is the sum of the top-loss coefﬁcient and the bottom-loss coef-
ﬁcient. The top-loss coefﬁcient is determined by taking into account the effect of
both convection and radiation, and the bottom-loss coefﬁcient includes the effect of
the conductive heat transfer coefﬁcient due to the bottom of solar cell as well as
convective heat transfer coefﬁcient from the back surface of the bottom to the
ambient.
The nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) is the temperature of the solar
cell corresponding to 20 °C ambient temperature, 800 W/m2 solar radiation, 1 m/s
wind speed, and no-load conditions. It is deﬁned as that cell or module temperature
reached when the cells are mounted in their normal way at a solar radiation level of
800 W/m2, a wind speed of 1 m/s, an ambient temperature of 20 °C, and no-load
operation (i.e., with gc ¼ 0).
For no-load condition, gc ¼ 0; therefore from Eq. (4.31), one can have

4.3
Generation of Solar Cell (Photovoltaic) Materials
Solar cell technologies are categorized into three generations. These generations are
divided according to the time of evolution of respective technology. Presently,
research and development activities for efﬁciency improvement and reduction in
production costs for each generation of solar cell are being done in various research
groups worldwide. Most of the solar cell market is covered by ﬁrst-generation solar
cells [9].
4.3.1
First Generation
First-generation solar cells are based on Si wafer technology. First-generation solar
cells include monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon solar cells. These solar
cells are single-junction solar cells with 33 % theoretical efﬁciency [10]. The
processing technology involved for the manufacturing of ﬁrst-generation solar cell
requires
high
energy
and
labour.
The
energy-conversion
efﬁciency
of
ﬁrst-generation solar cell is 15–20 %. These solar cells are widely used amongst all
generations of solar cells.
4.3.2
Second Generation
Second-generation solar cells include the amorphous solar cells. The efﬁciency of
these solar cells is low in comparison with the ﬁrst-generation solar cells, but their
production cost is low. This solar cell technology does not require high-temperature
processing unlike ﬁrst-generation solar cells. The second generation solar cell
materials include CdTe, CIGS, a-Si, and micromorphous silicon. Second-generation
solar cells are manufactured by depositing the thin ﬁlm of the above materials on
the substrates (Si, glass or ceramics) using chemical vapour deposition, molecular
beam epitaxy, or spin-coating technique.

Third Generation

technologies
mainly
focus
on
the
improvement
of
the
energy-conversion efﬁciency and light-absorption coefﬁcient of second-generation
solar cells while keeping the production cost close to that of second-generation
solar cells. The enhancement in efﬁciency can be achieved by manufacturing
multijunction solar cells, improving the light-absorption coefﬁcients (concentrating
solar cells), and using techniques to increase the carrier collection [11].
Here it is important to mention that there are two ways of deﬁning solar cell
electrical efﬁciency:
(a) Under standard test conditions (STC), i.e., indoor conditions
Io ¼ constant ¼ 1000 W/m2 and surrounding temperature ¼ 25 C


All electrical efﬁciencies of different solar cells reported earlier are under
standard test conditions (STC) (Fig. 4.11a) NREL
(b) Under open-ﬁeld conditions [for available variable solar radiation in terrestrial
regions in wavelength range between 0.23 and 2.6 μm]
This is deﬁned as
g ¼ Pm



, which is responsible to carry electrons from the balance band
to the conduction band and hence current is produced. Furthermore, the energy
content from 0.40 to 0.70 μm is 47 %. This means that one cannot have an efﬁ-
ciency of solar cells produced from silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and
germanium (Ge) materials that is more than 47 %. This is the reason that the
electrical efﬁciency of such solar cells is much lower than 47 %.
4.4
Photovoltaic (PV) Module and PV Array
As discussed previously, solar cells convert solar energy in wavelengths of visible
radiation into direct current (DC) electricity by way of the photovoltaic effect.
Single solar cells cannot generate enough power for many of practical applications;
therefore, solar cells are connected in series and sandwiched between top trans-
parent and bottom opaque/transparent covers to protect them from adverse weather
conditions. The series-connected packaged solar cells are known as photovoltaic
modules (PV modules). PV modules are available in different sizes and shapes

depending
on
the
required
electrical
output.
The
number
and
size
of
series-connected solar cells made from a particular material (wafer-based c-Si,
thin-ﬁlm CdTe, or crystalline silicon) primarily decides the output of the PV
module. The electrical interconnections as well as weather and climatic conditions
are some other factors that affect the output of a PV module. PV modules made of
different materials are available on the market, but glass-to-Tedlar PV modules with
36 solar cells (each cell produces 0.5 V) connected in series (which can charge a
typical 12-V battery) are widely used. In this type of PV module, the
series-connected cells are sandwiched between a top glass cover and Tedlar and
sealed with a metal frame. Most of the modules are rigid, but thin-ﬁlm solar cell‒
based modules are ﬂexible. The positive and negative terminals for interconnections
are provided on the backside of PV module. PV modules are rated in terms of peak
watts (Wp), which is the power produced at 1000 W/m2. A typical panel with a
40 Wp rating may produce energy between 100 and 200 Wh/day.
A photovoltaic (PV) array is a collection series or parallel, or both series and
parallel, connected photovoltaic (PV) modules. The size of a PV array depends on
the requirement of electrical power. The DC power produced from a PV array is
converted into AC power using an inverter and fed to the different electrical loads.
PV modules are connected in series to achieve the desired voltage; then such
series-connected strings are connected in parallel to enhance the current and hence
power output from the array. The size of the PV array decides its capacity, which
may be in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.
The electrical output of a PV module depends on solar irradiance, solar cell
temperature, electrical efﬁciency of solar cell, and load resistance. For a given size
of solar cell, the current increases with increasing solar irradiance, and the current is
marginally affected (marginal increase) due to temperature rise; however, a higher
solar cell temperature decreases the voltage output of solar cell, which in turn
decreases power output. Load resistance is decided by the operating point of
module; the preferred operating is peak power point. Solar cell efﬁciency is gov-
erned by the manufacturing process and the solar cell material, and it varies from 9
to 20 %. Therefore, for better performance, the PV module in an array must operate
at the peak power point; the array must be installed in an open place (no shading);
and the PV module must be kept cool.
4.4.1
Single-Crystal Solar Cell Module
These type of module deploy series-connected crystalline solar cells sandwiched
between a top glass cover (with high transmittivity, low-iron glass), an encapsulate
(transparent and insulating; most commonly used is ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)),
and a back cover (Tedlar/Mylar/glass) as shown in Fig. 4.12. A series or parallel, or
both series and parallel, combination of these modules forms the crystalline PV
array.

Solar Cell Materials, Photovoltaic Modules and Arrays

Crystalline PV modules are divided into two categories depending on the
material of the back cover of the module. If the back cover of the module is made of
opaque Tedlar, it is known as a “glass-to-Tedlar” or “opaque” PV module
(Fig. 4.13a); if the back cover is made of glass, it is known as a “glass-to-glass” or
“semitransparent” PV module (Fig. 4.13b, c). The amount of light transmitted from
a semitransparent PV module depends on its packing factor. The lower the packing
factor,
the
lower
the
area
covered
by
the
solar
cell.
Therefore,
for
electrical/thermal/day lighting application, the packing factor of the semitransparent
PV
module
can
be
tailored
(Fig. 4.13b,
c)
per
the
desired
requirement
(thermal/electrical/daylighting) from the system.
4.4.2
Thin-Film PV Modules
Thin-ﬁlm PV modules are made of thin-ﬁlm solar cells. Thin-ﬁlm solar cells are
manufactured at lower temperature compared with crystalline solar cells; hence,
these technologies are less energy intensive. In addition, the production cost of
thin-ﬁlm solar cells is lower than that of crystalline solar cells. Furthermore, the thin

ﬁlms can be easily deposited onto different substrates such as glass, metal, or even
at plastic; this ﬂexibility leads to greater interest in manufacturing of thin-ﬁlm PV
modules. Another advantage of thin-ﬁlm PV modules is that they can bend;
therefore, they can be used at different structures of the building facade and other
glazing areas. The major drawback of this technology is low energy-conversion
efﬁciency and degradation on exposure to adverse weather conditions (the
Staebler-Wronski effect). The major challenge for this technology is improvement
of the conversion efﬁciency of commercially made thin-ﬁlm PV modules [12].
Initially amorphous silicon thin-ﬁlm solar cells were used in thin-ﬁlm PV
modules because production cost are low and production processes are simpler than
that of polycrystalline silicon [13]. However, the energy-conversion efﬁciency of
amorphous silicon thin-ﬁlm PV modules is only 6–7 % [14]. Other materials used
for thin-ﬁlm solar cell technology for manufacturing thin-ﬁlm PV modules are
copper–indium–diselenide
(CIS),
copper–gallium–diselenide
(CGS),
copper–
indium–gallium–diselenide
(CIGS),
and
cadmium
telluride
(CdTe).
The
energy-conversion efﬁciency achieved by these thin-ﬁlm technologies is up to
approximately 20 % (19.9 % for CIGS (NREL, USA), 16.5 % for CdTe (NREL,
USA), and 13 % for CIGS (Wurth Solar, Germany)). Thin-ﬁlm solar cell tech-
nology is gaining more interest, and large-capacity manufacturing plants are already
in operation around the globe [15].
4.4.3
III–V Single Junction and Multijunction PV Modules
Multijunction solar cells utilize a wider range of solar spectra for electricity gen-
eration. In multijunction solar cells, different solar cells placed in a tandem
arrangement have different band gaps. Therefore, a multijunction solar cell utilizes
Fig. 4.13 a Opaque PV module of 75 Wp, b semitransparent PV module of 75 Wp, and
c semitransparent PV module of 37 Wp

a different range of spectra for electricity generation, which reduces absorption
losses and improves efﬁciency. The thermodynamic performance limit of multi-
junction solar cells is 68 %, which is further improved to 85 % for concentrating
multijunction solar cells. The PV module manufactured from multijunction solar
cells are very lightweight panels and are used particularly in space applications. The
tandem arrangement can be made by mechanical stacking, by monolithic technique,
or by both. The most commonly used dual-junction solar cells include the
gallium-arsenide (GaAs) cell with efﬁciency of up to 30 % and the multijunction
cell made of GaInP/GaInAs/Ge (gallium indium phosphide/gallium indium
arsenide/germanium substrate). This multijunction solar cell has an efﬁciency (with
concentrating sunlight) of 41.1 % (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems).
GaAs solar cells are ideal for applications with concentrating sunlight, which allows
the lesser quantity of gallium to further offset limited gallium resources [16].
4.4.4
Emerging and New PV Systems
This category of PV modules uses the recent and emerging technology of solar
cells, namely, organic solar cells (OSC), dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSC),
quantum-well solar cells (QWSC), etc. The major issues at the centre of recent
research and development activities worldwide are reduced production cost and
enhanced energy conversion efﬁciency. PV modules utilizing new and emerging
solar cell technology are categorized on the basis of light-absorbing capacity and
electricity-generation mechanism. The solar cell that contains only organic poly-
mers is termed an “organic” solar cell; if it includes some inorganic material then it
is known as a “hybrid organic” solar cell. Dye-sensitized solar cells contain porous
nano-particles of titanium dioxide, which enhance the light-gathering capacity of
the solar cell and hence its electrical efﬁciency. O’Regan and Gratzel [17] reported
an efﬁciency of 10.4 % for these solar cells. DSSC has a low production cost
because the processing mechanism is simpler and the material cost is also low. The
quantum-well solar cell consists of a low-energy band-gap material sandwiched
between relatively large-energy band-gap materials such as GaAs. Efﬁciencies of
different modules utilizing different solar cells are given in Table 4.3. The move-
ment of electrons is conﬁned to in a plane in QWSC unlike the three-dimensional
motion in other solar cells. The electrical efﬁciency of these solar cells is improved
due to the conﬁned motion in the quantum well. These solar cells are fabricated by
chemical vapour deposition or molecular beam epitaxy techniques. Properties of
different solar cell materials under standard test conditions are given in
Appendix IV [18].

comfort, and electricity needed for different electrical appliances. In addition, these
PV arrays can be connected to medium-scale decentralized grids. In grid-connected
systems, surplus power is fed to the grid; under cloudy conditions, power can be fed
from the grid.

Packing Factor bc
ð
Þ of the PV Module
The packing factor is deﬁned as the ratio of total solar cell area to the total module
area and can be expressed as:
bc ¼ area of solar cells
area of PV module
ð4:35Þ
It is clear that bc is less than unity (pseudo solar cell), and it has maximum value
of one when all area is covered by the solar cell (e.g., rectangular solar cell).
4.4.6
Efﬁciency of the PV Module
The electrical efﬁciency of a PV module expressed as a percentage can be expressed
as follows:
gem ¼ sg  bc  gec
ð4:36aÞ
For bc ¼ 1; Eq. (4.36a) reduces to
gem ¼ sg  gec
ð4:36bÞ
This shows that the electrical efﬁciency of a PV module (gem) is less than the
electrical efﬁciency of solar cell due to presence of glass over the solar cell (gec).
This is also expressed as:
gem ¼
FF  Isc  Voc
Am  Ip
	

 100
ð4:37aÞ
where Am ¼ area of PV module; Ip ¼ incident solar intensity on the PV module;
and FF, Isc and Voc are the ﬁll factor, the short-circuit current, and the open-circuit
voltage, respectively, of the PV module. The maximum value of ﬁll factor (FF) of
an Si-based PV module is 0.88.
The temperature-dependent electrical efﬁciency of the PV module can be
expressed as follows:

Energy Balance Equations for PV Modules
In this section, we will consider the crystalline solar cell module generally known as
the “PV module.” There are two type of PV modules, namely, (a) the opaque PV
module, Fig. 4.13a and (b) the semitransparent PV module, Fig. 4.13b.
The energy balance equations for PV modules have been written with following
assumptions:
• One-dimensional heat conduction
• The system is in quasi-steady state
• The ohmic losses between solar cells in the PV module are negligible
(a) For the opaque (glass-to-Tedlar) PV module (Fig. 4.13a) [19]
In this case, solar radiation, IðtÞ, is transmitted by the glass of PV module as sgIðtÞ,
and furthermore it is absorbed by the solar cell of the PV module having area Am
and packing factor bc as sgacbcIðtÞAm. The remaining solar radiation sgð1  bcÞIðtÞ
is absorbed by Tedlar

Series and Parallel Combination of PV Modules
PV modules are connected in series or in parallel to increase current and voltage
ratings. When PV modules are connected in series/parallel, it is desired to have the
maximum power production at the same current/voltage. A solar panel is a group of
several modules connected in series/parallel combination in a frame that can be
mounted on a structure.
Series and parallel connection of modules in a panel is shown in Fig. 4.16b. In
parallel connection, blocking diodes are connected in a series with each series string
of modules such that if any string should fail, the power output of the remaining
series string will not be absorbed by the failed string. In addition, bypass diodes are
installed across each module such that if one module should fail, the power output
of the remaining modules in a string will bypass the failed module. Some modern
PV modules come with such internally embedded bypass diodes. A large number of
interconnected solar panels is known as solar PV array.

Applications of the PV Module/PV Array
There are many applications of the PV module/PV array such as street lights, water
pumping, building, agriculture, transport, refrigeration, stand alone and roof top etc.
These applications will be discussed in the chapter about solar power generation
(Chapter XVI).
Example 4.11 Calculate the daily load for domestic use and determine the number
of 40 Wp PV panels required in the array.
Solution
Consider the following domestic loads:
Four 40 W lamps + one 15 W television used 4 h per day: 700 Wh
Two 35 W fans used 6 h per day: 420 Wh.
One 60 W refrigerator used all day, compressor on 50 % of the time: 720 Wh:
Total daily domestic load ¼ 1840 Wh
For 150 Wh per day energy production per PV module.
Number of panels required (in parallel connection) ¼ 1840 Wh/150 Wh ¼ 12:3:
Therefore, a 12 V system needs 13 PV modules connected in parallel.
4.5
Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Systems
From Eq. (4.34a), it is clear that an electrical efﬁciency of the photovoltaic
(PV) module depends on the operating temperature of the PV module. If the
operating temperature of the PV module is reduced, then the electrical efﬁciency of
the PV module will be increased. In addition to increased electrical efﬁciency of the
PV module, there can be additional thermal energy if thermal energy is prop-
erly collected by using a medium such as either water or air. Such a system is
known as a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system. Photovoltaic thermal (PVT)
systems are broadly classiﬁed as follows.
4.5.1
PVT Water Collectors
In this case, water as a ﬂuid can be ﬂown either above or below the PV module as
shown in Fig. 4.17a, b. One can get hot water in addition to enhanced electrical
output. Hot water has many applications including domestic as well as industrial.
A thermal circuit diagram of an opaque PVT water collector and a semitrans-
parent PVT water collector are shown in Fig. 4.18a, b, respectively.

The semitransparent PVT water collector gives the better performance compared
with the opaque PVT water collector. The expression of temperature-dependent
electrical efﬁciency for a semitransparent PVT water collector can be obtained as

PVT Air Collectors
In this case, air as a ﬂuid can be ﬂown either above or below the PV module; one
can get hot air in addition to enhanced electrical output. Hot air has also many
applications such as solar crop drying and space heating.
The working principle of the PVT air collector can be explained as follows:
There is an air duct with a proper channel below the PV module. There is a rate of
overall heat transfer from the solar cell of the PV module, which ﬂows air through
the Tedlar, Utc;f Tc  Tf
ð
ÞAm, which is used to heat the ﬂowing air with a mass ﬂow
rate of
_ma ¼ density of air q
ð Þ  cross sectional area of air duct a ¼ L  b
ð
Þ
 flowrateðuÞ;
with speciﬁc heat of air as Ca. Once the temperature of the ﬂowing air is increased,
there is also a rate of overall heat loss from ﬂowing air to ambient air through the
bottom insulation, Ubf;a Tf  Ta
ð
ÞAm. Here it is important to mention that there is an
indirect gain of thermal energy to the ﬂowing air.
On the basis of energy balance of the solar cell of the PV module and the ﬂowing
air, an expression for the temperature-dependent electrical efﬁciency for the PVT air
collector covered by opaque PV modules and semitransparent PV modules can be
written as Eqs. (4.52a) and (4.52b) respectively.

The hourly variation of electrical efﬁciency of PV modules is shown in
Fig. 4.19. It can be clearly observed that the semitransparent PV module has better
solar cell efﬁciency because the radiation falling on the nonpacking area is trans-
mitted to the blackened absorber plate. In the case of the opaque PV module, the
radiation falling on the nonpacking area is absorbed by the tedlar resulting in a
higher module temperature and hence lower solar cell efﬁciency.
The efﬁciency of the PVT system can be deﬁned based on the following:
(a) The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, which will be referred to as the “overall
thermal efﬁciency” of the PVT system; and
(b) the second law of thermodynamics, which will be referred as the overall
exergy efﬁciency” of the PVT system.
4.5
Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Systems

Equations (4.37a) and (4.37b) gives the electrical efﬁciency of a PV module. If
one needs to determine the equivalent thermal efﬁciency for a PV module in terms
of percentage, it can be expressed as
geth ¼ gem
0:38  100
ð4:53Þ
where 0.38 is the conversion factor from thermal energy to electrical energy for the
best coal available internationally. However, it varies from 0.20 to 0.40.
The overall thermal efﬁciency of the hybrid PVT system may be written as
gov;th ¼ gth þ ge
0:38
ð4:54Þ
where gth is the thermal efﬁciency of the PVT system.
The overall exergy efﬁciency of the hybrid PVT system is the sum of electrical
efﬁciency and equivalent exergy efﬁciency of thermal energy, Eq. (3.6). The
expression for this may be written as:
gov;ex ¼ gex þ ge
ð4:55Þ
where gex is exergy efﬁciency ¼ gth 1  Tsink

; and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Degradation of Solar Cell Materials [39]
4.6.1
Dust Effect
The deposition of dust on PV modules is a serious concern because it affects the
performance of the PV systems. Dust deposition depends on the weather conditions
and the local environment of the particular place. It also depends on the physical
and chemical composition of the dust. The surface of the module also plays an
important role for dust deposition because dust accumulation is higher for rough
surfaces. The optical performance of a PV module is negatively affected due to dust
deposition because dust blocks the solar radiation from coming into direct contact
with the solar cells of the module.
Under outdoor conditions, the surface ﬁnish, tilt angle, humidity, and wind
speed also affect dust accumulation. Tilted PV systems usually accumulate less dust
compared with strictly horizontal systems.
4.6.2
Aging Effect
As time elapses, the performance of the PV modules degrades. This phenomenon of
performance degradation is known as the “aging effect” of PV modules. The time
period during which a PV module yields the rated power is closely connected to the
life time of the PV module, which signiﬁcantly depends on the materials and
technology used for fabrication of the PV module. The aging effect is due to the
weather conditions, ﬂuctuation in ambient temperature, rain, dust deposition, etc.
Decolouration and large strain formation affect the performance and life time of the
module. It is suggested to optimize the effect of the environment on the operation of
modules. By using UV-ﬁltering glass superstrates, the modules can be made more
resistant to degradation.

Abstract A ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) is a device to collect solar energy and
transform it into thermal energy (low-grade energy) by using water as a working
ﬂuid. It is a heart of solar thermal devices that has many applications in a medium
temperature range ≅100 °C from domestic to preheating to industrial sectors. The
hot water available from ﬂat-plate collectors (FPC’s) can be also used to conserve
fossil fuel.

Introduction
Solar radiation is considered to be in the form of electromagnetic waves as well as
photon-carrying energy ðhmÞ. Solar energy can be used broadly by three techno-
logical processes, namely:
(i)
Heliochemical: This process maintains life on Earth by producing food and
converting CO2 from the atmosphere into O2 using photons through the
process of photosynthesis, i.e., light and dark reaction.
(ii)
Helioelectrical: In this process photons are used in a semiconductor to
produce electricity (Chap. 4); these are known as “photovoltaic converters.”
They provide power for many applications including spacecraft.
(iii)
Heliothermal: This process can be used to provide much of the thermal
energy required for solar water/air heating and building heating. It is also
referred as a “solar thermal system.”
The most important part of the solar thermal system is the ﬂat-plate collector
(FPC), which will be discussed in this chapter.

Flat-Plate Collector
The FPC is the heart of any solar energy‒collection system. It is designed for
operation in the medium temperature range between 60 and 100 °C. It is used to
absorb both the beam and the diffuse solar radiation (Chap. 1) after transmission
from the glass cover. The absorber converts it into thermal energy (heat) and then
transfers the absorbed thermal energy (heat) into a stream of liquid or gas (Fig. 5.1a).
In the present case involves water. It does not require tracking of the Sun. It requires
little operation and maintenance.
A conventional FPC generally consists of the following components, namely:
(a) Glazing: This is transparent material for the short wavelength range
(0.23–2.6 μm) and opaque for the long wavelength range ≥2.6 μm. The
number of transparent materials used can be more than one (Fig. 5.1a)
(b) Tubes and ﬁns: The ﬂuid is allowed to pass through tubes and ﬁns for
conducting or directing the heat transfer from absorber to the ﬂowing ﬂuid
(Fig. 5.1b).

(c) Absorber plate: This is a blackened conducting ﬂat plate, corrugated or
grooved, with tubes and ﬁns for the absorption of short-wavelength solar
radiation (Fig. 5.1b).
(d) Header or manifolds: There are two headers, namely, the lower header,
which allows ﬂuid to pass through, and upper header, which is used to dis-
charge hot water after heating (Fig. 5.1b).
(e) Insulation: This is a nonconduting material at the bottom of tube and ﬁns to
minimize heat loss from the back and sides of the FPC (Fig. 5.1b).
(f) Container or casing: This surrounds the various components and protects
them from dust and moisture, etc. (Fig. 5.1b).
It is important to mention that area of the glass cover and the absorber is equal.
5.2.1
Glazing Materials
The role of a glazing material is to transmit the maximum possible short-wavelength
radiation and to minimize the upward loss of heat from the absorber to the ambient
through the glazing. The most commonly used glazing material is glass. It can
transmit up to 90 % of incident short-wavelength radiation, but it behaves as opaque
for long-wavelength heat radiation (≥2.6 μm), which is emitted by the absorber plate.
Plastic ﬁlms and sheets may also be used for the purpose of glazing because they
possess high transmittance to short-wavelength solar radiation.
The transmittance (τ)
The propagation of solar radiation through one non-absorbing cover is shown in
Fig. 5.2a. Considering only the perpendicular component of polarization of

The same expression can be obtained for the parallel component of polarization

dence. The transmittance of initially unpolarised solar radiation is the average of the
two components and it is expressed as

The variation of sq with angle of incidence is shown in Fig. 5.2b for a different
glass covers. It shows that transmittance decreases as the number of glass covers
increases.
Absorption by glazing
According to Bouguer’s law, the absorbed solar radiation is proportional to the
product of solar intensity and the distance travelled (x) in the medium. It can be
expressed as follows:
dI ¼ KI dx
ð5:4Þ
Here K is proportionality constant known as the “extinction coefﬁcient of
glass.” It is assumed to be constant in the solar spectrum. The value of K varies
from 4 m1 for “white-water” glass to 32 m1 for poor glass (greenish).

The propagation of short-wavelength solar radiation (0.23–2.6 μm) through a
glass window is shown in Fig. 5.3. The transmission characteristic of a window
glass cover is also shown in the same ﬁgure.
5.2.2
Working Principle
The critical component of the FPC is to act as the absorber and tubes/duct for the
ﬂow of liquid/gas. In case of the water collector, water ﬂowing in the tubes receives
thermal energy from the absorber plate. The role of absorber of FPC is:
(i)
to absorb the maximum possible solar radiation incident on it through the
glazing;
(ii)
to minimize heat losses from the absorber to the atmosphere from the top,
bottom, and sides of the FPC; and
(iii)
to transfer maximum heat to the ﬂuid.

Flat Plate Collectors

Materials generally used for collector absorber plates are copper, aluminum, and
steel. For better performance and low maintenance, the cost and conductance
should be properly chosen. The selective surface coating of the absorber plate must
ensure high absorptivity
a
ð Þ and low emissivity
ð Þ to retain maximum thermal
(heat) energy. The role of selective surface is vital for high-temperature applica-
tions. For a domestic water-heating system, the absorber plate is normally painted
black because the required temperature is low compared with the industrial demand.
The solar energy absorbed by the absorber plate heats the absorber plate. The
thermal energy from the absorber plate is transferred to the ﬂuid circulating in the
tubes in thermal contact with the absorber plate; or ﬂuid can directly extract the heat
if it is ﬂowing on the absorbing plate. The sides and bottom of the FPC are properly
insulated to reduce losses from the bottom- and sides. The ﬂat-plate‒collector
assembly is inclined at the optimum angle (depending on the location of installa-
tion) to receive the maximum solar radiation throughout the year (Fig. 5.4).
5.2.3
Characteristic Curve of the Flat-Plate Collector
Under steady-state conditions, based on the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the energy
balance of a simple FPC will be as follows:
_qab ¼ _qu þ _qL
ð5:10Þ
where _qab ¼ as
ð
ÞIðtÞ and _qL ¼ UL Tp  Ta

:
Here _qab is the rate of energy absorbed by the plate per unit area; _qu
ð
Þ is the rate
of useful energy transferred to the ﬂuid; and _qL
ð
Þ is the rate of energy lost per unit
area by the absorber plate to the surroundings.
Equation (5.10) can be rewritten as follows:

where a and s are the absorptivity and transmissivity of the glazing surface of the
FPC, respectively; I tð Þ is the incident total solar radiation in the plane of the absorber
(W/m2); Tp and Ta are the plate and the ambient temperature (°C), respectively; and
UL is an overall heat loss coefﬁcient for the FPC (W/m2 °C). Referring to Eq. (5.11a)
and Fig. 5.2, the rate of useful energy decreases with increasing temperature dif-
ference. The thermal loss to the surroundings is an important factor in the determi-
nation of the performance of a FPC. The higher the rate of thermal losses _qL

5.2.4
Classiﬁcation of Flat-Plate Collectors (FPC)
In FPC’s, heat loss by convection is important to determine its performance. The
convective heat loss may be decreased by using double glazing, Fig. 5.6. However,
solar radiation reaching the absorber is reduced due to double reﬂection. Hence, the use
of single glazing gives better thermal efﬁciency than double glazing at low temperatures
due to smaller loss. The use of double glazing is advisable for better performance at
higher temperature differences. The classiﬁcation of FPC’s is shown in Table 5.1.
The schematic diagrams with single glazing are shown in Fig. 5.7 for all of the
collectors. The types of FPC’s used for water heating applications are as follows:
(a) Full pipe and ﬁn: This type should be used with a ﬁn made of a highly conducting
material, namely, copper or aluminium. It is used for domestic water heating
(b) Full water sandwich type: In this case, both the wetted area and the water
capacity are high. Because the thermal conduction is only across the skin
thickness (short distance) of the materials, low-conductivity materials may be
used. Both plastic and steel are used. It is commonly used for heating
swimming pools with plastic panels.
(c) Semi-sandwich type: A medium-conductivity material, such as steel, is
commonly used. In some case aluminium may also be used.

Flat-Plate Collector Testing
FPC performance can be determined from either
(a) controlled indoor tests by using a solar simulator; however, nonavailability of
a solar simulator matched to the solar spectrum limits the accuracy of indoor
tests; or
(b) carefully performed outdoor tests under steady-state conditions; in this case
weather variability limits that the accuracy of outdoor tests.
These tests are the ultimate check on FPC performance under ﬁeld conditions.
The outdoor testing of FPC are described later in the text.
5.3.1
Orientable Test Rig [1]
The standard procedure for testing the FPC is to operate the collector under
steady-state conditions. This means the solar radiation and other conditions are
essentially constant for long-enough time to allow the outlet water temperature and
the rate of the useful gain ð _QuÞ to become steady.
To achieve the above conditions, water at constant temperature Tfi

Furthermore, the FPC is rotated to face the Sun to reduce the angle of incidence and
capacitance effects as shown in Fig. 5.8. This adjustment feature extends for the
duration of the day available for constant steady input of solar radiation to the
system. Instantaneous thermal efﬁciency gi

Series-Connected Test Rig
For N-ﬂat-plate collectors (FPC) connected in series and exposed to the same
climatic operating conditions (Sect. 5.3.1), it is possible to carry out simultaneous
testing of several FPC’s under different operating conditions. In this case, inlet
water temperature is maintained with a controlled ﬂow rate. The inlet and outlet
temperatures for each of the FPC’s are continuously monitored separately.
Although all FPC are exposed to the same environmental conditions. each one is at
a successively higher operational temperature level. It is thus possible to create a

the same formulation given in Sect. 5.3.1.
5.3.3
Flat-Plate Collector with Intermittent Output
This method has been developed to overcome the limitations of previous methods
of steady-state conditions (constant solar radiation and ambient temperature) for a
longer time. In this model, the output water from the FPC is not continuous but
intermittent. It is controlled by a thermal switch that operates only when the outﬂow
temperature reaches a preset value. The outﬂow of hot water is driven by inlet cold
water, which comes from a storage tank on the roof or a higher level under grav-
itational force.
The complete test set up is shown in Fig. 5.9, which consists of
(a) a cold-water tank from which the inlet water at temperature Tfi is fed to the
FPC;
(b) a collector to be tested at some known inclination depending on the latitude of
the testing place; and
(c) a pyranometer to measure the incident solar radiation on the collector, thermal
switch, and storage tank.
The thermal switch controls the solenoidal valve with a thermal (mercury-type)
sensor immersed inside the outﬂow header tube [2] of the FPC Tfo
ð
Þ. When the
water inside the FPC attains a temperature equal to a preset value, the solenoidal
valve opens, and hot water is forced out; when the temperature decreases below the
preset value, cold water inﬂows into the tank, and the valve is closed. The solar
water‒heating
process
is
repeated.
The
temperatures
are
measured
with
copper-constatan thermocouple wires. The thermal sensor is of mercury-type
immersed inside the upper header tube [2]. The outﬂow temperature may differ
from the preset value due to the natural convection inside the inclined collector.

Therefore, during the discharging period, it is advised to measure the average
temperature Tfo, which is equal to the average temperature of the discharged and
well-mixed ﬂuid (inside the insulated storage tank).
Huang and Lu [2] measured the quantity of water discharged to the storage tank
by graduated cylinder in each cycle. They found it to be different from the total ﬂuid
in the absorber. They correlated the quantity of discharged hot water in each cycle
with a parameter Y as follows:
Mfo ¼ 3:74 Y0:507  0:6 kg 0\h\45

ð5:14bÞ
where E is the equilibrium constant. The values of E are determined for different
values of inclination and are found to be approximately independent of solar
incident angle. The values of E for different ranges of incident solar angle are given
in Table 5.2.
The average thermal efﬁciency of each FPC in each cycle is given by

5.3.4
The ASHRAE Method
There are three standard procedures for a liquid collector as given by ASHRAE 93–
77. The essential requirements for all of the procedures are summarized below:
(i)
arrangement for the inlet of ﬂuid at constant temperature with ﬂexibility to
set different values of inlet temperatures;
(ii)
pyranometer to measure the solar radiation on the surface of the FPC;
(iii)
provisions for recording mass ﬂow rate and different temperatures; and
(iv)
equipment for measuring pressure and pressure drop across the FPC.
The general test method is to operate the FPC in the test facility under nearly
steady conditions as shown in Fig. 5.10. To determine _Qu (Eq. 5.12), the following
data, namely, I tð Þ, Tfo; Tfi and Ta, are required to evaluate gi from Eq. (5.13).
Therefore, outdoor tests are performed preferably between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on

clear days. During this time period, the incident solar radiation falls perpendicularly
on the surface of the FPC, and thus it contains maximum beam radiation. Therefore,
the transmittance‒absorptance product is approximately the normal incidence value.
It is expressed as as
ð
Þn for N-glass cover if required.
Tests are performed for various values of the inlet ﬂuid temperature. The effects
of heat capacity of FPCs are minimized by conducting the tests in symmetrical
pairs, i.e., before and after solar noon. Instantaneous thermal efﬁciencies gi
ð Þ are
determined from the expression given in Eq. (5.13) for the averaged pairs. These
are plotted as a function of Tfi  Ta

sites under ASHRAE 93–77 conditions is shown in Fig. 5.11.

perature and wind speed.
Even the data can be used to evaluate intercept FR as
ð
Þn, which is gain factor,
and the slope m ¼ FRUL ¼ tan h, which is loss factor. This method can also be
utilised to compare the performance of different designs of FPCs.
The curve represents the theoretical characteristics derived from points calcu-
lated for the test conditions [3].
The ﬂow rate factor, FR, and slope FRUL, are weak functions of temperature.
There can be variation of beam, diffuse, and ground-reﬂected components of solar
radiation during the test period. Thus, scatter data from a straight line is to be
expected due to these variations. Despite these deviations, FPCs can be charac-
terized by the intercept FR as
ð
Þn and slope FRUL.

Heat-Transfer Coefﬁcients
Thermal loss to the surroundings is an important factor in the study of the per-
formance of an FPC. Thermal loss from an FPC to the surroundings can occur from:
(a) the absorber plate through the glass cover (referred to as “top loss”); and
(b) the absorber plate through the insulation (referred to as “bottom loss”).
These thermal losses take place through conduction, convection, and radiation.
These thermal losses are also shown in Fig. 5.12. The equivalent thermal losses in
the terms of thermal resistance circuit are shown in Fig. 5.13. Here it is important to
discuss that the thermal resistance (r) is inversely proportional to the heat-transfer
coefﬁcient (h). Knowledge of the heat-transfer coefﬁcient is a main feature for
analysis of the performance of the FPC. A discussion of these heat-transfer coef-
ﬁcients is given in the next sections.

where Nu is the Nusselt number; Ka is the thermal conductivity of air between the
plate and the glass cover; and d is the spacing between the absorber plate and the
glass covers.
The expression for Nu can be obtained using the method given by Holland et al.

At the mean air temperature of 40 °C, the air properties are as follows:

convection and radiation. The bottom heat‒loss coefﬁcient (W/m2 °C) is the sum of
the insulating conductive heat-transfer coefﬁcient and the total heat-transfer coef-

Optimization of Heat Losses
There is approximately 33–50 % heat loss in most commercial FPCs, such as
(i) 22–30 % convective losses and
(ii) 5–7 % radiative loss.
These heat losses should be minimized to improve the collector’s thermal efﬁ-
ciency. A highly reﬂective coating is used on the back surface of the FPC to
minimize heat loss from the back surface. Furthermore, the bottom of the absorber
plate is insulated with optimum-thickness glass wool, as shown in Fig. 5.15, to
reduce losses from the bottom of the absorber plate, In the ﬁrst step, radiation loss
from the back surface of the absorber plate is minimized by the reﬂective coating. In
the second step, loss is minimized due to the reﬂecting surface. From the front space
of the absorbing plate, mainly convective and radiative losses take place. These two
losses are minimized by (i) changing the spacing between the cover and the plate;

and (ii) using an absorbing surface with different emissivity. The optimum gap
width is different for different absorbing surfaces. The convective thermal loss is
further reduced to almost zero by illuminating the absorbing plate from below in the
reverse ﬂat-plate conﬁguration. In this conﬁguration, the hot air sticks to the plate
due to a favourable density gradient; hence, convection losses are avoided.
A comparative study of the losses (i) from normal and (ii) from the reverse
ﬂat-plate absorber was performed by Madhusudan et al. [10]. In their study, the
absorber plate was kept in a leak-proof cell (Fig. 5.16) uniformly illuminated by
1000-W cylindrical halogen lamps mounted in Phillips NV-51(2 × 15) reﬂectors.
The illumination intensity on the absorber plate was measured using calibrated
silicon solar cells. Various temperatures were recorded by a calibrated copper-
constantan thermocouple and a multiple-strip chart recorder.
The theoretical and experimental values are compared (using black paint and
cobalt oxide as ¼ 0:88; e 100 C
ð
Þ ¼ 0:15

Þ coating) in normal and reverse conﬁg-
urations of absorbing surfaces. The optimum gap width for the black-painted and the
selective surface were *2.5 and 5.0 cm, respectively, in normal and reverse con-
ﬁguration. No effect of radiation is observed on this gap width. The higher gap width
shows equivalent or better performance in the case of selective surfaces. Smaller gaps
are preferred to avoid shading of the absorber surface by the collector walls.
5.5.1
Transparent Insulating Material (Honeycomb)
When designing solar FPCs, the main objective is to reduce convective heat loss
through the glass cover. Such studies of convection suppression have been performed
by many researchers, particularly by Hollands [4], Buchberg et al. [5], Edwards [11],
and Meyer et al. [12]. In their studies, the space between the top glass cover and the
absorber plate is ﬁlled with a transparent/specularly reﬂecting honeycomb structure
to reduce convective losses. In the absence of ﬂuid motion, conduction and radiation
will be the heat-transfer mechanism between the two plates.

Optimization of Heat Losses

Inclusion of the honeycomb modiﬁes the radiative characteristics of the solar
FPC. The honeycomb structure reduces the amount of radiation reaching the
absorber plate. The choice of the material for the honeycomb structure should be
such that the material must be infrared-transparent or infrared‒specularly reﬂecting.
Speciﬁcally chosen materials do not affect the radiative characteristics of the solar
FPC to a great extent. For infrared opaque material for the honeycomb structure, the
radiative characteristics of solar FPC will be equivalent to a black body, which is
undesirable.
5.5.2
Selective Surface
FPCs must have a high absorptance ðaÞ for incident solar radiation. These collectors
lose energy due to convection and radiation from the absorbing surface. For the
reduction of radiation losses, an absorber surface with a lower value of
long-wavelength emittance is desired. Both of the requirements, i.e., high absor-
bance and low long-wavelength emittance, can be achieved by choosing a selective
absorber surface.
Figure 5.17 shows the variation of reﬂectance with wavelength for an ideal
surface. The reﬂectance of this ideal surface is very low below a certain cut-off
wavelength kc; however, for wavelengths greater than kc the reﬂectance is near
unity, and emittance k ¼ ak ¼ 1  qk
ð
Þ is low. The operating temperature of the
solar FPC is low; hence, it emit at wavelengths greater than 3 μm.
5.6
Fin Efﬁciency
Figure 5.18 shows a dimension of one half- of one tube below the plate (absorber)
conﬁguration (Fig. 5.7). A bonding material has been used between the plate and
the tube. The sheet above the bond is assumed to be at some local base temperature
Tb. The distance between the centres of the two tubes is W, which is at the same as
distance between centres of the two absorber sheets. Hence, the distance between
the centres of the absorber sheet and the tube is W=2. If the outer and the inner-tube
(riser) diameters are D and d, respectively, then solar radiation absorbed over

Þ=2 length of absorber sheet will be performed toward the riser. The region
between the centre line separating the tubes and the tube bond base can be con-
sidered as a ﬁn problem. The absorber sheet has a thickness of d. Because the sheet
material is a good conductor, the temperature gradient through the thickness of
sheet is negligible.
To see the effectiveness of a ﬁn to transfer a given quantity of heat, a new
parameter is deﬁned, which is known as “ﬁn-efﬁciency factor”. It is expressed as
follows:

The following assumptions (Fig. 5.21a) are made to determine F0 [7]:
(i)
the incident solar radiation is absorbed only by the absorber plate;
(ii)
the bottom surface of the absorber plate and tubes are perfectly insulated;
(iii)
the heat loss occurs only from the top surface of the plate;
(iv)
the tubes are brazed onto the plate as shown in Fig. 5.21;
(v)
the bond has thermal conductivity Kb, which also accounts for the effects of a
poor joint; and
(vi)
the thermal inertia effects can be neglected under steady-state conditions.

The collector-efﬁciency factor, F0, is essentially a constant for any collector
design and ﬂuid-ﬂow rate. F0 decreases with an increase in the centre-to-centre
distance of the tube and increases with an increase in the material thickness and
thermal conductivity. An increase in the overall loss coefﬁcient decreases F0,
whereas an increase in the ﬂuid-to-tube heat-transfer coefﬁcient increases it. F0 and
F for some other conﬁgurations of collectors are shown in Fig. 5.22.

The factor FR reduces the rate of useful energy gain from the expected value if
the whole collector absorber plate has been at the ﬂuid-inlet temperature. The
temperature rise through the FPC decreases with an increase of the mass-ﬂow rate.
This results in fewer losses. Consequently, the actual rate of useful energy gain
increases. The heat-removal factor, FR
ð
Þ, can never become more than the FPC‒
efﬁciency factor, F0.

Another expression for FR was derived by Hottel [14], Bliss [15], and Whiller
[16] (HWB model), and it is given by

is

factor,
Eq. (5.63),
and
N0 ¼
AcU0= _mfCf
ð
Þ is a dimensionless design parameter.
The analysis leading to Eq. (5.76) neglects the axial conduction in both the ﬂuid
and the absorber. In the case of the ﬂuid, this assumption seems reasonable due to
low conductivity of the ﬂuids commonly used in FPCs. However, FPC absorber
plates are of a good conducting material. Heat transfer due to axial conduction in
the absorber plate is opposite to the heat transfer toward the ﬂuid; hence, it
decreases the ﬂuid temperature and the overall thermal efﬁciency of the solar FPC.
In some cases, the prediction made by the model of Hottel, Whiller, and Bliss
(HWB) is as much as 30 % higher.
Taking the axial conduction of heat into consideration, Phillips [17] analytically
derived an expression for FR as follows:

to (Fig. 5.24)

ð5:78bÞ
Phillips has also developed an empirically expression for FR over the full range
of parameters N0; F0 and K as follows:

In the models by Hottel, Whiller, and Bliss (HWB), the error due to neglecting
the axial conduction can be represented as a conduction error, and it is given as

The practical upper limit on the error for FPCs with F0K0 ¼ 0:8 that could result
from neglecting axial conduction is approximately 22 %. For collectors having
F0K0 products in the range of 0.1–0.5, the error is not more than 12 %.

It is to be noted that Tf  Ta

Tfi  Ta
ð
Þ for forced mode (Eq. 5.82b); hence, the threshold intensity in forced
mode will have lower values. This means that the FPC will operate earlier
under forced mode.
5.8
Combination of FPCs
A large bank of FPCs can be formed in the following ways:
(a) Parallel connection: In this case, the upper and lower headers of each FPC are
connected to increase the volume of water to be heated. This makes a row and can
be referred as “one module.” The mass ﬂow rate per FPC is the total mass ﬂow rate
divided by number of FPCs. The outlet-water temperature is the same at the outlet
of each FPC. Such FPC modules can operate in natural as well as forced mode.
(b) Series connection: In this case, the outlet of one row of FPCs (the ﬁrst
module) is connected with the inlet to a second row of FPCs (second module)
and so on. The mass-ﬂow rates in such cases are the same for all rows. The
outlet temperature depends on the number of rows of FPCs connected in
series. Such series-connected FPC modules can only operate in forced mode.
(c) Mixed-connection combination: In this case, the ﬁrst FPCs are connected in
parallel for a given capacity of hot water to make one row (one module), and
such modules formed are connected in series to increase the temperature per
the requirement. This is generally referred to as “arrays.” Here also the FPCs’
arrays will only operate in forced mode.
5.8.1
M-FPC Connected in Parallel
Figure 5.25 show that m-FPCs are connected in parallel to from one module. As
mentioned previously, the inlet and the outlet of each FPC are connected together.
The mass-ﬂow rate in each FPC will be _m=m as shown in Fig. 5.25a. The rate of
useful thermal energy of one FPC module will be expressed as follows:

The combination of m-identical FPCs connected in parallel under forced mode
are referred to as an “FPC module.”
The outlet temperature in both cases will be same. The outlet temperature in
forced mode can be evaluated from Eq. (5.71a). The typical results for m = 12 FPC
(each 1.5 m2) connected in parallel is shown in Fig. 5.25b. It is clear that the
maximum temperature at the outlet depends on the magnitude of solar intensity. At 9
a.m., the outlet temperature is lowest due to low values of solar intensity. However,
there is sharp increase in outlet temperature at 12 noon and 3 p.m., and then it starts
decreasing due to heat losses. These results were recorded at IIT Delhi, New Delhi.

For series-connected FPCs, the outlet temperature of a particular FPC will act as
the inlet temperature for the next collector up to the Nth collector. Therefore, the
outlet temperature from the Nth collector can be obtained in terms of inlet ﬂuid
temperature of the ﬁrst collector.
Furthermore, according to Eq. (5.71a), the outlet ﬂuid temperature of the second
FPC collector Tfo2 can be written in terms of the outlet temperature of the ﬁrst FPC
as follows:

Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Water Collector
5.9.1
Introduction
As discussed previously in Chap. 4, a photovoltaic thermal (PVT) water collector is a
system that gives electrical as well as thermal energy with enhanced electrical power.
Using this concept, a new PVT water collector is analysed in this section. PVT
technology is the integration of a semitransparent PV module with a conventional
solar water collector in a single unit. This can also be refesrred as the “hybrid PVT”
concept. In this case, a semitransparent PV module converts a part (approximately
15–20 %) of incident solar radiation into electrical energy, whereas rest of the
incident solar radiation (>80 %) is absorbed by PV module, and the absorber plate
generates thermal energy. The thermal energy generated from the system is harnessed
using water as the thermal energy carrier. Heating of the PV module lowers its
electrical efﬁciency. Extraction of thermal energy from the system using water or air
lowers the temperature, which in turn increases the efﬁciency of the system.
Conventional FPC require external source of electrical energy for operation in
force mode. The electrical energy requirement is met from grid electricity, whereas
in the PVT ﬂat-plate water collector, the electrical energy needed for force-mode
operation is supplied from the PV module of the integrated system.
The temperature proﬁles of the photovoltaic (PV) module under transient con-
ditions was studied by Jones and Underwood [19]. They found that, corresponding
to an ambient air temperature of 24.5 °C, the module temperature varies from 27 to
52 °C depending on the incident input solar radiation. They concluded that the
electrical performance of the PV module is strongly affected by the (i) packing
factor of module, (ii) ohmic losses, and (iii) module temperature. The electrical
performance of a PVT FPC can be improved by increasing the packing factor and
reducing the module temperature.

Partially Covered Photovoltaic Thermal
(PVT) Water FPC [20, 21]
(a) The lower portion of the FPC is partially covered by a semitransparent PV
module: In this case, the lower portion of the conventional FPC is replaced by
the semitransparent PV module as shown in Fig. 5.29. The area covered by the
semitransparent PV module is dependant on the desired requirement of
electrical/thermal energy from the PVT system. The energy balance for dif-
ferent parts of the PVT-FPC is given as follows:

the PV module; bc is the packing factor of the module; I tð Þ is the solar intensity;
W dx is the elementary section; gc is the solar-cell electrical efﬁciency; Utc;a is the
overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient between the solar cell to ambient air through glass
cover; Utc;p is the overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the solar cell to the black-
ened absorber plate through the glass cover and air gap; Tc is the temperature of the
solar cell; Ta is the ambient temperature; Tp is the temperature of the blackened
absorber plate; and gm ¼ gcsgbc is the module efﬁciency.

The hourly variation of solar-cell temperature for the two cases is shown in
Fig. 5.31. The conﬁguration with a semitransparent PV module on the upper por-
tion of the FPC has a higher solar-cell temperature. This is due to the fact that in this
case, the water is preheated from the lower portion, and the temperature difference
between the water and the solar cell is less, thus resulting in less heat transfer from
the module to the water. A high solar-cell temperature reduces the solar-cell
electrical efﬁciency (Fig. 5.32).

number of collectors connected in series (the mass ﬂow rate of water has been kept
constant, i.e., _m ¼ 0:04 kg=s) is presented in Fig. 5.34. With an increasing number

decreases.

Effect of Heat Capacity in a Flat-Plate Collector

5.11
Optimum Inclination of the Flat-Plate Collector
As we have seen in Chap. 1, there is a variation of solar radiation with (i) incli-
nation of the surface for a given latitude, (ii) orientation, (iii) the time of day, and
(iv) day of the year. Hence, there should be an optimum inclination to receive
maximum solar radiation. On the basis of a literature survey, a rule of thumb Indian
conditions has been made. Accordingly, an optimum inclination of the surfaces of
an FPC receiving maximum radiation is given by
boptimum ¼ /  15
ð5:141Þ
where the +ve sign refers to winter conditions and −ve refers to summer conditions.
Because the design of the FPC is made from a water-heating point of view
during winter days, the optimum inclination of a collector for the region around
Delhi is 28350 þ 15 ¼ 43350  45. The surface should face the north direction in
the southern hemisphere due to the motion of the Sun. For year-round performance,
the optimum tilt is 0.9 times the latitude of the location.
5.12
Effect of Dust in the Flat-Plate Collector
Dust deposited on the transparent cover of an FPC deteriorates its performance.
This reduces the transmittance of the top cover, and it also increases scattering
losses. Dust deposition depends on various factors such as weather conditions of the
place, nature of soil of the place, type of cover, angle of incidence, etc. Due to the
dependency on various ﬂuctuating parameters, the effect of dust deposition cannot
be generalized. For the northern region of India, it has been reported that trans-
mittance of the glass cover is decreased by 8–10 % for an inclined surface at 45.

Chapter 6
Solar Concentrator
Abstract For the highest operating temperature range (≥300 °C) of solar
thermal-energy applications in the industrial sector, the beam radiation of solar
energy is concentrated at a low surface area of the receiver. This is referred to as the
“concentrating system” and can be used for power generation by using a
boiling-temperature ﬂuid as a medium. Solar-power generation is economical for
higher capacity of plants (≥1 MW) with grid power in a dust-free region for less
cleaning of the reﬂecting sheet.

Introduction
As we saw in Chap. 5, the ﬂat plate collector (FPC) can provide a medium tem-
perature range up to 150 °C with working ﬂuid under steady-state conditions.
However, for a temperature range >150 °C, we require a change in the design of the
FPC. From Eq. (5.11b), one can observe that the rate of useful energy, _Qu, in W is
given by
_Qu ¼ Ac
as


ð6:1aÞ
where UL ¼ Ut þ Ub.
In the above equation, the following should be noted:
(i) The ﬁrst term is responsible for the rate of gain of thermal energy, whereas the
second term is responsible for the rate of heat loss from the absorber to the
ambient air from the top as well as the bottom of the FPC; and
(ii) the areas of the absorber, glass cover, and bottom insulation are equal.

If the rate of heat loss from the absorber to the ambient air, AcUL Tp  Ta

temperature of the absorber for the given collector area, Ac. This is only possible
and practical if area involved in loss term, AcUL Tp  Ta


, is reduced and referred
as receiver area Ar. Now onward, Ac will be replaced by Aa as the aperture area.
In addition, UL will be replaced by Ut because there will be only upward heat

Solar Concentrator

A solar concentrator is a device that concentrates the solar radiation falling on a
larger surface (aperture area, Aa) onto a smaller surface (receiver area, Ar) as shown
in Eq. (6.1d). Appropriate reﬂecting or refracting components are used to increase
the ﬂux density on the absorber (receiver) surface compared with a FPC for higher
concentration. For maximum concentration, tracking of beam radiation (the Sun’s
virtual motion) and an accurate focusing device is essential. Hence, a solar con-
centrator comprises a tracking arrangement, a focussing device and a receiver
system. Temperatures up to 300 °C can be achieved by using solar concentrators.
Therefore, concentrators are favourable for thermal as well as photovoltaic appli-
cations even at higher operating temperatures.
Solar-concentrating devices are used since as early as in 1695; a diamond was
melted by solar energy in Florence. Lavoisier carried out a number of experiments
with his double-lens concentrator. The knowledge of the concentrator dates back
even to the time of Archimedes, whose book “On Burning Mirrors” is an evidence
of this fact. Concentrators were predominantly used in heat engines and steam
production in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Followings are the main advantages of a concentrator:
(i)
It increases the solar intensity (beam radiation) by concentrating the solar
energy available over a large surface, Aa, onto a smaller surface, Ar,
(absorber/receiver).
(ii)
Due to the concentration being on a smaller area, the heat-loss area is
reduced as mentioned previously. Furthermore, the thermal mass is much
smaller than that of a FPC and hence the transient effects are small.
(iii)
The delivery temperature is very high.
(iv)
It reduces the cost by replacing an expensive receiver (large glass-cover area)
with a less-expensive reﬂecting or refracting surface.
However, a solar concentrator is an optical system. In this case, the optical loss
terms become signiﬁcant. Furthermore, it operates only on the beam radiation. It
results in the loss of diffuse radiation. The basic concepts of FPCs are also appli-
cable to solar-concentrating systems. A number of complications arise due to the
following:
(a) nonuniform ﬂux on absorber/receiver;
(b) wide variations in shape, temperature, and heat-loss behaviour of absorbers;
and
(c) optical considerations in the energy balance conditions.
As the requirement of higher-precision optics for a higher concentration of
collector increases, the cost of the system also increases. In addition to the com-
plexity of the system, the maintenance cost is also increased.

Characteristic Parameters
Deﬁnitions of the several terminologies that characterize concentrating solar col-
lectors are given below.
Aperture area (Aa)
This is the area on the front of the solar concentrator that accepts the incident solar
beam radiation as shown in Fig. 6.1.
Acceptance angle (2θc)
This is the limiting angle over which the incident solar beam radiation path may
deviate from normal to the aperture plane and reaches the absorber/receiver after
reﬂection. For larger acceptance angles, solar concentrators are moved seasonally,
whereas for smaller acceptance angles, solar concentrators must be moved con-
tinuously to track the Sun as shown in Fig. 6.1.
Absorber/receiver area (Ar)
This is the total area that receives the concentrated solar beam radiation. This area
delivers the useful thermal energy to the system.
Geometric concentration ratio (C)
This is the ratio of the aperture area to the absorber/receiver area, Eq. (6.1e).
C ¼ Aa=Ar
ð6:2aÞ
The value of C varies from unity (FPC) to several thousand (parabolic dish).

Solar Concentrator

Local concentration ratio (brightness-concentration ratio)
The local concentration ratio is deﬁned where the whole system is not uniformly
illuminated; it is the ratio of the beam radiation at any point on the absorber/receiver
to the incident beam radiation at the entrance of the solar concentrator.
Intercept factor (γ)
This is the fraction of focussed solar beam radiation intercepted by the
absorber/receiver of a given size as shown in Fig. 6.1.

The value of the intercept factor depends on the size of the absorber; for a typical
concentrator/receiver design, it is >0.9. For normal incident (on aperture) radiation,
it is unity.
Example 6.1 A linear parabolic solar concentrator is designed to intercept all of the
specularly reﬂected beam radiation for normal incidence. It continuously rotates
horizontally on an east‒west axis and ﬁtted with liquid-heating receiver unit of
length 10.0 m. A strip of 0.21 m—wide reﬂector is shaded by the receiver. For the
aperture, a = 2.00 m and focal length, f = 1.00 m, calculate the rate of useful
energy in W for the following parameters.
(i) Normal beam radiation to the aperture = 950 W/m2, (ii) here as for the
receiver = 0.78, (iii) q ¼ 0:84, (iv) inlet-ﬂuid temperature = 180 °C, (v) ambient
air temperature = 20 °C, and (vi) FR ¼ 0:85.
Solution
For normal incidence, c ¼ 1, and a fraction of the reﬂector 0:21=2:00 ¼ 0:10 is
shaded by the receiver; therefore, 0.90 of the reﬂector is effective.

As shown in Fig. 6.2, let us consider the circular solar concentrator with aperture
area Aa and receiver/absorber area Ar. It also views the Sun of radius r at a distance
R. The half-angle subtended by the Sun is hs. For a perfect solar concentrator, the
beam radiation from the Sun on the aperture is the fraction of the solar radiation
emitted by the Sun that is intercepted by the aperture area Aa. The radiation W

Classiﬁcation of Solar Concentrators
Solar concentrators may be broadly classiﬁed as follows:
(i) Tracking type: These types of solar concentrators are classiﬁed on the basis
of tracking type (continuous, intermittent, one-axis, or two-axis) or on the
basis of the moving device (focussing part or receiver or both) for tracking.
(ii) Non-tracking type: In this case, the axis of concentrator is ﬁxed. There is no
moving part.
Solar concentrators can also be classiﬁed on the basis of optical components.
They may be (i) reﬂecting or refracting type, (ii) imaging or nonimaging type, and
(iii) line-focussing or point-focussing type. The reﬂecting or refracting surface can
be one piece or a composite surface. It may be either a single-stage‒ or two-stage‒
type system. It may be further classiﬁed as symmetric or asymmetric. In practice,
however, hybrid and multistage systems occur frequently that incorporate various
levels of the features.
6.4
Types of Solar Concentrator
There are a number of ways to measure ﬂux of beam radiation on receivers. Some
of them are discussed brieﬂy in the following section.
6.2
Characteristic Parameters

6.4.1
Tracking Solar Concentrators
6.4.1.1
One-Axis Tracking Solar Concentrators
Solar concentrators are used to achieve moderate concentration with one-axis
tracking. A few of them are discussed below:
(i) Fixed-mirror solar concentrator (FMSC)
The ﬁxed-mirror solar concentrator consists of a (i) ﬁxed mirror and (ii) a
tracking receiver system as shown in Fig. 6.3. The ﬁxed mirror consists of long,
narrow ﬂat strips arranged on a reference circular cylinder of a chosen radius R.
The width of the mirror strip is compatible with the diameter of a given
absorber/receiver pipe. The angle of each element is adjusted in such a way that the
focal distance of the array is twice the radius of the reference cylinder. The array
produces a narrow focal line, which lies along the same circular path with the
diurnal motion of the Sun. The focal line can be easily tracked by the movable
receiver pipe. The pipe is made to rotate about the centre of curvature of the
reﬂector module. Thus, the delicate part of the system comprises the rigidly ﬁxed
mirrors.
The image width is ideally the same as the projected width of the mirror element
at the absorber/receiver. Thus, the concentration ratio is approximately the same as
the number of mirror elements. For ﬁxed and concave aperture, the mirror strips
result in shading with very high or very low Sun altitude angles. Edge losses also
occur during reﬂection due to the strips. However, the mirrors can be suitably
designed for only 10 % loss of the total energy lost over a year’s time. Fixed-mirror
solar concentrator models have shown an overall thermal efﬁciency in the range of
40–50 %.

Solar Concentrator

(ii) Cylindrical parabolic solar concentrator (CPSC)
A cylindrical parabolic trough solar concentrator comprises a cylindrical para-
bolic reﬂector and a metal tube receiver at the focal plane as shown in Fig. 6.4. The
blackened receiver is covered by the concentrator and rotated about one axis to
track the Sun. The heat-transfer ﬂuid is heated as it ﬂows through the absorber tube.
Such solar concentrators have been used for many years. The aperture diameter,
rim angle, and absorber/receiver size and shape may be used to deﬁne the con-
centration. The absorber tube may be made of either mild (low carbon) steel or
copper. It is coated with a heat-resistant black paint. Selective coatings on the
absorber may be used for better performance. Depending on the temperature
requirement, different heat-transfer liquids/ﬂuids are is used. Reﬂectors may be
made of anodized aluminum sheets, aluminized Mylar, or curved silvered glass.
Because it is difﬁcult to curve a very large glass, mirror strips are used in some
cases. The reﬂecting part is ﬁxed on a lightweight structure. The solar-concentration
ratio C
ð Þ for a cylindrical absorber varies from 5 to 30.
The major thermal energy losses from a concentrator/receiver assembly for
normal incidence are the losses that occur during reﬂection from the reﬂecting
surface. There is convection loss from the absorber/receiver to the surroundings.
Efforts are made to use high-reﬂecting materials to reduce losses. Twisted tapes are
used in the absorber tube for large heat transfer from the absorber to the working
ﬂuid.
A cylindrical parabolic trough may be oriented in any of the three directions,
namely, (i) east‒west, (ii) north‒south, or (iii) polar. The ﬁrst two orientations have
higher incidence-angle cosine losses. The polar conﬁguration intercepts more beam
radiation per unit area compared with other modes. Thus, it gives the better
performance.
(iii)
Linear Fresnel lens/reﬂector
A linear Fresnel lens solar concentrator, as shown in Fig. 6.5, consists of linear
grooves on one surface of the refracting material. The groove angles are chosen
with reference to a particular wavelength of incident beam radiation so that the lens
acts as a converging one for the light, which is incident normally.
Both glass and plastic can be used as refracting materials for fabricating Fresnel
lenses. Glass is seldom used because it is difﬁcult to mould, and it also has large
surface tension; on the other hand, plastic lenses are economical. Plastic moulding
lasts for an appreciable time. Plastic Fresnel lenses with 20 grooves/mm are
moulded.

parabolic concentrator (CPC)
6.4
Types of Solar Concentrator
255

The Fresnel lens may be installed with either of the following:
(a) Sun-facing grooves: In this case, the ineffective facts of the grooves prevent a
part of the input beam light from being transmitted to the focus. According to
Snell’s law, the refracted light is deviated away from the normal on moving
from a denser to a rarer medium. Furthermore, the dust deposited in these
grooves results in a poor performance.
(b) Downward-facing grooves: In this case, the solar concentrator has a high
surface reﬂection loss and large off-axis aberrations. The reﬂection losses
cause low thermal efﬁciency. Large off-axis aberrations give a low concen-
tration ratio. In addition, the beam radiation is not incident normally, which
affects the performance. The focal length of the lens varies rapidly with a
change of the angle of incidence. The optical system needs to track the path of
the Sun for a better performance.
Fresnel reﬂectors can also be used as concentrating devices as shown in Fig. 6.6.
They are made up of either smaller ﬂat or curved components. They consist of a
number of mirror elements mounted suitably. All incident parallel rays of beam
radiation are focussed at a common point after reﬂection. Ideally, mirror elements
must be parabolic in shape. Flat mirrors are generally used to ameliorate manu-
facturing and assembling problems.

6.4.1.2
Two-Axes Tracking Concentrators
To achieve a high solar concentration for higher-temperature solar processes,
concentrators with double curvatures are used. These require two-axes tracking of
the Sun. Some of these are brieﬂy discussed as follows:
(i) Paraboloidal dish solar concentrator (PDSC)
In a paraboloidal dish solar concentrator (PDSC), a parabola rotates about the
optical axis as shown in Fig. 6.7. In this case, a higher concentration ratio C
ð Þ is
achieved.
Considering the Sun as a point source of light, beam radiation is focussed at a
point in a paraboloidal due to the compound curvature. However, an image is
produced due to the ﬁnite angular substance of the Sun. Furthermore, the surface
may not be strictly parabolic. This causes an enlarged image due to misdirection of
the beam light rays because of misaligned surface elements. A degraded image is
obtained for an off-axis object. The rays from the central region of the paraboloidal
travel a shorter distance in arriving at the focus, and the rays from the edges travel a
larger distance. Results spread of the image. Thus, a three-dimensional image of the
Sun in the shape of an ellipsoid is formed as shown in Fig. 6.8.
The thermal losses from a paraboloidal are primarily radiative. They can be
reduced by decreasing the absorber aperture area. However, this results in a smaller
intercept factor. The optimum intercept factor is approximately 0.95–0.98. There
should be large absorber size to achieve the optimum beam intercept.
High-collection thermal efﬁciency and high-quality thermal energy are the fea-
tures of a paraboloidal or parabolic dish type of solar concentrator. These devices
can be used as sources for a variety of purposes due to large delivery temperatures.

(ii) Central tower receiver (CTR)
The central tower receiver (CTR) consists of (a) a central stationary receiver and
(b) heliostats as shown in Fig. 6.9. A heliostat is composed of a large array of
mirrors ﬁxed to a supporting frame, which reﬂect the beam radiation toward
receiver. This frame can be used to track the Sun as per requirement.

ð Þ can be achieved ≤3000. The absorbed energy can be
extracted from the receiver. This is delivered at a higher temperature and a pressure
suitable for running the turbines for power generation.
The advantage of this system is to eliminate the need for carrying the working
ﬂuid over large distances. As a result, heat losses are reduced signiﬁcantly to
eliminate the need for insulation. However, many other problems are involved in
the system. A majority of them are due to the heliostats and receiver. A large

number of heliostats are required to focus beam radiation, which requires a large
free space. The heliostats may be provided with proper tracking arrangement. It
may be arranged such that self-shading is avoided to achieve reasonable concen-
tration. In addition to the cost, cleaning of the mirrors poses another problem.
Furthermore, the heliostat arrangement must be strong enough to sustain extreme
weather conditions. The receiver/absorber must be able to effectively intercept the
focused beam radiation to absorb heat and transfer this energy to the working ﬂuid
with minimum heat loss. Several designs have been proposed for the receiver.
Heat-transfer ﬂuids, such as steam and liquid metals, have been suggested. Some
problems arise due to reﬂection and transmission losses as well as thermal stress in
the receiver.
(iii)
Circular Fresnel lens (CFL)
Lenses are not usually used in solar energy applications due to their high cost
and weight. However, these are used for high-temperature requirements (solar
furnace). Figure 6.10 shows the principle of Fresnel lens. Optically, the Fresnel lens
is equivalent to a thin-lens approximation. It is divided into a number of zones. The
zones are spaced at a few tenths of a millimetre. The space can also be few
centimetres. Within each aperture zone, the tilt of the lens surface is adjusted such
that its optical behaviour resembles that of the conventional spherical lens of the
same focal length. The focus of the annulus does not need to be curved. However, it
is required to have the correct tilt so as to refract the light to the focus. This is due to
the large absorbing surface in comparison with the width of a Fresnel zone on the
lens. Meinel [1] proposed the equation for the tilt of the facet as a function of the
aperture zone and focal length.
The circular Fresnel lens provides a very good concentration ratio. For a precise
plastic lens, the brightness concentration is as high as 2000. Hence, such concen-
trators are usually used with silicon and gallium arsenide solar cells for high ﬂux. In
solar-cell applications, the lens must track the Sun. It is required to keep the small
solar image centred on the receiver. In this case, it may be noted that the brightness
concentration is smaller in comparison with that of parabolic mirrors.
The transmitting system has an advantage over the reﬂecting system due to
absorbing certain wavelength of incident beam. This may result in heating of the
focus.

Solar Concentrator

(iv) Hemispherical bowl mirror
Figure 6.11 shows a cross-sectional view of hemispherical mirror concentrator
developed by Steward [2]. It has a ﬁxed mirror and a moveable receiver-type
concentrator. The major components of this concentrator are (a) a ﬁxed hemi-
spherical mirror, (b) a tracking linear absorber, and (c) a supporting structure.
The hemisphere produces a highly aberrant optical image. However, all rays
entering into the hemisphere after reﬂection cross the paraxial line at some point
between the focus and the mirror surface because of the symmetry of light.
Therefore, an absorber pivots about the centre of the curvature of the hemisphere to
intercept all reﬂected rays. The absorber/receiver is to be moved with axis, which is
always aligned with solar rays passing through the centre of the sphere. This
requires two-axes tracking. Although this motion can be set in a number of ways.
One of the simplest ways is to use an equatorial mount, in which the
absorber/receiver is driven around a polar axis at a constant angular speed of 15°/h
during the day. It may be noted that this type of concentrator gives a lesser con-
centration than that in paraboloids due to the spherical aberration.
6.4.2
Non-tracking Solar Concentrators
Tracking solar concentrators provide high delivery temperatures due to an accurate
tracking device and ﬁne surface; and hence they are expensive. However,

hemispherical-mirror

6.4
Types of Solar Concentrator
261

inexpensive concentrators are designed without tracking for medium-temperature
operation. Some of these concentrators are discussed in brief as follows:
(i) Flat receiver with booster mirror
Figure 6.12 shows a conventional FPC receiver with plane reﬂectors at the edges
to reﬂect additional radiation into the absorber/receiver. Flat mirrors are also called
“booster mirrors.” The concentration ratio of such a concentrator is relatively low,
but it is higher than that of the conventional FPC. It has a maximum value <4.
Booster mirrors become less effective due to the increase of the solar incidence
angle. Booster mirrors can be used on all the four sides for a single collector. The
mirror actually starts casting a shadow on the absorber for a Sun angle greater than
the semi-angle of the booster mirrors. In case of an array of ﬂat-plat collectors,
plane booster mirrors can be used on only two sides.
The thermal efﬁciency of a boosted ﬂat-plate system can be increased several
times during the year with a change in the angle of the ﬂat mirrors. The advantage
of such a system is to use the diffuse radiation in addition to the beam radiation. In
this case, the attainable temperature and collection thermal efﬁciency will be greater
in comparison with those of a FPC with the same collection area.
(ii) Tabor‒Zeimer circular cylinder
Figure 6.13 shows a view of a Tabor‒Zeimer circular cylinder. It is a very
simple cylindrical optical system. It consists of an inﬂated plastic cylinder with a
triangular pipe receiver. The cylinder has a clear portion on the top to allow beam
radiation to enter toward the rear portion, which is aluminized to act as a mirror.
The incident beam radiation is reﬂected by the mirror and is focussed on the
absorber/receiver near the bottom of the cylinder.
Without tracking, a concentration of approximately 3 can be achieved. It can be
placed along an east‒west axis. It requires only seasonal tracking. The concentrator

uses diffuse in addition to the beam component. The delivery temperatures and
collection thermal efﬁciencies are higher in comparison with those of the conven-
tional FPC.
(iii)
Compound parabolic solar concentrator (CPSC)
This CPSC is a nonimaging one. It belongs to a family of concentrators with
maximum permissible concentration under thermodynamic limit for a particular
acceptance angle. Furthermore, it has a large acceptance angle. It needs to be
intermittently turned toward the Sun.
The ﬁrst design of a CPSC was ﬁrst made by Winston [3]. It consists of two
parabolic segments. It is oriented such that the focus of one is located at the bottom
end point of the other and vice versa as shown in Fig. 6.14. The axes of the
parabolic segments make an angle with the CPSC axis equal to the acceptance
angle. The slope of the reﬂector surfaces at the aperture plane is parallel to the
Fig. 6.13 Schematic view of
a Tabor‒Zeimer cylindrical
concentrator

263

CPSC axis. The receiver is a ﬂat surface parallel to the aperture joining the two foci
of the reﬂecting surfaces.
Beam radiation (rays) incident in the central region of the aperture undergoes no
reﬂection, whereas that near the edges undergoes one or more reﬂections. The
numbers of reﬂections depend on (a) the incident angle, (b) the collector depth, and
(c) the Concentration ratio [4].
To reduce the cost of the unit, the height of the CPC can be truncated by half
from the bottom without any signiﬁcant change in concentration ratio.
Extensive investigations have led to several modiﬁed designs of the ideal CPSC.
The main modiﬁcations are mentioned as follows:
(i)
the use of receiver shapes like ﬁns and circular pipes for better optical and
thermal performance;
(ii)
truncation of CPSC height to minimize the physical size and cost;
(iii)
asymmetric orientation of source and aperture to provide seasonal varying
outputs; and
(iv)
design of the CPSC as a second-stage concentrator.
In view of the above modiﬁcation, the reﬂecting surface of all resulting solar
concentrators may not be parabolic. However, these still belong to the nonimaging
group of concentrators.
The CPSC can be used in nontracking mode with a concentration ratios of
approximately 6. However, for higher concentration ratios, the reﬂecting surface
area becomes very large, and hence it cannot be used.

Theoretical Solar Image
In

concentrators,
an
image
of
the
Sun
is
formed
on
the
receiver/absorber. Because the Sun is not a point source, therefore even a perfect
optical system produces an image of ﬁnite size. The Sun‒Earth distance causes the
solar disc to subtend an angle of 320 at a point on the Earth’s surface (Fig. 6.17).
Rf is a reﬂector, and Rv is a plane receiver kept normal to the axis of the
concentrator. Rays are shown to be incident at the edge from solar disc. After
reﬂection, it forms the image on the receiver. If the distance between the point of
incidence and the focus (mirror radius) is r, then the image size W is expressed as
W ¼ 2r tan 160

cos u
ð6:9Þ
where u is the angle between the optical axis of the concentrator and the normal at
the point of incidence (Fig. 6.15a).

It may be noted that this theoretical image is subjected to modiﬁcations due to
(a) the solar disc is not uniformly bright with the centre being the brightest; and
(b) the actual concentrating systems are not precise optical systems.
6.6
Thermal Performance
Writing an energy balance to determine the performance of concentrator as shown
in Figs. 6.1 and 6.14 is similar to writing one for FPC. Complications occur in the
calculation of thermal losses from receiver/absorber due to the following reasons:
(i) Receiver shapes are widely variable and the beam radiation at the receiver is
not uniform.
(ii) Due to the temperature being high, edge losses and conduction effects are
signiﬁcant.
The analytical expression for collection thermal efﬁciency will be discussed for
following conditions: natural mode and forced mode.
6.6.1
Natural Mode
In this case, we follow the same procedure as done in the case of the FPC Sect. 5.7.

expressed as

ð

ð6:10aÞ
where Ib is the incident beam radiation (Eq. 1.25); and _qu is the rate of useful

Forced Mode
In the case of forced mode of operation of a CPC concentrator, the working ﬂuid
will ﬂow through the circular tube and ﬂat plate as shown in Fig. 6.16. The working
ﬂuid at inlet temperature Tfi is allowed to ﬂow in the x-direction.
Let us consider an elemental length between ‘x’ and ‘x + dx’. The ﬂuid tem-
peratures at ‘x’ and ‘x + dx’ are TfðxÞ and TfðxÞ þ dTfðxÞ, respectively. Here the
rate of heat available per unit length at ﬂuid, Eq. (6.19), will be carried away by the
working ﬂowing ﬂuid. Hence,

6.7
Solar Concentration Ratio (C)
To improve the performance of a solar concentrator, the rate of thermal losses from
the receiver, namely, (a) Ut Tfi  Ta
ð
Þ for a tubular absorber and (b) UL Tfi  Ta
ð
Þ for
a ﬂat-plate absorber/receiver, must be minimized. This implies that the area of
absorber/receiver Ar
ð
Þ should be small. However, smaller the size of the absorber
implies a lower intercept factor. Thus, it leads to poor optical performance. Hence, a
compromise must be made between optical and thermal performance of the solar
concentrator to obtain a suitable concentration ratio. From the point of view of
thermodynamic considerations, the upper limit of the concentration of any con-
centrating collector has been obtained by Rabl [4] and Rabl and Winston [5]. It is
observed that the maximum possible concentration is the reciprocal of the radiation
shape factor between the Sun and the solar concentrator. This limit is valid for a
given acceptance angle 2hc
ð
Þ as shown in Fig. 6.1. Practical values of acceptance
angle vary from a minimum value subtended by the disc of Sun approximately
0.5°–180°. This corresponds to a FPC receiving solar radiation from a full
hemisphere.

Line focus or trough-like concentrators have the radiation shape factor FAS
ð
Þ
for two-dimensional geometries, which is given by
FAS ¼ sin hc
ð6:30aÞ
Hence, the thermodynamic concentration limit is given by
C ¼ 1= sin hc
ð6:30bÞ
A point-focus of dish-like concentrators has the shape factor and concentration
limits for three-dimensional geometries, which are given by
FAS ¼ sin2 hc
ð6:31Þ
and
C ¼ 1= sin2 hc
ð6:32Þ
Example 6.3 Determine the solar-concentration ratio (C) for a two-dimensional
geometry if the acceptance angle is 30° and compare the result with that of a
three-dimensional geometry.
Solution
From Eq. (6.30b), for two-dimensional geometry we have C ¼ 1= sin hc.
For hc ¼ 15, C ¼ 1= sin 15 ¼ 3:86.
From Eq. (6.32), for three-dimensional geometry we have C ¼ 1= sin2 hc.
For hc, we get, C ¼ 1= sin2 15 ¼ 14:93.
This shows that, for the same acceptance angle the concentration ratio is more in
three dimension geometry.
The maximum limit is determined from the minimum acceptance angle by
considering the optical concepts. The solar concentrator is always facing the Sun;
hence, the acceptance half-angle hc
ð
Þ is equal to the half-angle of the solar disc
(about 0:25). Equations (6.30b) and (6.32) show that the concentration limit for a
two-dimensional concentrator and three-dimensional concentrator is of the order of
200 and 40,000, respectively.
However, in practice, solar concentrations are different due to the ﬁnite accep-
tance angles. Furthermore, the cosine effect reduces the energy gain at hours far
from solar noon in nontracking collectors.
The concentrations of some concentrators for different types of absorbers are
discussed below.

We can see that if the optical limit is considered, i.e., hc ¼ 0:25, then (a) for a

(one-sided), it is 113. Thus, the highest possible solar concentrations and the

Solution
From Eq. (6.42), we have C ¼ sin2 /

6.8
Solar Tracking
6.8.1
Three-Dimensional Solar Concentrators
For point-focus solar-concentrating systems, three-dimensional concentrators are
required to continuously track the motion of the Sun for maximum brightness
concentration and radiation balance. This is because their acceptance angles are
small for the small absorber. Hence, solar collectors must be tracked along two axes
to keep the Sun on the absorbers/receivers.
Geometries of fully tracking mountings are polar, azimuth, altitude‒altitude, and
horizontal yoke mountings etc. [6]. The simplest one is the polar mounting. In this
case, one axis is placed parallel to the Earth’s axis, and the second axis orthogonal.
For the solar collector, if one axis is inclined with the horizontal at a latitude angle,
then the axis is parallel to the Earth’s axis, and the other axis is normal to it. This
mounting is referred to as “polar mounting.” The diurnal solar motion is required to
track about the polar axis only.
Generally, two-axes tracking is required for all other conﬁgurations. A number
of complications arise due to the nonlinear motion of the Sun. There are other
mountings for mechanical motion. One such mounting for mechanical motion is the
altitude‒azimuth mounting. In this case, one axis is horizontal, and the other one is
vertical. Being in the vertical plane of the concentrator, gravitational attractions are
also minimized.
The mounting for heliostats results in the generalized case of nonlinear motion in
two coordinates. The kinematics of the generalized heliostat is given by Meinel [1].
6.7
Solar Concentration Ratio (C)
279

6.8.2
Two-Dimensional Solar Concentrators
Two-dimensional/line-focussing solar concentrators are moved only in one coor-
dinate to track the motion of Sun. There are a number of feasible mounting con-
ﬁgurations. The most commonly used mountings are with the long axis facing
either north‒south or east‒west. For troughs oriented toward the north‒south, the
solar concentrators are moved to track the diurnal motion of the Sun. In this case,
the long axis can be either horizontal or with an inclination equal to the latitude.
The latter mounting is the polar mounting as discussed previously. If in addition to
east‒west tracking, north‒south tracking is introduced; then the Sun always stays
normal to the aperture for maximum availability of solar radiation on the aperture.
With east-west tracking, it must be noted that solar concentrators must be sep-
arated from each other in the north‒south orientation so as to eliminate self shading.
This problem is acute for the shallow Sun’s angle during the morning and after-
noon. In this case, more land area is required compared with the east‒west
orientation.
The east‒west orientation is the most common for line-focussing solar con-
centrators. The motion of Sun then coincides with the long axis. Hence, the per-
formance is similar to that of the FPC. It follows the pattern of solar intensity, i.e.,
maximum at noon and falling off on either side. As a result, these concentrators
collect some diffuse energy from the Sun.
6.9
Materials for Solar Concentrators
The availability of suitable materials determines the effective use of solar energy.
We brieﬂy discuss the major material problems associated with the different
components of solar concentrators.
6.9.1
Reﬂecting and Refracting Surfaces
Solar reﬂectors should have (a) high reﬂectivity and (b) good specular reﬂectance.
No surface is perfectly specular due to either micro-roughness or surface undula-
tion. For a low solar-concentration ratio, the reﬂector does not need to be highly
specular. Glass silvered either on the rear or a second surface is usually used as
mirror materials. Front-surface mirrors can also be used. Aluminium can also be
used for the same purpose. It is protected by a coating of aluminium oxide, mag-
nesium ﬂuoride, or cerium oxide. Other materials, such as metalized plastic ﬁlms
and thin metal sheets, are also useful. Aluminium and silver with a total reﬂectivity
280
6
Solar Concentrator

of approximately 85–90 and 95 %, respectively, are very good reﬂecting surfaces
for solar energy applications. Silver is not adequate for front-surface mirrors.
Glass is the most durable material with low iron content. It can be used as a
transmitting material. Currently plastics are used as refracting substances.
Polymethyl methacrylate is generally used because it is weather resistant. Acrylic
has been found to be an excellent material for Fresnel lenses because acrylic can be
easily moulded or extruded.
For easy installation of reﬂectors and refractors, they should be light in weight.
They should be able to withstand wind and extreme weather. Dust, sand, and other
contamination strongly affect performance although the effect varies with the type
of material used, collector conﬁguration, exposure time, and site. The surfaces must
be cleaned regularly.
6.9.2
Receiver Covers and Surface Coatings
A simple ﬂat receiver is used in either parabolic concentrators or simple
nonimaging-type (V-trough) concentrators, particularly at low-temperature appli-
cations. Glass and transparent plastic ﬁlms are generally used as glazed materials
for the receiver. Glass should have a low iron content to reduce absorption. Its
surface should be etched to reduce reﬂection losses. A double-etching process can
give better results with increased cost. Plastics are not suitable as cover materials
due to low service temperature limit and ultraviolet degradation. Evacuated tube
receivers have also been used to eliminate convection heat losses.
Coatings are required to have strong absorptivity and stability at high temper-
atures and are also cost effective. Black chrome appears to be the best among the
selective coatings. It can be electroplated on steel, copper, and aluminium, etc.
Other metal-oxide coatings, namely, black copper oxide and black nickel, are also
used. Selective paints, such as lead sulphide particles in a silicon binder, can also be
used.

For effective heat transfer, the ﬂuid should be (i) stable at high temperatures and
(ii) noncorrosive and safe. It also should be cost-effective. Air is attractive for
heating and cooling applications. However, the heat transfer is very poor. The most
commonly used working ﬂuids are pressurized water, liquid metals, therminol 55,
and Mobile therm 603.

6.9.4
Insulation
Insulation is required to reduce heat losses from the unirradiated portions of the
receiver. It is also used in the pipes carrying the working ﬂuid. In addition to
cost-effectiveness,
the
insulation
should
be
strong
enough
to
withstand
high-temperature ﬂuctuations. Commonly used insulations are ﬁbre glass with and
without binder, urethane foams, and mineral ﬁbre blankets.

Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Concentrator
In a solar concentrator, the forced mode of operation is practical, which is going to
be used for power generation. For such application, the ﬂuid is chosen as per
requirement. The receiver/absorber in a concentrator can be classiﬁed as follows:
(a) Glazed tube‒type: In this case, the annular spacing between the selective
coated copper tube and co-axial glazed tube can be evacuated for reducing
convective heat loss between the annular spacing ðh1c ¼ 0Þ. There will be only
radiative loss between annular spacing. It is not feasible to integrate a semi-
transparent photovoltaic module with a glazed receiver/absorber.
(b) Parallel ﬂat-plate receiver/absorber: In such conﬁguration, it is possible to
integrate
a
semitransparent
photovoltaic
(PV)
module
with
a
glazed
receiver/absorber. However, ﬂuid other than water ﬂowing between two par-
allel receivers/absorbers is not practical due to high operating temperature
(≈300 °C) and the leakage problem associated with this.
(c) Tube-in-plate‒type receiver/absorber: In this case, the heat capacity of the
ﬂuid is reduced in comparison with parallel ﬂat-plate absorber, and hence the
operating temperature becomes greater. Furthermore, leakage of ﬂuid due to
high pressure is minimized. In addition, it is easier to integrate a semitrans-
parent PV module with the glazed surface of receiver/absorber as has been
done in the case of PVT FPC.
In this section, the tube-in-plate‒type receiver/absorber conﬁguration concen-
trator will be considered for thermal analysis.
6.10.1
Single Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) Concentrator [7]
As shown in Fig. 6.17a, the tube-in-plate‒type receiver/absorber base concentrator
is considered. The energy balance equation for such a system will be same as in the
case of a PVT water FPC with some modiﬁcation, which will be discussed below.

Chapter 7
Evacuated Tubular Solar Collector
(ETSC)
Abstract An evacuated tubular solar collector (ETSC) is another device to collect
solar energy for thermal applications in the temperature range between 100 and
300 °C. In this case, an ETSC can be used for indirect space heating and crop
drying through a heat exchanger. An ETSC can also be used for preheating of
working ﬂuid for power generation at lower capacity.

Introduction
In a ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) (see Chap. 5) and solar concentrator (see Chap. 6),
there are two thermal losses from the absorber/receiver to the glazing cover as
follows:
(i) The rate of convective heat transfer: The rate of convective heat transfer
depends on the temperature-dependent physical properties of the enclosed air
between the absorber/receiver and the glazing cover. If enclosed air between
the absorber/receiver and the glazing cover is evacuated to create a vacuum,
then the rate of convective heat transfer is suppressed to a minimal value, and
hence the upward rate of heat loss is minimized to have a maximum
absorber/receiver temperature. In a glazed ﬂat absorber/receiver surface, in
both an FPC or a solar concentrator, it is difﬁcult to have vacuum; it is also
impractical for a larger-surface absorber/receiver. Because of such limitations,
a
vacuum
is
created
between
the
coaxial
glazed
conductive
tube
absorber/receiver. The coaxial glazed conductive tube absorber/receiver is
known as an “evacuated tubular absorber/receiver.”
(ii) The rate of radiative heat transfer: The rate of radiative heat transfer depends
on the emissivity ðÞ of the blackened surface of the absorber/receiver. This
can be achieved easily for smaller-surface absorber/receiver. It is also durable
for a longer period compared with an FPC.

The above condition is achieved in an evacuated tubular collector (ETC). The
evacuated tubular solar collector (ETSC) is always in solar concentrators (see
Chap. 6). There is only a difference of the following:
(a) Only beam radiation is used in a solar concentrator due to the application of
optical property; and
(b) total radiation is used in an ETSC.
The classiﬁcation of an evacuated tubular collector is given as follows:

Evacuated Tubular Solar Collectors (ETSC)
In an evacuated glazed tubular collector, a vacuum is created between the absorber
and the transparent glass cover. There are many types of evacuated glazed tubular
collectors, which will be discussed in the following sections.

7.2.1
Solaron Collector
Figure 7.1a shows a cross-sectional view of Solaron tubular collector with an
evacuated transparent tube. In this case, the evacuated transparent tubes are
arranged above the selective coating absorber. There should not be any space left
between the consecutive tubes. The evacuated tubes provide a vacuum layer above
the selective coating absorber. The vacuum layer suppresses convective heat loss
from the absorber to the transparent glass cover. Incident solar radiation is absorbed
by the selectively coated absorber after transmission from the transparent evacuated
tubes. After absorption of solar radiation by the tube, most of the available thermal
energy at the absorber will be ﬁrst conducted and then convected to the working
ﬂuid below the absorber/receiver. The temperature of the working ﬂuid will be
increased. Afterward, there will be two types of heat losses from the working ﬂuid
to the ambient air as follows:

hence, there will be small heat losses. This top-heat loss will be minimum
compared with that of an FPC.
(b) Second loss: The rate of heat loss from the working ﬂuid to the ambient air
through the bottom insulation is referred to as “bottom-heat loss.”
The working ﬂuid may be either air or any liquid (e.g., water). The temperature
of the working ﬂuid in this case will be greater compared with the ﬂuid temperature
of a conventional FPC due to decreased upward heat loss.
7.2.2
Phillips (Germany) Collector
The thermal performance of the Solaron collector with an evacuated tube with a
single glass cover can be further increased. This can be achieved by increasing the
convective heat transfer from the absorber tube to the working ﬂuid through
the surface area of the absorber/receiver ðArÞ as shown in Fig. 7.1b. In this case,
the working ﬂuid passes through the conductive tubes attached at the bottom of the
semicircular absorber/receiver. The heat capacity of the working ﬂuid is also
decreased. This results in a greater increase of the temperature of the working ﬂuid.
The curved selective surface absorber acts as a heat exchanger. The top surface of
the evacuated tubes ðTc2Þ is directly exposed to solar radiation unlike to Solaron
collector. Furthermore, the inner surface of the evacuated tubes ðTc1Þ is exposed to
the absorber/receiver ðArÞ through a vacuum.
Solar radiation, IðtÞ, is transmitted after reﬂection ðqÞ from the outer curved
portion of the glass tube inside the vacuum space. It is ﬁnally absorbed by the
curved selective surface
a
ð Þ after reﬂection. The reﬂected radiation is further
transmitted to the atmosphere through the curved outer portion of the tube.
Absorbed thermal energy is transferred to the working ﬂuid through conduction and
convection. The working ﬂuid is then heated. After heating the working ﬂuid, there
is heat loss from the working ﬂuid to the ambient air through the top as well as
bottom insulation of area Ab.
7.2.3
Instantaneous Thermal Efﬁciency
The instantaneous thermal efﬁciency of an ETSC can be determined by assuming
that the outside surface area of tube is equal to the overall dimensions of the
collector, which is referred as the “aperture area” Aa

The working principles of various ETC are discussed in the following sections.
7.3.1
Sanyo Evacuated Tubular Solar Collector
Various views of the Sanyo ETSC are shown in Fig. 7.2. A cylindrical metal tube is
ﬁxed with a selectively coated conducting metal absorber as shown in Fig. 7.2a.
The conﬁguration is then inserted in a glass tube of 0.08-m diameter. The diameter
of the tube and the thickness of the absorber depend on the material and its physical
properties such as thermal conductivity and speciﬁc heat. Generally, copper
material is used due to its high thermal conductivity. The effective length of the tube
is approximately 2.8 m. The tube is evacuated to suppress the convective heat loss
between the absorber and the tube cover. Hence, it comes under the ETSC.
Bottom-heat loss is also decreased by proper insulating of the base of the ETSC.
The absorber can also be rotated at the optimum angle to receive maximum solar
radiation for a given latitude unlike other types of ETC. Ten tubes are connected in
parallel to form one module with an effective area of 1 m  2:8 m as shown in
Fig. 7.2c.

Corning Evacuated Tubular Solar Collector
A cross-sectional view the top elevation of a Corning ETSC, as well as the module

U-shaped copper tube is ﬁtted with a selectively coated horizontal copper ﬂat plate
in a tube below the absorber conﬁguration as shown in Fig. 7.3a. The assembly is
inserted into a Pyrex (glass) tube with a diameter of 0.10 m and a length of 2.28 m.
Furthermore, the U-shaped tubing is also supported by a plate strip. After creating a
vacuum inside the tube, the other end of the tube is sealed. The tubes are connected
in series to form one module as depicted in Fig. 7.3b. Six tubes connected in series
for one module, which is known as a “Corning ETSC”.

The Phillips evacuated tube solar collector is an improved version of the evacuated

is ﬁtted into a glass tube. Each arm of the tube touches the inner glass wall as shown

in Fig. 7.4b. The inner side of the tube is ﬁlled with polyurethane foam to avoid
heat exchanges between the tubes unlike a Corning evacuated tubular solar col-
lector. The outer side of the tube is selectively coated. This arrangement is further
inserted into another glass tube having a larger diameter. An annular space between
the inner and the outer tube is evacuated to decrease the upward convective heat
losses. In this case also, the tubes are connected in series to form a module of a
given area.

0.10 m. The glass tube is evacuated to minimize the convection top losses within the
tube. The open part of the tube is properly sealed to maintain a vacuum. The working
ﬂuid is allowed to pass through the inner tube of the concentric copper tubes. The
working ﬂuid is heated during its ﬂow through an annular space of a concentric copper
tube as depicted in Fig. 7.5b. The outer portion of the concentric copper tube is
perfectly insulated to ensure minimum heat losses at the outlet.

heat transfer from the surface of the inner tube to the working ﬂuid. An annular
space of the coaxial tube is evacuated to minimize convective heat loss from the
surface of the inner tube to the outer tube. The outer surface of the inner tube is
selectively coated for minimum radiation losses. The whole assembly is kept at a
focal point of the cusp reﬂector as shown in Fig. 7.6a.
Solar radiation is reﬂected back to the outer glass of the coaxial tube from the
cusp reﬂector. It is further transmitted after reﬂection. Finally it is absorbed by the
inner tube. The absorbed thermal energy is transferred to the working ﬂuid ﬂowing
through the U-shaped tube.

a selectively coated another tube of larger diameter. One end of the selectively
coated tube is sealed. The working ﬂuid is heated while it passes in a reverse ﬂow
through an annular space between the glass delivery tube and the selectively coated
tube. The glass delivery tube and the selectively coated tube are further inserted into
another borosilicate outer glass tube as shown in Fig. 7.7. To decrease convective
losses from the inner tube, the annular space between the inner tube and the outer
tube is evacuated. The collector tubes are often mounted above a white surface,
which reﬂects sunlight onto the underside of the tubes.

Evacuated Tubular Solar Collector with Heat Pipe [2]
In this section, the design and working principle of a heat pipe and an ETSC will be
discussed.
7.5.1
Heat Pipe
Figure 7.9 shows the schematic diagram of heat pipe. Heat pipes are used to
transfer heat by a simple method. It consists of a perfectly insulated (to minimize
losses from the ﬂuid to the outside) circular pipe with an annular wick layer. Solar
radiation incident on the evaporator end boils the ﬂuid inside the pipe. The vapor
7.4

migrates to the condensing end, and transfers the heat of vaporization to the ﬂuid
loop at the condensing end. The heat created by the ﬂuid loop is used at the end-use
point. After thermal energy is released to the ﬂuid, vapor is condensed and is
returned to the boiler end by capillary action through the wicks (in case of hori-
zontal pipes) or by gravitational force.

tube with a diameter of 0.10 m and a length of 1.4 m. The position of the cusp
reﬂector is in half of the tube. The heat pipe is placed at the focal point of the
reﬂector. The outer surface of the evaporator of the heat pipe is a black chrome
selective surface to minimize emittance. It also absorbs maximum solar radiation.
The evaporator of the heat pipe is covered with a glass tube along with the cusp
reﬂector. The condenser is exposed to the end-point use. The end-point use may be
immersed in working ﬂuid either (i) directly or through (ii) the heat exchanger. This
transfers the heat from the condenser to the working ﬂuid.
7.5.3
Gumman Evacuated Tubular Solar Collector (ETSC)
A metal ﬁn is used in the Gumman ETSC to maximize heat transfer from absorbed
solar energy at the absorber. A cross-sectional view of the Gumman ETSC is shown
in Fig. 7.10b. The position of the heat pipe evaporator and the condenser are also
shown in same ﬁgure. The evaporator is exposed to solar radiation, and the con-
denser is attached with a tube in the plate-conﬁguration plate. The working ﬂuid
ﬂows through the tube ﬂat plate of the condenser.
7.5.4
Thermal Analysis
A schematic view of an evacuated tubular solar collector with a selectively coated
ﬁn-absorber plate is shown in Fig. 7.11a. It comprises a heat pipe having an
evaporator at one end and a condenser at the other end. The condenser is attached
through a manifold, which transfers the heat of vaporization to the working ﬂuid.
The whole assembly is enclosed independently with an evacuated cylindrical
envelope.
An electrical network for a system under consideration is shown in Fig. 7.11b
for analysis. The ﬁgure also shows the thermal resistance at various points. The rate
of energy transferred from one point to another is also shown.
Under steady-state conditions, the rate of useful energy

is marginal effect of UL=hph on F0 for UL=hph [ 0:01 for evacuated tubular solar
collector manufactured by Phillips, UL=hph ¼ 0:0038
ð
Þ. Figure 7.12b shows the effect
of UL=hhm on F0 for UL=hph ¼ 0:19 for different Ahm=Ac. This shows that the value of
F0 is close to 0.8 for Ahm=Ac [ 0:1 and UL=hhm\0:04. Simultaneously, Fig. 7.12c
shows that F0 is nearly 0.8 for Ahm=Ac [ 0:02, UL=hhm ¼ 0:001 and UL=hph ¼ 0:19.
The value of F0 can go beyond 0.8 for UL=hph ¼ 0:19 for any value of ratio of
resistances >17 (Fig. 7.12d).
It is important to note that this analysis is based on a single tubular module. The
value of F0 increases appreciably when a module with ≥20 tubes is used.

Solar Water-Heating Systems
Abstract A solar water-heating system is a device to store hot water available from
a combination of ﬂat-plate collectors (FPCs) and evacuated tubular solar collectors
(ETSCs) at a moderate-temperature. Solar collectors can be connected in a com-
bination of series and parallel per the requirement. Such a water heating system is
mostly used during either off-sunshine hours or when there is a low level of solar
radiation.

Introduction
The main component of a solar ﬂat-plate collector (FPC), which is generally used
for water heating, is the blackened absorber surface. Furthermore, the blackened
absorber surface can be broadly classiﬁed as follows:
(a) Parallel ﬂat plate: In this case, the water can be stagnant either above the
absorber or below the absorber for heating purposes. The water is heated by
convective heat-transfer from the blackened absorber surface to the water. If
the water depth (heat capacity, MwCw) is large, then such a water heater can
also store the thermal energy due to reduced heat loss. This type of water
heater is referred to as a “collection-cum-storage water heater.” This can be
used as a domestic-level application.
(b) Tube and plate: In collection‒cum-storage water heater, the temperature of
water is lower due to the large heat capacity. To increase the temperature of
the water, there should be least the heat capacity (lower water mass) of water.
This condition can only be achieved in a tube-and-plate conﬁguration. The
ﬂat-plate collector is generally used for large-scale water heating. The heated
water in a ﬂat-plate collector is then stored in an insulated storage tank. The
mode of transfer of heated water from the FPC to an insulated storage tank can
be either (i) natural circulation (thermo siphon) or (ii) forced-circulation mode.

Such a water heating system is referred to as a “conventional water-heating
system.” Furthermore, the transfer of heated water may be performed either
directly or through a heat exchanger. These water solar heaters employ water
as a transport ﬂuid for energy transfer from the collection unit to the storage
one. Water, apart from being a low cost and easily available ﬂuid, has many
advantageous thermo-chemical properties such as nontoxic, nonﬂammable,
high speciﬁc heat, good heat-transfer and ﬂuid dynamic characteristics, and
suitable liquid‒vapour equilibrium and temperature‒pressure relationship for
space-heating and cooling applications.
8.2
Collection-Cum-Storage Solar Water Heater
A collection-cum-storage solar water heater combines both collection and storage in
the same unit. Thus there is no need of a separate insulated tank for the storage of
hot water.
Collection-cum-storage water heaters can be classiﬁed as follows:
(i) Built-in storage solar water heater [1–4]
(ii) Shallow solar pond (SSP) solar water heater [4, 5]
Brief descriptions of the two are given below.
8.2.1
Built-in Storage Water Heater
In built-in storage water heaters, the water is below the absorber of the parallel
ﬂat-plate collector. It is compact in design, has a low cost, and is easy to install. In
addition, they have a good collection efﬁciency and satisfactory overnight thermal
storage.
A built-in storage water heater, as shown in Fig. 8.1, consists of a rectangular
insulated tank. The tank is usually made of galvanized iron with dimensions of
1.12 m × 0.08 m × 0.1 m and is encased in a mild- iron or wooden box
(1.22 m × 0.9 m × 0.2 m). The top surface of the tank is painted with blackboard
paint. Furthermore, it is covered with one or two window-glass covers (3-mm thick)
with approximately 4-cm air gaps between the absorbing surface and the glass
cover. Due to the enormous water pressure, there is bulging of the tank; hence,
braces are provided.
Cold water is fed through the inlet. Hot water is withdrawn from the outlet. In
case there is no provision of piped water supply, hot water can be withdrawn by
adding cold water into the inlet through a large funnel ﬁxed at the top of the heater.

Solar Water-Heating Systems

The major thermal losses in a built-in storage solar water heater are radiative and
convective from the top surface during off sunshine hours. In this case, the solar
heater cannot provide hot water in the early morning. To improve the night-time
performance, the solar water heater should be covered with an adequate thickness of
glass-wool insulation. The water is allowed to heat up during the day. The top of the
tank is covered with insulation when the thermal collection reduces to zero (during
off-sunshine hours).
Energy-balance equation:
To write an energy balance of a built-in storage solar water heater; it is fair to
assume the same absorber and water temperature. Under this assumption, an energy
balance can be written as
Ac as

; and hpw is the convective
heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the absorber plate to the water. Because the value of
hpw is very large, it can be neglected (see Example 8.1).
Equation (8.1) can be written as follows:
dTw

where a ¼

The solution of Eq. (8.2) can be obtained with following assumptions:
(a) f tð Þ should be considered as f ðtÞ for Dt time interval; and
(b) Tw is Two at t ¼ 0.

Example 8.1 Evaluate the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient ðhpwÞ from a
blackened surface to a water mass ðat 20 CÞ for a built-in storage water heater for
an effective area of 1 m × 1 m = 1 m2.
Solution
From Appendix V, the properties of water at 20 °C are
v ¼ 1:006  106 m2=s; K ¼ 0:5967 W=mK and Pr ¼ 7:02:
These values can be substituted in Eq. (3.22d), and the value of the Grashof
number is calculated as

The value of the Nusselt number can be obtained from Eq. (3.24) using the
values of C ¼ 0:15 and m ¼ 1=3 from Table 3.3.
Thus, Nu ¼ 425:4105
Now Nu ¼ hpw X=K, where X is the characteristic dimension and is given by
ð1 þ 1Þ=2 ¼ 1.
Thus, hpw ¼ 253:84 W=m2 C
Example 8.2 Calculate an overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient from water to the
ambient ðUtÞ air through a blackened surface and glass cover, e.g., as in Example
8.1.

Here h1 and h2 are the heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the absorber to the glass

h2 are given as

The values of hpw ¼ 253:84 W=m2 C (Example 8.1).

Example 8.2 justiﬁes our assumption of the water and the plate temperature
being the same.
8.2.2
Shallow Solar Pond (SSP) Solar Water Heater
In this case, the water is placed between the absorber and the glass cover unlike the
built-in-storage solar water heater. Such a solar water heater is referred to as a
“shallow solar pond (SSP).” It is a simple and cost-effective device to harness solar
energy for water heating.
A shallow solar pond (SSP) solar water heater consists of a blackened tray ﬁlled
with water of small depth (say, approximately 0.10 m). The tray is properly insu-
lated from the bottom and sides to reduce conductive heat losses. Evaporative
cooling in a SSP solar water heater is suppressed by covering the water surface with
a transparent glass/plastic sheet to avoid evaporation. Incident solar energy is
absorbed at the blackened surface after transmission from the glass cover and the
water mass, and absorbed energy is transferred to the water column by convection.
Thus, the water is heated.
A compact SSP solar water heater consists of a pillow-type water bag placed in
an insulated (from side and bottom) wooden box that is transparent on top with a
blackened bottom to receive and absorb the maximum solar radiation for heating. It
has a thermally insulated cover at the top, which can be used as a booster mirror
during the day and as an insulation cover during off-sunshine hours, thus providing
a means of overnight storage as shown in Fig. 8.2.
An efﬁcient performance of the SSP solar water heater demands continuous
withdrawal of hot water from the pond to reduce thermal losses.
Three modes of hot-water withdrawal from an SSP have been suggested
(a) Batch withdrawal: In the batch-withdrawal mode, the pond is ﬁlled early in
the morning and is emptied into an insulated storage reservoir in the afternoon
to achieve maximum water temperature.
(b) Closed-cycle continuous ﬂow: In the closed-cycle mode, the water is circu-
lated continuously at a constant ﬂow rate between the SSP and the storage
with or without the extraction of heat from storage by way of heat exchanger.
In this case also, the pond water is transferred to storage in the afternoon.
8.2
Collection-Cum-Storage Solar Water Heater
331

(c) Open-cycle continuous ﬂow: In the open-cycle mode, water at an initial
temperature enters the pond, and the hot water ﬂowing through the pond is
drained out continuously into storage or for some other end-use application.
The pond is emptied in the evening when the heat collection reduces to zero.
The solar heater can be designed to optimize performance. The water temper-
ature is observed to decrease with increasing water depth. Greater water depth
results in more water mass and hence a higher heat capacity per square meter.
Energy Balance:
To write an energy balance of an SSP solar water heater, it is fair to assume the
same absorber and water temperature. Under this assumption, an energy balance
can be written as

where e is the effectiveness of a heat exchanger placed in the storage tank for the
transfer of heat from the SSP water heater to the storage tank under a closed-cycle
continuous (CCC) ﬂow, which is always <1 and _Mw [ 0. The _Mw ¼ 0 for batch
withdrawal (BW) and _Mw [ 0 and e ¼ 1 for open-cycle continuous (OCC) ﬂow.

Solar Water-Heating Systems

The effect of water depth on the maximum water temperature, as well as on the
overall thermal efﬁciency, is shown in Fig. 8.3 for both built-in storage and SSP
water heaters. It can be observed that the maximum water temperature in case of a
SSP solar water heater is greater than that of a built-in storage water heater. This
may be due to fact that the rate of thermal energy available for an SSP solar water
heater is more. Furthermore, an overall thermal efﬁciency of an SSP solar water
heater is less due to there being more thermal losses from the top cover unlike with
a built-in storage solar water heater. As the water depth increases, the overall
collection thermal efﬁciency increases due to the decrease in top thermal losses to
the outside air. However, the thermal efﬁciency in both cases becomes stagnant up
to a water depth of 10 cm; hence, one can conclude that a 10-cm water depth gives
optimal thermal performance.
Losses from the top and bottom can be reduced by optimizing the thickness of
the insulation. It has been seen that a 5.0-cm thickness of insulation is optimum for
minimum heat loss from the bottom and top surfaces. The performance of the
system can be improved by using a reﬂecting sheet (can be used as booster mirror)
having 0.03 emissivity and a 5-cm air gap, which is equivalent to a 5 cm—thick
layer of glass wool insulation.
Example 8.3 Calculate the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the blackened
surface to the water ð60 CÞ for an SSP solar water heater of area 1 m × 1 m.
Solution
From Appendix V, the properties of water at 60 C are
m ¼ 4:775  107 m2=s; K ¼ 0:6503 W=mK and Pr ¼ 3:02
From Eq. (3.22d), the Grashof number can be calculated as

Solar Water-Heating System
A conventional solar water-heating system essentially consists of (a) the collection
unit and (b) the insulated storage unit. The collection unit is a combination of
ﬂat-plate collectors (FPC) (Chap. 5, Sect. 5.2). The hot water, available at outlet
ðTfoÞ, is transferred to the insulated storage tank to reduce possible heat losses for
the storage of hot water during off-sunshine hours (nighttime). Transportation of the
hot water from the ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) to the insulated storage tank can be
performed by two modes, namely:
334
8
Solar Water-Heating Systems

(i) The thermo siphon/natural mode: In this case, the hot water is circulated
between the FPC to the insulated tank under gravitational force. To achieve
this, an insulated storage tank should be placed above the ﬂat-plate collector
modules. This height should be at least 1 foot above the FPCs as shown in
Fig. 8.4. There are three type of such water heater, namely
(a) Nonpressure type: The schematic diagram of a nonpressure-type solar
water heater with natural circulation is shown in Fig. 8.4a. In this case, an
insulated storage tank is ﬁlled with cold water once in the morning, and
hot water can be withdrawn per requirement at any time in the day or
night.
(b) Pressure type: The schematic diagram of pressure-type solar water heater
with natural circulation is shown in Fig. 8.4b. In this case too, an insulated
storage tank is ﬁlled with cold water once in the morning. However, hot
water can only be withdrawn if main water line has water with sufﬁcient
pressure.
(c) Pressure type with heat exchanger: The schematic diagram of
pressure-type solar water heater with natural circulation with heat
exchanger is shown in Fig. 8.4c. It is important to mention here that the
heat exchanger is used only for the withdrawal of hot water from the
insulated storage tank. For this, too, there should be sufﬁcient pressure in
the main line to withdraw hot water.
(ii) Forced-circulation mode: In this case, there is no need of placing an insu-
lated storage tank above the FPC module due to the forced circulation of hot
water between the FPC and the insulted tank. Here a water pump for a given
capacity is required for the ﬂow of water as shown in Fig. 8.5.
8.3.1
Natural Circulation [6]
A schematic diagram of a nonpressure-type solar water heater consists of m-FPCs
connected in parallel under natural circulation mode. The storage tank of water heat
capacity of MC
ð
Þw is an insulated cylinder with two inlets: One inlet is for the hot
water coming from the outlet at mth FPC [TfoN, Eq. (5.88)], and the other inlet is to
allow the cold water from the mains to reach the bottom of the insulated storage
tank without it mixing with hot water. There are two outlets, namely, (i) for the
withdrawal of hot water and (ii) to feed cold water to the inlet of ﬁrst ﬂat-plate
collector. To reduce heat loss, the entire length of the connecting pipes is perfectly
insulated. Solar radiation incident on the ﬂat-plate collector modules heat the water
inside. The hot water rises up the collector due to its lesser density. The vacuum
created by this ﬂow is ﬁlled up by the cold water from the insulated storage tank

under gravity. Thus, the upper ends (2) of the collector modules have hot water,
whereas the lower ends (1) have cold water. This hot water then enters the storage
tank from inlet 3 as shown in Fig. 8.6.
Referring to Fig. 8.6, the energy balance for different components of a solar
water-heating system can be written with the following assumptions:
• The heat capacity (mass × speciﬁc heat) of glass cover, connecting pipes,
absorber plate, pipes, insulating materials, and storage materials are negligible
compared with heat capacity of the water.
• The average temperature of the water in a solar FPC (between the upper and
lower headers) and the storage tank (top and bottom water) is approximately the
same.
• There are no heat losses from the insulating connecting pipes between the solar
FPC and the storage tank.
The energy balances are as follows:

From Eq. (5.84), the rate of thermal energy available from m-FPCs connected in
parallel can be written as

where Acm ¼ mAc; Ac is the effective area of one solar FPC; F0 is the solar ﬂat

ature of the solar FPCs connected in parallel; _mf is the mass ﬂow rate of water due
to natural circulation, which depends on solar radiation; and Tf is the average
temperature of the outlet and inlet water.
Storage tank
Because there is no losses occurring through the connecting pipes between the solar
FPCs and the insulated storage tank, then the thermal energy available from the
m-FPCs will be distributed as the (i) thermal energy stored in storage tank’s water,
(ii) the thermal energy lost to the ambient air from the storage tank, and (iii) the
thermal energy withdrawn from the storage tank.
Now the energy balance of the storage tank can be written as

Forced-Circulation Solar Water Heater [7–9]
In this case, to transfer the hot water available at the upper header of the collector to
the insulated storage tank, a water pump is used at the inlet of the collector between
the solar ﬂat-plate collector and the insulated storage tank. The solar FPCs can also
be connected either in parallel, in series, or in a combination of both, as discussed in
Sect. 5.8, for higher water temperature if required. Furthermore, it is important to
mention here that for forced mode we need power; hence, PVT solar FPCs should
be provided to make the system sustainable as shown in Fig. 8.7a.
A single- and double-loop water heating system will be discussed in the next
section.
(i) Single Loop [8]
A line diagram of single-loop solar water-heating system is shown in Fig. 8.7b.
It operates continuously until pump is switched off manually. This problem is
automatically solved in the case of single-loop PVT solar water-heating system as
shown in Fig. 8.7a. In this case, a DC pump operates only if there is solar radiation.
Otherwise a controller with a sensor should be used as shown in Fig. 8.7c. The
sensor is ﬁtted at the outlet of the solar FPC. In this case, the pump operates at a
desired set temperature. Furthermore, a coil-type heat exchanger with a controller is
used in the collector loop inside the storage tank as shown in Fig. 8.7d. Antifreeze
liquid is used in the collector loop. This is required in harsh cold climatic conditions
where the temperature decreases beyond 0 C. Another type of heat exchanger can
also be used in a collector loop as shown in Fig. 8.7e. This is known as a “heating
jacket used outside the tank.” The maintenance of such a heat exchanger becomes
easier. A detailed analysis of Figs. 8.7b to 8.8 will be discussed in the coming
sections.
A complete set-up of a domestic solar water-heating system is shown in Fig. 8.8.
Hot water can be withdrawn for a continuous supply of cold water at inlet under
pressure. The nonreturn check valve is used. The controller with a sensor is con-
nected to the absorber outlet and the storage tank. A back-up unit is also provided at
the outside of the storage tank.
Energy Balance
In this case, water in the storage tank is allowed to pass through the inlet of the
FPCs, i.e., Tw ¼ Tfi. The ﬂow of cold water from the insulated storage tank to the
inlet of the collector is maintained by a pump as shown in Fig. 8.7b. An energy
balance under forced mode for a simple and single-loop solar water heater can be
written as

Consider a solar water-heating system in which two heat exchanger loops have
been used as shown in Fig. 8.9. First there is the heat exchanger between the
collector and storage tank I for any ﬂuid other than water, and there is the other heat
exchanger between storage tanks I and II with forced circulation. There is water in
storage tank II. Such a system is required when the temperature of frozen water goes
into negative numbers.

Detailed Analysis of a Double-Loop Solar
Water-Heating System
The use of a heat exchanger mainly depends on (i) the quality of the water and
(ii) the climatic condition of the location. In this section, it is assumed that all of the
connecting pipes between (a) the collector and the heat exchanger loop and (b) the
heat exchanger to an insulated storage tank loop are perfectly insulated to avoid
heat loss, and hence there is no temperature drop for the hot water ﬂowing through
them.
The heat exchanger-based solar water-heating system, as shown in Fig. 8.10,
works under forced-circulation mode. Pump no. 1 is used in a collector loop and is
also known as “smaller stream” due to its low capacity of ﬂuid. Pump no. 1 cir-
culates the ﬂuid through the collector. Pump no. 2 is used to circulate water in the
outer loop between the storage tank and a heat exchanger and is also known as
“larger stream” due to large heat capacity of the water in the storage tank.

Solar Water-Heating Systems

8.4.1
Heat Exchanger [10]
The heat exchanger is essential only to avoid (a) corrosion due to poor quality of the
water and (b) freezing of the water in the collector tubes due to harsh cold climatic
conditions.
8.4.2
Choice of Fluid
Water is an ideal heat-transfer ﬂuid for a ﬂat-plate collector. Water is non-
ﬂammable, nontoxic, and noncorrosive, particularly in plastics as well as some
metals (copper and stainless steel, etc.). It has high heat-transfer properties, high
density, and high speciﬁc heat along with a reasonably high boiling temperature. It
has also low viscosity. No heat exchanger is used for water. However, the problem,
of course, is water’s freezing point.
Some alternative ﬂuids having a low freezing point are listed in Table 8.1. The
freezing point of water can be lowered below 0 °C by the addition of some inor-
ganic salts without affecting most of its other properties. Most of the ﬂuids listed in
Table 8.1 are noncorrosive, nonﬂammable, and nonfreezing. Except for water and
air, the rest of the ﬂuids are expensive with a high boiling point. Ethylene and
propylene glycol are good choices and indeed are in general use (a 50 %-by-weight
mixture approaches most of the properties of water). These are only used in a
collector loop as shown in Fig. 8.10. Air, of course, does not have the problem of
freezing. However, there is a penalty in terms of system performance due to air’s
poor heat-transfer properties.

8.4.3
Analysis of a Heat Exchanger
There are many kinds of liquid–liquid heat exchangers. However, only concentric
tube and spiral heat exchangers in a tank, as shown in Fig. 8.11, are used in solar
water-heating system. These are cost-effective, inexpensive, and easy to maintain
locally.
Heat-exchanger performance is measured by effectiveness concept. In this sec-
tion, an analysis of a counter-current heat exchanger will be brieﬂy discussed. For
simpliﬁcation, a block diagram of Fig. 8.11a for a concentric tube exchanger for
counter current is depicted in Fig. 8.12.
The outlet of a solar ﬂat-plate collector ðTfoÞ becomes the inlet of small stream
ðTsiÞ. It passes through an inner tube of the heat exchanger as shown in Fig. 8.11a.
The cold water available from the storage tank at temperature Tli is allowed to pass
in the opposite direction of the small stream for maximum heat transfer
_Qmax


from the small stream to the large stream. The inlet temperatures, Tsi ¼ Tfo and Tli,
to the heat exchanger are considered to determine outlet temperatures Tso and Tlo,
respectively.
The maximum quantity of the rate of heat-transfer from the small stream to the
large stream can be written as
_Qmax ¼ _MfCf Tsi  Tli

where _Mf is the mass-ﬂow rate of the hot ﬂuid in kilograms per second available
from the collector; and Cf is the speciﬁc heat of the working ﬂuid. The actual heat
exchange
_Q
 
between the hot ﬂuid of the small stream and the water of the large
stream can be expressed as a proportion e of _Qmax. The ‘e’ is referred to as “the
effectiveness of the heat exchanger.”

the water of the large stream is given by
_Q ¼ e _MfCf Tsi  Tli
ð
Þ
ð8:24Þ
The effectiveness of the heat exchanger eð Þ depends on its heat-transfer prop-
erties and the ﬂuid ﬂows. It is independent of the temperature level. Once these are
ﬁxed, the effectiveness
eð Þ can be used to determine the performance of heat
exchanger in terms of inlet-ﬂuid temperature.

ð8:25Þ
where _mf ¼ _Mf=Ac
Referring to Fig. 8.12, the hot water available at Tsi will cool down to Tso during
its ﬂow in a heat exchanger. Although the cold water available at Tli from the
storage tank will be heated to Tlo during its ﬂow in the opposite direction in the heat
exchanger. If there is no heat loss, than the heat loss from the small stream (col-
lector loop) will be a heat gain to the large stream (storage tank loop). Both will be
equal and can be expressed as follows:
Heat lost by the small stream in W=m2ðcollector loopÞ ¼ _mfCf Tsi  Tso
ð
Þ
ð8:26Þ
Heat gained by the large stream in W=m2ðstorage tank loopÞ ¼ _mwCw Tlo  Tli
ð
Þ
ð8:27Þ
By equating Eqs. (8.25) and (8.26), one has the following expression for the heat
exchanger’s effectiveness:
Effectivness of the heat exchanger ¼ e ¼ Tsi  Tso
Tlo  Tli
ð8:28Þ
The effectiveness
eð Þ is deﬁned as the ratio of the actual temperature change
achieved in the small and large steam, respectively.
The ﬂow-capacity ratio is expressed as the ratio of temperature differences
required for proper performance or the ratio of the temperature changes occurring in
the two streams. It can be obtained by equating Eqs. (8.26) and (8.27), respectively,
as follows:
Flow capacity ratio ¼ _mfCf
_mwCw
¼ Tlo  Tli
Tsi  Tso
ð8:29Þ
Here it is important to note that the ﬂow-capacity ratio should be <1, i.e.,

ð8:29aÞ
For counter-current heat ﬂow, an expression for the effectiveness of a heat
exchanger in terms of its heat-transfer properties and the ﬂow-capacity rates can be
written as follows:

of the ﬂuid in the circulating collector loop. This temperature difference can be used
to determine the heat-exchanger parameter UxAx. For a tank heating water with a
given temperature difference, a convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient can be calcu-
lated by using the following formula:
h ¼ 142 DTx

where h is in W=m2 C; DTx

only for DTx ¼ 38 C. For DTx ¼ 65 C, multiply Eq. (8.42) by 1.15; for
DTx ¼ 21 C, divide Eq. (8.42) by 1.15. For higher DTx, the ﬂow rate should be
small in the collector loop.

Solution
Referring to Fig. 8.15, one can determine _mfCf ¼ 84:11 W=m2 and Ac=Ax ¼ 3:6.
If _q is the net heat ﬂux collected per unit area of the solar ﬂat-plate collector, then
the heat transfer through the heat exchanger to the water in the insulated tank is
obtained as
_qAc ¼ UxAxDTx

Heat Collection in an Insulated Storage Tank [10]
The hot water from the outlet of a solar ﬂat-plate collector is fed at the top of the
insulated storage tank. If the insulated storage tank is in a horizontal position, as
shown in Fig. 8.10, then there is quick mixing between the hot water of the solar
ﬂat-plate collector and the cold water of the insulated storage tank. In the case of a
vertical position of the storage tank, as shown in Fig. 8.15 (without heat exchanger)
and Fig. 8.14 (with heat exchanger), the mixing takes some time due to low density
of the hot water at the top of the storage tank. The stratiﬁcation generally takes
place at a very low circulating-ﬂuid ﬂow rate in the collector loop. Hence, an
analysis of a storage tank with and without stratiﬁcation will be presented in the
following section.
8.5.1
Heat Collection with a Stratiﬁed Insulated Storage

ÞIT  UL Tsi  Ta

ð8:43Þ
where IT is the total solar radiation over a time period, tT, on a solar ﬂat-plate
collector.
The hot water available from a solar FPC is fed at the top of the storage tank. It
does not affect the temperature of the ﬂuid leaving the tank immediately; hence, the
solar ﬂat-plate collector operates at a constant thermal efﬁciency. After ts time, the
358

Solar Water-Heating Systems

ﬁrst-collected heat at the top of the solar FPC reaches the bottom of the tank and
hence changes the temperature of the ﬂuid leaving the tank. In this case, the
performance of the ﬂat-plate collector also changes due to the change in its inlet
temperature. At this time, heat collected exactly equals the heat required to raise the
temperature of the water storage in the tank from Tsi to Tso. This can be mathe-
matically expressed as follows:
QT ¼ _MfCf Tfo  Tfi
ð
Þts ¼ MsCs Tso  Tsi
ð
Þ
ð8:44Þ
Because Tfo ¼ Tso and Tfi ¼ Tsi, as shown in Fig. 8.6, the above equation can be
solved for ts, which is expressed as
ts ¼ MsCs
_MfCf
¼ msCs
_mfCf
ð8:45Þ
Here it is important to note that tT  ts.
The process can then be repeated with the ﬂat-plate collector operating at new
inlet temperature with a new constant thermal efﬁciency. After one turnover time of
period ts, a new storage tank temperature is calculated as
Tso ¼ Tsi þ

From Eq. (8.45), the storage turnover time can be calculated as
ts ¼ msCs
_mfCf

Because the maximum value of tT is equal to ts, the total heat collected in 2 h is
therefore calculated from Eq. (8.43) as

from Eq. (8.46) as
Tso ¼ Tsi þ
qT
msCs
¼ 15 þ 3:8163
0:32 ¼ 26:93 C
During the second turnover, the time collection will continue with the inlet
temperature at 26.93 °C, hence the total heat collected in another two hours is
calculated as
qT ¼ 0:75  750:0  0:0071  5:0 26:93  10

Þ  0:0071 ¼ 3:3927 MJ=m2
and Tso ¼ Tsi þ
qT
msCs ¼ 26:93 þ 3:3927

Similarly, after a third turnover time, the total heat collected in 2 h is given as

ð

and Tso ¼ Tsi þ
qT

The total heat collected over period of 6 h is obtained as
qT ¼ 3:8163 þ 3:3927 þ 3:0486 ¼ 10:2576 MJ=m2
8.5.2
Heat Collection with a Well-Mixed Insulated Storage
Tank
In this case, ﬂuid is circulated with a high ﬂow rate in a horizontal storage tank as
shown in Fig. 8.10. Due to higher ﬂuid ﬂow rate, one turnover time period, tT, of
the stratiﬁed storage tank is very small. A well-mixed insulate storage tank is less
efﬁcient due to the high temperature of the ﬂuid leaving insulated storage tank. The
large ﬂow of ﬂuid through the solar ﬂat-plate collector gives a high heat-transfer
360

factor, which compensates for the loss due to the higher temperature. Under these
circumstances, Tsi should be replaced by Ts in Eq. (8.43) as follows:

For the second hour, I ¼ 558 W=m2 and Ta ¼ 13:5 C, qT is determined as

Similarly, for other hours, qT and Tso can be also calculated as given in the above
table. Furthermore, qT can also be calculated from Eq. (8.47) as given in the same
table, and it is inferred that the value of qT calculated from both equation is the
same for a 1-h time step.
Example 8.14 Estimate qT and Tso for Example 8.13 for a 5-h time step.
Solution
In this case,

and Tso is calculated as
Tso ¼ Tsi þ
qT

The above-calculated value of Tso is lower by 0:4 C compared with a 1-h time
step value of Tso ¼ 61:33 (from the above table). This is due to the longer time step.
8.5.3
Effect of Heat Load [11]
In the previous section, the-FPC integrated storage equation was developed without
considering any heat losses/thermal load. The effect of heating load to a room is
shown in Fig. 8.16.
There can be two ways to determine room heating for a given load as follows:
(i) A noninsulated hot water-storage tank should be placed inside a room with
provision of a fan at one end for fast heating.
(ii) There should be circulation of hot water between the insulated hot
water-storage tank and the heat exchanger—fan arrangement, and hot air
available at the exit of the fan is sent to the required room for space heating. In
this case, there is no need of a hot water tank to be placed inside the room.
If lT is the thermal load demand, which is expressed as the thermal head load per
unit collector area, then it is deﬁned as
lT ¼ Tb  Ta
ð
Þ þ UA
ð
Þb
Ac
ð8:52Þ
where the positive sign (+) indicates that only a positive value in the bracket should
be considered for the thermal heating of a building. The
UA
ð
Þb is the overall
heat-loss coefﬁcient from the room of a building to the ambient air through different
walls,

Solar Flat-Plate Air Collectors
Abstract A solar ﬂat-plate air collector has the application of space heating and
crop drying under forced mode of operation with air as a working ﬂuid. For space
heating, hot air can be stored in a rock bed for night-time application. The electrical
power consumed under forced mode can be met by integrating a PV module into an
air collector panel.

Introduction
A conventional solar air heater is essentially a ﬂat-plate collector with a blackened
absorber plate having a as absorptivity, a transparent cover having s as a trans-
mittivity at the top, and insulation at the bottom and on the sides. The whole
assembly is encased in a sheet-metal container, and the system is referred to as a
“solar ﬂat-plate air collector.” The working ﬂuid is air, instead of water, which is
blown either below or above the absorber plate. The description and analysis of
various types of solar air heaters will be studied in this chapter. The solar ﬂat-plate
air collector is used for the heating of living spaces and drying of crops/vegetables.
Solar ﬂat-plate air collectors are advantageous compared with other solar
thermal collectors using liquid as working ﬂuid. Solar ﬂat-plate air collectors have
following advantages:
(i)
The system is compact and less complicated. The working ﬂuid, i.e., air
directly transfers heat to the living space or crops/vegetables; therefore, no
additional (other than working ﬂuid) heat-transfer medium is required.
(ii)
The problem of corrosion is completely eliminated in the solar ﬂat-plate air
collector.
(iii)
The leakage of air does not cause any serious problem.

(iv)
The working ﬂuid does not freeze.
(v)
The pressure rise in the solar air collector is comparatively low.
Thus, a solar air heater can be designed using less and cheaper material. Its
operation and maintenance is simpler than those for solar water heaters. However,
solar air heaters have certain following disadvantages as follows:
(i)
Poor thermo-physical properties of the working ﬂuid (air) lead to a lesser
amount of heat transfer from the absorber to the working ﬂuid; therefore,
speciﬁc additional arrangements are needed to enhance the heat transfer.
(ii)
A large volume of working ﬂuid is required to be handled because of its low
density.
(iii)
The lower thermal capacity of air limits these systems to be used as thermal
storage systems.
(iv)
The cost of an air heater can be very high due to improper design.
The applicability of a solar air collector depends on various factors, namely,
(a) thermal efﬁciency, (b) fabrication cost and installation, (c) operational and
maintenance costs, and (d) the speciﬁc use. Solar air heaters have been extensively
investigated both experimentally as well as theoretically. A variety of geometries
have been proposed to enhance the heat-transfer properties of the system. Selcuk [1]
has reported a comprehensive literature review on solar air heaters. It was con-
cluded that technically solar air heaters are at a state-of-art-level, which should be
addressed commercially to a greater extent.
9.2
Classiﬁcation of Solar Air Heaters
Selective coating of the absorber plate, high absorptivity, a and low emissivity ðeÞ
can be used to improve the collection thermal efﬁciency.
Depending on the type of mechanism for transferring heat to air, the solar air
heater can be classiﬁed as (a) nonporous solar air heaters or (b) porous solar air
heaters. Figures 9.1 and 9.2 show the basic features of these solar air heaters.
9.2.1
Nonporous-Type Solar Air Heaters
In the nonporous-type solar air heater, an air stream ﬂows as follows:
(i)
Above the blackened absorber plate: In this case, absorbed solar radiation,
after transmission from the glass cover, heats the blackened absorber plate.
Thermal energy from the blackened absorber plate is then convected to the
ﬂowing air above blackened absorber plate (hot surface facing upward), and
then it is heated (Fig. 9.1a).
370

Solar Flat Plate Air Collectors

(ii)
Below the blackened absorber plate: In this case, absorbed solar radiation,
after transmission from the glass cover, heats the blackened absorber plate.
Thermal energy from the blackened absorber plate is then convected to the
ﬂowing air below the blackened absorber plate (hot surface facing down-
ward), and then it is heated (Fig. 9.1b).

Fig. 9.2 a–c Schematics of porous absorber-type air heaters. (From [17])
9.2
Classiﬁcation of Solar Air Heaters
371

(iii)
Both sides of the blackened absorber plate: In this case, air ﬂows from
both sides (above and below) of the blackened absorber plate (Fig. 9.1c).
The temperature of hot air is much less compared with cases (i) and
(ii) respectively.
Because there is more heat transfer in the case of the hot surface facing upward
(double) compared with the hot surface facing downward (Chap. 3), the tempera-
ture of the hot air in case (i) is greater. Furthermore, the hot air in case (i) loses more
heat to the ambient air through the glass cover due to high operating temperature.
Therefore, thermal efﬁciency in case (i) has a lower value. Because of that, this
conﬁguration is not recommended compared with case (ii). In case (ii), there are
provisions to increase the heat transfer by increasing the surface of the absorber as
shown in Fig. 9.1c, d. In the case of Fig. 9.1d, a pressure drop also occurs, which
requires greater consumption of electricity.
Because of low heat transfer between the blackened absorber plate and the air, the
air collector has lesser thermal efﬁciency. However, the efﬁciency of the solar air
heater can be improved by increasing the heat-transfer surface area or by increasing
the turbulence. This can be achieved by roughing the surface of the blackened
absorber plate or by using extended ﬁn structures as shown in Fig. 9.1d. The turbu-
lence caused by roughing the surface enhances the convective heat transfer between
the blackened absorber plate and the air ﬂowing through the solar air collector. For the
nonporous-type solar air collectors, the losses from the blackened absorption plate
due to radiation are considerable. In the absence of a selective coating, the collection
thermal efﬁciency is low. Inclusion of a ﬁn incurs the problem of an excessive
pressure decrease, which restricts the use of this type of solar air heater.
9.2.2
Porous-Type Solar Air Heaters
In the porous absorber solar air heater, porous absorbers of different conﬁgurations—
such as wire mesh, honeycomb, or glass plates—are used as shown in Fig. 9.2.
The air heater with a porous-type absorber has the following advantages:
(i) The solar radiation penetrates through the porous absorber and is absorbed
throughout the duct depth of the solar air heater. Consequently, loss is
decreased in the porous-type absorber air heater. The air stream heats up as it
passes through the porous absorber, which is also known as the “matrix.”
(ii) The pressure decrease is usually lower than with the nonporous-type absorber.
The porosity and thickness of the absorber must be optimized for higher thermal
efﬁciency. It should be optimized in such a way that it transfers more thermal
energy to the air ﬂowing in the solar air heater. Figure 9.2a shows the porous wire
mesh along with its matrix. The absorber bed, formed by broken bottles (Fig. 9.2b)
and an overlapped glass plate (Fig. 9.2c), is an examples of a porous-type
absorbers.

Conventional Nonporous Solar Air Heaters
Figure 9.3a shows the various thermal losses in terms of percentage of the con-
ventional nonporous solar air heater. It can be seen that the maximum thermal
efﬁciency of a conventional nonporous solar air heater can be 60 %. This is also
referred to as a “single-pass solar air heater.” An equivalent thermal-resistance
circuit diagram of a conventional nonporous solar air heater is shown in Fig. 9.3b.
The energy-balance equations in this chapter are written under quasi-steady state
and transient conditions with the assumptions given as follows:

(i)
There is no temperature gradient along the thickness of the glass cover and
the absorber plate.
(ii)
The heat-transfer coefﬁcients for the operating temperature range are
assumed to be constant.
(iii)
The mass-ﬂow is stream-line ﬂow and constant.
(iv)
The side-heat losses are neglected.
(v)
The temperature gradient along the depth of the duct is negligible; average
air temperature changes along the direction of ﬂow.
(vi)
The thermal/heat loss from the absorber plate through the bottom insulation
is considered under steady-state conditions.
(vii)
Absorptivity of solar radiation in a glass cover is negligible.
9.3.1
Steady-State Analysis for Natural Mode
(a) First method
Materials for the construction of solar air heaters are similar to those of liquid
ﬂat-plate collectors. Here the absorption of solar radiation in the absorber plate
(a) takes place after the transmission of solar radiation (s) through the glass
cover system, which is identical to that of liquid ﬂat-plate collectors. Hence,
the rate of thermal energy at the absorber plate will be as follows:


ð9:1bÞ
where IðtÞ is solar intensity; Ac is the area of the solar air heater; and Tp and Ta
are the plate/absorber and ambient-air temperatures, respectively. The UL is an
overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the absorber plate to the ambient air
through glass cover as well as the bottom insulation.
If the working ﬂuid as air can be either above or below the absorber plate, the rate of
thermal energy transfer from the absorber plate to the air will be written as follows:
_Qu ¼ Ac hpf Tp  Tf

where hpf is the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the absorber plate to the
ﬂuid (air). Its value will be half in the case of ﬂuid (air) below the absorber plate.

F0 is the solar air heater‒collection efﬁciency factor, which is always <1. It is
deﬁned as the ratio of the actual rate of useful energy to the rate of useful energy
when the plate is placed at ﬂuid (air) temperature. Equation (9.3b) was derived
under the assumption that there is only heat transfer from the absorber to the ﬂuid
(air).

heat-loss reduction due to single glass compensates for the transmission losses and
becomes beneﬁcial beyond a certain temperature. However, the choice of the
number of glass covers always confers economical constraints.

Various types of conventional air heaters have a nonporous-type absorber. The
performance analyses of some of these have been discussed here.
9.3.3
Transient Analysis for Forced Mode
In this case, only the heat capacity of the absorber plate MpCp


is considered for
simple analysis. Furthermore, one can also see the effect of the heat capacity of the
absorber plate on the performance of a conventional nonporous solar air heater.
In view of the above, the transient analysis [3] of the conﬁguration shown in
Fig. 9.6 is performed.
In Fig. 9.6, an air gap with an air conductance of ‘C’ is introduced by inserting a
reﬂecting sheet in between the absorber plate and the insulation. The inclusion of a
Fig. 9.6 Schematic view of

reﬂection sheet and an air gap reduces the overall bottom heat loss unlike shown
Fig. 9.3a. However, analysis for conventional nonporous solar air heater air without
an air gap and reﬂecting sheet can be considered as a special case similar to the
earlier case.

9.4
Double-Exposure Solar Air Heaters
The conventional nonporous solar air heater (Sect. 9.3) is also known as a
“single-exposure air heater” due to fact that one side of blackened absorber plate is
open for solar radiation exposure, whereas the other (bottom) side is insulated.
A cross-sectional view of a double-exposure solar air heater is shown in Fig. 9.7. In
this case, there is passage of ﬂuid air between the two parallel blackened and glazed
metallic absorber plates exposed to solar radiation. The ﬂuid air stream in a
double-exposure solar air heater receives thermal energy/heat from both of the
9.3
Conventional Nonporous Solar Air Heaters

exposed absorber plates, thus forming the passage of ﬂuid air. The thermal efﬁ-
ciency of a double-exposure solar air heater, also nonporous, will certainly be
increased.
The double-exposure solar air heater can be studied according the similar pro-
cedure as performed in the case of the single-exposure solar air heater.
For an elemental area 0bdx0 of a double-exposure solar air heater, the energy

previously.

Solar Air Heater with Flow on Both Sides
of the Absorber
For a solar air heater with ﬂow on both sides of the absorber (Fig. 9.8), the contact
area between the absorber plate and the air stream is increased. For analysis of this
type of solar air heater, it is assumed that the mass-ﬂow rate and the heat-transfer
coefﬁcient (between absorber plate and air stream) in the upper and lower channels
are the same. The analysis, which was discussed in the previous subsection, can
easily be extended to study the thermal performance of this heater. Sodha et al. [4]
have analyzed this solar air heater. The analysis is very approximate because it does
not take into account the interaction of the cover and bottom plates with the air
stream. The radiation exchanges between the absorber plate and the cover, and
between the absorber plate and the bottom plate, have not been considered.
The steady-state heat-gain rate for the air stream can be written as follows [5]:
_qu ¼ hpf Tp  Tft


þ hpf Tp  Tfb


 hcf Tft  Tc
ð
Þ  hcf Tfb  Tb
ð
Þ
ð9:28Þ
where Tft is the air temperature in the top passage; and Tfb is the air temperature in
the bottom passage.
The energy-balance equations for the cover, the absorber plate, and the bottom
plate can be written. Furthermore, they are used to eliminate Tp; Tb; and Tc from
Eq. (9.22). The two air temperatures (one above the plate and another below the
plate) can be eliminated in the manner given below.
In general, the thermal loss from the top of absorber plate exceeds the heat loss
from the bottom of the absorber plate. As a result of this, air temperature in the rear
passage will be higher than in the top passage. The ﬂow rates are the same on both
sides. If Tf is the average of Tft and Tfb; then the deviations of Tft and Tfb from Tf
must be same. The deviations between the ﬂuid and the ambient-air temperatures
Fig. 9.8 Schematic view of a double-ﬂow solar air heater
9.5
Solar Air Heater with Flow on Both Sides of the Absorber

may also be used to indicate the deviations of Tft and Tfb from Tf: Therefore, a
fractional deviation ‘n’ is deﬁned as follows:
Tf  Ta
ð
Þ 1  n
ð
Þ ¼ Tft  Ta
ð
Þ
ð9:29Þ
and
Tf  Ta
ð
Þ 1 þ n
ð
Þ ¼ Tfb  Ta
ð
Þ
ð9:30Þ
These two equations can be used to express Tft and Tfb in terms of Tf:
Equation (9.22) can be expressed in terms of mean air temperature Tf:
On solving the equations, one can obtain the expressions for F0 and UL as
follows:
F0 ¼

It may be seen that although the method for calculating F0 and UL is the same,
the expressions become complicated due to the conﬁguration. Furthermore, the
value of UL changes with n: This indicates that neglecting the deviations of the top
and bottom temperatures from the average ﬂuid temperature may result in an
appreciable error in the value of UL [5].

Two-Pass Solar Air Heater
9.6.1
Nonporous Conventional Two-Pass Solar Air Heater
In this case, two types of ﬂow pattern, as shown in Fig. 9.9, are described: (i) air
ﬂows between two glass covers in the upper channel, and then it ﬂows in between
the absorber plate and the insulated plate in the lower channel; and (ii) air ﬂows in
between the glass cover and the absorber plate in the upper channel, and then it
ﬂows in between the absorber plate and the insulated plate in the lower channel.
The concept of the two-channel solar air heater was proposed by Satcunanathan
and Deonarine [6] and later studied by Caouris et al. [7]. Figure 9.9a shows the
conﬁguration of the air heater studied by Satcunanathan and Deonarine [6]. In this

type of solar air heater, air ﬂows between the glass cover, which reduces top heat
loss. Wijeysundera et al. [8] studied another conﬁguration of two-channel solar air
heater as shown in Fig. 9.9b. They developed the thermal modeling of a
two-channel solar air heater and determined the performance of these solar air
heaters with experimental validation. They have reported improvement in the solar
air heater by 10–15 % with this conﬁguration.

9.11 depict the hourly variation of thermal efﬁciency and outlet-air temperature
after solar noon for the single-channel and two-channel solar air heaters,
respectively.
The ﬁgures infer that the two-channel solar air heater yields 10–15 % improved
thermal efﬁciency compared with the single-channel solar air heater. The
enhancement in thermal efﬁciency is due to the modiﬁcation in the design of air
passage of the solar air heater with nominal additional material and construction
costs.

PVT Nonporous Conventional Two-Pass Solar Air
Heater [9]
A schematic diagram of a semitransparent PVT nonporous conventional two-pass
solar air heater/collector is shown in Fig. 9.12. In the PVT double-pass air collector,
the air duct is divided into two parts by inserting the semitransparent PV module in
the middle position in between the top glass cover and the blackened absorbing
plate. The upper and lower air ducts are connected in series at the closed end of the
solar air PVT collector. The upper and lower ducts are designed in such a way that
there is a uniform air ﬂow in both ducts. There is proper insulation on the sides and
at the bottom of the PVT solar air heater to minimize side and bottom-losses.

rate of thermal energy for a semitransparent PVT nonporous conventional two-pass
solar air heater/collector.
Results and discussions
The hourly variation of solar cell temperature and electrical efﬁciency for a typical
day is shown in Fig. 9.13. It shows that with the increase in solar-cell temperature,
solar-cell efﬁciency decreases; it becomes constant at a constant solar-cell

temperature; and at the end of the day it again increases due to a decrease in cell
temperature. This indicates the importance of solar-cell temperature. Based on this,
electrical power can be determined on both an hourly and daily basis, and it can be
extended to yearly electrical power.
The outlet-air temperature of single- and double-pass PVT air collectors for a
typical winter day are shown Fig. 9.14. The outlet-air temperature varies from 26.9
to 46.6 °C for a double-pass air collector and from 24.6 to 43.2 °C for a single-pass
air collector. It is seen that the outlet-air temperature of single-pass air collector is
approximately 3–4 °C lower than that of the double-pass air collector due to low
extraction of heat. These results show that the double-pass air collector has more
utility than the single-pass air collector.

Effect of Fin
9.7.1
Air Heater with Finned Absorber
The heat-transfer rate (and hence the thermal efﬁciency of the solar air heater) from
the ﬁxed area of the absorber plate to the air stream can be increased by increasing the
contact area between the air stream and the absorber plate. This can be achieved by
introducing ﬁns on the rear side of the absorber plate as shown in Fig. 9.1d. The
inclusion of ﬁnes causes an additional pressure drop across the solar air heater. The
number and design of additional ﬁns are limited to the additional power requirement
to run the fan for air circulation.
The thermal modeling of a solar air heater comprising additional ﬁns can be
developed by following similar approaches in convective heat-transfer problems.

However, the major constraint of this type of solar air heater is the unavailability of
correlations for convective heat-transfer coefﬁcients for various conﬁgurations of ﬁn
structures. Malik and Buelow [10] gave the correlation for the convective
heat-transfer coefﬁcient for a solar air heater used in solar crop-drying.
9.7.2
Air Heater with Vee-Corrugated Absorber
A Vee-corrugated absorber plate is shown in Fig. 9.15. Here the ﬂat-plate absorber
is replaced by a vee–corrugated absorber plate, which enhances the contact area in
between the absorber plate and the air stream ﬂowing inside the air duct. The
increased surface area of the absorber plate also increases the loss from the absorber
plate to the top cover, but this loss is overcome by the enhanced heat transfer from
the absorber plate to the air stream inside the air duct.
The acceptance angle for the vee-groove must be optimized in such a way that it
compensates for the loss of solar radiation due to multiple reﬂections to the gain

because of the increased heat transfer and improved efﬁciency. It should be properly
designed. Inclusion of a vee–corrugated absorber plate increases the effective
emissivity. The vee–corrugated absorber plate with selective coating and a 55°
acceptance angle is suggested for this type of solar air heater.
Hollands [11] extensively analyzed the optical properties—such as absorptance,
emittance, and directional selectivity—of the Vee-grooved specular surfaces.
A vee–corrugated absorber plate solar air heater may be designed for a
single-pass as well as for a double-pass air ﬂow through the upper and lower ducts.
This type of solar air heater has the same values of collector thermal-efﬁciency
factor F0
ð
Þ and overall heat-loss coefﬁcient UL
ð
Þ as that of a ﬂat-plate absorber solar
air heater. The only difference is the improved value of the convective heat-transfer
coefﬁcient hpf from the absorbing plate to the air stream [5].
When vee-grooves are extended to touch the bottom of the absorber plate, they
form a triangular air duct as shown in Fig. 9.15b. The drawback of this type of solar
air heater is that it resists the air ﬂow through itself.
The triangular ducts are made of solid materials with high thermal conductivity.
High thermal conduction provides a uniform temperature within the triangular duct.
The lower temperature difference around the duct allows for neglecting the radiative
heat transfer. The energy-balance for this type of solar air heater is written as
follows (UL is sum of the top and bottom overall heat-transfer coefﬁcients):

Reverse-Absorber Air Heater
A nonporous conventional air heater/collector can provide hot air at a temperature
of 15–30 °C above the ambient temperature. Furthermore, the rise in temperature
say ﬃ100 C
ð
Þ can be obtained by reducing the convective and radiative top-heat
losses from the absorber to the ambient air through the top glass cover. This is
feasible in a new type of solar air collector known as a “reverse-absorber ﬂat-plate
collector” (RAFPC). It can collect solar energy at a high temperature of 200 C. The
working principle, energy-balance, and performance of RAFPC will be discussed in
the following sections.
9.8.1
Working Principle
The schematic view of a reverse absorber ﬂat-plate collector (RAFPC) is shown in
Fig. 9.16 (a). Solar radiation is reﬂected by the polished curved cylindrical surface
qN sIðtÞ

g after transmission from the glass cover
sIðtÞ
f
g toward the glazed
reverse-absorber plate. After absorption, the absorber plate emits long-wavelength
radiation. The long-wavelength radiation is then trapped between the absorber plate
and the glazed cover. In this case, the convection and radiation heat losses are
suppressed due to the hot absorber plate facing downward. An insulation thickness
above the absorber plate reduces the top-heat loss due to conduction unlike the
nonporous conventional air heater/collector. There is an air gap between absorber
plate and the insulation to allow the air to ﬂow above the absorber. The air passing
above the absorber is heated. The aperture area of the RAFPC collector is equal to
the absorber plate area. The concentration ratio is 1. other conﬁgurations of the
RAFPC are shown in Fig. 9.16b–e.

Chandra et al. [12] compared the performance of a normal ﬂat-plate collector
(NFPC) with that of a reverse-absorber ﬂat-plate collector (RAFPC) a for
single-pass and double-pass solar air heating system. They concluded that the
outlet-air temperature for the RAFPC is higher than that for the outlet-air temper-
ature of an NFPC.

Solar Air Heaters with Porous Absorbers
Porous absorber increases the contact area between the absorber material and the air
ﬂowing through solar air heater. A higher contact area ensures higher heat exchange
between the absorber material and the air; hence, the high temperature of the air.
Therefore,
these
porous
absorbers
are
most
suited
for
high-temperature
applications.
Generally blackened porous matrix with different structures, namely, honey-
comb absorber, slit, expanded metal, and wire mesh, are used as the absorber in
these solar air heaters.
9.9.1
Matrix Solar Air Heaters
Figure 9.19 shows a schematic view of a solar air heater that uses a porous matrix
as the absorber. The degree of porosity and wire mess size is optimized per the
end-use requirement of a particular solar air heater. Long-wavelength thermal
radiation losses can be minimized by selectively coating the top surface of the
absorber matrix. The upper surface of the porous absorber acts as a set of black
cavities, which guarantee higher absorptivity. A different arrangement of air ﬂow
can be adopted for the heat-exchange mechanism between the air and the porous
matrix as shown in Fig. 9.19. However, the arrangement depicted in Fig. 9.19b
reduces the overall top-loss because the inlet cold air is always in contact with the
cover of the solar air heater.
For a loosely packed porous matrix of semitransparent material, solar radiation is
absorbed throughout the depth of the porous matrix; however, for the compact
matrix the incident solar radiations are mostly absorbed by the upper surface of the
porous absorber. Thermal analysis of this type of solar air heater is performed with
the following assumptions:
(i)
Thermo-physical and transport properties of the porous absorber do not
change with the temperature over the entire collector area.
(ii)
The ﬂow of air stream and heat transfer is assumed to be one-dimensional
and perpendicular to the bounding surfaces of the porous matrix.
(iii)
It is assumed that there is no temperature gradient between the absorber
matrix pores and the ﬂowing air at any position inside the solar air heater.
(iv)
Radiation and convection losses from the sides and bottom of the solar air
heater have been neglected.
The cost of these solar air heaters is strongly affected by the choice of matrix
absorber material. To minimize the cost of the porous absorber, the use of screen
doors, expanded metals, and black nylon in solar air heaters is avoided. Less costly

materials—such as bronze, aluminum, stainless steel, and carbon steel—are pre-
ferred. Rusting of carbon steel is a major issue that limits the use of carbon steel in
these solar air heaters. Blackened ﬁberglass insulation (FI) and dust ﬁlters can also
be used as a porous matrix absorber.
9.9.2
Overlapped Glass-Plate Solar Air Heaters
A schematic diagram of an overlapped glass-plate solar air heater is shown in
Fig. 9.20. This solar air heater comprises an overlapped set of glass plates. The
overlapped portion of subsequent glass plates are painted black and the rest of the
plate is left transparent. Solar radiation transmitted from the transparent portion of
the glass plates falls on the blackened portion of lower glass plate and gets
absorbed. This set of overlapped glass plates is covered by a glass cover on the top
side, whereas the bottom side is insulated to reduce heat losses from the bottom
side. This complete assemble is encased in a metal-sheet box. Solar radiation falling
on the blackened portion of the glass plates are absorbed by the glass plates and
thus heat them. The air ﬂowing on either side of the glass plates receives thermal
energy from the hot glass plates and thus becomes heated.
These solar air heaters provide a low pressure decrease and have high thermal
efﬁciency for applications involving low and moderate temperatures. The require-
ment of a large area of glass plates make these solar air heaters costly. Parametric
studies [1] have inferred that thermal efﬁciency is marginally affected by the
variation of spacing between the plates and the use of multiple plates. The optimum
glass thickness is approximately 3 mm, and the optimum spacing between the
plates varies between 5 and 7 mm.

9.9.3
Solar Air Heater with Honeycomb Absorber
The use of honeycomb structures between the glass cover and the absorber plate is
an established means of decreasing reduce top convective losses. A solar air heater
can also be made by passing air through a honeycomb structure as shown in
Fig. 9.21.
The honeycomb should be transparent. Different structure, e.g., hexagonal or
rectangular, of honeycomb can be chosen per the desired requirement (Fig. 9.21).
The convective and radiative heat losses from the absorber to the top glass cover
can be reduced by adopting a porous matrix material for the honeycomb structure.
Elaborated studies on honeycomb structure for use in solar air heater by Buchberg
et al. [13] showed that reﬂecting walls coated with a thin lacquer ﬁlm give a better
performance compared with noncoated walls in solar air heaters.

Testing of a Solar Air Collector
A schematic view of a test facility developed at the University of Waterloo for
testing solar air heaters is given in Fig. 9.22. The solar air collectors are tested at
two different mass-ﬂow rates viz. 7.5 and 10 L/m2. The solar intensity IðtÞ
½
 for the
duration of testing is measured using a pyranometer mounted at the top of the solar
air collector. The inlet air can be fed at the ambient temperature or at any other
constant temperature. For constant inlet-air temperature, the inlet air is passed
through a 2 kW‒capacity thermostatically controlled electric heater.
The inlet air at constant temperature from the outlet of the electric heater is then
fed to the solar air collector. Finally the hot air is passed through mixer duct—
calibrated temperature—and ﬂow rate‒measuring devices.
The instantaneous thermal efﬁciency, gi; can be calculated by using the fol-
lowing expression:

for two different mass-ﬂow rates is shown in

a better performance at a higher ﬂow rate because of relatively low thermal losses.

Performance of an Air Collector Versus
that of a Liquid Collector
The characteristics curve for the ﬂat-plate collector using liquid as a thermal energy
carrier is also plotted in Fig. 9.23 for the purpose of comparison. Thermal per-
formance in the case of a liquid collector is better than that of solar air collector,
which can be credited to the high speciﬁc heat capacity of liquid. It can also be
inferred from the ﬁgure that the air ﬂow rate signiﬁcantly affects the performance of
the solar air heater, but at higher solar intensities a lesser inﬂuence of the ﬂow rate is
observed.
9.11
Parametric Studies
9.11.1
Effect of Air Leakage
Air leakage either from inside the solar air collector to the outside environment or
within the solar air collector (i.e., between different ﬂow channels at different
temperatures) deteriorates the thermal performance of a solar air heater. The air
leakage may occur due to various reasons viz. poor design and manufacturing,
corrosion, vibrations and settlement, thermal expansion or contraction due to
temperature variations, and poor handling of the solar air heater. Because the
problem of air leakage cannot be solved completely, a small air leakage is generally
ignored.
The instantaneous thermal efﬁciency is directly proportional to the mass-ﬂow
rate of air inside the solar air heater. For the same temperature difference in outlet
and inlet air, the mass-ﬂow rate measured at the inlet and outlet of the solar air
heater will be different due to the small air leakage, which is ignored. The

mass-ﬂow rate at the inlet will be higher than that at the outlet. Suppose mass-ﬂow
rates measured at inlet and outlet of the solar air collectors are
_mfi and
_mfo: respectively.
For mass-ﬂow rate measured at inlet the instantaneous thermal efﬁciency is
given as follows:

The air-leakage ﬂow rate is given as follows:
_mL ¼ _mfi  _mfo

The ratio of thermal efﬁciency with leakage to the thermal efﬁciency without
leakage can be found using Eqs. (9.46) and (9.45) and is given as follows:

The above equation concludes that for no leakage, both of the efﬁciencies will be
same. However, for a leakage, the leakage mass-ﬂow rate ( _mL) will be greater than
zero. Therefore, in case of leakage the instantaneous thermal efﬁciency is lower
than that without leakage.
9.11.2
Effect of Particulate
Dust and the particulates in the air stream ﬂowing through the solar air heater
depreciate its performance. Dust and particulates are deposited on the inner walls of
the air duct, which causes scaling on the inner surfaces of the duct. Due to the
scaling effect, the rate of heat transfer decreases. Smaller particulates are deposited
in the case of a laminar-ﬂow condition due to molecular diffusion. Larger-size
particulates, for example, ﬁbrous dust, creates resistance to the air stream ﬂowing
inside the air duct. The denser particles present in the air stream are not in phase
with the air ﬂow inside the duct and are mainly deposited at the curved locations
inside the duct.

The problem of particulate deposition can be overcome by using ﬁlters at the
inlet of the solar air heater and designing the air duct with as minimum a number of
bends as possible.

Solar House
Abstract The thermal comfort inside solar houses can be met by using various
concepts of cooling and heating technology by proper design of a building, which is
known as a “passive house.” In this case, a signiﬁcant amount of high-grade energy
of fossil fuel can be saved from an ecological and climatic point of view.
Solar-passive heating of a building is more economical then solar-passive cooling.

Introduction
Each house on planet Earth is a solar house. In the modern days of building
architecture, a solar house is an important concept that incorporates the motion of
the Sun, the location of the building (latitude), climatic conditions, and locally
available materials required for building construction. The concept of the solar
house also includes the strong correlation between immensely available renewable
sources of energy and building design. It ensures the use of naturally occurring
sources as much as possible for the design and construction of the building as well
as the day lighting and thermal comfort of the building. The solar house is not an
entirely new concept. Socrates (400 B.C.) made a statement: “Now in houses with
south aspect, the Sun’s rays penetrate into porticos in winter, but in summer
the path of the Sun is right over our heads and above the roof. If then, this is
the best arrangement one should build the south side loftier to keep out the
cold winds, reﬂects this.” Ancient Iranian architecture used the following concepts.
(a) Clustering of thick wall: Clustering means decreasing the ratio of surface
area to volume to reduce the thermal load of the building and the thick walls,
which means there is large thermal storage capacity to reduce temperature
ﬂuctuations

Energy Systems in Electrical Engineering, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-0807-8_10
417

(b) Plantations: Plantation provide shading on the building to reduce the solar
ﬂux incident on the building. During extreme heat, one can live in the
basement.
(c) Wind towers: A wind tower makes the building comfortable in the summer
due to cooling by the Earth and water evaporation.
The concept of clustering and mass walls was also used in medieval India.
American Indians used passive solar techniques as long ago as 1100 A.D. However,
the ﬁrst scientiﬁc application of solar energy for the heating of a house with a
blackened and glazed south wall was started in 1881 [1]. This concept, which is
now referred to as a “passive concept,” was granted a patent. This concept was not
implemented for a long time until 1972. Trombe [2, 3] re-patented the concept and
successfully applied it. Later on this concept of a blackened and glazed thick south
wall was referred as a “Trombe wall.”
However, in recent past years, people have chosen to abandon these
long-standing considerations. They are increasingly relying on mechanical control
of the indoor environment rather than exploiting climatic and other natural pro-
cesses to satisfy their necessities. Such a system is referred as an “active system.”
As a result, even a minor power or equipment failure can make these buildings
uninhabitable (i.e., uncomfortable). Furthermore, with the advent of the energy
crisis in 1973, the effective use of renewable energy resources has become the basis
for the design and planning of buildings. Now more emphasis is given to passive
concepts for solar heating and cooling systems due to the energy availability in the
immediate environment. It is simple in concept and requires little or no mainte-
nance. Solar passive heating and cooling systems do not require any external source
of energy. These systems also do not generate thermal pollution and produce no
waste. Because these systems use energy resources available on site, transportation
and distribution networks of conventional energy (i.e., nonrenewable energy) are
eliminated.
There is strong need to add various passive solar concepts in the design of a
building. An active solar heating/cooling system based on conventional energy is
independent of the building architecture. It is difﬁcult to include any passive con-
cepts in a building designed based on active concepts. Thus, information regarding
various passive concepts/systems must lead to a necessary degree of accuracy at
each stage of building design. A judicious application of passive solar concepts
provides thermal comfort in an economical way. Such thermal comfort is based on
the following parameters:
(i)
Oxygen
(ii)
Water
(iii)
Air temperature
(iv)
Relative humidity
The thermal comfort chart, as shown in Fig. 10.1a, lists various factors
inﬂuencing living thermal comfort.
418

Solar House

The thermal comfort factors have been divided into three categories:
(a) Physical condition: The primary and dominant factors are air temperature,
mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, air movement, etc.
(b) Physiological condition: In this case, the additional factors are age, sex, and
nutrition, etc.
(c) Intermediate condition: Here clothing and activity level are the dominant
factors.

Introduction
419

There can also be some additional factors such as secondary and imaginary
factors. Similar to the physiological conditions, all of the factors are additional
factors; in intermediate conditions, occupancy, adaptation, and acclimatization are
additional factors.
10.2
Physical Parameters
10.2.1
Air Temperature
There are basically two temperatures:
(a) Wet-bulb temperature (WBT): This is a temperature at which the vapour
pressure of air is equal to the saturation pressure.
(b) Dry-bulb temperature (DBT): This is the temperature of the air at atmo-
spheric pressure, and it is measured by an ordinary thermometer. Dry-bulb
temperature is always higher than wet-bulb temperature. It is dry-bulb tem-
perature that is generally used to gauge thermal comfort.
The recommended dry-bulb temperature for thermal comfort for summer and
winter are 25  1
ð
Þ and 20  1
ð
Þ C, respectively.
10.2.2
Relative Humidity
This is related to moist air. Moist air is a mix of dry air and water vapour. It can be
deﬁned as follows:
Moist air ¼ dry air fixed part
ð
Þ þ water vapour variable part
ð
Þ
If the absorption of water reaches its maximum value in a given volume of dry air,
then it is referred to as “saturated air.”
Humidity or speciﬁc humidity ðxÞ: This is deﬁned as the ratio of water vapour
mass ðmvÞ to dry air mass ðmaÞ in a given volume of moist air (mixture of dry air
and water vapour). It is given by
x ¼ mv
ma
ð10:1Þ
The above equation shows that the numerical value of the humidity ratio or the
speciﬁc humidity (ω) is always >1. The ratio of actual speciﬁc humidity to the
speciﬁc humidity of saturated air at a given temperature is referred to as the “degree
of saturation.”
420
10
Solar House

The relative humidity ðcÞ is the ratio of mass of the water vapour mv
ð
Þ in a given
volume of moist air at a given temperature to the mass of water vapour ms
ð
Þ in the
same volume of saturated air at the same temperature. It is expressed as
c ¼ mv
ms
ð10:2Þ
For thermal comfort, the recommended value of the relative humidity c
ð Þ for
both summer and winter condition is
50  5
ð
Þ %. Its numerical value is always
<100 %.
Figure 10.1b shows the variation of humidity ratio (speciﬁc humidity) with
dry-bulb temperature for different relative humidities at atmospheric pressure. It is
also known as a “psychometric chart.”
10.2.3
Air Movement
The temperature of the body is constant between 36.9 and 37:2 C. A body tem-
perature >40 C may be fatal. The thermal-comfort air temperature for a human
being is approximately 20–25 °C for winter and summer, respectively. If air ﬂows
over a human body with a certain movement, there will be respiration (heat transfer)
from the body to the environment. As the air movement over the body increases, the
level of comfort increases. This is true only when the air temperature of the sur-
roundings is lower than the body temperature. An increase of air movement over
the body helps in the increase of heat transfer (respiration). The recommended value
of air movement is approximately 0.2–0.4 m/s in winter and summer, respectively.
This condition is obtained inside the room by operating a ceiling/table fan during
the summer.
10.2.4
Mean Radiant Temperature
The body of loses heat by radiation (R), by convection (C), and by evaporation
(E) (respiration) to the surroundings. The total heat loss (Q) from the body is given
by
Q ¼ ðR þ CÞ þ E
ð10:3aÞ
where R and C are sensible heat loss QS
ð
Þ; and E is latent heat loss QL
ð
Þ.
Sensible heat loss
QS
ð
Þ mainly depends on the temperature difference
DT
ð
Þ
between the surface of the body and the surrounding air. Latent heat loss
QL
ð
Þ
depends on the difference in water-vapour pressure.
10.2
Physical Parameters
421

The heat transfer between humans and the environment can be expressed as
follows:
M  W ¼ Q þ S
ð10:3bÞ
where M is the metabolic rate; W is the work performed by a human; and S is the
rate of heat storage.
In summer, body temperature increases due to the storage of energy (with
S being positive). In such a situation, the blood ﬂow rate increases through the
extremities, and this is known as “vasodilation.” In winter, the temperature of body
tends to decrease (with S being negative), and hence the blood ﬂow decreases,
which causes shivering.
The rate of heat released by the human body given the surrounding temperature
is shown in Fig. 10.1c.
Here the surrounding air temperature refers to the mean radiant temperature
(MRT). This is the area-weighted average temperature of surfaces and can be
deﬁned as follows:
MRT ¼
P
i TiAi
P
i Ai
ð10:4Þ
where, Ti and Ai are the temperature and the respective area of the different surfaces
of the living space, respectively.
10.2.5
Air Pressure
It is well known that a person feels more comfortable at atmospheric pressure. At
higher altitudes, pressure is reduced and the person feels discomfort. This is due
high pressure within the body.
10.2.6
Air Components
Each person requires 0:65 m3=h of oxygen (O2) under normal conditions. He or she
produces 0:2 m3=h of carbon-dioxide (CO2). The human body requires at least this
rate of oxygen for survival. It is also required to sustain the action of O2 inside as
well outside of the building. In open conditions this requirement is fulﬁlled by
plants, which release oxygen to maintain the level of oxygen in the environment.
Carbon dioxide, which is released by the human being, is consumed by plants to
balance the ecosystem. However, the optimum levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide
should also be maintained inside the building by either passive or active modes. To
maintain this level, there should be provision of a roof vent (roshandan), ventilator,
422
10
Solar House

exhaust fan, etc. in the building. In such a way, there is direct contact between the
environment and the living space of the building.
10.2.7
Air Electricity
A person feels shock when a thin layer of air passes over the skin. This can be felt
while rubbing the skin in the presence of thin layer of air. This is due to friction
between the thin air layer and the skin.
10.2.8
Acoustics
A person feels more comfortable in effective working conditions up to maximum
sound level of 120 db 0:01 W/m2


in a living space. An average person can hear
frequencies from 20 to 16,000 Hz. Unwanted sound creates a sense of irritation in a
living space. It is termed “noise pollution.”
10.2.9
Day Lighting
In the absence of natural lighting, artiﬁcial lighting is created by using electrical
appliances such as an electric bulb, lamp, tube light, etc., in a building. By using an
electric bulb, the thermal heat gain in a building is signiﬁcant. In an electric lamp,
only a fraction of the electrical energy is converted into light energy. The heating
effect of day lighting of an electric lamp is 1 W per lumen.
10.3
Physiological Parameters
10.3.1
Nutritional Intake
Human comfort is inﬂuenced by physiological factors. It is determined by the rate
of heat generated inside body and the rate of heat dissipated to the environment.
The rate of heat produced by the human body is known as the “metabolic rate.”
A healthy person during sleep produces heat at the rate of 60 W
 35 W/m2


;
during hard work it can increase to 600 W  350 W/m2


.
It is well known that a person requires optimum nutritional intake. This depends
on the composition of the body, which varies from person to person and from
season to season. For example, nutritional intake (healthy food) for a person
becomes greater during winter and it less during summer. Due to this, a person feels
10.2
Physical Parameters
423

more thermal comfort during the winter period after taking in higher-calorie food
compared with summer.
10.3.2
Age
A person feels more cold in winter and warm in summer at an older age. This is due
to following facts:
(i)
the decrease of metabolic rate (the rate of heat generated within the body);
(ii)
the change in food habits;
(iii)
the decrease in nutritional intake; and
(iv)
the change in activity level, etc.
10.3.3
Ethnic Inﬂuences
This deals with lifestyle of people living in a particular climatic condition. This
includes food habits and clothing, etc.
10.3.4
Sex
Females produce more heat due energy generated within body compared with
males. Hence, they feel more comfortable in cold climates.
10.3.5
Constitution
This refers to the physical constitution of an individual. It is well known that a weak
person feels colder during winter than a healthy one and vice versa during the
summer.
10.4
Intermediate Parameters
10.4.1
Clothing
Clothing intervenes with air movement across the skin. As a result, clothing
decreases the potential of heat transfer [conduction, convection, and evaporation
424
10
Solar House

(respiration)] from the body to the room air. The colour of the clothing is also
important.
For example:
(i)
In the desert, thin, loose-ﬁtting, and light-colored clothing is more suitable.
This gives lower absorption of solar radiation and heat transfer from the
outside to the skin. It provides air movement across skin the due to the loose
ﬁt.
(ii)
In hot and humid climates, loose, light-colored, and porous clothing is more
suitable. Due to the porosity of the cloth, fast heat transfer takes place from
skin to the air.
(iii)
In cold climates, dark-colored, thick, and tight-ﬁtting clothing is more suit-
able for higher absorption of solar radiation and minimum heat transfer from
skin to the air.
10.4.2
Activity Level
As mentioned previously, the rate of heat transfer (dissipation) by a person depends
on his or her activity. It varies from 60 W  35 W/m2



Hence, the human body can be considered as a heat engine converting thermal
energy (metabolic rate) into mechanical energy with an efﬁciency of 20%.
A person’s body dissipates energy at a rate of 335 KJ/h. To provide thermal
comfort, the heat generated by a person can be removed by providing a ventilator in
the room.

Adaption and Acclimatisation
This means that a person should ﬁrst become accustomed to an artiﬁcial climate
before he or she starts living in harsh climatic conditions.
10.4.4
Time of the Day/Season
The recommended thermal-comfort air temperature is 20 C. It is known that
ambient air temperature changes with the following:
(i) time of the day (due to changes in the level of solar intensity (insolation) with
time); and
(ii) month of the year (from season to season).
10.4
Intermediate Parameters
425

For example, in a northern climatic condition there is variation of ambient air
temperature from 5 to 15 C in winter and from 30 to 45 C in summer.
Therefore, the requirement of heating/cooling load depends on the time of
day/season.
10.4.5
Occupancy
We know that a person can produce heat due to energy generated within the body
(Sect. 10.4.2). For a given volume of an enclosed space, the total amount of heat
produced increase depending on the number of people. This leads to an increase in
the room air temperature, which affects the living as well working conditions.
10.4.6
Psychological Factors
Most of the time, by maintaining the levels of peak winter and summer conditions
in a group, people feel comfortable by sharing their thoughts with others. This gives
pleasure to the individual talking in a group due to psychological factors.

World Climatic Zone
The whole world can be divided into six climatic zones for the simpliﬁcation of
analysis in the solar energy system. The criterion for classiﬁcation of these climatic
zones is given in Table 10.1.

The heating/cooling requirement of a building can be determined if the solair
temperature, deﬁned below, is known.
10.6
Solair Temperature
There are three treatments of horizontal surfaces for various applications of heating
and cooling of a building. Hence, there is need to deﬁne the solair temperature for
all three cases: bare horizontal surface, wetted horizontal surface, and blackened
and glazed horizontal surface.
10.6.1
Horizontal Bare Surface
Let us consider a horizontal surface that is exposed to solar radiation and an
ambient air temperature with a wind velocity of V in m/s as shown in Fig. 10.2a.
The energy balance for an exposed horizontal surface can be written as:
For a bare surface
Referring to Fig. 10.2a, the energy balance at x ¼ 0 can be written as:
aI tð Þ ¼ K@T

where a and e are the absorptivity and emissivity of the surface, respectively; K is
the thermal conductivity; and DR ¼ 60 W=m2 Eq. (3.34d). The value of DR is zero
for a vertical wall.
Equation (10.5) can be rewritten as follows:

respectively. Furthermore, ho can also be considered as a combined convective and
radiative heat-transfer coefﬁcient and is given as 5:7 þ 3:8 V, Eq. (3.29a).

Equation (10.7a) is known as the “solair temperature” for a bare horizontal
surface. It can be deﬁned as follows:
“The solair temperature is an effective ambient air temperature that
includes the effect of solar and long-wavelength exchange radiation between
the ambient air and the sky for a horizontal surface.”
Furthermore, Eq. (10.7a) can be discussed for the following cases:
Case (i): For
a
ho I tð Þ  eDR
ho  0 or aIðtÞ  eDR  0, the solair temperature Tsa
ð
Þ is
greater than the ambient air temperature Ta

Þ. In this case, heating is possible by
solar energy from a horizontal roof surface.
Case (ii): For a
ho I tð Þ  eDR
ho  0 or aIðtÞ  eDR  0, the solair temperature Tsa
ð
Þ is
less than the ambient air temperature Ta
ð
Þ, i.e., Tsa\Ta. In this case, cooling is
possible by solar energy from a horizontal roof surface.
Case (iii): For a
ho I tð Þ  eDR
ho ¼ 0 or aIðtÞ  eDR ¼ 0, the solair temperature Tsa
ð
Þ is
equal to the ambient air temperature Ta
ð
Þ. In this case, neither heating nor cooling is
possible by solar energy from a horizontal surface.
For vertical surface, eDR ¼ 0, the expression for solair temperature is given by
Tsa ¼ a
ho
I tð Þ þ Ta
ð10:7bÞ
In this case, only heating of a room is possible through a vertical wall for
I tð Þ [ 0:
Under steady-state conditions, the rate of heat available at x ¼ 0 will be same as
the rate of heat available at x ¼ L, and hence it will be transferred by conduction
and can be written as
_q ¼ K

This rate of heat is further transferred from x ¼ L to the living space by con-
vection and radiation, and it can be expressed by

Equation (10.11) offers the rate of thermal energy that is being transferred during
sunshine hours from an exposed horizontal surface to the living space kept at
constant temperature Tb, which is known as an “air-conditioned condition” under
steady-state conditions.
Equation (10.11) will be negative for case (ii) of Eq. (10.7a), i.e., Tsa\Ta. This
means that only a horizontal bare surface can be used for cooling when it is exposed
to direct sky conditions during either a low-intensity period or during night hours.
In this case, reverse heat ﬂow will take place.
The total energy gain for case (i), i.e., Tsa [ Ta through a horizontal roof per m2
in terms of Joule during sunshine hours, tT, can be obtained as

10.6.2
Horizontal Wetted Surface
For this, a water ﬁlm is maintained on a horizontal surface as shown in Fig. 10.2b.
In this case, there will be mass transfer (evaporation) from the exposed surface to
the ambient air in addition to convection and radiation heat transfer; hence,
Eq. (10.5) is modiﬁed as follows:

where h1 ¼ hra þ hea þ hca and hea ¼ hew
ð
Þ is given by Eq. (3.52). Furthermore, Eq.
(10.16) is similar to Eq. (10.7a). However, the value of Tsa in the case of a wetted
surface will be lower due to the higher value of h1 compared with ho of a bare
surface.
Furthermore, Eq. (10.16) can be further discussed for the following limiting
cases:
Case (i): For a
h1 I tð Þ  eDR
h1  0 or aIðtÞ  eDR  0, the solair temperature Tsa
ð
Þ is
greater than the ambient air temperature Ta
ð
Þ. However, the values of Tsa in the case
of a wetted surface will be lower compared with a bare surface; hence, in this case
the heating level will be reduced.
Case (ii): For a
h1 I tð Þ  eDR
h1  0 or aIðtÞ  eDR  0, the solair temperature Tsa
ð
Þ is
less than the ambient air temperature Ta
ð
Þ i.e., Tsa\Ta. In this case, the cooling
level will be increased with a wetted surface.
Case (iii): For a
h1 I tð Þ  eDR
h1 ¼ 0 or aIðtÞ  eDR ¼ 0, the solair temperature Tsa
ð
Þ is
equal to the ambient air temperature Ta
ð
Þ. In this case, the heating level will be
reduced, whereas the cooling level is increased by solar energy from the horizontal
wetted surface.
Also, in the case of a wetted surface, an expressions for the rate of heat con-
ducted from x ¼ 0 to x ¼ L by conduction and the rate of heat convected and
radiated from x ¼ L to the living space Tb

Þ under steady-state conditions will be

According to Eqs. (10.10a–10.10c), an expression for the rate of heat transfer

For a blacked/glazed surface, the top of the bare surface is painted black, and the
glass cover is placed on it at a proper distance as shown in Fig. 10.2c. In this case,

ð
Þ by the blackened
surface. After absorption, there will be a rate of heat transfer from the blackened
surface to the ambient air through the glass cover, and the rest is transferred by

The above-derived equation can be used to determine the rate of thermal energy gain
for thermal heating of a building during the daytime.
10.7
Thermal Gain
To understand and analyse passive heating systems, there are three basic concepts to
know: direct gain, indirect gain, and isolated gain. These are explained as follows.
10.7.1
Direct Gain
For direct gain, sunlight is admitted/transmitted through a glass window or a wall
facing south (north for the southern hemisphere) to heat up the inside walls, ﬂoors,
and objects (and, consequently, the air) in the room as shown in Fig. 10.3.
In this approach, the space becomes (i) a live-in solar collector, (ii) a heat-storage
system; and (iii) a distribution system. Direct-gain systems are continuously working
because they collect and use every bit of direct or diffuse radiation that passes
through the glazing. To avoid overheating during the day and cooling at night, the
ﬂoor and walls must be constructed of materials capable of storing heat for use
during the night. The most commonly used materials for heat storage are masonry
and water. Double-glazing is used to reduce the heat losses from the room to the
outside air. The windows are covered by insulation at night for the same purpose.
The rate of net useful thermal energy gain into a room is given by
_q ¼ sI tð Þ  Ut Tb  Ta

where s is the transmissivity of a glass window/wall; Ut is the overall heat-transfer
coefﬁcient from the living room to the ambient air through the glass cover; Tb is the
base or reference temperature in the building; and Ta is the ambient air temperature.
Equation (10.20) can be written as
_q ¼ Ut

ð10:21Þ
where Tsa ¼ s
Ut I tð Þ þ Ta, which is the solair temperature of the glazed window and
walls. The expression for Ut is given by Eq. (10.18a).
Equation (10.20) can also be used to determine the total net energy gain during
sunshine hours (tT is the total sunshine hours). This can be obtained as follows:

During off-sunshine hours/low-sunshine hours, the glazed window/walls are

from the enclosed space to the outside ambient air. In this case, the net daily loss
can be calculated as follows:

10.7.2
Indirect Gain
In case of indirect gain, solar radiation ﬁrst strikes a thermal mass located between
the Sun and the living space. The solar radiation is ﬁrst absorbed by the surface of
the thermal mass. It is converted into thermal energy and then transferred into the
living space. The advantage of indirect gain over direct gain is that a more uniform
room-air temperature is achieved. The two basic indirect gain systems are (i) ther-
mal storage walls generally known as “Trombe walls” and (ii) roof ponds.
The details of thermal storage walls/roof and roof ponds are discussed below
under steady-state conditions.
(a) Thermal storage walls/roof
Both walls and roof can be used, but a south-facing wall is preferred to the roof
because of the abundance of solar radiation on the south wall in winter and the
difﬁculty of supporting a heavy roof. A thermal storage wall absorbs the Sun’s
radiation on its outer surface and then transfers this heat into the building through
conduction. A thermal storage wall may be either masonry or water.
(i) Simple glazed wall (Trombe wall without vents): To increase absorption, the
outer surface of a Trombe wall is painted black and glazed as shown in
Fig. 10.4.

Thermal Gain
437

For a simple glazed wall of thickness L and thermal conductivity K, the heat ﬂux
available at the exposed surface for conduction into the inside room maintained at a
temperature, Tb, can be written as
_q ¼ asI tð Þ  Ut Tjx¼0Ta


ð10:26Þ
where Ut is an overall heat-loss coefﬁcient from the outer surface of the wall to the
ambient air through the glazing. Under steady-state conditions, the amount of heat
ﬂux conducted and subsequently convected and radiated into the space remains the
same as Eq. (10.19).
Example 10.3 Calculate the rate of heat ﬂow through a south-facing concrete wall
for the following parameters: (i) mean incident solar radiation ¼ 250 W/m2,
(ii) ambient air temperature = 13 °C, (iii) wall thickness ¼ 30 cm, (iv) wall of
thermal conductivity ¼ 0:72 W/mC, (iv) mean room temperature ¼ 20 C,
hc ¼ 8:7 W/m2 C, hr ¼ 3:8 W/m2 C, a ¼ 0:6, V ¼ 1 m/s, and hi ¼ 8 W/m2 C.
Solution
Here, consider that ho ¼ hc þ hr ¼ ð8:7 þ 3:8Þ ¼ 12:5 W/m2 C. The U value
should be calculated as
1
U ¼
1
8:7 þ 3:8 þ 0:30
0:72 þ 1
8 ¼ 0:622
or,
U ¼ 1:609 W/m2 C
From Eq. (10.7a), we have
Tsa ¼ 0:6 
 250
12:5
þ 13 ¼ 25 C
Here we have R ¼ 0 for the south wall.
The rate of heat ﬂow can be obtained from Eq. (10.11) as
_q ¼ 1:609 
 25  20
ð
Þ ¼ 8:045 W/m2
The positive sign indicates that heat is gained from the environment to the living
space. Heat must be removed from the living space at the above rate to maintain the
space at 20 C.

Solar House

The same example, if performed with an ambient air temperature of 5 C, gives,
Tsa ¼ 0:6

12:5
þ 5 ¼ 17 C
and
_q ¼ 1:609 
 17  20
ð
Þ ¼ 4:827 W/m2
This indicates that heat must be added to the living space at this rate to maintain
the space at 20 C.
Example 10.4 Determine the net heat ﬂux into the room if the south wall
(Example 10.3) is covered with a 4 cm—thick movable night insulation (NI) with
K ¼ 0:025 W/m C.
Solution
With night insulation of L ¼ 0:04 m, the overall heat-loss coefﬁcient from the room
to the ambient air can be calculated as follows:
U ¼
1
12:5 þ 0:04
0:025 þ 0:30
0:72 þ 1

1
¼ 0:45 W/m2 C
The rate of heat loss from the room air to the ambient air during the night can be
calculated as follows:
_q ¼ 0:45 13  20
ð
Þ ¼ 0:45 
 7
ð
Þ ¼ 3:15 W/m2 C
Comparing from the result of Example 10.3, we see that there are losses during
the night; hence, the net rate of heat ﬂux = 8:45  3:15 ¼ 5:3 W/m2.
This is true only when the duration of the day and the night is the same;
otherwise, the gain and the loss should be multiplied by the duration of the day and
the night, respectively, before adding.
Example 10.5 Consider a south-facing brick wall with a ¼ 0:8 and s ¼ 0:71.
Calculate the mean heat ﬂux into a room through for a Trombe wall of 305 mm‒
thick concrete for the following parameters:
• room air temperature maintained = 18 C;
• external wall heat-transfer coefﬁcient from glazed surface = 5 W/m2 C;
• hi ¼ 8 W/m2 C;

(ii) Water Wall: Here water drums are stacked vertically in between the solar
thermal collector glazing wall and the living space as shown in Fig. 10.5. The
water-wall has advantage of large heat capacity unlike the Trombe wall. It is
used as a storage medium to release heat into the living space during the night.
If Tp is the temperature of the metallic surface of the drums, the energy- balance

(iii)
Transwall: A transwall, also known as a “translucent wall,” is shown in
Fig. 10.6. It is a transparent thermal storage wall admitting partial solar
energy. Introduction of a layer of concrete wall behind the water mass
decreases the average absorption of solar energy. It also reduces temperature
ﬂuctuations. Thus, a transwall absorbs marginally less energy compared with
the pure Trombe wall. A transwall is more useful for heat transfer when the
daytime-heating load is signiﬁcant.

(iv) Solarium: A solarium, as shown in Fig. 10.7a, is an integration of direct-gain
and thermal-storage concepts. It consists of a south-side sun space with
thick-mass wall connecting the living space.
The thermal-storage mass link between the Sun and living space helps in heat
retention and distribution. It also enhances the efﬁciency of the system. The
overheating of the sunspace during the summer can be avoided by the use of
shading. The use of movable insulation/shutters during the day to minimize heat
gain.
There are two zones, namely, zone I and zone II, having temperatures Ts and Tb.
These zones represent the sun space and the living space, respectively.
Solar radiation, after transmission s
ð Þ from the glass cover of the sun space, is
absorbed
a
ð Þ by a blackened thermal-storage mass-link wall facing the south
direction. Furthermore, there is convective heat transfer from the blackened
thermal-storage mass-link wall to the sun space Ts
ð
Þ and consequently from the sun
space to the ambient air by an overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient U0
ð
Þ. At the same
time, the rest of the heat is conducted to the living space. There is no direct heat
transfer between the absorbing surface and the ambient air.
The energy-balance equations can be written as follows:
For zone I

(v) Photovoltaic thermal (PVT) direct/indirect gain [4]
In this case, a semitransparent photovoltaic module (see Sect. 4.4.1 in Chap. 4)
is used in place of a window glass as shown in Fig. 10.7b. The solar radiation
incident on the semitransparent photovoltaic module (facing south in the northern
hemisphere) is used in two ways. The solar radiation incident on the packing factor
is ﬁrst converted into DC power, and the rest is lost to the ambient air and the
enclosed room air (indirect gain). Furthermore, the solar radiation incident on the
non-packing factor is directly transmitted to the room air, which represents a direct
gain for the room air. Thus, one gets a direct as well as an indirect gain by using a
semitransparent photovoltaic module. By such application, one gets thermal as well
as electrical power, and hence it is referred as “photovoltaic thermal gain.” It is also
known as a PVT facade.
Referring to Fig. 10.7b, an energy-balance equation in W/m2 for the PV module
and the room air can be written as follows:
Semitransparent photovoltaic module wall



where sg, ac, bc, and gm are the transmittivity of the glass of the PV module, the
absorptivity of the solar cell, the packing factor, and the electrical efﬁciency of the
semitransparent PV module, respectively; Ut;ca and Ut;cb are an overall heat-transfer
coefﬁcient from the solar cell to the ambient air and from the solar cell to the room
air, respectively.

where Ut;ba is an overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient from a non-air conditioned room to
the ambient air; and _qu is the rate of useful energy in W. N and V are the number of
air change and volume of the non-air conditioned room, respectively.
From Eq. (10.46), one obtains
Tc ¼ sgacbcI tð Þ  gmI tð Þ þ Ut;caTa þ Ut;cbTb
Ut;ca þ Ut;cb
ð10:47Þ
For a air-conditioned room, the values of Tb can be either 20 or 25 C. Thus, for
known Tb, Tc can be calculated and after knowing Tc; the temperature-dependent
electrical efﬁciency, and hence the electrical power, can also be calculated from
Eq. (4.37b).

10.7.3
Isolated Gain
Isolating, the collection of the solar energy unit and the storage from the building,
results in a greater ﬂexibility of design and operation. The most common appli-
cation of this concept is the natural convective loop with a thermo-syphoning water
heater as shown in Fig. 10.8a. This ﬁgure represents the simplest version.
Figure 10.8b shows the working principle of the collector‒cum‒rock bed storage
system integrated with a building. Hot air from the solar air collector is allowed to
448
10

enter the building. The cooled air is returned to the solar collector through the
basement and rock bed. In the case of hot air prevented from entering the building,
it is allowed to enter the rock bed to be stored for later use, preferably at night.
10.8
Thermal Cooling
Thermal cooling of a building, which is the reduction of peak cooling power
demand, utilizes a number of natural heat-rejection mechanisms, namely ventila-
tion, evaporation, infrared radiations to the sky, and Earth-contact cooling, etc.

10.7
Thermal Gain
449

The ﬁrst step in the direction of passive cooling is the reduction of unnecessary
thermal loads.
(a) Exterior load: Climate-dependent loads involve the conduction of heat
through the building skin, inﬁltration of the outside air, and direct penetration
of short wavelength radiations. This is achieved by having optimized Trombe
walls without ventilation during day and night.
(b) Interior
loads:
These
are
thermal
emissions
due
to
human
activities/occupancy.
The cooling concepts may be divided into two categories as follows:
(I) Direct cooling: Direct-cooling concepts include (i) ventilation/inﬁltra-
tion/courtyard, (ii) wind tower/air vents and (iii) Earth shelter; and
(II) Indirect cooling: The indirect cooling concept include (i) evaporative
cooling/roof pond (ii) shading/movable insulation and (iii) Earth air tunnel.
These concepts are described in subsequent sections.
10.8.1
Evaporative Cooling [5]
In a direct evaporative‒cooling system, the room air should come into direct contact
with the water surface. The relative humidity inside the room increases due to the
evaporation of water. In such cases, it is possible to cool a small building by placing
wetted pads in the windows or porches facing the wind direction.
Either water ﬁlm or an intermittent spray of water or water ﬂowing over the roof
is another method of indirect evaporative cooling. As the water draws heat from the
heated roof surface, it leaves a cooler ceiling surface. It acts as a radiative cooling
panel for the space inside the room. The indoor temperature is lowered without
elevating the humidity level as in the case of direct evaporative cooling. Indirect
evaporative cooling by roof pond is more effective. The roof can also be covered
with plants and movable insulation for indirect cooling.
The rate of reduction of thermal energy due to evaporation can be determined by
Eqs. (10.7a), (10.7b).
10.8.2
Inﬁltration/Ventilation
Inﬁltration means the admittance of outside air into the living space through a door
and/or window openings as well as cracks and interstices around the doors and
windows. It can also be said that there is exchange of air between the room air and
the outside air through inﬁltration/ventilation. The inﬁltration may be due to (i) the
pressure difference generated by the difference in temperatures and the humidity of
450
10
Solar House

the inside and the outside air of a building, (ii) wind pressure, and (iii) entry and
exit of occupants.
Convective heat losses due to ventilation are attributable to the air-exchange rate,
the temperature difference between the inside and the outside the building, and the
heat capacity of the air.
The rate of inﬁltration/ventilation losses can be determined by the following
relation:
_Qv ¼ 0:33NV Tb  Ta
ð
Þ
ð10:51Þ
where N is the number of air exchanges per hour and for inﬁltration N < 10 and
for ventilation N > 10 The V is the volume of the room of a building m3
ð
Þ; and Tb
is the temperature of the air inside the room of a building (°C).
Local topography and surface texture affect the wind conditions considerably.
Spacing of buildings, at six times their height in a grid iron pattern, results in proper
wind movement due to uniform ﬂow and removal of stagnant zones.
Windows play a dominant role in inducing ventilation. The ventilation rate is
affected by the parameters such as climate, wind direction, size of inlet and outlet,
room volume, shading devices, and internal partitions.
10.8.3
Wind Tower
Wind towers are designed to harness cool air through the wind and circulate cool air
inside the building. A wind tower provides heating or cooling depending on the
time of the day as well as the presence or absence of wind. When ambient air at a
higher temperature comes in contact with the walls of the wind tower during the
day, it is cooled. The higher density of cool air creates a downdraft and settles down
at the lower part of wind tower. The presence of a wind tower helps this downdraft.
During the night, thermal energy stored in the wind tower during sunshine hour
heats the air present in wind tower and works as a chimney. Higher temperatures in
the upper part of the wind tower lower the pressure, and an updraft is created. The
concept of a wind tower works well in individual units but not in multi-storey
apartments unless it is designed accordingly.
10.8.4
Earth‒Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE)
An Earth‒air heat exchanger (EAHE) exploits the constant ground temperature a
few meters below the Earth’s surface. The ground temperature remains constant
throughout the year at an appropriate depth. The depth along with temperature is
given in Table 10.2. The constant temperature beneath the ground can be harnessed
for cooling or heating during the winter or summer, respectively. The design
10.8
Thermal Cooling
451

parameter (e.g., the depth below ground for installation of a heat exchanger, length
of pipe, cross-sectional area for air ﬂow, and air ﬂow rate) and climatic parameter
(such as humidity of inlet air, ambient temperature, and incident solar radiation)
determines the heat exchange between the surrounding soil and the air ﬂowing in
the pipe.
Figure 10.9a shows a cross-sectional view of an Earth‒air heat exchanger
(EAHE) below the ground surface at 4-m depth. Air available from the atmospheric
air temperature is allowed to pass through it. The shape of the EAHE is cylindrical
having a radius of ‘r’ and length ‘L’. As the air passes through the EAHE, there is
heat transfer from the inner surface of the tunnel to the ﬂowing air by forced
convection. Depending on the air temperature, the air is either heated or cooled. If
the temperature of the air is lower than the temperature of the inner surface of the
EAHE, heat is transferred from the surface to the air for heating. This occurs in
winter and vice versa for summer.
Referring to Fig. 10.9b, the energy balance for an elemental length ‘dx’ in terms
of W can be written as [6]
_mfCf
dT x
ð Þ
dx
dx ¼ 2prhc T0  T x
ð Þ
ð
Þ
ð10:52Þ
where hc is a convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient, which can be calculated by the
formula given in Chap. 3. For a larger-diameter EAHE, one can approximate a
heat-transfer coefﬁcient considering it as 2:8 þ 3V where V is the speed of air
ﬂowing through the EAHE; Cf is the mass-ﬂow rate and speciﬁc heat of the air; and
T x
ð Þ is the temperature of air as a function of ‘x’.
The solution of the above equation with the initial condition T x ¼ 0

The following special cases should be discussed:
Case (i)
If either L ) 1 or _mf is very small, which indicates a very large tunnel length with
very slow speed of air, then Tfo ¼ T0 and _Qu ¼ _mfCf T0  Tfi
ð

This indicates maximum withdrawal of thermal energy to heat the living space.
Case (ii)
If L ) 0 and _mf is very large, which indicates a small tunnel length with very large
speed of air, then
Tfo ¼ Tfi and _Qu ¼ 0
This indicates no withdrawal of heat from tunnel, and hence there is a need to
optimize the length, radius, and velocity of the air for thermal heating/cooling of a
living space. The variation of _Qu with L for winter and summer conditions for a
typical set of parameters is shown in Fig. 10.9c.
A combination of wind tower and Earth‒air heat exchanger is effective in
increasing the draft of air in the Earth‒air tunnel to improve the cooling rate of the
building air as shown in Fig. 10.9a.
Here it is important to mention that the depth in case of a wetted surface is
greater than that of a dry surface. For a given depth, the ground temperature for a
wetted surface will be lower than any other surface due to it high thermal

Air Vent
Air vents are used due to the failure of a wind tower. A typical air vent is shown in
Fig. 10.10. It consists of holes that have been appropriately optimized for size at the
top of any cylindrical or domed roof. The hole is covered with a protective
cap. When air passes through the openings of the protective cap, low pressure at top
454
10

of the curved roof is created. The low pressure created at the top directs the hot air
inside the living space toward the upper vent, which results cooling of the living
space. Thus, the air is kept circulating through the room. Air vents are usually
placed over living rooms to cool air moving through the room. An air vent is
suitable for hot and dry as well as warm and humid climatic conditions. Air vents
are preferred for single-unit living/working spaces.
10.8.6
Shading
Another important building element is the glass window, which greatly inﬂuences
the thermal environment. Glass window openings must be designed in relation to
the sunlight, ventilation, and air movement. Window designing relating to sunlight
can be performed by two methods as follows:
First method: In this case, one must design the shading devices to prevent radiation
from entering the interior.
Second method: In this case, one must design the openings to permit the adequate
natural lighting of the interior.
There are also a number of options available for windows. These include the
following:
(i) Self-inﬂating curtain: The curtain consists of a number of thin layers of
ﬂexible material with high reﬂectivity and low emissivity. Solar radiation
warms the air between the two layers, which increases the pressure and
Fig. 10.10 Air vents under operation
10.8
Thermal Cooling
455

decreases the density in the upper part of the layers. The pressure pushes the
layers apart and creates fresh air intake of air from the bottom. Thus, the
system of reﬂecting layers separated by air gaps provides good insulation. If
insulation is not required between two layers, the air is evacuated from the
sides.
The rate of thermal-energy transfer through a self-inﬂating curtain is written as
follows:
_q ¼ 1  f
ð
ÞsI tð Þ  U Tb  Ta
ð
Þ
ð10:56Þ
where f is the shading factor; and the value of f is 1 for complete shading and < 1
for partial shading.
(ii)
Window Quilt Shade: The quilt consists of a sandwich of ﬁne layers. It is
assembled with an ultrasonic ﬁbre welder. The quilt is enclosed in decorative
polyester ﬁbre.
(iii)
Venetian Blind between the glasses: This is an effective system to reduce
heat loss through a double-glazed window. In this case, the characteristic
dimension of the unit is small; hence, the convective heat transfer is stopped.
In this case, _q is the same as that in Eq. (10.21) but with a lower value of s
and U.
(iv)
Transparent Heat Mirrors: This is a method to reduce heat loss from a
glazed surface. In this case, the glass is coated by a ﬁlm to reﬂect the infrared
radiation from the surface a large extent. However, this coating also reduces
the transmissivity of the glass window for solar radiation. A suitable com-
promise must be made as per requirement. The coating may consist of single
or multiple layers of different substances deposited by vacuum evaporation
or spray technique. The heat mirror gives much less heat loss and a higher
transmission than a multi-pane system.
(v)
Heat Trap: A reasonable thickness of insulating material with good trans-
missivity may be used to reduce heat transfer.
(vi)
Optical Shutter: This consists of three layers of transparent sheets and one
layer of cloud gel. It is opaque at high temperatures. It can be used for
reducing air-conditioning loads and preventing overheating in green houses
and solar-collector systems.
10.8.7
Rock Bed Regenerative Cooler
A cross-sectional view of a regenerative cooler is shown in Fig. 10.11. It consists of
two rock beds set side by side. It also acts as a heat exchanger and is separated by
an air space. A damper is used between the two rock beds to divert the incoming air
from house toward the cooling rock bed by water spray. The rock beds are cooled

alternatively. It also absorbs water during cooling. The air passing through a cooled
dry rock bed in the ﬁrst cycle gets cooled by transferring heat to the cooled rock
bed. The cooled air is allowed to pass into the room. Humid air is produced during
its evaporation cycle from the rock bed, and it is vented to the outside. After getting
the rock bed warm, the damper is reversed for further cooling. In the meantime,
another cooled rock bed is used similarly for cooling.
10.8.8
Radiative Cooling
The sky temperature is always lower than the ambient air temperature by 12 °C
under clear night sky conditions. The northern sky in the northern hemisphere is
often cool enough even during the day. It acts as a cooler heat sink with respect to
ambient air during the day/night. A horizontal surface is the most effective radiative
conﬁguration.
Exposed horizontal surface loses heat to the ambient air by convection until its
temperature is equal to the dry-bulb air temperature. In addition, there is heat loss
from the ambient air/surface to the sky by long-wavelength radiation exchange. If
the net heat exchange between the surface and the sky reduces the roof surface
temperature to the wet-bulb temperature of the surrounding air, condensation of
moisture of the air starts taking place on the roof. The condensation will further cool
the roof due to fast heat loss from the enclosed room to the surface of the roof.
(Case (ii) of Eq. 10.16)
If a surface is inclined as shown in Fig. 10.12, then the cooled air will trickle
down toward an internal courtyard from the inclined surface due to its high density.
Then the trickled cooled air enters the room, as shown in the ﬁgure, through the
openings at lower level. However, this does not work in windy conditions because
Fig. 10.11 Cross-sectional
view of a regenerative cooler
10.8
Thermal Cooling
457

the wind becomes the carrier of cooled air. To avoid this, the roof should be
covered with a transparent polyethylene sheet which has a limited life time. This
problem can be solved by covering the roof with a corrugated metallic sheet with
the provision of openings at the lower and upper end from inside the roof as shown
in Fig. 10.13.
10.8.9
Green/Cool Roof
A “green” roof or “cool” roof is a concept in which there is vegetation and gar-
dening [7] on the roof of the building to decrease the heat ﬂux inside the building
from the top. In addition to the vegetation, there are some other concepts that are
used such as colouring of the roof [8, 9] evaporative cooling, and solar ponds [10,
11]. There are also some selective coatings on the roof of the building that reﬂect
radiation and cool the roof. In some cases, roof ventilation has also been used to
cool the roof. Green roofs are a passive cooling technique, which does not have any
ill effect on environment or on human health.
10.8.10
Heating and Cooling
Figure 10.14 shows a schematic view of a roof pond integrated with a
water-circulating column working under natural circulation mode. The roof pond is
covered permanently with a thin-layer exchange membrane. There is a louvered

radiation through a
closed-roof loop

shade above the membrane. The louvered shade is closed to reduce heat loss during
the night. It is opened to allow solar radiation to be incident on the roof pond during
the day. This is precisely performed for thermal heating. In this case, the water of
the roof pond is heated. The hot water is allowed to pass through the downcomer.
During passes through the downcomer, thermal energy is released to the water
outside and cooled down toward the lower ends due to high density.
For thermal cooling, the louvered shade is opened to increase heat loss during
night time. There will be evaporation from the water surface; it cools the water. It is
closed during the day to minimize solar radiation to incident on the roof pond. The
cooled water is allowed to pass through the downcomer. The thermal energy gained
from the room air during passes through the downcomer. Thus room is then cooled.
10.9
Time Constant
For most of the commonly encountered thermal structures, the boundary conditions
change constantly. The steady-state methods gives only approximate solutions. The
exact analyses of the heat transmission under transient conditions are complex. An
approximate estimation of the time-dependent response of the thermal structures
can be performed by assuming a constant temperature throughout the structure at
any instant. If there is a small change in temperature dT in time dt, the change in the

Solar Load‒Ratio Method
This method determines the yearly requirements for supplementary energy in a
building. The solar load‒ratio method was put forward by Balcomb et al. [12]. It is
extensively applied for designing sunspace, solar collector/storage, and direct gain
in buildings. This method employs simulation techniques of passive-heating sys-
tems. The solar load‒ratio method requires knowledge of some basic terms. The
important deﬁnitions of each one of them are as follows:
Solar Wall: A glazed wall of a building that absorbs solar radiation and transfer
thermal energy to the living space of a building is known as a “solar wall.”
Solar Aperture: The glazed area of the wall that transmits solar radiation into the
living space for direct thermal gain and day lighting is termed a “solar aperture.”
SLR correlations assume the negligible losses through the solar aperture. Hence,
losses through the solar aperture are neglected.
Net Glazing Area (Ar): Ar is the area obtained after excluding the area of mullions,
framing, etc., from the solar aperture.
Projected Area (Arp): Arp is the projection of the net glazing area on a vertical
plane normal to the azimuth of the glazing. Net glazing area and projected area are
equal for a collector storage wall and direct gain portions of the building, whereas
the net glazing area for a sunspace is signiﬁcantly higher than projected area
(Fig. 10.7a).
Net Reference Load (Lns): Lns is the thermal losses incurred from the nonsolar
components of the building in 1 month.
The net reference load (in Wh) is given by
Lns ¼ 24 UA
ð
Þns DD
ð
Þ
ð10:65Þ
where UA
ð
Þns is in W=C, and DD is the number of DD in the month.
462
10
Solar House

Net-Load Coefﬁcient: Net-load coefﬁcient is the ratio of net reference load to the
temperature difference between living space and the outdoor of a building.
Gross Reference Load: L is the sum of heat losses from the solar and nonsolar
components of the building.
Total-Load Coefﬁcient: Total-load coefﬁcient is ratio of the gross reference load to
the temperature difference between the living space and the outdoors of a building.
It can be expressed as follows:
L ¼ 24 UA
ð
Þ DD
ð
Þ
ð10:66Þ
Solar-Savings Fraction: (fns) is the fraction of energy requirement in the building
that is met by solar components installed in the building. It can be expressed as
fns ¼ Lns  LA
Lns
¼ 1  LA
Lns
ð10:67Þ
where LA is the auxiliary energy required for each month given by
LA ¼ Lns 1  fns
ð
Þ
ð10:68Þ
Load-Collector Ratio: (LCR) is deﬁned as the net-load coefﬁcient per unit of
projected area of solar aperture in a building. It is expressed as
LCR ¼ 24 UA
ð
Þns=Arp
ð10:69Þ
Load-Collector Ratio for the Solar Aperture: (LCRs) is deﬁned as the loss
coefﬁcient per unit of projected area of the aperture.
The “unutilizability” method (double-U method) assumes a passive building as a
collector with a ﬁnite heat capacity for designing the direct gain and solar collector
and storage wall of the building. Two limiting cases are considered for the esti-
mation of required auxiliary energy.
(i) For an inﬁnite-capacitance structure: An inﬁnite capacitance structure has a
very large heat capacity. This structure allows the storage of excess energy
(excess of loads) met from the solar elements of the building for later time.
(ii) For a zero-capacitance structure: In this case, excess energy from the loads
is not stored for later use.
Therefore, all of the correlations used for the estimation of the auxiliary energy
of a building fall in between these two limits. Figure 10.15 presents the input and
output energy streams from a direct-gain component in 1 month.
Solar energy absorbed in the room is given by the following expression:
ItN as
ð
ÞAr ¼ NSAr
ð10:70Þ
where N is the number of days of the month and S ¼ as
ð
ÞIt.
10.11
Solar Load‒Ratio Method
463

“Load” is deﬁned as the energy lost through the building shell by conduction,
inﬁltration, etc. There are two possibilities as follows
(i) when energy from solar components is unable to meet loads, i.e., the
requirement of auxiliary energy LA; and
(ii) when there is excess absorption of solar energy compared with load, this
energy cannot be stored from a thermal-comfort point of view; in this case,
excess heat QD must be vented or “dumped.”
For nonzero thermal capacitance, there will be a sensible amount of heat, which
may be removed from or stored in any structure in 1 month. Thermal energy stored
is not shown in Fig. 10.15.
For a building having inﬁnite storage capacity, the excess energy of the loads is
stored, which gives a constant temperature. In this case, the energy balance (for
1 month) for the auxiliary energy requirement LA;i is given as follows:
LA;i ¼ L  NSAr

 þ
ð10:71Þ
where L is the load for the entire building. The ‘+’ sign indicates that only positive
values of the bracket are considered.
For a zero storage‒capacity building, the excess energy of the loads is dumped,
and the deﬁcit energy is given by auxiliary energy. The temperature inside the
building is constant in this case, too, but at the cost of the addition or removal of
energy instead of storage.
The instantaneous rate of energy removal _QD from the structure is given as
following:

Solar Cooling
Abstract A ﬂat-plate collector, if operated at low temperature by using working
ﬂuid refrigerant, is known as a “solar-cooling device.” The concepts of vapor
absorption and compression (refrigeration) are used. This device is used for
household refrigerators and air conditioning, etc. Solar collectors are the main part
that heats the working ﬂuid.

Introduction
Solar cooling has the following advantages:
• It saves the conventional primary energy source based on electricity.
• It leads to a reduction of peak electricity demand for cost saving.
• It is environmentally sound without ozone depletion to sustain global warning.
• The demand and supply matches, i.e., the hottest period has sufﬁcient maximum
solar energy.
Solar energy is used in cooling cycles for the following cases:
(i) Thermal-comfort cooling:
In hot climates, thermal-comfort cooling is important for space conditioning of
buildings. The feasibility of solar insolation and cooling load exists nearly in a
similar phase. Solar air conditioning can be attained by (a) absorption cycles,
(b) desiccant cycles, and (c) solar-mechanical processes. A continuous or inter-
mittent cycle, hot- or cold-side energy storage, diverse control strategies, various
temperature ranges of operation, different collectors, etc., can be possible under the
above-mentioned categories. Theoretically, numerous thermal efﬁciencies of
solar-cooling processes can be achieved. The temperature constraints of a mecha-
nism of solar collectors restricts their thermal efﬁciencies. Compared with the

provision of additional cooling, minimization of cooling loads through cautious
building design and insulation are much cheaper, which makes them more
preferable (Chap. 10). Proﬁcient design and construction of a building can mini-
mize the load on any air-conditioning or heating system, but we are concerned
about cooling loads that should really be considered in an effective building design.
(ii) Refrigeration cooling:
Refrigeration is a process in which work is carried out to convey heat from one
point to another. The conveyance of heat is done by mechanical work. Refrigeration
has numerous applications such as household refrigerators, industrial freezers,
cryogenics, and air conditioning.
Refrigeration cyclic can be categorized as follows: a vapor cycle and a gas cycle.
Vapor cycle refrigeration can further be categorized as follows:
(I) Vapor-compression refrigeration
(II) Vapor-absorption refrigeration.
11.2
Solar Air Conditioning
Different aspects of solar air-conditioning will be discussed in the following
sections.
11.2.1
Solar-Absorption Process [1]
The solar-absorption process utilizes the difference in the binding of a ﬂuid, known
as a “refrigerant,” into two vessels at different temperatures. The ﬂuid (refrigerant)
can be bound by a liquid or a solid solvent known as an “absorbent.” The
solar-absorption process takes place as follows:
The solar-absorption process is shown in Fig. 11.1. Vessel I contains the
refrigerant (R) bound with the absorbent (A), and vessel II contains the pure
refrigerant. The valve between the two vessels is closed for the same temperature.
The vapour pressure in vessel II will be higher than that in vessel I
PII [ PI with TI ¼ TII
ð
Þ. If the valve opens, the refrigerant gas ﬂows from vessel II
to I vessel due to the existing pressure difference. The vapour pressure in I becomes
higher than the equilibrium vapour pressure, and the vapour condenses in it. The
temperature in vessel I increases due to the latent heat of condensation. The reverse
process taking place in vessel II decreases its temperature.
Due to mass transfer from vessel II to vessel I, the vapour pressure tends to
equalize in the two vessels. This causes a temperature difference between them
PI ¼ PII with TI [ TII
ð
Þ. Now the heat is supplied to the cold vessel II from the
surroundings, and the pressure equilibrium is disturbed. The vapour pressure in
472
11
Solar Cooling

vessel II exceeds the vapour pressure in vessel I, which causes mass transfer from
vessel II to vessel I; hence, the ﬂow of heat/thermal energy from vessel II to I. Thus,
heat is transferred (pumped) from the lower temperature of vessel II to the higher
temperature of vessel I. The absorption process may be utilized for the following:
(a) For cooling: In this case, the cold vessel takes the heat from the surrounding; or
(b) For heating: In this case, the heat developed in the warm vessel is utilized.
The heat-pumping ability of the device is thus consumed; to restore it, the system
must be regenerated by reversing the mass transfer/heat transfer from vessel I to
vessel II. In between the phases of heat pumping and regeneration, energy can be
stored. Therefore, an absorption process has three main characteristics viz. cooling,
heating, and energy storage. The success of the absorption process depends on the
selection of a suitable pair of refrigerant and absorbent.
The selection of suitable pair of refrigerant and absorbent is generally based on
the following criteria:
(i) Chemical and physical properties of the ﬂuid; and
(ii) Acceptable range in particular for the thermo-physical and thermodynamic
properties of the ﬂuid.
For an absorption system, the preferable features of a refrigerant/absorbent
mixture are (i) low viscosity of the solution under operating conditions to minimize
the pump work; (ii) freezing point of the liquid lower than the lowest temperature in
the cycle; (iii) good chemical thermal stability; and (iv) noncorrosive, nontoxic, and
nonﬂammable components.
The thermodynamic properties of the solutions of refrigerant and absorbent are
critical in determining its suitability for absorption systems. The combination of
refrigerant and absorbent should satisfy two primary thermodynamic requirements:
(a) high equilibrium solubility of the refrigerant in the absorber; and (b) a larger
difference in boiling points of the absorbent and the refrigerant. The combinations
of lithium‒bromide‒water (LiBr–H2O) and ammonia‒water (NH3–H2O) are often
used. Solar energy-based absorption coolers can operate in two ways: (i) the use of

continuous coolers having the same construction and operation as conventional gas
or steam-ﬁred units (in this case, energy supplied to the generator from the
solar-collector/storage auxiliary system); and (ii) the use of intermittent coolers.
A diagram of one of the possible arrangements for continuous-absorption cycles is
shown in Fig. 11.2.
Temperature limitations of ﬂat-plate collector limit the consideration of com-
mercial machines for lithium‒bromide‒water (LiBr–H2O) systems. The principle
advantages of lithium‒bromide‒water (LiBr–H2O) systems are as follows:
(i)
Water as a refrigerant has a very high latent heat of vaporization.
(ii)
The absorbent is nonvolatile.

(iii)
Lithium‒bromide‒water (LiBr–H2O) systems operate at low pressure and
hence have a low pumping-power requirement.
(iv)
The material is nontoxic and nonﬂammable.
Lithium‒bromide‒water (LiBr–H2O) machines require water to cool the
absorber and condenser, and in most of the applications a cooling tower is required.
The disadvantage of using water as the refrigerant is that a water-cooled condenser
is required to attain temperatures corresponding to those of air conditioning. The
temperatures corresponding to refrigeration cannot, however, be reached even with
a water-cooled condenser. This is due to the fact that LiBr is not sufﬁciently soluble
in water to permit the absorber to be air-cooled. The combination is corrosive to the
materials of construction of the cycle (hydrogen, which is the product of the cor-
rosion reaction, increases the system pressure and hence decreases the efﬁciency of
the cycle). In addition, during the system operation the combination produces salt
crystallization and thus cannot be used for a long period. Ammonia‒water (NH3–
H2O) system is mostly used for industrial absorption air conditioning and
refrigeration.
Solar-assisted desiccant-cooling systems generally use the solar thermal
ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) with a selective-surface/concentrating-collector/evacuated
tubular solar collector (ETSC) as a heating system. The solar thermal system
consists of a solar ﬂat-plate collector (FPC)/concentrating collector with a
selective-surface/evacuated tubular solar collector (ETSC) using water as the ﬂuid
and an insulated water storage tank operating under forced mode to increase
exploitation of the solar energy. However, to connect the solar and air systems
together, a supplementary water/air heat exchanger is needed.
The thermal instantaneous efﬁciency of a solar ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) with a
selective-surface/concentrating collector/evacuated tubular solar collector (ETSC)

From Eq. (11.1) we have

go ¼ asð1  qÞ ¼ 0:9  0:9  0:4 ¼ 0:329 for an evacuated tubular solar collector

solar ﬂat-plate collector/evacuated tubular solar collector/parabolic-trough solar

11.2.2
Solar-Desiccant Cooling
Solar-desiccant cooling is an open-cycle system in which water acts as a refrigerant
and is in direct contact with air unlike the solar-absorption process. The water is
easily available. A combination of evaporative cooling with air dehumidiﬁcation
using a desiccant (a hygroscopic material) constitutes the thermally driven cooling.
A liquid or solid material can be used for this. The term “open” signiﬁes that the
refrigerant is not reused after accomplishing the cooling effect. Therefore, water is
the only possible medium that can act as a coolant with direct contact to the
neighbouring air for evaporation. Currently frequently applied technology uses
rotating desiccant wheels equipped either with silica gel or lithium‒chloride (Li–Cl)
as sorption material.
There are two type of solar-desiccant cooling, which will be discussed as
follows:
(a) Solid-desiccant cooling
The principle components of a solar-assisted solid-desiccant cooling system are
given in Fig. 11.3. The basic working principle is given below.
Warm and humid air is passed above the slowly revolving desiccant wheel
where it is dehumidiﬁed due to the adsorption of water (1 and 2). The hot air is then
passed through the heat-recovery wheel (2 and 3) where it is cooled. This precooled
air is fed to the humidiﬁer and further cooled and humidiﬁed up to the desired value
of humidity and temperature (3 and 4). Now the cool, dried air is fed inside the
building. The warm, humid air from the room is passed through the humidiﬁer
(6 and 7) and humidiﬁed to the saturation level to utilize the maximum cooling
potential. Then it is fed to the heat-recovery unit (7 and 8). Thereafter this air is
passed through the dehumidiﬁer (9 and 10) and exited. For continuous operation of
the cooling process, the sorption unit is regenerated by heating it in a low tem-
perature range (50 °C–75 °C).
For critical outdoor weather conditions, such as high-humidity weather for
coastal areas, one needs an advanced design of desiccant cycle that is capable
enough to reduce the humidity level up to a certain minimum level favourable for
direct evaporative cooling. In this speciﬁc case, an extra heat-recovery wheel or
additional air coolers can achieve the desired requirement. An innovative approach
may
be
the
simultaneous
dehumidiﬁcation
(using
sorptive
coating
on
a
heat-exchanger wall) and cooling of air (through returning humidiﬁed air) by using
air-to-air heat exchanger. This approach improves the thermal efﬁciency of the
system. The sorptive coating material becomes saturated after some time; hence,
two such heat exchangers can be used intermittently with one in operation and the
other regenerated (i.e., ready to use if one becomes saturated).
478
11
Solar Cooling

(b) Liquid-desiccant cooling
A liquid desiccant-cooling system is a novel technology in which a liquid water‒
lithium chloride (H2O–Li–Cl) solution is used as sorption material. Such systems
have numerous beneﬁts as follows:
(i) It has higher air dehumidiﬁcation compared with a solid-desiccant cooling
system for the same temperature range.
(ii) It has a higher energy-storage capacity with concentrated solutions.
For air conditioning, based on solar thermal systems, liquid-desiccant cooling
can raise the utilization of solar thermal systems signiﬁcantly.
11.2.3
Solar Mechanical Cooling
There is another cooling method that involves the coupling of a solar-powered
Rankine-cycle engine with a conventional air-conditioning system. The major
limitations of a solar-assisted conventional air-conditioning system include (i) the
production of mechanical energy from solar energy; and (ii) the modiﬁcation of an
existing air-conditioning system for variable-load operation.
A simple Rankine-cycle cooling system is presented in Fig. 11.4. The heat
engine in this cooling system produces mechanical work by utilizing the thermal
energy available in insulated storage water tank through a heat exchanger. It is a
well-known fact that the efﬁciency of solar thermal systems decreases with
increasing temperature, which is in contrast to the heat engine where higher tem-
peratures result in higher efﬁciency. A typical variation of solar thermal collector
efﬁciency versus engine efﬁciency with temperature is shown in Fig. 11.5a. The
overall system efﬁciency is shown in Fig. 11.5b.

11.2.4
Solar Photovoltaic Cooling
Solar photovoltaic is used to provide electrical power to a absorption/adsorption-
based vapour compressor as shown in Fig. 11.6a. In the absorption/adsorption-based
vapour compressor process, energy is transferred through a phase-change process.
For small residential/commercial cooling
 5 MWh=year
ð
Þ, solar photovoltaic-
power cooling is the most suitable/successful solar cooling technology. The reason
for this may be the incentive provided by government agencies. The cost of solar
photovoltaic-power cooling effectiveness mainly depends on the cooling system and
the use of electrical processes. Partially replacing the grid supply for air conditioning
with PV systems can be signiﬁcantly cost-effective. This also limits carbon emission
in the atmosphere.
Vapor-compression refrigeration system
A circulating liquid (refrigerant) is used in the vapor-compression refrigeration
system. The refrigerant works as a medium that absorbs the heat from the space to be
cooled and discards that heat somewhere else. Figure 11.6b shows a typical
single-stage vapor-compression system that has four components: (i) a vapour
compressor, (ii) a condenser, (iii) a thermal-expansion valve (throttle valve), and
(iv) an evaporator. The circulating refrigerant ﬁrst enters the vapour compressor
(i) in the thermodynamic state known as “saturated vapor.” [2] It is then compressed
to a higher pressure, which causes an increase in temperature. In a thermodynamic
state, the hot and compressed vapor is known as “superheated vapour.” The
superheated vapour is allowed to pass through the condenser, and (ii) cool water or
cool air streaming across the coil or tubes can make the saturated heat condensed into
a saturated liquid ﬂowing by way of the same coil or tubes. The rejected heat from
the condenser is carried away by either the water or the air. This route is considered
as the high-pressure side (hot refrigerant) as shown in Fig. 11.6a. In solar-assisted
refrigeration systems, the electricity provided to the compressor is met by photo-
voltaic (PV) systems.

Solar Cooling

The condensed liquid refrigerant, after condensation, is known as “saturated
liquid” in the thermodynamic state. The saturated liquid is next allowed to pass
through an expansion valve (iii) for an abrupt reduction in pressure. Due to pressure
reduction, one obtains the following:

(i)
A part of the liquid refrigerant is evaporated.
(ii)
It lowers the temperature of the vapor‒liquid mixture by the auto-refrigeration
effect of the adiabatic ﬂash evaporation.
(iii)
The vapour‒refrigerant liquid mixture is cooler than the temperature of the
living space (v) in the building to be cooled.
The cold mixture moves through the coil or tubes in the evaporator (iv). The
warm air is circulated by a fan in the enclosed room air (v) to be cooled across the
coil or tubes carrying the cold refrigerant liquid‒vapor mixture. That warm air from
the enclosed room of a building evaporates the liquid part of the cold refrigerant
mixture in the coil of evaporator. Instantly the circulating air becomes cooler and
hence lowers the temperature of the enclosed room to the desired temperature.
For completing the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor from the evaporator
(iv) is again a saturated vapour and is further allowed to pass through the
vapour-compressor (i).
In this case, an electrical efﬁciency of crystalline silicon solar cell ge

where go is an electrical efﬁciency of the crystalline silicon solar cell under standard

cell to the ambient air through the top and bottom of the solar cell.

where E is the electrical output of the PV system used as input to drive the chiller

where ge is given by Eq. (11.5); and COP is the coefﬁcient of performance of the
chiller unit.
11.2.5
Difference Between Basic Vapour Compression
and the Absorption Cooling Cycle
The vapour-compression system, as shown in Fig. 11.6, is an electrically driven
compressor based on a photovoltaic system, whereas in case of absorption cooling,
482
11
Solar Cooling

an electrically driven compressors based on a photovoltaic system is replaced by a
chemical cycle taking place between the absorber, the pump, and the regenerator [3].
Basically, instead of compressing the refrigerant vapour in compression cycle,
the absorption cycle dissolve as follows:
(i)
The vapour in a liquid known as the “absorbent.”
(ii)
The cycle can pump the liquid to a high pressure with much less work input
compared with a vapour compressor.
(iii)
Heat input is used to evaporate part of the liquid into refrigerant vapour.
Hartmann et al. [4] investigated the investment cost for solar thermal and solar
electrical heating and cooling in Freiburg in Germany. They observed that the
primary energy saving was 36 %. Corresponding to 36 % primary energy saving,
the optimized solar thermal and solar electrical systems are as follows:
(i) The optimum solar thermal collector area is 160 m2 with a storage tank of
40 l=m2.
(ii) There is a photovoltaic module of 24 m2.
The cumulated investment cost for a solar electric system is 73 % lower than that
of a solar thermal system because of the low-utilization factor and low COP of solar
thermal system.
11.3
Comparison of Different Solar Cooling Technologies
In this section, a comparison of performance the following solar based-cooling
technologies will be discussed as follows:
(i)
Selective solar ﬂat-plate collector (FPC);
(ii)
Parabolic-trough collector (PTC);
(iii)
Evacuated tubular solar collector (ETC); and
(iv)
Photovoltaic (PV) collector (Fig. 11.6).
The performance of these technologies was carried out by Lazzarin [2] for the
following constant-collection temperature conditions:
(a) Adsorption at 70 °C.
(b) Single-effect absorption at 90 °C.
(c) Double-effect absorption at 160 °C.
(d) GAX ammonia-absorption air cooled at 160 °C.
Here it important to note that to maintain a constant-collection temperature for
a given hourly variation of climatic condition (solar intensity and ambient air
temperature), the mass ﬂow rate should be varied to determine the daily useful
thermal energy kWh=m2=day

vesting periods. A solar-dried crop is hygienic and preserves nutritional value.
A solar crop dryer reduces drying time with protection from external disturbances
such as rain and strong wind.

Importance of Solar-Drying
The primary requirement for survival of human beings is food after air and water.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that >852 million people
worldwide were undernourished in the year 2000–2002 [1]. The projected ﬁgure of
the world’s population is >7.6 billion up to the year 2020. Hence, agricultural
production should be increased to meet the food demand of the fast-growing
population across world. In the next 25 years, approximately 50 % more food must
be produced, particularly in developing countries. The gap between the supply and
demand for food can be challenged (i) by increasing crop/food productivity (ii) by
controlling population growth (iii) by reducing food losses, or (iii) a combination of
both. In this chapter, we will address the problem of decreasing food losses
before/after harvesting using solar drying.
Solar drying of agricultural product is one of the important postharvest opera-
tions to save grain from postharvest losses. Solar drying is the process of removing
moisture from produce to attain optimum moisture content for its long-term storage
(Table 12.1).
Solar drying of crops helps with the following: (i) facilitating early or preharvest
activities, (ii) planning the harvest season, (iii) providing long-term storage,
(iv) fetching better returns for farmers, (v) maintaining the viability of seeds,
(vi) selling a better-quality product, (vii) the handling, transport, and distribution of
crops, and (viii) reduction of the requirement for storage space [2].

Conventional drying of agricultural products is an energy-intensive operation.
For conventional drying processes, large amounts of energy are consumed by
various industries. In developed countries, nearly 8–12 % of primary energy
demand is consumed by drying purposes. The use of conventional sources of
energy for drying agricultural products substantially affects the environment. The
rise in the price of conventional fuels directly affects the market price of the
products dried by using conventional sources of energy [3].

Solar Crop-Drying
Solar energy available in the terrestrial region can be converted into either thermal
energy or DC electricity, or both, by photovoltaic (PV) cells. Solar crop-drying
utilizes thermal energy available from the Sun for drying agricultural products.
Solar crop-drying is categorized on the basis of the methodology for solar-energy
collection and conversion of solar energy into useful thermal energy.
Open-Sun drying (OSD) was used for drying fruits, vegetables, and other
products from ancient times. Worldwide a large share of dried products are dried
using OSD without any advanced technology [4]. OSD, as adopted by a large
number of farmers, has inherent challenges: (i) It requires a large space and more
time for drying; (ii) it poses considerable loss due to rodents, birds, insects,
microorganisms as well as hostile weather conditions, e.g., unexpected rain or
storms; (iii) crops can be contaminated by foreign materials such as dust, dirt etc.;
(iv) there is a risk of overdrying/insufﬁcient drying as well as discoloring by UV
radiation; (v) and there can be a degraded quality of dried products (due to the
readsorption of moisture. Thus, OSD results in a product of degraded quality. If the
quality of products is lower, then they are not marketable for their reference value
[5–11].
Therefore, to overcome the limitations and disadvantages owing to OSD, a more
advanced and controlled method of solar-energy harvesting was adopted for
crop-drying. The advanced method is known as controlled solar drying; it uses a
combination of a solar thermal energy-collection system and a drying chamber.
Solar energy may be collected separately using (1) a solar thermal-collector unit and
be fed to the drying chamber or (2) a solar thermal energy collection unit can also
be integrated with the drying chamber in a single unit. Controlled solar drying is
more efﬁcient, healthier, more hygienic, faster, and more economical than OSD
[12–15].
Figure 12.1 shows the classiﬁcation of solar dryers. Solar dryers are differenti-
ated on the basis of methods adopted for the collection of solar energy as thermal
energy and the transfer of this thermal energy from the solar collector to the drying
unit. Broadly there are two types of solar dryers, namely, passive solar dryer
(utilizes natural convection for the transfer of thermal energy to the drying prod-
ucts) and active solar dryer (utilizes natural forced convection for transfer of
thermal energy to the drying products).
In passive solar dryers, air inside the drying chamber receives thermal energy
from the solar collector surface and transfers it to the adjacent layer of air due to the
temperature gradient between layers. The hot air is circulated to the crop surface
either due to buoyancy of the pressure difference or due to the combined effect of
both. In active solar dryers, hot air from the solar thermal collector unit is circulated
using external source such as fans or blowers. Furthermore, these dryers are clas-
siﬁed into three major subgroups, namely, direct mode, indirect mode, and mixed
mode [16, 17]. A solar thermal energy-collection unit is integrated to the roof or
walls of the drying chamber in direct-mode type of solar dryers, whereas the solar
12.2

thermal energy-collection unit and drying chamber are separately operated in the
indirect-mode type of solar dryers. The mixed-mode type of solar dryer uses some
features of the direct-mode type of solar dryer and some features of the
indirect-mode type of solar dryer in a single unit.
The energy needed for the forced circulation of air is provided by external
electrical sources, but in the case of solar dryers integrated with a PV module, the
DC electrical energy generated from the PV modules is used to operate the fan or
blower. Active solar dryers are more controlled and ﬂexible because they can be
regulated to a desired drying rate for faster and better drying compared with passive
solar dryers [18–20].
12.2.1
Open-Sun Drying (OSD)
In open-Sun drying (OSD), some part of incoming solar energy I(t) in the form of
short-wavelength radiation is reﬂected back to the atmosphere, and the remaining
radiation is selectively (different absorptivity ac
ð
Þ of a crop surface pertains to the
color of crop) absorbed by the crop surface. A fraction of absorbed radiation
increases the temperature of crop surface and rest is performed inside the interior of
crop. Due to temperature rise, thermal energy is transfer from the crop surface to the
ambient air by way of radiation (long wavelength) and convection in addition to
mass transfer due to evaporation. The rate of convective heat transfer depends on
the velocity of wind blowing above the crop surface (Fig. 12.2): The greater the

velocity of the wind, the greater the convective heat transfer. The evaporation
process removes moist air from the crop surface and is responsible for crop-drying.
The thermal energy conducted inside the crop raises the temperature of the interior
of the crop resulting vapor formation inside the crop. Water vapors diffuse from the
interior toward the outer surface of the crop and evaporate to the ambient air.
Initially, moisture removal from the crop surface is higher due to the wet crop
surface, but when moisture is removed from the outer layer of the crop, the rate of
drying depends on diffusion (which depends on the type of crop) of water vapor
from the interior toward the outer crop surface [5, 21].
Thermal modeling
(a) Analysis in quasi-steady state
The following assumptions are made for OSD:
• The heat capacity of a tray of area, At, and moist air are negligible.
• There is no heat conduction between particles.
• Heat ﬂow is one dimensional.
• There is an approximation of thin-layer drying.

Equation (12.15) is an expression of equivalent solair temperature ðTsaeÞ as
deﬁned in Sect. 10.6. It is also important to mention that the numerical values of the
surrounding moist temperature may or may not be higher than the crop temperature.
It will depend on the hardness of the crop.
After knowing Tc and Te from Eqs. (12.14) and (12.15), the amount of mass
evaporated can be determined either from Eq. (12.3) or (12.11).
Evaluation of Convective Heat Transfer ðhcÞ
According to Sect. 3.3.3, the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient ðhcÞ from the crop
surface and the surrounding moist air in OSD (Eq. 12.3) can be determined as
follows:
Nu ¼ hcX
Kv
¼ CðGr:PrÞn
or
hc ¼ Kv
X CðGr:PrÞn
ð12:16Þ
where Nu, Pr and Gr are the Nusselt, Prandtl, and Grashof numbers deﬁned in
Chap. 3 (Eqs. 3.22a, c, and d). The numerical values of C and n depend of the type
of crop to be dried, and these are constants for a given crop. Kv and X are the
thermal conductivity of humid air and the characteristic dimension, respectively.
The amount of moisture evaporated ðmevÞ in time ‘t’ and a given tray area At can
be obtained from Eq. (12.3). After the substitution of Eq. (12.16) in Eq. (12.3), one

Experimental observations for open-sun drying (OSD)
For drying of the various crops, a wire mesh (porous) tray of 0.45 × 0.19 m size
was constructed and placed on an electronic balance with the same of space below
the tray to ﬂow the air from the bottom of tray through the crop to the ambient air.
A digital temperature indicator with a least count of 0.1 °C with a copper-
constantan thermocouple was used to measure (i) the crop temperature ðTcÞ, the
surrounding moist temperature ðTeÞ, and the ambient air ðTaÞ at different time points
at interval of 15 min. The relative humidity of moist air just above the crop surface
was measured with a dial-type hygrometer (least count of 1). The mass evaporated

was estimated using an electronic balance (least count 0.1 g). The design param-
eters of the drying tray to determine convective the mass transfer is given in
Table 12.2.
The crop was placed above the wire mesh tray with different copper–constantan
thermocouples to measure the various temperatures, and the whole system was
further kept on the electronic balance. A hygrometer was kept above the crop
surface with a sensing element facing the crop surface. For every observation, the
hygrometer was kept over the crop surface for 2 min to record the humidity of
moist vapor. The whole experimental assembly was kept in the open Sun. The effect
of wind velocity was neglected during the experiment. For consecutive observa-
tions, the difference between the crops’ mass gives the amount of evaporated water
during that speciﬁed time period. The experiment was repeatedly performed to
obtain the most accurate results. Different treatments were given for different crops
before performing the experiment. Various treatments and the densities of different
crops are listed in Table 12.3.
The other parameters, including the physical properties of the various crops, are
given in Table 12.4.
Experiments were performed during the summer months in the year 1999.

The measured experimental data for a typical crop, namely, green peas, is
reported in Table 12.5.
The experiment was performed on June 15, 1999, between 11.00 and 13.30 h for
the climatic conditions of Delhi. The variation of the solar intensity was found to be
between 990 and 1020 W/m2. The Ti is an average temperature of the crop surface
and the surrounding moist temperatures, which was used to determine Gr (3.22d)
and Pr (3.22c), respectively. Using Eqs. (12.21) and (12.22) and the data in
Table 12.5, the values of C and n can be determined and are given in Table 12.6 for
green peas. In addition, the convective mass-transfer coefﬁcient is also given in the
same ﬁgure. Different crops have different thermo-physical properties resulting
different heat- and mass-transfer coefﬁcients for different crops.
The average values of C and n of Table 12.6 for green peas, along with data of
other crops, is also given in Table 12.4.
According to Anwar and Tiwari [22], Eqs. (12.7), (12.10), and (12.11) are
computed by using the data in Tables 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6 for the crop

shown in Fig. 12.3. It was observed that except for the surrounding temperature,
there is good agreement between experimental and theoretical prediction. In the
case of the surrounding temperature, there is possibility of error due to improper
position of the sensor to measure the surrounding moist temperature.

12.2.2
Direct Solar Drying (DSD)
Open-Sun drying is not hygienic due to dust and insects and losses due to birds, etc.
It is also a slow drying process. To solve these problems, the concept of the
greenhouse effect was used. It is the ﬁrst scientiﬁc step for crop-drying using solar
energy. In this case, the crop is placed inside a cabinet box covered with an inclined
glazed roof. The cabinet box has openings at its base and at the top of the large
vertical wall for air inlet and outlet, respectively. Thus, it is also referred to as
“cabinet drying” as shown in Fig. 12.4. Some part of the short-wavelength solar
radiation transmitted from the glazed cover of the cabinet is reﬂected back, and the
rest is absorbed by the crop surface. The absorbed solar radiation heats the crop
surface and crop start emitting long-wavelength radiation, which is trapped by the
glazed cabinet covers. The blocked radiation further raises the crop temperature,
which results in faster drying compared with OSD. In addition to creating a
greenhouse effect inside the cabinet dryer, the glazed covers also reduces con-
vective losses to the ambient air. The moisture formed due to evaporation is taken
away by the air. The air enters from the bottom of the cabinet dryer and takes away
the moisture from the opening provided at the top of the vertical wall. This phe-
nomenon is referred to as “natural convection drying” without any use of additional
source of energy.
Thermal analysis
The energy-balance equations of a cabinet dryer (Fig. 12.4) can be written with the
following assumptions:
502
12
Solar Crop Dryers

• Heat capacities of different components (glass cover, tray, drying chamber wall)
and the air are negligible.
• The volume of crop is assumed to be constant.
• The conduction between particles is negligible.
• There is no heat ﬂow and stratiﬁcation inside the crop.
• Moisture is immediately removed from the chamber, i.e., condensation inside
the chamber is negligible.
The energy-balance equations are as follows:
For the crop surface
Using the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, the rate of thermal energy available to the
crop is equal to the rate of thermal energy stored inside the crop and the rate of
thermal energy lost to chamber by radiation, convection, and evaporation.

chamber by radiation, convection, and evaporation is transferred outside through

12.2.3
Indirect Solar Drying (ISD) [23]
This is also referred to as a “conventional drying unit.” In this case, there are two
units, namely, a heating unit and a drying unit as shown in Fig. 12.5a. In this case,
drying is more controlled and homogeneous (resulting in a better quality of dried
product) because the crops are not directly exposed to solar radiation. Here solar
energy is collected and converted into thermal energy by the use of solar air heater.
The solar air heater is further integrated with the drying chamber. The hot air from
the inclined solar air heater is allowed to ﬂow in a natural mode through a wet crop
placed inside the drying chamber. Here, the heated air passes through the crop after
transferring the heat to the crop, thus heating it. The water inside the crop gets
evaporated and is allowed to pass through the vent provided at the top of the drying
chamber.
In a natural ventilated indirect solar dryer (ISD), the drying time is longer due to
the fact that the rate of moisture evaporated from the crop is not immediately
transferred from the drying chamber to the ambient air through the vent, particularly
at noon, and hence the drying time is signiﬁcantly affected. Therefore, an indirect
solar-dryer (ISD) system operating under forced mode of operation is most
appropriate.
For
the

operation,
an
photovoltaic
thermal
(PVT) integrated with mixed-mode dryer was developed as shown in Fig. 12.5b.
In this case, too, there are two components, namely, a PVT solar air collector
(Chap. 9) and a drying chamber. A PVT solar air heater consists of semitransparent
PV modules [35 W and (0.65 m × 0.55 m)] integrated with a conventional
ﬂat-plate air collector. Solar radiation falling on the packing area (solar cells) of a
semitransparent PV module generates electricity. Solar radiation falling on the
nonpacking area of the semitransparent PV module is absorbed by the blackened
absorber plate of the solar air-collector unit. Air inside the duct of a solar air heater
receives thermal energy from the blackened absorbing plate and is thus heated. The
hot air is fed to the drying chamber (for drying the crop) by the DC fan at the outlet
of the solar air heater. The DC fan is operated by the electricity produced from the
semitransparent PV module. Here it important to mention that the speed of fan (and
thus the rate of withdrawal of moisture) depends on the level of solar radiation,
which is a required condition of such sustainable dryer. In this case, the rate of
removal of moisture from the drying chamber will match with rate of removal of
moisture from the crop.

A drying chamber [with dimensions (0.65 m × 0.30 m × 0.66 m)] is made of a
wood, but the front side is glazed [with plain glass of dimensions (4 mm thickness,
0.65 m × 0.4 m in size)], which allows solar radiation to fall directly on the crop
surface. There are three layers of trays [with dimensions (0.65 m × 0.26 m ×
0.04 m)] are stacked at equal spacing (0.15 m) inside the drying chamber. The
products to be dried are kept on theses trays.
The above-mentioned components are integrated with each other as shown in
Fig. 12.5c.
The design parameters of PVT mixed mode dryer are given in Table 12.7.
12.2.4
PVT Greenhouse Dryer [24]
A PVT greenhouse dryer consists of eight semitransparent PV modules with each
having a packing factor of 0.425 and power of 35 Wp with an effective area of
1.2 m × 0.54 m. Each PV module is connected in series to produce 280 Wp of
electricity, which is used to operate four fans for forced mode of operation. Solar
radiation transmitted through non-packing area is a direct gain received by the crop
placed on the top tray for heating. Thermal energy associated with the solar cell is
convected to the inside enclosure of a PVT dryer for indirect heating of the
crop. A clean PVT dryer is shown in Fig. 12.6. The PVT dryer was installed at top
of wind tower of the SODHA BERS’ complex, (Varanasi, India) so that preheated
air can circulate from the bottom of the dryer to the upper vent through crops placed
on different trays. This helps cause faster drying.
The design parameters of a PVT dryer are given in Table 12.8. There are four
AC fans of rating (20 W, 1100 rpm) that are at the top of the north side to remove
moist air from inside the dryer for fast evaporation from the crop placed on different
trays. There is also provision of two glass doors at the east side through which the
removal of trays, as per requirement at regular intervals, to determine the loss of

The structure of the PVT dryer is permanently ﬁxed at a vertical foundation wall
with a galvanized iron angle ﬁtted with nuts and bolts. Furthermore, a semitrans-
parent PV module is ﬁxed at the top of the structure with an aluminum L-strip, nut,
and bolts to have minimum resistance. The output of the PV module is connected to
an 18 V battery through a solar-charge controller. The output of the battery is
further connected to the fan through an inverter. The charge controller and inverter
are packed in one box for simple operation. The trays are provided with side
support in each layer. The proposed system can be used to dry a minimum of 12
items at a time. The east view of a clean hybrid PVT dryer is shown in Fig. 12.7a.
A block diagram of whole assembly of a PVT greenhouse dryer, including a

Reverse-Absorber Cabinet Dryer
A cross-sectional view of a reverse-absorber cabinet dryer (RACD) is shown in
Fig. 12.8. This can also be an indirect (Fig. 12.8a) or mixed-mode (Fig. 12.8b)
solar dryer. If the top inclined surface is metallic, then it is an indirect solar dryer; it
becomes mixed-mode if the top inclined surface is glazed. Goyal and Tiwari [25]
proposed and analyzed the RACD for drying purposes. The drying chamber in a
RACD is similar to that of conventional cabinet dryer, but it receives direct radi-
ation from the top glazing cover as well as thermal energy from the bottom of the
dryer using a reverse-absorber ﬂat-plate air collector. A reverse absorber ﬂat-plate
air collector is ﬁxed below an optimized depth ðﬃ0:05 mÞ from the bottom of the
drying chamber. The air gap between the bottom of the drying chamber and the top
of the reverse-absorber ﬂat-plate air collector serve as the air duct for the heating of
air. Hot air passes through the crop placed on wire mess or trays and thus dries the

crop. Solar radiation is collected using a glass aperture ﬁtted with a cylindrical
reﬂector. The aperture is inclined at an angle equal to the latitude to receive
maximum annual solar radiation throughout the year. The area of the glass cover
and absorber are kept the same as area of the bottom surface of the drying chamber.
The working principle of this RACD is different from that of a conventional cabinet
dryer because in this case solar radiation is transmitted from the inclined glass cover
and then reﬂected to the selectively-coated reverse-absorber plate. The radiation
absorbed by the absorber plate is converted into thermal energy. Air in between the
absorber plate and the bottom of the cabinet dryer receives thermal energy by
convection and heats the crop surface. Thereafter, air leaves the drying chamber by
removing moist air from the upper vent at the top of the drying chamber.
Thermal modeling
Referring to Fig. 12.8, the energy-balance equations for different components of an
indirect inverse absorber cabinet dryer for thin layer are as follows:

where s; q0; ap, and I0 are the transmittivity of the inclined glass, the reﬂectivity of

radiative heat-transfer coefﬁcient between the plate ðTpÞ and the ﬂuid ðTfÞ and
between the plate ðTpÞ and the crop ðTcÞ respectively. Ut is an overall heat-transfer

Fig. 12.9. From this ﬁgure, one can conclude that there is an improvement of
approximately 10 % in the performance of a RACD due to a reduction in heat
losses.
Example 12.2 Determine the expression for the rate of heat transfer from the air to
the crop for RACD.

Eq. (12.26),

This gives

Finally, on substituting Tf into hfcðTf  TcÞ, the rate of heat transfer from the
ﬂuid to the crop surface can be obtained as follows:

Heat-utilization factor
The quantity of heat used in any process is governed by the heat-utilization factor
(H.U.F), which is deﬁned as the ratio of heat used to the heat supplied.

Coefﬁcient of performance

The hourly variation of coefﬁcient of performance (C.O.P.) and heat-utilization
factor (H.U.F.) is shown in Fig. 12.10a. H.U.F. ﬁrst increases rapidly and is then

saturated by afternoon due to the fact that in the morning hours more moisture
content results in more heat transfer from the ﬂuid to the crop, whereas in afternoon
it is decreased. The C.O.P. decreases as the time of the day progresses owing to the
lesser level of solar radiation [resulting in a lesser value of ðTf  TaÞ] in the later
hours of the day.

The overall daily thermal efﬁciency can be obtained by taking the ratio of

energy received by absorber. Mathematically it is expressed as:

The overall daily thermal efﬁciency also determines the drying rate and time.
The greater the overall daily thermal efﬁciency, is the greater the drying rate and the
less the drying time. The variation of drying rate with moisture content is shown in
Fig. 12.10b. This shows that the drying rate is greater for greater moisture content
as desired.

Solar Distillation
Abstract Solar distillation is a process used to purify brackish/saline water into
potable water using solar energy in underdeveloped region with hard ground water.
The system gives a better performance under forced (active) mode of operation.
Passive and active solar stills are economical from the point of view of potable
water and industry.

13.1
Importance of Solar Distillation
Potable (drinking) water, along with food and air, is a basic necessity for human
beings for survival. Potable water shortage is a serious problem in developing and
underdeveloping countries due to either a lack of water or polluted underground
water. Human beings, along with all animals, birds, and ﬁsh, etc., are dependent on
rivers, lakes, and underground water reservoirs for potable water. However, the
pollution of rivers, lakes, and underground water by industrial waste has caused a
scarcity of fresh/potable water near lakes and rivers. Global surveys show that
approximately 79 % of water available on Earth is salty as seawater. Approximately
20 % of underground water is brackish, and only 1 % is freshwater. Many devel-
oping and underdeveloping countries have a prime objective to provide potable
water supply to each and every citizen. For example, in India, the Rajiv Gandhi
National Drinking Water Mission is actively involved in promoting projects aimed
at supplying drinking water in remote villages where people travel <30 km for
freshwater.
Unlike conventional distillation techniques, solar distillation uses abundantly
available solar energy for the distillation of brackish or saline water to obtain
potable water. Conventional distillation techniques generally used fossil fuels for
distillation process and are energy intensive. Solar distillation is a simple tech-
nology that uses nonpollutant solar energy as input energy. This technology does

not require very skilled labour and requires very little maintenance. It can be used at
any place without much difﬁculty.
A classiﬁcation of published literature on solar distillation is given in Fig. 13.1
[1–3]. The details of some designs of solar stills are discussed along with their
performance in following sections.

Working Principle of Solar Distillation
Figure 13.2 shows the various energy losses at different components in a con-
ventional double-slope passive solar distiller unit. It has an airtight basin. The
basin with a rectangular base is currently constructed using (i) concrete/cement for a
larger plant and (ii) ﬁbre-reinforced plastic (FRP) for a smaller plant. There is a top
cover of transparent material such as glass, plastic, etc. The inner portion of the
rectangular basin is blackened to efﬁciently absorb short-wavelength solar radiation
after transmission through the transparent cover. There is a provision to collect the
distillate output (yield) at the lower end of the transparent cover. Following is the
working principle of the solar double-slope distiller unit.
The short-wavelength solar radiation [I(t)] is transmitted through the transparent
cover inside an enclosure of a solar still. The transmitted solar radiation sg½IðtÞ is
partially reﬂected ½R0
wIðtÞ and partially absorbed ½a0

basin. The remaining solar radiation reaches to the blackened absorber/basin liner
where it is absorbed and heats the blackened absorber plate. Most of the thermal
energy from the blackened absorber plate is transferred to the water mass through
convection, and a small fraction is lost to the ambient air through the insulation on
the bottom of the solar still. As the water temperature increases, heat is transferred
from the water to the glass cover by (i) radiation (_qrw), (ii) convection (_qcw), and
(iii) evaporation (_qew). The evaporated water (without impurity) ﬁrst saturates the
enclosure and then condenses on inner glass cover by releasing the heat of con-
densation to the glass cover. The glass cover loses thermal energy from the top
surface to the ambient air by way of convection and radiation. The condensed
droplets on the top glass cover trickle down to the lower ends of the inclined glass
cover due to gravity and are stored in containers.
The fraction of short-wavelength solar radiation is shown in Fig. 13.2 at different
components of the east distiller unit. These fractions can be mathematically
expressed as follows [4]:
The fraction of incoming solar radiation absorbed by glass cover is given as
follows:

where L and As are the latent heat of condensation (J/kg °C) and the area of the

ðW/m2 CÞ:
(b) Active solar still
It is important to mention here that the rate of distilled water yield will depend
on the temperature difference between the water and the glass cover, i.e.,
ðTw  TgÞ: One of the methods to increase the temperature difference between
the water and the glass cover is to increase the water temperature by feeding
some additional thermal energy into the basin of the solar still. Such a
solar-distillation unit is referred to as an “active solar still.”
In the present chapter, we describe an external thermal energy fed by ﬂat-plate
collectors integrated with the basin of the solar-distillation unit. In this case, an
instantaneous thermal efﬁciency can be written as follows:

It is to be noted that the operating temperature of the water in the basin of
active solar still will be higher than the operating temperature of that in a
passive solar still; hence, an instantaneous thermal efﬁciency of the active
solar still will be lower compared with that of the passive solar still, i.e.,

Basic Heat Transfer
The basic heat-transfer process in a solar-distillation unit (Fig. 13.2) is classiﬁed as
follows:
(a) External: External heat transfer includes heat transfer from the outer surfaces
of the solar still to the ambient air. The mutually independent mechanisms
involved in external heat transfer are conduction, convection, and radiation.
(b) Internal: The heat transfer tacking place between the water’s top surface and
the glass cover falls under the category of “internal heat transfer.” Internal
heat-transfer mechanism involve convection, evaporation, and radiation.
Evaporative heat transfer depends on convection heat transfer, but radiative
heat transfer is independent from both convective and evaporative heat transfer.
13.4.1
External Heat Transfer
According to Chap. 5, external heat transfer consists of (a) transfer from the inner
glass cover to the ambient air mainly due to conduction, convection, and radiation’
and (b) transfer from the basin liner to the ambient air through the bottom and side
insulation.

From the inner glass to the ambient air
In this case, it is important to mention that heat transfer due to conduction through
the glass cover can be neglected as proven in Chap. 5 (Sect. 5.5.4); hence, there will
be only convective and radiative heat transfer in W/m2 from the outer glass cover to
the ambient air, which can be expressed as
_qga ¼ h2ðTg  TaÞ
ð13:6Þ
where h2 ¼ 5:7 þ 3:8 is similar to Eq. (3.29a).
From the bottom insulation to the ambient air
In this case, an expression for a convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient from the bottom
insulation to the ambient air can be considered by
hb ¼ 2:8 þ 3V
ð13:7Þ
similar to Eq. (3.29b).
In the above equation, radiative heat transfer is neglected because the bottom of
the insulation faces the surface of the ground.
13.4.2
Internal Heat Transfer [2]
This section covers in detail internal heat-transfer processes, which includes radi-
ation, convection, and evaporation.
Radiative heat transfer
In this case, the water surface and the glass cover are considered to be parallel
planes to take the radiation shape factor as 1. This approximation requires a small
inclination of the glass cover of the solar-distillation unit. The rate of radiative heat
transfer ð_qrwÞ (Eq. 3.34a) from the water surface to the glass cover is given by

or

Convective heat transfer
Convective heat transfer occurs between the water surface and the humid air inside
the solar still. It depends on buoyancy, density gradient of the humid air, and
temperature gradient in the different layers of air:
The rate of heat transfer from the water surface to the glass cover ð_qcwÞ in
(W/m2) by convection can be determined by
_qcw ¼ hcwðTw  TgÞ
ð13:9aÞ
where the convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient, hcw, can be determined by the
relation
Nu ¼ hcwdf
Kf
¼ CðGrPrÞn
or
hcw ¼ Kf
df
CðGrPrÞn
ð13:9bÞ
where an expression for the Grashof and Prandtl numbers (Chap. 3) depends on the
physical properties of moist air; and Kf and df are thermal conductivity of water in
the basin and characteristic dimension of the basin in the solar still, respectively.
In the Grashof number, the following expression of DT0 should be used [1]
DT0 ¼

expression for the Grashof number is reduced to

ð13:9dÞ
As can be seen from Eq. (13.9d), the Grashof number depends on the average
gap between the glass cover and the water surface (Table 13.4) for a typical
operating-temperature range. The values of C and n for different ranges of Grashof
number are given in Table 3.5. For the typical operating-temperature range and

ð13:11bÞ
For a hot surface facing upward, C = 0.54 and n = 0.25 (Table 3.3). The Gr and
Pr can be determined at the average water temperature in the basin. The numerical
values of hbw will be on the order of three digits, and one can consider the value as
≥100 W/m2 °C.

Overall Heat-Transfer Coefﬁcient
There are basically two overall heat-transfer coefﬁcients: the overall top-loss
coefﬁcient and the overall bottom-loss coefﬁcient, which can be expressed using the
thermal circuit diagram shown in Fig. 13.3.
(a) Overall top-loss coefﬁcient

13.5.1
Passive Solar Still
In this case, generally the condensing cover temperature is reduced by changing the
design of solar still as follows:
(a) Solar still with passive condenser
In a conventional passive solar still, the condensing glass cover acts as the
input (solar radiation) as well as output surface (hourly yield). The latent heat
of condensation released by the evaporated water to the glass condensing
cover increases the condensing-surface temperature. If the rate of release of the
latent heat of condensation is not equal to the rate of release of heat from the
condensing cover to the ambient air, then the temperature of the condensing
cover starts increasing, which reduces the temperature difference between the
water and the condensing cover and hence decreases the hourly yield. In this
design, the condensing chamber is separated from the evaporated water
chamber in the basin as shown in Fig. 13.4. In this case, the condensing
chamber is made of conducting material to release the latent heat of con-
densation as quickly as possible to have a minimum condensing-cover tem-
perature. There is very little condensation on the sloped glass surface;
condensation mainly takes place in the attached passive condenser. This is due
to the purging of vapor into the condenser. Because most of the latent heat of
condensation is given to the passive condenser, the temperature difference
between condenser and the water is greater, which causes faster evaporation
and increases distillate output.
To further increase hourly yield, a provision for the natural circulation of
vapor can be made between the condensing chamber and the evaporating
chamber.

(b) Double-condensing chamber solar still
The design of the solar still with a passive condenser was modiﬁed by
Agrawal
and
Tiwari
[8],
and
the
modiﬁed
design
is
known
as
a
“double-condensing
chamber”
(DCS).
A
schematic
view
of
a
double-condensing chamber solar still (DCS) is shown in Fig. 13.5. The
double-condensing chamber (DCS) has two chambers: chamber I and chamber
II. They are separated by an insulating partition wall. The condensing cover
for chamber II is made of stainless steel. The shading of chamber II is per-
formed with cardboard covered with black plastic so that it does not receive
solar radiation directly. A mirror is also ﬁtted on the partition wall facing
chamber I to reﬂect most of the solar radiation falling on it toward the water
surface in the basin. A double-glass cover is used to ensure minimum upward
heat loss and maximum vapor temperature for maximum pressure difference
between the two chambers.
For faster discharge of heat from the metallic condensing cover, a water-ﬂow
arrangement over it was also made.
(c) Conical solar still
In a conical solar still, the condensing surface area is signiﬁcantly greater
compared with that of a conventional passive solar still (Fig. 13.6); hence, the
rate of heat loss from the condensing surface area to the ambient air is more for
the lower temperature of the condensing cover ðTgÞ. There will be higher
hourly yield in this solar still. Brackish water is fed in a transparent twin-cone
arrangement. Solar radiation is transmitted through the transparent enclosure
to heat the water. It causes evaporation and then condensation on the inner

Other Designs of Passive/Active Solar Stills
535

face of the transparent cone. Condensed water droplets slide past in the water
pan and are collected in the bottom cone.
(d) Inverted-absorber solar still
The schematic view of an inverted-absorber solar still is shown in Fig. 13.7. In
this type of solar still, the surface receiving the input energy (solar radiation) is
separated from the condensing surface unlike a conventional solar still. Solar
radiation is received from below the absorbing plate, and condensation takes
place on the inner surface of the metallic condensing cover. The metallic
condensing cover can also be replaced by a transparent condensing cover. The
absorbing surface area can be a selective surface for high absorbtion and low
emissivity to minimise heat losses from the bottom. For a metallic condensing
cover in an inverted-absorber solar still, there is an additional advantage of
increased upward heat transfer to the atmosphere as well as low maintenance
costs. A HIGH absorptive surface and increased upward heat transfer to the
atmosphere results in a higher yield. This design consists of a cylindrical
reﬂector integrated with the solar still. It is based on the concept of an
inverted-absorber ﬂat-plate collector.
As shown in Fig. 13.7, solar radiation after transmission and multiple
reﬂections by the reﬂecting surface reaches the selective absorber plate
Fig. 13.6 Schematic diagram of a conical solar still
536
13
Solar Distillation

through the glass plate G2. Most of the solar radiation is absorbed by the
selective surface, and then it is converted into thermal energy. Most of the
thermal energy is transferred to the water mass above the absorber plate where
the water is heated. A very small part of it is lost to the atmosphere through the
glass plate G1. Furthermore, heat from the water mass is lost to the metallic
condensing cover in the form of radiation, convection, and evaporation. The
evaporated water releases it's latent heat of vaporaization to the glass cover
and condenses. The condensed droplets trickle down under gravitational force
and collect through the channel at the lower end of the inclined glass cover.
The heat transferred to the condensing cover is lost to the ambient air through
radiation and convection at a faster rate compared with a conventional solar;
this is still due to the metallic cover rather than the glass.
(e) Multi-wick solar still [9]
A cross-sectional view of multi-wick solar still is shown in Fig. 13.8. The
structure of this type of solar still is made of an insulated ﬁbre‒reinforced
plastic (FRP) material. It can also be any light-insulating material. There is
water storage tank at one end. Furthermore, a ﬂat surface made of the same
material, with optimum inclination, is attached to it to support the multi-wick
system as shown in the ﬁgure. One end of the blackened multi-wick system is
dipped in the water of the storage tank, and the other ends are spread over the
ﬂat surface. Each layer of blackened jut cloth wick is separated by a thin
plastic sheet so that each jute cloth acts independently. Before arranging the
blackened multi-wick jute cloth over a ﬂat surface, it should be wetted so that
capillary action starts immediately. In this design, the storage effect due to the
water ﬁlm over the jute cloth is neglected. The inclined-wick solar still has
black porous fabric that acts as an absorber. Water is fed at a slow rate through
the porous absorber by capillary action of the jute cloth placed in the water-
storage tank. There is a glass cover over the jute cloth, which acts as a
condensing cover. The water in the absorber (jute cloth) is evaporated

13.5
Other Designs of Passive/Active Solar Stills
537

immediately after receiving solar radiation and condenses on the inner surface
of the glass cover. Such a solar still even works under diffuse climatic
conditions.
(f) Multiple-effect solar still
The latent heat of condensation released to the condensing cover is lost to the
ambient air by convection and radiation in the passive solar still. If the latent
heat of condensation released to the condensing cover is used further for
distillation purpose, as performed in the double-basin solar still, then the
overall yield is increased. This process can be repeated a number of times. In
contrast, the rate of solar radiation reaching the basin is also affected

538

Solar Distillation

signiﬁcantly. In addition, there will be a problem of maintenance in this type
of solar still; hence, it is never recommended for producing distilled water.
The multi-effect solar still has more than two basins.
13.5.2
Active Solar Still [10]
As mentioned previously, the hourly yield is directly proportional to the tempera-
ture difference between the water and the internal glass cover (condensing cover).
The temperature of the water mass can be increased by supplying thermal energy
from the external active thermal-energy source. Such a solar still is referred to as an
“active solar still.”
The different arrangements for feeding thermal energy from the external sources
are classiﬁed as follows:
(a) Nocturnal production: In this case, the waste hot water available from
industries is fed into the basin once in a day.
(b) Preheated water applications: The feeding of hot water available from
industries is fed into the basin at a constant ﬂow rate.
(c) Distillation with a collector panel: The feeding of hot water from a ﬂat-plate
collector is fed into the basin by integration. It can be either a ﬂat plate or
concentrator.
The methodologies and performance of the active solar still will be brieﬂy
discussed in the following subsections.
(a) Nocturnal production
The hourly yield from any solar still in the absence of solar radiation is known
as “nocturnal production.” A conventional passive solar still with large water
depth in the basin stores a large amount of thermal energy from solar radiation
during the day due to its large heat capacity. During low solar radiation, the
hot water (heated from a source other than solar radiation, i.e., nocturnal
production) can be supplied to the basin for higher yield. The ﬁrst parametric
studies were performed by Malik and Tran [11] with a mathematical model for
predicting nocturnal distillate under controlled environment conditions.
Madhuri and Tiwari [12] studied the effect of feeding hot water in the morning
(once in a day) on the performance of a conventional passive solar still. They
reported that the daily distillate output increases with water depth in the basin
due to the nocturnal effect. This is the reverse of the performance of a passive
solar still (passive).
(b) Preheated water application
Preheated waste hot water available from industries/thermal-power plants can
be used in the basin as raw water. The use of preheated waste hot brine water
in a tubular solar still is fed at a constant ﬂow rate; this was studied by Tiwari
13.5
Other Designs of Passive/Active Solar Stills
539

and Kumar [13], the researchers found that the solar still with low water depth
acts in the passive mode even during the daytime. Such a condition is not
effective during the night hours due to there being no storage effect. Therefore,
the solar-distillation unit can be used under both passive as well as active
mode depending on the water depth in the basin under nocturnal mode.
Intermittent as well as continuous feeding of preheated hot water is used by
many scientists.
(c) Distillation with a collector panel
In this case, additional hot water from a collector panel is fed into the basin of
a passive-mode solar still to obtain a higher water temperature. In this case, the
collector panel is integrated with the basin of a solar-distillation unit. The
collector panel may be either a conventional /PVT water collector (Chap. 5) or
a CPC-PVT collector (Chap. 6). Furthermore, integration of the collector panel
may be done either directly or through a heat exchanger depending on the type
of ﬂuid used in the closed loop. As shown in Fig. 13.9, a PVT water-collector
panel is integrated with a basin-type single-slope solar still. The connecting
pipes are completely insulated so that there is no heat loss to the ambient air
during water circulation. The water in the basin is heated by solar energy
through the inclined glass cover as explained in the working principle (pre-
vious text). The water in the basin is additionally heated by the ﬂat-plate
collector. This results in higher evaporation and more distillate output. Water
circulation through the collector panel is performed during sunshine hours. It
is closed during off-sunshine hours to avoid heat losses.
As shown in Fig. 13.10, a collector panel consists of a number of collectors
integrated with the basin of solar still. The water temperature in the basin can be
further increased, hence the increase in distillate output. The optimum number of

collectors for maximum distillate output depends on the number of parameters as
follows:
(a) water mass in the basin;
(b) mass-ﬂow rate in the collector loop’
(c) climatic conditions; and
(d) number of effects, etc.
Distillation unit with a hybrid system
In this case, distillate yield can be increased by exhausting moist air from the basin
enclosure to
the condensing
chamber using
an electrically
operated
fan.
Figure 13.11 shows a solar still (single slope) integrated with an active component.
Electricity runs the active components (blower and condenser), which can be met
using a photovoltaic system or integration of a photovoltaic system with a
solar-distillation system to make it a hybrid system.
13.6
Heat and Mass Transfer: A New Approach [14]
In Sect. 13.4, basic heat and mass transfer in relation to the solar-distillation system
is discussed. However, most transfer of heat and mass has the following limitations:
(a) The inclination of the condensing cover is small to make parallel the evapo-

It is well known that evaporative heat transfer plays a dominant role compared
with other modes of internal heat transfer; hence, we will discuss only evaporative
heat transfer in this section. Furthermore, evaporative heat transfer directly depends
on an internal convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient. It is important to mention here
that the evaporating/condensing cover may not be parallel as can be seen in other
solar-still designs (Sect. 13.5). Therefore, there is need for further study into an
internal convective heat transfer without any limitations.
According to Eq. (13.10a), the hourly distillate output per square metre from a
solar-distillation unit can be written as follows:
_mew ¼ _qew  3600
L
¼ 0:0162  hcw  ðPw  PgÞ  3600
L
ð13:17Þ
where an expression for hcw is given by Eq. (13.9b).
After substituting an expression from Eq. (13.9b) for hcw in Eq. (13.17) and
rearranging, one gets
_mew
R ¼ CðGr:PrÞn

where
R ¼ 0:0162  ðPw  PgÞ  kf  3600
L  df
Now Eq. (13.18) can be written in the following form:
y ¼ axb
ð13:19Þ
where y ¼ _mew
R ; x ¼ Gr:Pr; a ¼ C and b ¼ n:
By considering log on both the sides of the Eq. (13.19), it can be written in the
form of a straight-line equation as
y0 ¼ b0x0 þ a0
ð13:20Þ
where
y0 ¼ ln y; b0 ¼ b; x0 ¼ ln x; a0 ¼ ln a
Using the linear regression analysis method, coefﬁcients a′ and b′ in Eq. (13.20)
can be obtained as
a0 ¼

where N is the number of experimental observations under steady-state conditions.
Under a quasi steady-state conditions, N becomes N + 1 (Example 13.1).
After determining a′ and b′ from the above equation, C′ and n′ can be obtained
by the following expression:
C ¼ expða0Þ and n ¼ b0
Once the value of C and n are known, a convective heat-transfer coefﬁcient can
be obtained from Eq. (13.9b).
The procedure for evaluating an evaporative heat-transfer coefﬁcient is the same
as discussed in Sect. 13.4.
It should be noted that if the hourly rate of distillate output ð _mewÞ, water, and
condensing cover temperature is known experimentally for any design of solar still
as
discussed
in
Sect. 13.5,
then
the
internal
convective
and
evaporative
heat-transfer coefﬁcient can be determined without any limitation of shape of the
condensing cover and operating temperature.

Thermal Modelling
Here it important to mention that the passive solar still is a special case of active
solar still if the feeding of external thermal energy is made to be zero. Hence, we
will discuss the thermal modelling of active solar-distillation unit,which can also be
used for a passive solar still. Furthermore, it is observed that in an active solar still
the rate of condensation is much higher than the rate of heat loss from the con-
densing cover to the ambient air, and the glass cover temperature becomes sig-
niﬁcantly greater in case of an active solar still. Thus, the inner glass-cover
temperature is greater than that of the outer glass-cover temperature. In thermal
modelling, we make one of most important assumptions for the same inner and
outer condensing cover temperature. The schematic diagram of a single-slope active
solar still is shown in Fig. 13.9.
Energy balances: Heat ﬂuxes at various component of a double-slope passive
solar still facing east‒west are shown in Fig. 13.2. The ﬂuxes are the same for a
single-slope south-facing solar still. The only difference will be the rate of incident
solar radiation in each case.
The energy-balance equations (in W/m2) for different components of a solar still
have been written with the following assumptions:
(i)
The inclination of the glass condensing cover is very small.
(ii)
The thermal heat capacity of the different components (glass cover, absorbing
blackened surface, side insulation, and bottom insulation) is very small.
(iii)
The active solar-distillation unit is airtight.
For the glass Cover: The glass cover receives energy from the absorbed solar
radiation and from the hot water in the basin. Under steady-state conditions, this
energy will be balanced by energy lost to the air by radiation and convection.

Approximate solution of Eq. (13.27)
An approximate solution of Eq. (13.27) can be obtained with the following initial
conditions:
(i) The time interval Dtð0\t\DtÞ is inﬁnitesimally small.
(ii) The function f ðtÞ (i.e., f ðtÞ ¼ f ðtÞ) and ‘a’ are constant for the time interval
Dt, and h1 can be computed by ﬁnding the water temperature Tw ¼ Tw0 and
glass-cover temperature Tg ¼ Tg0 at t = 0.

The thermo-physical properties of water are estimated after knowing the water

The temperature obtained for a particular time interval will serve as the initial
temperature for the next time interval for the calculation of thermo-physical
properties and heat-transfer coefﬁcients. The accuracy of the estimated values
depends on the time interval; for a smaller time interval the accuracy is high. In
present the chapter, generally the time interval taken is 1 h.

Fig. 13.12 is positive (Eq. 13.35). It is opposite to the slope in Fig. 5.5 (ﬂat-plate
collector). The reason for this variation is that in the case of a solar still, the higher
top loss to the ambient air results in a higher yield (hence higher efﬁciency),
whereas for FPC, less loss from the top results in a higher efﬁciency. The nonlinear
behavior of Fig. 13.12 is due to the high temperature dependence of the evaporative
heat-transfer coefﬁcient ðhewÞ.

Solar Distillation

Effect of Design and Climatic Parameters
The hourly output (yield) from a solar-distillation unit depends on the temperature
difference between the evaporating (water) and the condensing surfaces. One can
see from Eq. (13.16a) that the higher the value of ðTw  TgÞ, the higher the yield.
Effect of wind velocity
Wind ﬂowing over the outer condensing cover creates a faster rate of heat loss from
it. This reduces the condensing-cover temperature and hence increases ðTw  TgÞ
for a higher yield. This has a signiﬁcant effect at a larger water depth in the basin
unlike a smaller one. After a typical maximum wind velocity (5 m/s), the yield is
not much affected [7].
Effect of ambient air temperature
With higher ambient air temperature, there is lower rate of heat loss due to smaller
ðTg  TaÞ; hence,the glass condensing-cover temperature increases. This decreases
ðTw  TgÞ and hence the hourly yield.
Effect of solar radiation
Solar radiation is one of the sensitive parameters in solar distillation. It is an important
input parameter that determines yield from asolar still. As solar intensityincreases, the
yield also increases until the rate of heat released to the inner condensing cover due to
condensation is equal to the rate of release of heat from the outer surface of condensing
surface to the ambient air for a given water depth. After a certain level of solar
radiation, if the rate of heat released to the inner condensing cover due to condensation
becomes greater than the rate of release of heat from the outer surface of the con-
densing surface to the ambient air, then the yield starts decreasing.
Effect of bottom loss
Water depth plays an important role in terms of the thickness of insulation, which
determines an overall bottom heat-transfer coefﬁcient ðUbÞ, Eq. (13.14b). At lower
water depth, the water temperature is signiﬁcantly higher and hence the bottom heat
loss due to larger values of ðTw  TaÞ; this causes a lower yield. However, there has
been no signiﬁcant effect of this in studies of larger depth performed by many
researchers.
Effect of a double-glazed condensing cover
As mentioned in Sect. 13.7 (Eq. 13.12a), the upward top-heat loss in a
solar-distillation unit should be maximum unlike in a ﬂat-plate collector for higher
yield. If the upward top-heat loss in a solar-distillation unit is reduced due to the
presence of a double-glazed condensing cover, then the yield will be signiﬁcantly
reduced. In this case, the water temperature in the basin will be also increased as in
the case of a ﬂat-plate collector. In addition, the rate of evaporation will be
increased. In such a case, vapour is transported to another condensing chamber.
13.8
Effect of Design and Climatic Parameters

Effect of condensing-cover inclination [2]
Because there is a relation between condensing-cover inclination and solar radia-
tion, and this effect cannot be discussed in isolation. It is well known that annual
solar radiation on a surface is highest for the surface inclined at the latitude of place.
Furthermore, the condensing cover should also be inclined to draw the condensed
water, under the force of gravity, into the collecting bottle at the lower end of the
condensing cover. The optimum inclination of solar distillation should be per-
formed from an annual point of view for different. For New Delhi climatic con-
ditions, the optimum inclination is 30. Cooper [7] found that the evaporation rate
decreases with condensing-cover inclination variation from 0 to 45 and increases
at approximately 60 and decreases again beyond 75.
Effect of salt concentration [1]
With an increase of salt concentration, the heat capacity of the water mass also
increases for a given water depth. This causes a lower water temperature and hence
lowers ðTw  TgÞ. Finally the yield is reduced. There is another problem with high
salt concentration, which causes high scaling in the basin liner, which increases
maintenance costs. This reduces the absorption coefﬁcient of solar radiation in the
basin. On the basis of this observation, the puriﬁcation of seawater (salinity
approximately 40,000 ppm) is never recommended for solar distillation.
Seawater also causes high corrosion of the metallic sheet, which can be solved
by using a noncorrosive metal for the basin construction.
Effect of water depth [1]
It can be seen that there is no effect of water depth without insulation. However, the
yield decreases with water depth in an insulated basin. This ﬁnding has been
veriﬁed by many researchers. The optimum depth for a passive and an active solar
still is considered 0.02 and 0.05 m, respectively.
Effect of black dye [15]
To increase the yield, there have been many attempts to use black dye, charcoal etc.
It has been observed that there is no marginal effect at lower water depth.

Introduction
After air, water, and food, energy is the fourth basic need of human beings. It is the
most essential and secure accessible supply of energy for modern societies with a
persistent demand as human needs evolve. Now energy plays a vital role in human
life for nearly all activities including domestic, transport, industrial, medical, etc.
Thus, energy security for the worthwhile growth of the world population is very
necessary. Continued use of conventional energy sources (fossil fuels) is set to face
multiple challenges including (i) depletion of fossil fuel reserves, (ii) global
warming and other environmental concerns, (iii) geopolitical and military conﬂicts,
and (iv) continuing increases in fuel prices. These problems will eventually create
an unsustainable situation. Solar energy is one of many solutions to the growing
energy challenges/crisis. Fossil fuels impose a huge detrimental impact on the
environment. Human activities causing climate changes result in the production of
greenhouse-gas emissions (GHG), which negatively affect the environment directly.
Per the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), as many as 160,000
people die each year due to the side effects of climate change. This ﬁgure could
approximately double by 2020. The energy supply, in the form of energy derived
directly or indirectly from the Sun, comprises the total energy demand, without
exception, of every human being and living organism on Earth. Energy require-
ments for humans include the heating, cooling, transport, and manufacture of goods
and agriculture. Solar energy is renewable and eco-friendly, free of contamination,

and easily and freely obtainable. Basically, solar energy is both a direct
renewable source and an indirect nonrenewable source of energy. In this per-
ception, solar-energy systems have been growing fast globally during the last two
decades. Most of the world receives a high level of solar radiation. Energy analysis
of solar thermal and PVT systems can calculate their environmental impact [1, 2].
Both thermal and electrical energy can be achieved through solar energy. In view of
the above, solar-energy technology must meet the following two chief criteria:
(i) cost-effectiveness; and
(ii) utmost annual energy savings.
In the present chapter, annual energy savings will be evaluated using the ﬁrst law
of thermodynamics (Chap. 3).
14.2
Embodied-Energy Analysis
To perform an analysis of life-cycle energy and environmental impact for any
system, an embodied-energy analysis is an important and relatively new concept.
Embodied energy is deﬁned as: “the quantity of energy required by all of the
activities associated with a production process, including the relative propor-
tions consumed in all activities upstream to the acquisition of natural resources
and the share of energy used in making energy equipment and in other sup-
porting functions i.e. direct energy plus indirect energy” [3]. Embodied-energy
analysis quantitatively assesses the energy required to manufacture the system
including raw-material extraction, fabrication of every component, and assembly
and maintenance of each component. Embodied-energy analysis also includes
quantitative analysis of the components (construction, operation, and maintenance)
of any system on a life-cycle basis.
The embodied energy of any system indicates the amount of energy consumed to
get the system into operational condition starting from raw-material extraction to
fabrication and the installation of each component. Operational energy consumption
can be reduced by improving the design and efﬁciency of the system. However,
embodied energy is neglected in theses analysis. Embodied energy is ignored due to
the unavailability of data, the unavailability of techniques for the assessment of
embodied energy of components and processes, and the common assumption that
determining the embodied energy of different components and processes is
insigniﬁcant. However, in the recent past these limitations of data and techniques
have been conquered, and it has been found that embodied energy can be as much
as 20 times the annual operational energy [4].
In embodied-energy analysis, the energy consumed for the fabrication of each
component is calculated and summed to obtain the embodied energy of the system.
For this, the energy densities (available in literature and provided by the manu-
facturer) of the materials of each component are multiplied by the quantity of
556

Energy Analysis

materials used in fabricating the component. For life-cycle analysis as well as
embodied-energy analysis, some environmental factors—such as CO2 emission—
are considered in fabricating all components of the system.
14.3
Energy Density (Intensity)
The energy densities (intensities) can be procured from various national and
international studies of energy analysis. The difﬁculty experienced in using a broad
range of sources to conﬁrm the values is necessary to explicate the deﬁnitions of
technique boundaries or to determine whether the values are presented in terms of
primary energy or delivered energy.
It is a huge task to obtain an exact and authentic energy database for the
materials used in PVT systems. An extensive comparison of materials is needed.
Acquiring the exact and useable quantities of materials is the most essential
requirement in the calculation of embodied energy at the design stage. Inclusion of
the same with current available energy-intensity values is also important [4].
To execute energy analyses, the following methods are given:
• Process analysis: This is a frequently used method, which identiﬁes the system
periphery around a meticulous process. This process evaluates the needs for
direct and indirect energy by determining the condition of other goods and
services, as well as capital equipment and buildings, that cross the system’s
periphery. In process analyses, deﬁnition of the system periphery is a crucial
facet. The proper selection of different system peripheries gives a signiﬁcant
range of results. In a system periphery, a meticulous manufacturing process may
consist of the needs “upstream” for the provision of natural resources where the
system periphery may be the factor hedge.
• Input‒output analysis: This analysis can trace the economic ﬂows of goods
and services in different sectors of the economy. Government economists have
collected data for the compilation of input‒output matrices used for input‒
output analysis, which was developed for economic analysis. Input‒output
matrices for 109 economic sectors are published by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics every ﬁfth year in Australia. The matrix row indicates all of the sales
of a sector, and the matrix column indicates all of the purchases in dollars of
input per $100 of output. Thus, the energy intensity of a sector can be derived by
dividing purchases from the individual energy supply sectors by the suitable
tariffs, which is expressed in gigajoules (109 J) of energy per $100 of sector
output (GJ/$100).
• Hybrid analysis: A crucial facet of concern involves the direct energy and
quantities of goods and services acquired by process analysis. This analysis
examines and quantiﬁes in detail the production process for materials in which
the manufacture represents the main bulk of the overall environmental impact.
Then the energy intensities of goods and services further upstream are acquired

by input‒output analysis. This approach reduces the errors involved with input‒
output analysis to a great extent, but the energy intensities derived can be
applied to materials and products manufactured by the speciﬁc process(es)
audited. It does not apply globally.
To derive the embodied-energy intensities, input‒output analysis is often used,
but net energy intensities were found to rival those derived from process analysis.
The precision of input‒output analyses is intrinsically untrustworthy, but it gives a
general base for comparison purposes. This method is judged as the most preferred
one for embodied-energy analysis because it can minimize to a large extent the
errors associated with input‒output analysis. The energy densities of different
materials generally used to manufacture solar energy technology are given in
Appendix VI.
14.4
Overall Thermal Energy
As we have seen, two types of energy are available from the solar system, namely,
thermal and electrical energy. Because thermal energy is low-grade energy and
electrical energy is high-grade energy, they cannot be added directly for energy
analysis, which is based on the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. For this, electrical
energy is ﬁrst converted to the equivalent thermal energy, and then it is added to the
thermal energy to obtain the overall thermal energy available from any system.
Mathematically, overall thermal energy is expressed as follows:
Qoverall; thermal ¼ Qthermal þ Eelectrical
gcp
ð14:1Þ
where gcp is the electric power‒generation efﬁciency. Its value depends on the
quality of the coal. For good-quality coal with low ash content, gcp ¼ 0:38. The
value of gcp varies between 0.20 and 0.40 for different types of coal used in power
plants.
14.5
Energy-Payback Time (EPBT)
In this section, the energy-payback time EPBT
ð
Þ of a solar system will be discussed
based on the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. It is deﬁned as the recovery period of
embodied energy. Mathematically, it is expressed as follows:

where Ein is the embodied energy of the solar-energy system.
Calculation of the embodied energy of solar thermal technology is straightfor-
ward except for a PV module, which goes through various high-technological
processes.
Calculation of the embodied energy of a particular solar thermal energy tech-
nology can be achieved as follows:

PV Module
Calculation of the total embodied energy of a PV module per m2 is difﬁcult. It
requires the manufacturing energy requirement for the individual components. The
energy requirements for different processes involved in the production of a PV
module are given in Table 14.1.

The above data of case (i) were generated using the high-grade energy used at
different processes excluding the embodied energy of the balance of system
(BOS) of a PV system.
The basis of the data generated above is due to the following reasons:
(i)
Reduction of mass of the solar cell, which may occur due to development of
new materials. Case (iii) is considered as 10 % of case (i)
(ii)
Cell-processing energy: This is reduced by 75 % from case (i) to (iii)
(iii)
Cell efﬁciency: This is increased by 4 %
(iv)
Elimination of wafer trimming and packaging
(v)
Reduction of embodied energy of the module assembly by 50 %.
Case (ii) is based on the average value of case (i) and (ii), respectively. For
details on the above calculations, refer the books by Tiwari and Ghosal [6],
Agrawal and Tiwari [7], and Tiwari and Dubey [8]. The above results show that the
embodied energy of a PV module decreased signiﬁcantly from 1071 to
261 kWh/m2 due to the reasons described above.
If the embodied energy for an open ﬁeld (stand alone) and a rooftop per m2 is
considered to be 500 and 200 kWh, respectively, then the total embodied energy of
a PV module per m2 with installation for an open ﬁeld and rooftop integration to a
building will be 1571 and 1271 kWh, respectively, for case (i).
Annual output of PV module ¼ gm  I  Am  N  n0
Where gm and Am are electrical efﬁciency and the area of the PV module; N and n0
are the number of sunshine hours and clear days in a year; and I is the annual average
values of solar intensity, which vary from place to place, e.g., its value for Port
Hedland (NW Australia, Sydney, and India are 2494, 1926, and 1800 kWh/m2/year,
respectively. This indicates that the annual electrical output for Port Hedland
(NW Australia) will be maximum.
For the following parameters, namely, gm ¼ 0:12; Am ¼ 1 m2 and for Port
Hedland (NW Australia) climatic condition, calculate the
Annual output of PV module for 1 m2 ¼ 0:12  2494  1 ¼ 299:28 kWh

Similarly, for Sydney and Indian climatic condition for the same design
parameters, we calculate the following:
Annual output of PV module for 1 m2 ¼ 0:12  1926  1 ¼ 231:12 kWh
and the
Annual output of PV module for 1 m2 ¼ 0:12  1800  1 ¼ 216 kWh

The embodied energy for two ﬂat-plate collectors each having an area of 2 m2 is
given in Table 14.2. The value of embodied energy for two ﬂat-plate collectors is
2315:10 kWh.
Embodied energy for flat plate collector (FPC) of 2 m2 ¼ 1157:11 kWh
For clear-sky (blue sky) conditions for 268 days/year in New Delhi, 8 sunshine

For gc ¼ 0:70 (efﬁciency of FPC),
An annual thermal energy of 2 m2 FPC ¼ 0:7  1715 kWh ¼ 1205:5 kWh
The energy-payback time of one ﬂat-plate collector of 2 m2 is given by
Energy pay back time EPBT
ð
Þ ¼ 1157:11
1202:5 ¼ 0:96 years
The above calculated energy-payback time is based on the annual thermal
energy of an FPC. Hence, the use of an FPC is economical.
Second Method
For natural mode, F0 ¼ 0:9; Ac ¼ 2 m2; as ¼ 0:8; I tð Þ ¼ 400 W/m2 and Ta ¼ 25 °C
(annual average values), UL ¼ 6 W/m2 °C and Tf ¼ 60 °C and n ¼ 268 clear days
in 1 year and 8 sunshine hours per day, the annual thermal energy available can be
calculated from Eq. (5.54) as follows:
Annual thermal energy under natural mode ðQannulÞ

For forced mode, a pump of 20 W is required to circulate the water through the
ﬂat-plate collector, and it is the only change in FR ¼ 0:8 and Tfi ¼ 30 °C in the
above calculation; the annual thermal energy available can be calculated from
Eq. (5.75) as follows:
Annual thermal energy Qannul ¼ 0:8  2  0:8  400  6  ð30  25Þ

Net annual energy saved for forced mode of operation ¼ 994  42:88
ð

This calculation indicates that the net annual energy saved for forced mode of
operation is higher than the annual thermal energy available in natural circulation
mode of operation.

For forced-circulation mode,

This shows that the EPBT is less than the life of the ﬂat-plate collector, i.e.,
10–15 years. However, increasing the annual energy saving can further reduce the
EPBT of the ﬂat-plate collector. This can be achieved as follows:
(i)
increase the amount of insolation;
(ii)
increase the number of sunshine hours; and
(iii)
decrease the overall heat loss, etc.
14.6.3
Hybrid Flat-Plate Collector
The embodied energy for one hybrid ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) of 2 m2 will be
approximately the sum of the embodied energy for one ﬂat-plate collector (FPC)
at 2 m2 1157:11 kWh
ð
Þ and the embodied energy for one PV module at 0:605 m2
607 kWh
ð
Þ. From Table 14.2, this value will be approximately 1764:11 kWh. Now,
the energy-payback time for one hybrid ﬂat-plate collector is given as
Energy pay back time EPBT
ð
Þ ¼ 1764:11
994
¼ 1:77 years
In this case, the electrical energy needed to operate the pump is taken from the
PV module. Furthermore, such system is self-sustaining. In this case, the EPBT is
higher due to an increase in the embodied energy by the PV module.
14.6.4
Hybrid Air Collector
The calculation of total embodied energy for two hybrid air collectors connected in
series is given in Table 14.3. The embodied energy for two hybrid air collectors of
2:64 m2 (fully covered opaque) is 3297:7 kWh. In this case, the embodied energy
of a PV module is 2587:2 kWh, and the remaining
710:5 kWh
ð
Þ is embodied
energy for the BOS. The embodied energy for two hybrid air collectors connected
in series, as done in the case of the PV module, will be as follows:
Case (i) Embodied energy ¼ ð2:64  980 þ 710:5Þ ¼ 3298 kWh
Case (ii) Embodied energy ¼ ð2:64  607 þ 710:5Þ ¼ 2313 kWh
Case (iii) Embodied energy ¼ ð2:64  261 þ 710:5Þ ¼ 1399 kWh

Energy Analysis

The annual thermal and electrical energy of the hybrid air collector 2:64 m2
ð
Þ is
evaluated as 987 and 292 kWh, respectively. Using conversion factor, Eq. (14.1),
we get the following:
Overall annual thermal energy for two hybrid air collectors ¼ 987 þ 292
0:38 ¼
1755 kWh.
If the conversion factor has not been considered, then we get the following:
Overall annual thermal energy for two hybrid air collectors ¼ 987 þ 292 ¼
1279 kWh.
For clear-sky conditions 268 days/year, 8 sunshine hours/day, and an annual
average solar radiation of 400 W/m2, the annual solar radiation on two hybrid air
collectors of 2:64 m2 is given by
Annual solar radiation ¼ 400  8  2:64  268 ¼ 2; 264; 064 Wh ¼ 2264 kWh

Solar Still
Passive Solar Still
To determine the payback period (EPBT) for a single-slope passive solar still, one
needs the embodied energy with an effective area of 1m2 and the annual yield from
the solar still.
The embodied energy of a ﬁbre reinforced‒plastic passive solar still can be
calculated as follows:
Embodied energy of 1:2 m2 glass cover ¼ Area  thickness  density  energy density
¼ 1:2  0:003  2350  8:72 ¼ 73:77kWh
Embodied energy of a ﬁber glass material of 3 mm ¼ 10  25:64 ¼ 256:4 kWh
Embodied energy of a galvanized-iron angle stand ¼ 8  13:88 ¼ 11:04 kWh
Total embodied energy for the solar still ¼ 441:21 kWh
If the annual yield=m2 (output) is assumed to be 2 kg and the number of sun-
shine hours per day per year is considered as 268, then the annual energy available
from solar still will be
Annual energy ¼ 2  268  2:50  106 ¼ 13:50  108 J ¼ 375:2 kWh
Thus, the energy-payback time is given by EPBT ¼
441:21 kWh
375:1 kWh per year ¼
1:18 years.
This indicates that the energy-payback time (EPBT) for a passive solar still is
much less than the expected life of a passive solar still (by 25–30 years).
Active Solar Still

of the passive solar still plus the 2 m2 area of the ﬂat-plate collector and is given by
An embodie energy for active solar still ¼ Embodied energy of passive solar still
þ Embodied energy for 2 m2 FPC area
According to Sect. 14.6.2, an embodied energy for 2 m2 FPC area ¼ 1724 kWh,
then an embodied energy for the active solar still ¼ 441:21 þ 1724 ¼ 2165:21 kWh.

Energy Analysis

Thus,
EPBT ¼
2165:21 kWh
930 kWh per year ¼ 2:32 years:
It is necessary to observe that the energy-payback time (EPBT) for an active
solar still is signiﬁcantly higher than that for passive a solar still by 96 %. This is
due to fact that an overall thermal efﬁciency of an active solar still is reduced due to
high operating temperature range. Hence, an active solar still is recommended for
commercial applications having a high quality of water, and a passive solar still
should be used for domestic applications.

Solar Dryer
Cabinet Dryer
The embodied energy for different materials used in a cabinet dryer (Fig. 12.5)
having 0:5 m2 effective area is as follows:
(a) Mass of glass cover ¼ 4 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 4  8:72 ¼ 34:88
(b) Mass of wood material ¼ 10 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass energy density ¼ 10  4:95 ¼ 49:5 kWh
(c) Mass of galvanized iron ¼ 1 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 1  13:88 ¼ 13:88 kWh
The total embodied energy used for a 0:5 m2 cabinet dryer ¼ 34:88 þ 49:5 þ 13:88
ð

¼ 98:26 kWh
The annual energy produced by a cabinet dryer ¼ g  ac  s  I  Ac  N

The values of the different parameters are as follows: g ¼ 0:50; acs ¼ 0:40 
0:8 ¼ 0:32; Ac ¼ 0:5 m2;I ¼ 500 W=m2; N ¼ 5 and n ¼ 268 clear days/year.
The useful energy produced by a cabinet dryer in 1 year ¼ 0:5  0:32  400 
0:5  5  268  103 kWh = 42:8 kWh.
Thus, the energy-payback time (EPBT) is given by EPBT ¼

42:8 kWh per year ¼
2:29 years.

Greenhouse Dryer
The embodied energy for the different materials used in a greenhouse dryer for an
effective area of 0:96 m2 is given as follows:
(a) Mass of PVC pipe of diameter 100 ¼ 0:25 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass energy density ¼ 0:25  18:9 ¼ 7:225 kWh
(b) Mass of wood material ¼ 0:5 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 0:5  25:64 ¼ 12:82 kWh
(c) Mass of galvanized iron ðnailsÞ ¼ 0:100 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass energy density ¼ 0:100  13:88 ¼ 1:388 kWh
The total embodied energy of greenhouse dryer of 0:96 m2area ¼ ð7:23 þ 12:82 þ 1:388Þ kWh
¼ 21:50 kWh
The useful energy for greenhouse dryer in 1 year ¼ g  ac  s  I  Ac  N
n  103 kWh.
The values of different parameters are g ¼ 0:10; acs ¼ 0:40  0:8 ¼ 0:32; Ac ¼
0:96 m2;I ¼ 500 W/m2; N ¼ 5 and n ¼ 268.
The useful energy produced in 1 year ¼ 0:1  0:32  500  0:96  5  268  103 kWh
¼ 20:6 kWh
Thus, the energy-payback time is EPBT ¼
21:50 kWh
20:6 kWh per year ¼ 1:04 years
It is observed that the energy-payback time (EPBT) for a greenhouse crop dryer
is much less than that for a cabinet dryer. However, the life of a cabinet dryer
(10 years) is longer than that of a greenhouse crop dryer (by 4–5 years).
Reverse-Absorber Cabinet Dryer (RACD)
The embodied energy of different materials for a reverse-absorber cabinet dryer of
1 m2 area is given as follows:
(a) Mass of glass cover ¼ 8 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 8  8:72 ¼ 69:76 kWh
(b) Mass of wooden structure ¼ 25 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 25  4:95 ¼ 123:75 kWh

(c) Mass of galvanized iron with stand ¼ 15 kg,
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 15  13:88 ¼ 208:20 kWh
The total embodied energy of RACD ¼ ð69:76 þ 123:75 þ 208:20Þ
¼ 451:71 kWh
The useful energy produced in 1 year ¼ g  ac  s  I  Ac  N n  103 kWh
In this case, the thermal efﬁciency of the system will be the product of thermal
efﬁciency of the air heater and the efﬁciency of the drying chamber. For 50 %
efﬁciency of each, the values of the efﬁciency of the system and other parameters
are given as follows: ¼ 0:25 acs ¼ 0:90  0:8 ¼ 0:72; Ac ¼ 1:0 m2;I ¼ 500 W/m2;
and n ¼ 268.
The useful energy produced by RACD ¼ 0:25  0:72  500  1:0  5  268  103 kWh
¼ 120:6 kWh
Thus, the energy-payback time is EPBT ¼
471:71 kWh
120:6 kWh per year ¼ 3:91 years
The EPBT for RACD is more because of more materials were used in its
fabrication, which can be reduced by using wooden material for the stand and
ﬁber-reinforced plastic (FRP) material for the other structures.
Active Solar Dryer
The embodied energy of different materials used in an active solar drying system of
0:5 m2 area is calculated as follows:
(a) Mass of glass cover 1 m2

Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 35  13:88 ¼ 485:80 kWh
(d) Black paint and other paint ¼ 1 kg
Embodied energy ¼ mass  energy density ¼ 1  40 ¼ 40 kWh

The total embodied energy of active solar dryer is ¼ 69:76 þ 173:25 þ

The useful energy produced by active solar dryer in 1 year ¼ g  ac  s  I
Ac  N  n  103 kWh.
In this case also, the thermal efﬁciency of an active solar dryer is the product
of the thermal efﬁciency of the active air collector and the efﬁciency of the
crop chamber. For a 70 % efﬁcient active air collector and a 50 % efﬁcient dry-
ing chamber, values for the thermal efﬁciency and other parameters of the active
solar drying system are given as follows: g ¼ 0:35; acs ¼ 0:90  0:8 ¼ 0:72;
Ac ¼ 1:0 m2;I ¼ 400 W/m2; N ¼ 5; n ¼ 268.
The useful energy produced by an active solar dryer
¼ 0:35  0:72  400  1:0  5  268  103 kWh
¼ 135:0 kWh
Thus, the energy-payback time is EPBT ¼
768:81 kWh
135:0 kWh per year ¼ 5:69 years.
The above calculations do not include the effect of the electrical energy used to
operate the air blower.
The energy-payback time can be further reduced by using wooden material for
the stands and ﬁber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials for the other structures.
The above analysis shows that the EPBT strongly depends on the design of and
the material used for the fabrication of solar dryers. Therefore, a solar dryer must be
designed and fabricated in such a way that it utilizes low energy density material
with longer life time. Solar dryers should operate at a maximum throughout the year
and require less maintenance.

8:72 kWh/kgÞ for an evacuated tubular collector is 152:62 kWh. Out of total
embodied energy, 8.25 % is from the glass cover, and the remaining 91.75 % is
from the copper.
The energy-payback time (EPBT) for an evacuated tubular collector can be
evaluated as
EPBT ¼
152:62 kWh
30:24 kWh per year ¼ 5:1 years
The energy-payback time (EPBT) for an evacuated tubular collector is longer
than that for a ﬂat-plate collector. The evacuated tubular collector is generally used
for industrial applications, unlike a ﬂat-plate collector. However, either increasing
the annual energy savings or decreasing the total embodied energy of an evacuated
tubular collector can further reduce the EPBT for an evacuated tubular collector.
Annual energy savings can be increased by
(i) increasing the insolation; and
(ii) increasing the number of sunshine hours, etc.
The total embodied energy of an evacuated tubular collector can be reduced by
(i) decreasing the thickness of the copper tubes; and
(ii) changing the design for minimum use of copper.

Energy Storage
Abstract Due to the intermittent nature of solar energy, storage of energy is
required for night application. Both thermal and electrical energy can be stored for
short and long periods of time for the betterment of human life and needs. The solar
system is most economical without storage of energy and has many applications,
particularly in PVT technology.

Introduction
A medium that stores all forms of energy to perform useful functions after some
time is known as “energy storage.” Forms of energy can be classiﬁed as follows:
(i) Potential energy: This takes the form of chemical, gravitational, electrical,
temperature differential, latent heat. etc.
(ii) Kinetic energy: This takes the form of momentum.
Furthermore, there can be short- and long-term storage as follows:
Short-term storage: Some technologies, such as an insulated storage tank through
sensible heat, directly store solar energy in the form of short-term energy. Even
food, through the photosynthesis process, is a form of energy stored in chemical
form. Solar energy is an intermittent and a time-dependent energy resource. It is
available during sunshine hours (Chap. 1). It can be stored for off-sunshine hours if
required. It is stored for the use of energy requirements in day-to-day life.
Long-term storage: Other technologies, such as fossil fuels (coal, petroleum,
natural gas), deep aquifers and bedrock, can store energy long-term. Fossil fuels
indirectly store solar energy received by organisms and plants (dead and buried
over a long period of time).

Solar thermal energy storage can be classiﬁed as follows:
15.2
Sensible Heat Storage [1]
Thermal energy may be stored as
• sensible heat in liquid or solid; and
• latent heat in melting or vapour condition.
The level of sensible heat-storage systems depends on the heat capacity ðMCpÞ
and temperature difference during heating (charging) or cooling (discharging).
The ﬁrst law, i.e., sensible heat is stored ðQÞ during charging operations by a
storage medium from T1 to T2 (the maximum temperature at end of charging
period), is expressed as
Q ¼ M
ZT2
T1
CpdT ¼ V
ZT2
T1
qCpdT
ð15:1Þ
where M, ρ, and Cp are the mass (kg), the density (kg/m3), and the speciﬁc heat
(J/kg °C) of the storage medium; and V is the volume (m3).
For a temperature independent of Cp, Eq. (15.1) becomes
Q ¼ MCp T2  T1
ð
Þ
ð15:2Þ
It is important to mention that that T1 is a time-dependent temperature.
The amount of sensible-heat storage depends on the following parameters:
(i)
higher speciﬁc heat;
(ii)
higher thermal diffusivity, a ¼

qCp, with K being thermal conductivity;

(iv)
low cost and maintenance; and
(v)
Stability.
The physical properties of some sensible-heat storage materials are given in
Table 15.1.
Using the second law of thermodynamics, the exergy change in terms of
sensible-heat storage can be expressed as [2]
DE12 ¼ MCp T2  T1
ð
Þ  MCp Ta þ 273
ð
Þ ln T2 þ 273
T1 þ 273
ð15:3Þ
It can be seen that the exergy change is nonlinear unlike the energy of
sensible-heat storage.
In the case of sensible-heat storage, thermal-energy efﬁciency is deﬁned as the
ratio
of
energy
used
from
storage
to
the
energy
available
for
storage.
Mathematically, it is expressed as

imum temperature during discharge.

Sensible Heat Storage

Furthermore, sensible heat-storage technology is categorized on the basis of
storage media. It can be liquid-media storage, solid-media storage, or dual-media
storage.
Example 15.1 Calculate the thermal energy lost from an insulated tank ﬁlled with
1000 l olive oil for a temperature drop of 100 °C from the boiling point
ðTboiling ¼ 570 KÞ.
Solution
From Appendix IX, the density and speciﬁc heat capacity of olive oil are q ¼
920 kg/m3 and C ¼ 1970 J/kg K, respectively.
Using Eq. (15.2), we have
Q ¼ 1000  920  1970  373 ¼ 6:76  1011 J
15.2.1
Liquid-Media Storage
Many liquid can be used for thermal storage. However, the water is most eco-
nomically freely available with high heat capacity in abundant liquid for the
short-term storage of thermal energy <100 °C.
Water has the following advantages:
(a) It is nontoxic and noncombustible.
(b) It has low thermal conductivity and viscosity.
(c) The charging and discharging of energy can occur simultaneously.
Apart from the abovementioned advantages, water has some disadvantages.
These are as follows:
(a) It freezes below 0 °C and boils over 100 °C.
(b) It is a corrosive medium.
(c) It has low surface tension and hence leaks easily.
Liquid-storage tank without stratiﬁcation (well-mixed) and no heat exchanger
The analysis presented here is widely used for water storage, but is also valid for
other liquids.
In this case, one can consider a solar water-heating system under forced mode of
operation. According to Eqs. (8.15 and 8.17), one can write an overall energy
balance as follows:

 is the rate
of charging energy from the source (FPCs connected in parallel) in W without a
heat exchanger within the storage tank. It is important to mention that the inlet

Liquid storage tank without stratiﬁcation (well mixed) and with heat
exchanger in collector as well open loop
A well-mixed liquid-storage tank with heat exchanger for both charging a collector
loop and discharging an open loop (load loop) is shown in Fig. 15.2.
In this case, the inlet temperature of the ﬂat-plate collector (FPC), Tfi is not the
same as the storage temperature Tw in a collector loop as mentioned earlier. The
outlet of ﬂat-place collector, Tfo, becomes the inlet of the collector-loop heat
exchanger and the outlet of the collector-loop heat exchanger becomes the inlet of
the FPC, Tfi.

By using the initial condition (Tf at x ¼ 0 ¼ Tfo), i.e., the outlet of ﬂat-place

Equation (15.11) can be discussed in terms of the following cases:
Case (i): For L * very large, the length of the heat exchanger in the collector loop
is very large, so then the penalty factor ε * 1. In this case,
_QC ¼

which is same as _QC of Eq. (15.7). This indicates that most of thermal energy
available at the outlet of the FPC is transferred to the liquid/water in the storage tank.

_QC ¼
_mfCf
ð
Þc Tfo  Tw
ð
Þ
which is same as _QC of Eq. (15.7). This also indicates that most of thermal energy
available at the outlet of the FPC is transferred to the liquid/water in the storage tank.
Case (iii): For _mf  very large, then the penalty factor ε * 0. In this case,
_QC ¼ 0
This means that there is no transfer of heat to the liquid/water in storage tank.
This indicates that the hot ﬂuid is passed through collector-loop heat exchanger
without transferring the heat into the tank.
Similarly, the rate of withdrawal of hot water through load loop, _QL, can be
derived as

to determine the temperature proﬁle of a storage tank with a heat exchanger.

15.2.2
Solid-Media Storage
Thermal energy (heat) can be stored in loosely, abundant available packed rock-bed
material either in insulated box or underground for a temperature range of 100 °C with a
solar air heater for space heating. It can also be used for much higher temperature ranges.
The packed rock-bed material is simple in design with size ranging from 1 to 5 cm, is
relatively low cost, and has a longer life. It is porous with a large surface area and
facilitates fast heat transfer with a working ﬂuid (water/air) as medium with minimum
internal conductive loss. The amount of energy stored in a rock bed mainly depends on
the thermo-physical properties of the rock bed, rock size and shape, rock porosity, etc.
Packed rock-bed storage material has following advantages:
(a) It is nontoxic and noncombustible.
(b) Use of a heat exchanger can be avoided.
(c) It lacks freezing and corrosion problems.
The system has also some disadvantages as follows:
(a) The storage capacity is large.
(b) There is a high pressure drop.
(c) Simultaneous charging and discharging is not possible.
Abundantly available packed rock-bed material can also be used in a wall, which
can be considered a Trombe wall. Figure 15.4 shows a cross-sectional view of an
insulated packed rock-bed storage system with an N-segment in the vertical
direction if air ﬂow is from the top.
The energy-balance equations have been written considering a one-dimensional
heat ﬂow without axial conduction. It has also been assumed that the physical
properties of solid storage are the same throughout the rock bed, i.e., there is no mass
transfer; the temperature gradient between the solid particles is similar within the
elemental distance dx; and the rock bed is thermally insulated from the environment.
The energy balances for ﬂowing ﬂuid (water/air) and rock-bed storage media are

Dual-Media Thermal Energy Storage (TES)
Solid and liquid heat-sensible thermal-energy storage (TES) materials can be
combined in the following ways:
Hybrid thermal energy storage
In this case, a water tank is surrounded by a rock bed and can be used for room and
greenhouse space heating. Flat-place collectors connected in series are mounted on
the inclined roof of a building/greenhouse that is connected to a system of water
and a rock bed by water motor P1. The rock-bed water system is placed below the
building/greenhouse in the basement as shown in Fig. 15.5. A hot-air blower is
ﬁtted between the room and the top of rock bed, which is porous. Furthermore there
is connection between the ﬂoors of the building/greenhouse to the bottom of the
rock bed to pass cold air of the building/greenhouse to the base of the rock bed.
Furthermore, rocks and oil can be placed in a single insulated vessel. In this case,
the thermal energy produced by the concentrating collector at high temperature and
pressure can be stored during the day, and power can be produced during the night.
Such a system has been used for off-grid solar thermal-power applications.
Concrete thermal energy storage
Figure 15.6 shows a cross-sectional view of a ﬂoor of a building. It consists of a
concrete ﬂoor, a concrete block, and packed gravel. There is provision of air ﬂow
thorough the concrete block for charging hot air and discharging cold air in the
room. In the case of charging, hot air is circulated between the solar air collector
and the concrete block. There is transfer of thermal energy from hot air to the
packed gravel during charging (sunshine hours) and vice versa during discharging
(off-sunshine hours). The packed gravel is porous to increase the surface area for
maximum heat transfer. During discharging, the room air is allowed to ﬂow
between the room and the concrete block to the heat room as shown in Fig. 15.6b.
Ground thermal energy storage [3]
It is well established that soil in the ground has a large thermal capacity and can act
as a large reservoir of solar energy. It has insulating properties as well. Therefore,
the ground can be potentially used for the storage of hot water available from solar
energy at low temperature ranges.
The system, a combination of a water tank and a rock bed, as discussed in the
section on hybrid systems, is buried at an appropriate depth for long-term storage
for space heating of a building as well as a greenhouse by heat pump. In this case,
surplus heat in the summer can be stored and used later in the winter.
The above combination of a water tank and a rock bed is expensive and can also
be used for short-term storage. To reduce the cost and for long-term storage, is
necessary to use naturally existing conﬁned underground aquifers containing water
as shown in Fig. 15.7. In this case, excessive hot water available from the ﬂat-place
collector panel during summer is fed into the aquifer for long-term storage. It can be
used on demand during the winter by withdrawing it using a water pump.

Latent-Heat Storage (LHS)
Latent heat is thermal energy either absorbed (solar energy) or released by a sub-
stance during a phase change at constant temperature. The substance can be a solid
or a liquid. Examples of phase change include the melting of ice (solid) into water
(liquid) or the evaporation of water (liquid) into vapor (gas). In both examples, the
temperature is constant. Most phase-change materials (PCM) have high thermal
energy storage densities compared with sensible-heat storage materials.
The classiﬁcation of latent-heat storage is given below [4].

(b) a PCM container; and
(c) a heat exchanger for transferring heat between the working ﬂuid and the PCM.

media.

Figure 15.8 shows a glazed PCM slab exposed to solar radiation, IðtÞ, and ambient
air temperature, Ta. After the absorption of solar radiation by the top of the PCM
slab, the slab starts melting at the melting point with the latent heat of fusion of the
PCM. For given IðtÞ at time ‘t’, a portion of the PCM will be in liquid state, and the
rest of the PCM will be in a solid state. We will assume that at x ¼ 0 is the interface
of the liquid and solid PCM.
If _m is the mass-ﬂow rate of ﬂuid ﬂowing at the interface having temperature To,
then the rate of thermal energy withdrawn from interface is given by

Applications of PCM Materials [6]
(a) Solar cooker
A cylindrical solar-cooker vessel is surrounded by PCM (with erythritol having a
melting point of 118 °C and a latent heat of fusion approximately 339.8 kJ/kg)
material. The PCM material is ﬁlled between the annular space between the outer
surface of the cooking vessel and another cylindrical vessel. The outer surface is
attached by a heat exchanger, which is connected to an evacuated tubular collector
(ETC) through an insulated pipe. The ﬂow of water between the ETC and the heat
exchanger is under forced mode of operation. The cooking vessel has two hollow
concentric aluminum cylinders having a diameter of 30.4 and 44.1 cm, respec-
tively, and a height of 42.0 cm. The thickness of the aluminum sheet used for
fabrication of the cooking vessel is 9 mm. The hot water circulated through the heat
exchanger placed in the PCM transfers its thermal energy to the PCM, which is

melted at 118 °C by the latent heat of fusion, and the thermal energy is stored for
cooking at the required time.
All sides and the base of the conventional solar cooker can be surrounded by
PCM materials to maintain a uniform temperature inside the cooking vessel. Even
ﬂuctuation of the temperature inside the cooking vessel is reduced.
(b) Greenhouse heating
The ﬂoor of the greenhouse is constructed in a similar way except the packed gravel
is replaced by the appropriate PCM material having a melting temperature of
approximately the greenhouse temperature. In this case, thermal heating (charging)
can be performed as follows.
(i) Hot air is passed from the solar ﬂat-plate collector through a concrete porous
block at a slow ﬂow rate to enable maximum heat transfer between the hot air
and the PCM material. In this case, the PCM material is melted when the
passing hot air has a temperature greater than the melting temperature of the
PCM material.
(ii) The hot water from a solar ﬂat-place collector is passed at a slow ﬂow rate
through a heat exchanger placed between the concrete ﬂoor and the PCM
material. The charging takes place in similar way as mentioned above.
(c) Space heating
In this case, thermal heating of room can be performed either through ﬂoor or
facade heating. The design and construction of the ﬂoor and the facade of building
depend on the level of heating needed and the size of the room.
(d) Solar water heating
In this case, a suitable PCM material with proper thickness and melting temperature
is placed between the absorber and the back insulating sheet. This can be a
collection-cum-storage water heater/ﬂat-plate water and air collector/evacuated
tubular collector/concentrating collector. For such system, there will be no ﬂow of
ﬂuid during sunshine hours due to the transfer of thermal energy from the absorber
to the PCM material for the storage of heat (charging). Flow of ﬂuid is required at
the time of heating during night time (discharging).
(e) Waste-heat recovery
There is wastage of hot air (thermal energy) from an air conditioning unit; and
wastage of hot water (thermal energy) from industries.
A novel design of heat exchanger with a shell and a tube for low-temperature
waste-heat recovery using PCM can be a good solution. The stearic acid (PCM
material), which has melting temperature of 59 °C, ﬁlls the shell of the heat

exchanger for thermal-energy storage. Hot waste ﬂuid is used to ﬂow through the
tubes for the transfer of heat from the tubes to the shell during charging. During
discharging, cold ﬂuid is allowed to ﬂow through tube, and heat is transferred from
the PCM in the shell to the ﬂuid.
15.4
Chemical-Energy Storage (CES)
Chemical energy is a form of potential energy. The storage capacity depends on its
source. In this concept, energy is stored in the form of heat from chemical reactions.
It is often of a larger magnitude than latent-heat storage. The idea of storing solar
energy by the use of chemical reactions is not a new concept. Nature sores energy
by the use of chemical reactions in photosynthesis.
Chemical-energy storage (CES) is a two-step process, namely:
Endothermic (charging) mode: This describes a process or reaction in which the
system absorbs thermal energy from its surroundings in the form of heat. Absorbed
energy occurs either in the breaking or rearranging of chemical bonds. This pro-
duces more energetic species, which are stored.
Exothermic (discharging) mode: In this case, the reaction is reversed to produce
thermal energy and regenerate the starting material.
A chemical-energy storage (CES) system has following advantages:
(i) The energy storage density of these systems are high.
(ii) These systems are suitable for high-temperature applications.
(iii) The chemical-reaction rate is fast.
(iv) These systems have fewer energy losses.
(v) It has easy transportability and an unlimited life.
Apart from these advantages, chemical energy storage (CES) has the following
disadvantages:
(i) The underlying technology for CES is much more complex than the other two
energy storage systems.
(ii) CES may have a hazardous affect on the environment.
The following CESs have been suggested:
(i)
Hydrogen: This is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nontoxic gas and has
potentials as a source of energy. It can be produced by the electrolysis of
water (DC power from a PV module can be used for electrolysis). The
produced H2 gas can then be burnt to release heat, or it can be stored and/or
distributed
to
the
desired
location.
The
enthalpy
of
change
is
DH ¼ 242 kJ mol1, i.e., 242 kJ are released for every mole (18 g) of H2O
formed.

(ii)
Ammonia: Ammonia can also be dissociated at realizable temperatures.
Along with a heat engine, these reactions may form the basis of an efﬁcient
way to generate continuous electrical power from solar energy.
(iii)
Liquid nitrogen: Just like hydrogen, liquid nitrogen shows potential as a
source of energy. It can be used to generate electricity or for refrigeration and
cooling.
(iv)
Oxy-hydrogen: This is a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. It releases
high-pressure and high-temperature steam after ignition, which can be used
to generate electricity.
(v)
Biofuels and biomass: This is another example of indirect solar energy
chemical
storage.
It
releases
thermal
energy
after
the
burning
of
biofuels/biomass, which is stored in the bonds of molecules and atoms from
photons of solar energy.
15.5
Solar Battery
A solar battery is very useful. It delivers electric power for a multitude of purposes
with no moving parts and gives no visual evidence of its operation. The advantages
of solar batteries areas follows:
(i)
It is a portable source of electric power.
(ii)
It is capable of delivering large quantizes of power for short periods and can
be recharged at low rates over an extended period of time.
(iii)
It provides the most reliable source known of emergency power, instanta-
neously, when normal power sources fail.
(iv)
It provides a source of pure direct current for laboratory and other speciﬁc
purposes either as a separate and independent supply or by acting as ﬁlter in a
normal supply system.
15.6
PV Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is a type of hydroelectric-power gener-
ation. It is generally used by some power plants for load balancing during peak
demand. The water from a lower elevation reservoir is pumped by PV arrays to a
higher elevation. This method stores energy in the form of the potential energy of
water. The water stored at a higher elevation is released through turbines to produce
electric power during periods of high electrical demand. These system can met the
peak demand and generate more revenue.

Solar-Power Generation
Abstract Solar-power generation means the generation of electrical (high-grade)
power, and it is achieved from a solar-concentrator device and photovoltaic system.
DC-power generation is converted/transferred to AC power by means of suitable
generators through a charge controller. It works on the basis of the second law of
thermodynamics, and it can partially replace grid power.
Keywords Solar-power generation Concentrated solar power Charge controller
DC–AC inverter  Grid-connected systems
16.1
Introduction
Solar power is generated by converting solar radiation (sunlight) into electricity by
the following methods:
(i) Photovoltaic (PV) method: In this case, photons of the visible wavelength of
solar radiation is responsible for the direct generation of electricity (Chap. 4).
The PV method is economical at small (off-grid) as well as large (grid-
connected) scale capacity. The small scale can be classiﬁed as 1000 kWp.
This includes solar calculators, solar battery charging for remote application,
solar street lighting, water pumping, telecommunications, and solar home
lighting for energy security, etc.
(ii) Concentrated solar power (CSP) method: In this case, lenses or mirrors and
tracking systems are used to focus a large area of solar radiation (sunlight) into
a smaller area to have more temperature to operate turbine for power gener-
ation (Chap. 6). It is an indirect method for power generation. The CSP
method is viable and economical at large (grid-connected) scale, which can be
on the scale of MWp.

16.2
Power Generation by PV Modules
Because there is global market of approximately 80 % production of crystalline-base
PV modules, we will consider only power generation from a single (mono)
pseudo-shape and multi-crystalline rectangular-shape PV modules in this chapter.
16.2.1
PV Arrays
Thirty-six mono-crystalline silicon (Si) solar cells are interconnected in series to
give 18 V and 4.17 A current under standard test conditions (I ¼ 1000 W/m2 and
an ambient air temperature of 25 °C). It is encapsulated between hardened glass and
Tedlar or Mylar with ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) to form an air-proof PV module as
shown in Fig. 4.13. The Tedlar or Mylar may be opaque or transparent depending
on the application. An aluminium frame surrounds the PV module to prevent any
leakages. Such rated PV modules are available everywhere in the world.
Individual PV modules are connected in series to increase the required voltage to
charge a battery of 24 and 48 V with the same current for a higher rated output.
This series combination of PV modules is known as a “PV array.” Furthermore, PV
arrays can be connected in parallel to increase the current to achieve the given
voltage for a required rated power (Chap. 4).
16.2.2
Applications of PV Cells
(a) Solar calculator
Solar calculators were introduced at the end of the 1970s. Hand-held calcu-
lators are powered by a solar cell in the low voltage range of 1.5–2 V. They
have liquid crystal displays and can be operated at a very illumination level of
500 lx. They do not require any battery back-up and are very economical and
useful for remote rural area.
(b) Street light
Street light is powered by a PV module (Fig. 4.13) of high rated power com-
pared with a single solar cell. The module is mounted on the light structure. In
this case, the PV module charges a rechargeable battery. The charged battery
powers a compact ﬂuorescent light (CFL)/light-emitting diode (LED)/lamp
during the night. A LED consumes 50 % less power. Mono-crystalline Si solar
cells are used in PV modules, which convert solar energy into DC power during
the day to charge the battery (gel cell deep-cycle battery and lead-acid battery).
A PV-based street light is generally used as yard lighting, peripheral lighting
for industries, street lights in layouts, compound lights, etc. A PV module of a
600
16
Solar-Power Generation

street light turns on and turns off automatically by sensing the outdoor light
using a light source. The module can also be mounted on a roof to minimize the
cost of the street light.
(c) Stand-alone off-grid PV system
In a stand-alone system, PV arrays are used to generate more power compared
with single PV modules to operate high rated-capacity electronics instruments
including the following:
(i) Domestic light/fan
In this case, the PV array design depends on the total load kWh
ð
Þ of the
house for light during the night and cooling by fan during day/night.
Accordingly, the charge controller, battery, and inverter (next section)
should be specially designed.
(ii) Water pumping
A water well is a solid structure that is created manually in the ground by
digging, driving, boring, or drilling to access groundwater for human use.
In the past, water from a well was drawn either by mechanically or by
hand using buckets. However, this was feasible only up to a certain
depth. At larger depths, a water pump is used depending on the ﬂow rate
and depth of the underground water well. In the case of solar photo-
voltaic (SPV) water pumping, underground water at larger depths is
pumped at ground level by a stand-alone PV system for many applica-
tions, namely, livestock, plants, or human use, etc. The water require-
ment during dry conditions is in phase with the solar insolation (higher
values of solar insolation); hence, SPV water pumping is a suitable
option. A 200 Wp PV system on a clear-sky day can deliver at least
15,000 L/day from a 7-m depth and/or 10-m head.
(iii) Medical refrigeration
It has been strictly recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO) that vaccines must be kept in the temperature range suggested by
the manufacturer until their end use. Vaccines need to be refrigerated for
24 h. The PV-operated refrigeration system is a suitable option for
medical refrigeration at places where fossil fuel-based power is not
available. The rated power of a stand-alone system, including all com-
ponents, namely, charge controller, battery, and inverter, depends on the
capacity of the refrigeration system.
(iv) Transport carrier
Photovoltaic (PV) power was initially used for power generation in space
applications. PV technologies are also in used in the following area of
transport:
(a) Power boats: These are battery operated and used as ferries in
rivers/canals mostly during sunshine hours.
(b) Cars: There have been many driving tests of solar-operated cars
throughout world.
(c) Rickshaws: Battery-operated rickshaws are used to transport people
from one place to another by road.
16.2
Power Generation by PV Modules
601

(d) Generation of hydrogen: Hydrogen power is also being used in cars.
(e) Air carrier: Recently, Switzerland successfully tested a solar-based
aeroplane.
In all cases, a battery bank is used, which is charged by arrays of PV
modules through a charge controller.
The PV system discussed so far is an off-grid system. However,
grid-connected PV systems without a battery operating on the basis of
MW-rated capacity also exist.
(v) Building-integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) systems
In this case, no land is required for the installation of a PV system to supply
electrical power to a building. The PV is an integral part of the roof of a
building, and the space below the rooftop PV roof can be used for many
purposes; hence, it is referred as a “building-integrated photovoltaic
(BiPV) system.” If thermal energy associated with a PV is used for thermal
heating of the space below the roof, then it is referred to as a
“building-integrated photovoltaic thermal (BiPVT) system.” As discussed
in Chap. 4, there are two type of PV modules, namely, opaque and semi-
transparent. In a BiPVT system, a semitransparent PV module is used on
the rooftop of a building. In this case, the advantages are as follows:
(i) The electrical efﬁciency of a semitransparent PV module is higher
than that of an opaque PV module.
(ii) Solar radiation transmitted through a nonpacking-factor area is used
for thermal heating of the space below the rooftop PV.
(iii) The semitransparent roof can provide sufﬁcient day lighting into
various rooms.
(iv) The space below a semitransparent PV module can be used for
drying crops/vegetables drying, sun bathing, crop-pot cultivation
during off season, etc.
(v) The heating of various rooms in a building can be performed by
providing an air duct connected to the roof of a building.
The integration of such PV systems into buildings usually requires experts from
civil engineering, architecture, and PV-system design. The semitransparent PV
module should face south with optimum inclination (generally at latitude) on the
roof to receive the maximum yearly solar radiation.
Electrical power obtained by a BiPVT system can be used either to provide
electrical energy to a building or to transport it to the same locality if needed.
Electrical power from a BiPVT system can be regulated through a charge controller
for DC back-up and a charge controller, battery, and inverter for AC back-up.
Such a system is most suitable to localities not having access to grid power, and it is
economical from the point of view of energy conservation as well as carbon credits.
A photograph of the BiPVT roof of the SODHA BERS COMPLEX (SBC),
Varanasi, is shown in Fig. 16.1.

16.2.3
Charge Controller
At peak sunshine hour, maximum voltage is produced by a PV module; excessive
voltage can damage the batteries. A solar charge controller regulates the DC voltage
from a PV module for charging the batteries to a given voltage. It is also referred to
as a “battery regulator.” It prevents overcharging the batteries and can also protect
against overvoltage. This increases the life span of the batteries. It also prevents
complete draining of a battery. The term “solar-charge controller/regulator”
generally
refers
to
either
a
stand-alone
device
or
a
battery
recharger.
A “series-charge controller/regulator” stops the current ﬂow in a fully charged
battery.
Solar-charge controllers are speciﬁed by the system voltage, which is generally
12, 24, and 48 V. In this case, PV modules are connected in series to form arrays.
The maximum current is determined by connecting such arrays in parallel.
A single conventional PV module of 75 Wp requires a solar-charge controller of
approximately 4–6 A rating. A larger PV array may need solar controllers ≥40 A.
Figure 16.2 shows a basic solar-charge controller circuit with ratings of 8, 12, 20,
and 30 A, which automatically selects between 12 and 48 V.
16.2.3.1
Working Principle
A solar-charge controller monitors voltage across the battery and disconnects the
battery from the PV array or diverts the power away from the battery when it is
fully charged. This can be achieved by short circuiting the PV array (shunt reg-
ulator) or by disconnecting the positive and negative terminals (open-circuited
series regulator). In addition to a shunt/series regulator, an auto cut switch is also
provided, which disconnects the electrical load for very low battery voltage. This is
referred to as a “low-voltage disconnect function.” The solar-charge controller
(SCC) is provided between the solar PV panel and the batteries.

16.2.4
PV Battery
Generally a lead-acid automotive battery is used for the storage of electrical energy
generated from a PV array. Other suitable batteries used in a PV system for energy
storage are alkaline batteries, nickel‒cadmium batteries, and sealed batteries.
To avoid accidents, a solar battery for PV application is installed in a separate
room with proper ventilation and a moderate temperature range as suggested by the
manufacturer. Sealed batteries can be placed in usual working places with normal
ventilation. Battery manufacturers and suppliers provides speciﬁc guidelines for
stacking batteries and designing rooms for battery installation. These guidelines
vary by battery type and construction. Generally batteries are designed for ﬂoor
placement over a wooden or plastic platform. In some speciﬁc cases, they may be
installed in steel step or slotted iron stands. For long life and better performance,
these batteries are charged using a charge controller as discussed previously.
16.2.5
DC–AC Converter and Inverter
A power inverter, also known as an “inverter,” is an electronic device/circuitry
that converts DC current into AC current as shown in Fig. 16.3.
The power inverter can also charge batteries if it is connected to an AC utility
grid or, in the case of a stand-alone system, one’s own AC generator.

Solar Stirling Engine
A solar-powered stirling engine is a solar dish collector/heat engine operated by
cyclic compression and expansion of air/working ﬂuid at different temperature
levels to produce electricity. It consists of a large spherical dish focused toward the
Fig. 16.3 Circuit diagram of a DC–AC converter and inverter

16.2

Sun to reﬂect its rays into the focus point as shown in Fig. 16.5. Solar radiation is
collected in the form of heat to fuel the Stirling cycle engine. The heat engine
operates by allowing heat ﬂow from a heat source to a cold sink. The work output
of the Stirling cycle is then used to drive a generator and create electric power. If
solar power is used as a heat source, there is need of regulation (tracking) of solar
disk to have continuous maximum solar radiation. In some applications, Fresnel
lenses and mirrors are used for solar-power generation. The solar-powered Stirling
engine eliminates the use of fossil fuels for power generation; therefore, they have
fewer detrimental effects on the environment. The Stirling engine has been found to
have high efﬁciency compared with steam engines.
16.3.2
Concentrating Linear Fresnel Reﬂector (CLFR)
A concentrating linear Fresnel reﬂector is also known as a “compact linear
Fresnel reﬂector: (CLFR)”. This linear Fresnel reﬂector (LFR) system consists
of various long, thin strips of mirror. These mirrors reﬂect and focus solar radiation
on a ﬁxed absorber that is placed on a common focal point as shown in Fig. 16.6.
The reﬂecting mirrors can concentrate the incident solar radiation up to 30 times.
The energy absorbed by the linear absorber heats the ﬂuid (high boiling tempera-
ture). The ﬂuid ﬂowing through the absorber tubes powers the steam generator
using a heat exchanger. The CLFR utilizes multiple ﬂat-plate absorbers within the
vicinity of the mirrors unlike a traditional LFR.
16.3.3
Solar Steam Turbine
A steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam of
high temperature ﬂuid obtained from concentrating solar collectors. It converts

stirling solar engine

thermal energy into mechanical energy by rotating the output shaft. A steam turbine
generates a rotary motion to drive an electrical generator. The electrical power
generated by this process can be used for many applications. There are two type of
steam turbine as follows:
(a) Impulse turbines
An impulse turbine works on the principle of the law of moments/law of the
conservation of momentum or a direct push or impulse. The ﬁxed nozzles of
an impulsive turbine increase the speed of the incoming steam. The high-speed
jet of steam from the ﬁxed nozzles falls on the bucket, such as blades, and
rotates the shaft, which is connected to the electrical generator.
(b) Reaction turbines
A reaction turbine works on the principle of action and reaction (reactive
force). In reaction turbines, there are no nozzles like in an impulse turbine. In
this case, the blades, also known as “rotor blades,” are mounted on the
revolving rotor, and they are arranged to form convergent nozzles. The rotor
blades are called “moving blades.” The steam enters from the stator blade to
the rotor blade through the nozzle created by the rotor blade geometry. As the

steam jet leaves the rotor blade, the pressure decreases across both blades.
As the steam jet moves through rotor blade, it creates a reaction force, which
further creates turning moment.
Performance of a reaction turbine depends on three main forces as follows:
(i)
the reactive force on the rotor blades due to an increase in velocity;
(ii)
the reactive force on the rotor due to the changing direction of gas; and
(iii)
the impulsive force of gas on the rotor blades
16.3.4
Parabolic-Trough Concentrator Power
Concentrated solar power (CSP) is also known as a “concentrating solar power/
concentrated solar thermal system.” It uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate a
large area of solar thermal energy onto a small focal area of a parabolic-trough
mirror/lenses, etc. Electrical power is produced when the concentrated solar energy
(beam radiation) at the focal point is converted to thermal energy by ﬂuid ﬂowing
through the heat exchanger as shown in Fig. 16.7a. The thermal energy drives a
solar-heat engine. The heat engine, also referred to as a “steam turbine,” is con-
nected to an electrical power generator to produce electrical power supplied to the
grid.
Referring to the chapter on concentrating solar collectors, the rate of solar
radiation available at a receiver of area, Ar, and a concentration ratio of C for beam
radiation, Ib incident over the concentrator is given by
_Qab ¼ asgoCIbAr
ð16:1Þ
where a and s are the absorptivity and transmittivity of the evacuated glazed
receiver, respectively; and go and C are the optical efﬁciency and concentration
ratio of the concentrating collector, respectively.
At a high operating temperature of the solar concentrator, only radiative heat loss
can be dominant from a receiver having temperature Tr; hence, the rate of thermal
energy lost by radiation can be expressed as
_QL ¼ erArT4
r
ð16:2Þ
where e and r are the emissivity of receiver and Stefan–Bloltzmann constant,
respectively. In this case, radiation exchange between ambient air and receiver has
been neglected due to the very small value compared with the radiative heat loss
from the receiver to the ambient air due to very high operating temperature. Hence,

Latent-Heat Storage Concentrating Solar Power [1]
In parabolic-trough concentrator, power generated can either be used immediately
or transferred to a grid. However, in the case of latent-heat storage concentrating
solar power, power can be generated at a later stage due to the storage of thermal
energy in the phase-change materials.
Latent-heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) consists of three individual
phase-change materials (PCM) units connected in series as shown in Fig. 16.8.
A gravity-assisted heat pipe is buried inside the PCM unit (Fig. 16.9) to increase
the heat-transfer rate by decreasing thermal resistance between the heat-transfer

heat thermal-energy storage
systems

ﬂuids (HTF) and the PCM. The gravity-assisted heat pipe serves as a wick to
maintain uniform distribution on the interiors walls of the heat pipe. Furthermore,
the condensate returns to the evaporator section due to gravitational force. The
thermal energy available from the solar concentrators is allowed to pass through the
HTF during charging. The ﬂow direction of the transfer of thermal energy through
PCM and gravity-assisted heat pipe during charging.
The thermal properties of some PCM materials used for power generation are
given in Table 16.1 [2].
There are three stages during the charging of a PCM as follows:
• less-than-melting temperature;
• melting temperature; and
• completely molten.
The above-mentioned stages depend on the size of the solar concentrator and the
time of charging. The operating temperature of LHTES can vary between 280 and
390 °C. This corresponds to the working-ﬂuid temperature in a parabolic-trough
solar power plant.

centrator, Eq. (6.25). The _mfc and Cf are the mass-ﬂow rate and speciﬁc heat of the
working ﬂuid, respectively; and Ta is the environment air temperature.
The ﬂow direction of the transfer of thermal energy through the PCM and the
gravity-assisted heat pipe during discharging is shown in Fig. 16.10. Furthermore, it
is to be noted that charging and discharging should not be performed simultaneously.
Hence, charging is only performed during sunshine hours, and discharging is per-
formed at the time of power requirement; hence, this case shows the storage effect in
a power-generating system unlike in the case of conventional power production.

Introduction
The Sun is the primary source of energy for all living organisms on Earth. Solar
radiation comes from the Sun.
As discussed in earlier chapters, solar radiation is considered as follows:
(i) A wave (electromagnetic radiation): This is used for many applications such
as day lighting, water/air heating, crop drying, solar houses, solar cooling,
solar distillation, etc. Solar energy reaches the Earth with a spectrum of
wavelengths ranging from approximately 0.3 to 3 µm.
(ii) A photon: The energy association with a quantum of light (photon) is hm.
The h is the Planck’s constant, and m is the frequency of the light. The energy
per photon is 1.7 eV. It is used to generate electricity through solar cells
(Chap. 4).
17.2
Fossil Fuel [1]
In addition to producing electricity, photons are also directly used for photosyn-
thesis, which refers to a chemical reaction occurring in green plants in the form of
chemical energy. “Photo” means “light,” and “synthesis” means “making.” In the

photosynthesis process, solar energy is absorbed by green plants, which sythesize
organic compounds from low-energy carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). This
same photosynthesis process converted solar energy into living organisms millions
of years ago to create fossil fuels.
Photons in the visible portion of the spectrum have sufﬁcient energy to ionize
atoms of H2O into hydrogen and oxygen during sunshine hours. This is generally
referred to as a “light reaction.” Hence, green plants discharges oxygen during day,
which is required by humans.
Hydrogen ions combine with CO2 in the atmosphere, which is released by
humans, to form hydrocarbon during off-sunshine hours. This is also known as a
“dark reaction.” The overall photosynthetic process is shown in the following
equations:
CO2 þ 2H2O !
light CH2O þ H2O þ CO2 þ O2
ð17:1Þ
In the above equation, the light energy required to produce one mole (30 g) of
CH2O is 112 kcal.
Solar energy also contains vitamin D, which is basic need of humans. Hence,
people are advised to be exposed directly to the Sun during early morning hours to
absorb vitamin D. Living organisms also utilizes light energy indirectly. Sunlight
energy is converted into usable chemical energy for the origin of biomass through a
photosynthetic process. Humans depend on the chemical energy (food) formed by
the plants (biomass) during the photosynthesis process. Human beings eat the food
produced. The human body oxidizes or burns the carbohydrates with oxygen from
the air and releases carbon dioxide. One of the carbohydrates resulting from pho-
tosynthesis is cellulose. The burning of wood results in the decomposition of cel-
lulose into water and carbon dioxide, which is similar to the oxidation process of
food in the human body. In this process, the stored energy is released as heat.
Therefore, biomass is also referred to as “biofuel.”
The amount of biomass that can be grown certainly depends on the availability
of sunlight to drive the conversion of CO2 and H2O into carbohydrates (CH2O),
Eq. (17.1). Let us examine the overall conversion efﬁciency from sunlight to bio-
mass. The average solar energy per unit of horizontal area per unit of time in the
extraterrestrial region is approximately 0:5 cal/min cm2 (Example 17.1). For the
purposes of evaluating plant production, it is easier to determine the number of
calories in a day per square centimeter. Of the available solar energy available for
biomass production, 47 % comes from photosynthesis in the terrestrial region.

Other Applications of Solar Energy

The overall conversion efﬁciency of photosynthesis is as follows:
(i)
Plants use visible light (0.4–0.7 µm), i.e., 50 % of the solar spectrum
(Example 1.1).
(ii)
Chloroplasts absorb 80 % of visible light.
(iii)
The theoretical photon-to-glucose efﬁciency for the absorption process is
35 % (8 hf for each CO2).
(iv)
Dark respiration (metabolism) uses 50 % of visible light; therefore, 50 %
remains.
Taking all of these factors into account,
overall efficiency ¼ 0:50:80:350:5100 ¼ 7 %

Box-Type Solar Cooker
A schematic view of box-type solar cooker is shown in Fig. 17.1. It is suitable for a
nonpressure boiling type of cooking. The maximum cooking temperature is
approximately 100 C. It consists of double-walled insulated rectangular box with
double-glazing at the top to reduce heat loss from the exposed surface. The inner
area of the box may be 0:36 m2. The body is made of lightweight ﬁber-reinforced
plastic (FRP) material. There is a reﬂector on one side with the same effective area
to reﬂect more solar radiation toward the cooking vessel. The cooking period is
generally between 11 am and 2 p m under clear-sky conditions throughout the year.

Other Applications of Solar Energy

The components of a solar cooker are as follows:
(1) double-glass lid; (2) aluminium cooking pot; (3) inner tray made of an alu-
minium sheet; (4) outer box of teakwood with glass wool insulation and (5) a
booster mirror.
Working Principle
As shown in Fig. 17.1, the double-glazed surface of the solar cooker receives
incident I tð Þ
½
 and reﬂected qI tð Þ
½
 solar radiation. The resultant incident radiation
IT tð Þ
½
 can be given as the sum of the two. The total solar radiation is transmitted
inside the solar cooker and is absorbed by the blackened cooking pot and inside
surfaces. The absorbed solar radiation inside the solar cooker is transferred by
convection to the inside cooking pot to heat the water to cook the food. During the
cooking time, there is an overall heat loss through the top, side, and bottom of the
solar cooker. The quantity of heat required for the physical/chemical changes
involved in cooking are small compared with the sensible heat of the increasing
water/food temperature.
Thermal Analysis
In a solar cooker, the initial operation is transient before attaining a stagnation
temperature of 100 C. Hence, quasi‒steady state thermal modeling is performed.
To simplify the thermal analysis of the solar-cooker system, the overall energy
balance is written with following assumptions:
• There is no stratiﬁcation in the water column.
• The bottom of the cooking pot is in contact with the inner surface of the cooker.
• The physical properties of the cooking material and the water are the same.

Swimming Pool Heating
Solar energy can also be used for heating either an open or indoor swimming pool
at a low temperature. The heating may be either passive or active.
17.4.1
Passive Heating
In this case, a transparent ﬂoatable plastic cover is used over the water surface in the
swimming pool during peak sunshine hours. The incoming solar radiation is
transmitted through the plastic cover on the water surface and is then attenuated
through the water column and ﬁnally absorbed by the blackened bottom surface.
Most of the absorbed solar radiation is transferred by convection to the water in the
pool, and the remaining is lost to the ground. The loss can be minimized by using a
layer of insulating material beneath the bottom surface. Finally, the water of the
swimming pool gets heated and moves upward due to its low density. To minimize
these losses at night, the top pool surface is covered with waterproof insulating
622
17
Other Applications of Solar Energy

material. To use the swimming pool, the transparent cover sheet is removed. By
passive heating, the temperature of the swimming pool is raised marginally.
17.4.2
Active Heating of a Swimming Pool [3]
For increasing the temperature of the swimming pool, additional thermal energy
from another heating source, say ﬂat-plate collectors, should be integrated with the
basin of the swimming pool. The integration of a collector system can performed by
connecting a panel of collectors to the pool either directly or through a heat
exchanger depending on the climatic conditions. The area of the collectors depends
on the capacity of the pool. Such heating is desirable for indoor swimming pools in
harsh climatic conditions.
An indoor swimming pool has following advantages:
• It is protected from dust, birds, the climate etc.
• It is an integral part of the building.
• It is easy to clean.
• It has a lower maintenance cost.
• It can be used in extreme cold climatic conditions.
Active swimming pool heating, as shown in Fig. 17.2, has mainly three com-
ponents as follows:
(a) Flat-plate collectors;
(b) A ﬂuid circulation system between the FPC and the swimming pool; and
(c) A control system integrated with the panel of collectors and the pool water.
The cost of an active indoor swimming pool system depends on the type of
ﬂat-plate collectors used, which can include the following:
(i) Unglazed ﬂat-plate collectors (small temperature range) including
(a) plastic panels;
(b) strip collectors;
(c) plastic pipe collectors; and
(d) permanent collectors.
(ii) Glazed collectors (large temperature range) including
(a) boxed collectors; and
(b) an integrated collector, i.e., an integral part of the roof of a building.
Unglazed and glazed ﬂat-plate collectors are preferred for heating outdoor and
indoor swimming pools. Unglazed ﬂat-plate collectors are more cost-effective than
any conventional ﬂat-plate collector system.

Solar Heating of Biogas Plant [4]
Solar heating of biogas plants have gained importance for use in cold climatic
conditions in rural areas. The optimum temperature for biogas production is
approximately 37 C, which can be achieved by using solar thermal collectors. An
abundance of animal dung is a favorable factor for the production of biogas in rural
areas. The biogas plant supplies biogas for cooking, lighting, and other small-scale
industrial applications. The byproduct of a biogas plant (manure) serves as a good
quality of fertilizer for organic farming resulting in increased production.
Biogas consists of 70 % methane (CH4) and 30 % carbon dioxide (CO2). It has a
caloriﬁc value of 20 MJ/m3. Biogas is produced from the slurry
50 % water þ
ð
50 % dungÞ by anaerobic fermentation.
The quantity of gas produce from a biogas plant depends on the type of dung
(Table 17.1) and type of biogas plant (Table 17.2). After feeding the slurry into the
digester of a biogas plant, the optimum temperature is achieved after a certain
number of days for the maximum production of biogas. This is referred to as the
“retention period.” The retention period depend on the type of dung and the
operating temperature. The retention period can be reduced by heating the slurry to
the optimum temperature.
Solar heating is performed as follows:
Passive Mode
This is performed by erection of a greenhouse over the dome as shown Fig. 17.3.
The slurry (50 % water + 50 % dung) reaches the digester from the inlet and is
heated through the greenhouse effect. Biogas is produced through a biochemical

process, and it comes out through the pipe provided for gas supply. The digested
ﬂuid comes out to the outlet. A partition is provided in the digester to encourage
proper circulation. The ﬂoating gas holder provided at the top of the digester helps
keep the pressure constant. It rises when the pressure is increased.

17.5.1
Active Mode
This is performed by integrating ﬂat-plate collectors with a digester through a heat
exchanger as shown in Fig. 17.4.
In this case, the dome is ﬁxed inside the ground. With an increase of biogas
production, the pressure inside digester increases. The process is identical to the
ﬂoating dome‒type except that the pressure in the digester varies.
Thermal active heating is the same as discussed for swimming pool heating in
Sect. 17.4.2.
The heating mode also depends on the climatic conditions (Chap. 1) including
ambient air temperature. For higher thermal heating, the active mode is most
preferable. The slurry in the digester in active mode is heated through the heat
exchanger.
Biogas is produced at optimum temperature, say, approximately 37 C, by the
decomposition of decaying biomass and animal wastes in presence of fungi and
anaerobic bacteria under dark conditions (i.e., no oxygen). Aerobic bacteria ﬂourish
in the presence of oxygen. Dark reactions, in the presence of anaerobic bacteria
(microorganisms) are called “fermentations.” The term “digestion” is also often
used with anaerobic conditions, which leads to methane. The use of biogas is less
hazardous to human health than the input material. Biogas is used for both small- as
well as large-scale operations; it can also be attractive for an integrated farming
system.
The general equation for anaerobic digestion can be written as

Greenhouse [5]
A greenhouse is also known as “glass house.” It works on the principle of the
greenhouse effect and is generally made of an ultraviolent (UV)-resistant plastic
cover. This is available in various shapes and sizes depending on the climatic
conditions at the location of the greenhouse. There are many application of
greenhouse including the following:
• Crop cultivation.
For cultivation inside the greenhouse, four parameters are to be monitored on a
regular basis including the amount of CO2, the temperature, the relative
humidity and the inside solar lighting. In addition to these four parameters, root
media plays an important role. This depends on type of crop to be grown. Here,
it is important to note that high relative humidity (say, approximately 80 %)
plays
a
signiﬁcant
role
for
maximum
plant
survival
unlike
humans.
A well-designed greenhouse always maintains the inside environment to be
favorable for healthy plant growth.
• Drying of crops/vegetables/fruits
In this case, two parameters (temperature and relative humidity) are to be
maintained for a particular crop/vegetable/fruit. In solar drying, the relative
humidity should be maintained as low as possible for maximum respiration
unlike for crop cultivation.
• Sun bath/storage in solarium
In this case, temperature is important.
17.6.1
Working Principle of a Greenhouse
A schematic view of an evenly shaped greenhouse is shown in Fig. 17.5. It has an
east‒west orientation. It has centrally raised roof with a door on the north side. The
support structure can be bamboo/galvanized pipe with a covering of a single layer
of UV-stabilized polyethylene sheet. For heating, it has maximum transmissivity,
and for cooling it has a low value. Inside the greenhouse, plants can be grown either
in pots or ﬁelds.
628
17
Other Applications of Solar Energy

The incident solar radiation on a UV-stabilized polyethylene cover in a green-
house is the ﬁrst radiation transmitted inside the greenhouse. A part of the solar
radiation is absorbed by the plant as well as the ﬂoor after reﬂection. The reﬂected
solar radiation from the plant and ﬂoor is further transmitted through the
UV-stabilized polyethylene cover into the atmosphere. The energy absorbed by the
plant and ﬂoor is transferred to the enclosed air by convection, and hence the room
air is heated. In case of overheating of the enclosed air, different cooling
arrangements are adopted to achieve a favorable temperature inside the greenhouse.
The loss/gain of thermal energy from the enclosure room air to the ambient air
depends on the temperature difference between the two.
There are different cooling and heating methods are as follows.
17.6.2
Different Cooling Methods
(a) Natural convection through roof vents
A roof vent is a passive method to transfer a thermal energy trap inside a
greenhouse to the outside environment. The area and number of roof vents
depends on size and volume of the greenhouse. The rate of transfer of thermal
energy from inside the greenhouse to the outside environment depends on the
pressure difference created between the inside of the greenhouse and the
outside environment. The uneven-shaped greenhouse has such a roof vent at
the top across its length as shown in Fig. 17.6. The rate of heat loss (W) by
natural convection through the roof vent is given by

(b) Forced convection
This can also be considered a passive method due to the low consumption of
power to operate the fan. The capacity of the fan also depends on the volume
of the greenhouse. The size and number of fans can be calculated for a given
number of air changes N
ð Þ. The position of fans should be at either the east or
the west side of the greenhouse so that air moves along the length of green-
house. The exhaust fan is usually used when there is insufﬁcient heat transfer
due to natural convection through the roof vent. Incoming solar radiation can
also be reduced by using a movable insulating cover over the greenhouse
during high-sunlight periods. If insulating cover is a white color, it will be
more appropriate. The rate of heat loss by forced convection is given as
_Qloss ¼ 0:33 NV TR  Ta

(c) Evaporative cooling
In this case, a cooling-arrangement pad is ﬁtted opposite a fan side as shown in
Fig. 17.7. The cooling pad is made of a wire mesh, wood ash, and aluminium
(Al) frame. There is provision of water ﬂow at a constant ﬂow rate with a
minimum speed over the cooling pad to cool the air entering the greenhouse.
The evaporative-cooling arrangement is used during peak sunshine hours in
extreme climatic conditions. If possible, the movable cover should also be
used for reducing heat ﬂux during peak hours. The air passing through the
cooling pad is cooled and then propagates inside the greenhouse over and
along the length of greenhouse by forced convection. Due to the movement of
cool air over the plants, the hot air inside the greenhouse is carried away by
forced convection. The rate of heat removal by cool water is given by

should be very low to have maximum contact between the hot ambient airs
and the cooled water in the pad.
(d) Misting arrangement
A misting arrangement is another way to increase the relative humidity to
prevent plants from dying. This can also be referred to as a “cooling
arrangement” inside greenhouse. There is a lateral hard plastic pipe along the
length of the greenhouse. Water from the storage tank is pumped inside the
pipe through a ﬁlter by a water pump. The foggier is ﬁtted to the pipe at
appropriate places to provide complete fog inside. Both a misting and an
evaporative-cooling
arrangement
are
used
in
extremely
hot
climatic
conditions.
A greenhouse provides an excellent environment to maximize the yield of
vegetables, fruits, and ﬂowers.
Example 17.6 Determine an overall heat-transfer coefﬁcient in W/m2 C from the
enclosed room air of a greenhouse to the ambient air through a canopy cover with

However, in this case the transmissivity of cover is reduced signiﬁcantly to

(e) Earth‒air heat exchanger (EAHE)
An Earth‒air heat exchanger utilizes the constant ground temperature beneath
the Earth surface throughout the year. This constant ground temperature can
be used to condition the any living space or the greenhouse in summer or
winter. This concept is discussed in Chap. 10 for both heating and cooling
purposes.
(f) Shading effect
In this case, one must use either an ultraviolent (UV)-resistant plastic cover
with low transmittivity or a greenhouse cover made of opaque green ﬂexible
material during sunshine hours. The opaque ﬂexible material does not allow
solar radiation to pass into the greenhouse, thereby achieving a cooling effect
inside the greenhouse.
17.6.3
Different Heating Methods
(a) Partially underground greenhouse
Partially underground greenhouses are conditioned by the constant ground
temperature beneath the Earth’s surface. The inside of the underground
greenhouse can be made of a dense natural material that absorbs more heat
such as stones mud brick, etc. The glazing from the upper portion and the roof
creates the greenhouse effect. Because the greenhouse is partially under-
ground, crops inside the greenhouse are safe from harsh climatic conditions.
17.6
Greenhouse
633

(b) Earth‒air heat exchanger
The Earth‒air heat exchanger can also be used for heating of the living space
during the winter season in composite climates. For the cold climatic condition
the EAHE are used throughout the year for heating. The use of EAHE
eliminates or reduces the load of heating performed by the conventional fuels.
(c) Ground air collector
The ground air collector utilizes thermal energy stored in the ground. The
absorptivity and hence the thermal storage of the ground can be increased by
making the surface of the ground black. In a ground air collector, there is a
glazing above the ground surface. The air in between the ground and the
glazing is heated by the solar energy absorbed by the ground. There is a
provision to couple the ground air collector with the living space. The main
drawback of a ground air collector is the requirement of a large open area for
heating of the living space.
(d) Active heating
Active heating involves the use of an active source for heating of the living
space. To use solar energy for active heating, it is necessary to use photo-
voltaic modules for the generation of electricity to circulate hot air inside the
living area. In addition, DC power can be converted in AC power by means of
a charge controller and an inverter; then this AC power can be used to heat the
living space. The use of semitransparent photovoltaic module enables one to
use the direct thermal gain, the indirect thermal gain, and the generation of
electricity.
17.7
Solar Ponds [2]
(a) Shallow solar pond (Sect. 8.8.2): This is pool of fresh stagnant water ﬁlled in
a rectangular insulated box with glass cover at top to minimize top-heat loss.
The box is blackened from the inside to absorb solar radiation. The heat from
the bottom to the top is transfer by convection. The hot water is at the top
surface. It is used for the short-term storage of thermal energy. In this case
only is convection dominant.
(b) Nonconvective solar pond: This is a pool of stagnant salty water in a very
large pond as shown in Fig. 17.8. In this case, convection from the bottom to
the top is suppressed due to the salt gradient. The bottom layer is hot unlike a
convective solar pond. It is used for the long-term storage of thermal energy.
In this case, heat loss from the top surface is minimized due to the salt-density
gradient, i.e., the density increases with depth. In this case, warmer water at
the bottom may not acquire low density and rise to the top by convection. It
has many applications. The convective pond has lower thermal efﬁciency due
to higher top loss compared with a nonconvective solar pond.

17.7.1
Stability Criteria for a Nonconvective Solar Pond
Salt is the most expensive component of a nonconvective solar pond. For efﬁcient
operation of a nonconvective solar pond, knowledge of the salt-gradient require-
ment and the technology is required along with maintenance.
In a nonconvective solar pond, the density q
ð Þ of the ﬂuid is a function of salt
concentration, S, and temperature, T. In this case, stability against vertical convection,
i.e., the magnitude of the salt-density gradient

Basically, there are three methods to accomplish the nonconvecting mode of the
solar pond. They are as follows:
(a) salt-stabilized;
(b) partitioned or membrane; and
(c) viscosity stabilized.
Based on past experience, there are not many existing nonconvective ponds, and
hence we will discuss only salt-stabilized ponds.
17.7.2
Salt-Stabilized Nonconvective Solar Pond
As shown in Fig. 17.9, a salt-stabilized solar pond consists of a nonconvective ﬂuid
contained with an impervious bottom liner. The density gradient (salt solution) is
created by superimposing layers of decreasing salinity without disturbing the ﬂuid
layers. Brine (salt + water) with different concentrations (S) is prepared in a small
evaporation pond. The nonconvective zone is created by pumping batches of brine
into the solar pond through a horizontal diffuser. The brine with high concentration
is fed at the bottom of a large solar pond. The solar radiation falling on the water
surface penetrates the nonconvective solar pond. Because solar radiation travels

17

through the layers of different density, it is absorbed, and only a fraction of solar
radiation reaches the bottom and is trapped there due to the opaqueness of the water
for long-wavelength radiations. The trapped solar radiation at the bottom is not
moved toward the top layer due to the relatively poor thermal conductivity of the
still water and the stabilizing inﬂuence of the gradient. Stored thermal energy at the
bottom of the solar pond is withdrawn through a heat exchanger without disturbing
the concentration of the various layers. After using the thermal energy, extra
thermal energy associated after delivery is again fed to the bottom of the pond.
Figure 17.9 shows the variation of working-temperature increment, Tw  Ta

with extraction depth Zw for a range of output thermal efﬁciencies g.
From Fig. 17.9, one can predict the heat-collection thermal efﬁciency of an
idealized nonconvective solar pond. An instantaneous thermal performance of a
solar pond cannot be deﬁned due the excessive thermal mass (storage capacity). It
gives an average collection thermal efﬁciency for an average annual insulation level
of 200 W/m2 for various extraction depths. Figure 17.9 also shows that the tem-
perature rise of the pond
Tw  Ta
ð
Þ should be directly proportional to the
insulation level (I) for average ﬂux intensities other than 200 W/m2.
A salt-stabilized solar pond also suffers from some drawbacks. A few of them
are as follows:
(i)
Salt is expensive.
(ii)
The pond suffers from energy-withdrawal problems without a heat exchanger
(iii)
Establishing the necessary salt gradient constitutes major operational and
maintenance problems.
17.7.3
Applications
• Space heating
Thermal-energy extraction through a heat exchanger, as mentioned previously, can
be used for providing thermal energy at a reasonable operating temperature of
approximately 25 C by regulating the mass-ﬂow rate of the water. This can be
performed for a 24-h cycle due to the large heat-storage capacity.
• Crop drying
In this case also, the temperature of a drying chamber can be maintained at a drying
temperature 50 C
ð
Þ by regulating the ﬂow rate in the heating plate placed inside
the drying chamber. The drying can also be performed during off-sunshine hours
unlike a conventional solar drying system.
• Greenhouse heating
Greenhouse heating can be performed on a 24-h cycle to provide constant green-
house room air temperature with minimum ﬂuctuation inside a greenhouse. This is
a required condition for ﬂoriculture.

food, etc.

Abstract Energy conservation gives an opportunity to human beings to minimally
use fossil fuel for the future generation to create a better ecological balance for
healthy life on Earth.

Introduction
The meaning of energy conservation is to reduce the quantity of fossil fuel-based
conventional energy used for different applications in human life. Individuals,
private parties/governments, and industrial/commercial organizations are the prime
users of conventional energy sources. Conservation of such resources reduces the
cost of using conventional energy, which leads to economic, political, and envi-
ronmental sustainability by incorporating the CO2 credit.
On a national level, energy conservation reduces annual conventional energy
consumption; it also reduces energy demand per capita. With conservation, the use
of conserved conventional energy can be extended to a need-based requirement from
the point of view of energy security, particularly in underdeveloped/developing
countries.
Energy saving/conserving is equivalent to producing energy and saving
money
In this chapter, we will consider the conservation/saving of energy (conventional/
nonrenewable fuel) by using solar energy (renewable energy sources) in different
sectors. Energy conservation is also an important tool to minimize climate change
due to CO2 emissions, which are produced during conventional power generation

using fossil fuels. In the present scenario, the reduction of CO2 emission in the
energy sector by using energy-efﬁcient equipment is the most important area of
study. Energy conservation is the most economical solution to energy shortages in
underdeveloped/developing countries. Energy conservation reduces stables energy
cost as well as energy import and eliminates the requirement of new power plants.
Any form of conventional energy may be conserved. Saving fossil fuel-based
electrical energy is commonly referred to as “energy conservation,” which is the act
of using energy in a more efﬁcient and effective manner.
Fossil fuel will be depleted very quickly in the near future without energy
conservation. Finally we will have nothing to use for energy and will be forced to
live our lives uncomfortably. Furthermore, energy conservation is crucial when it
comes to energy security for environmental and climate change for future gener-
ations. In the present scenario, frequent erratic climates and climatic changes
caution us to conserve energy as much as possible. The importance of energy
conservation is clear from the fact that every year December 14th is celebrated as
World Energy Conservation Day.
Energy conservation can be achieved as follows:
• less use of fossil fuel-based energy;
• use of energy-efﬁcient electronic equipment; and
• development of new renewable energy-based technology.
18.2
Energy Efﬁciency
Energy efﬁciency is also simply known as “efﬁcient energy use” in day-to-day
activity. It is a goal to provide all kind of products and services using the minimum
amount of required energy. Following are some examples to conserve the energy:
Insulating a home
For an air-conditioned room, the inner ﬂoor, walls, and roof should be insulated. It
requires less heating and cooling by fossil-fuel energy to achieve and maintain
thermal comfort.
Compact ﬂuorescent lights (CFL)
These reduce the amount of energy required to maintain the same illumination level
compared with conventional incandescent light bulbs. Furthermore, they consume
one third of the energy of incandescent lights and last 6–10 times longer.
Natural skylights
In this case, there is no need for any conventional energy for illumination as
discussed in Chap. 2. This approach is most suitable for use in building academic
institutions. Energy can be saved by installing a smart sensor, which monitors the
illuminance level during the day with natural light and switches the artiﬁcial light
on or off as per the requirement.
644

Energy Conservation

Turning off all electronic devices
This is one of the best ways of conserving fossil fuel energy. Replacing or repairing
leaky faucets helps to save a lot of water.
Using sensors
The sensor should be used to control the air conditioner with closed doors and vents
to keep optimum room comfort level.
In many countries, particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries, the
energy efﬁciency of electronic equipment is also seen to confer a national
energy-security beneﬁt. The use of energy-efﬁcient equipments reduces energy
import and depletion rate of domestic-energy resources.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), improved energy efﬁ-
ciency in buildings, industrial processes, and transportation could reduce the
world’s energy needs in 2050 by one third, which can help control global emissions
of greenhouse gases [1].
From the point of view of energy conservation, the following home appliances
should have at least ﬁve-star energy rating:
• home electronics (TV, computer, mobile, fans, etc.);
• kitchen appliances;
• laundry appliances;
• refrigeration; and
• space conditioning (air conditioner, geyser, cooler, etc.).
18.3
Solar Fraction [2]
This is a term generally used to refer to the conservation of fossil fuel in different
sectors in day-to-day life. For example, the daily auxiliary energy needed in sup-
plementing the supply of hot water at a ﬁxed temperature Td (required water
temperature) is given by
Auxiliary energy; AEFPC ¼
Z24 h
0
_mwCw Td  Tw
ð
Þ þ dt
ð18:1Þ
where dt is the time interval (generally 1 h); Tw is the water temperature from the
ﬂat-plate collector (FPC);
Td  Tw
ð
Þ þ means Td [ Tw (hence only auxiliary
[fossil-fuel] energy is needed; and Td\Tw means that no auxiliary (fossil-fuel)
energy is needed (hence fossil fuel is conserved). The calculations for Tw are made
for an average day of each month.
18.2
Energy Efﬁciency
645

Without a FPC, the daily auxiliary energy needed in supplementing the supply
hot water at a ﬁxed temperature Td (required water temperature) is given by
Auxiliary energy, AE ¼
Z24 h
0
_mwCw Td  Tin
ð
Þdt
ð18:2Þ
where Tin is the inlet-water temperature available from the main supply.
The solar fraction (f), which can be used to optimize the area of the FPC for a
given ﬁxed temperature requirement, is deﬁned as follows
f ¼ 1 
Z 12 month
0
AEFPCnd
Z 12 month
0
AEnd
ð18:3Þ
where nd is the number of days in a particular month for a hot water requirement.
Equation (18.3) can be discussed as follows:
Case (i): For Td\Tw, i.e., the desired temperature is less than the outlet temperature
from the FPC i.e., Td  Tw
ð
Þ þ is negative; hence from Eq. (18.1) we have
Auxiliary energy; AEFPC ¼ 0
Then from Eq. (18.3), one gets f ¼ 1, i.e., no auxiliary (fossil-fuel) heating is
required.
Case (ii): For Td [ Tw, i.e., the desired temperature is more than the outlet tem-
perature from the FPC, i.e., Td  Tw
ð
Þ þ is positive; hence, from Eq. (18.1) we have
Auxiliary energy, AEFPC = positive
Then from Eq. (18.3) one gets f \1, i.e., auxiliary (fossil-fuel) heating is
required. The amount of fossil fuel depends on the following parameters:
• combustion (burning) efﬁciency;
• heating value;
• losses through piping; and
• conversion factor.
18.4
Energy Conservation in Building
The solar-load ratio (SLR) method is widely used to design glass windows (direct
gain), collector-cum-storage walls (indirect gain), and sunspace systems to save
fossil fuel for thermal heating for cold climatic conditions. Energy conservation in
buildings has already been discussed in Chap. 10 (Sect. 10.11).

18.5
Energy Conservation in Cooking
It is a well-established fact that slow cooking is the best way to cook because it
retains most of bacteria needed by human beings to maintain good health. In ancient
times, most cooking was performed using biomass (renewable energy), which is
also a byproduct of solar energy (Chap. 15). Even today, people use biomass in
underdeveloped/ developing countries. For them, it is suggested to use the most
efﬁcient cook stove to reduce the cost of biomass to save the ecological system.
In this section, we will mostly discuss how to conserve fossil fuels (electricity
and petroleum products), e.g., pressurized natural gas (PNG), liqueﬁed petroleum
gas (LPG), etc., by using solar energy for cooking if sufﬁcient exposed working
space is available either on the roof or in the corridor. As discussed in Chap. 17,
one can cook using a solar cooker. It is also known that a solar cooker can only be
used in the presence of sufﬁcient solar energy. However, a solar cooker can be used
to conserve some part of fossil fuel. There are many type of solar cookers.
A properly designed solar cooker should be used for cooking a meal of a given
capacity.
There are many ways to improve cooking to conserve fossil fuels and save
money. These are as follows:
The cooking method
This means choosing the appropriate size of cooking pot for a food/meal. It is
suggested that the box-type solar cooker is the best size for cooking a small meal for
two to three people. Rice, lentils, and beans, etc., can be cooked in a box-type solar
cooker once a day for lunch. In each cooking process, food should be rinsed with
hot water and kept for some time before placing in the solar cooker. Cooking will
take less time in sunny conditions; sometimes cooking twice is also possible. For a
small family, a concentrated pressurized solar cooker should not be used. It is
always better to use this type of cooker for a large-size family meal. One can also
cook food more efﬁciently using specialized appliances such as a pressure
cooker/rice steamer for rice and lentils, etc.
Cooking pot
The outer surface of a cooking pot and the inner surface of a solar cooker should be
regularly painted black to absorb maximum solar radiation. This will help in
reducing the cooking time. The mirror should also be adjusted according to the
season to reﬂect the solar radiation accordingly.
Solar water heating
There are many application for a solar water heater in the kitchen. First, hot water
from a solar water heater, if available, can be used to preheat water for cooking
meals. This will save conventional energy, which will help in reducing the monthly
energy bill. It is also environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the hot water can also
be used to clean kitchen utensils with less use of cleaning powder.
18.5
Energy Conservation in Cooking
647

Solar cooker as hot oven
This is most suitable for ofﬁce workers. A solar heater can be used to warm cooked
food for before consumption to retain its taste. This will also save electricity during
the lunch period.
Fried vegetables
Vegetables can be ﬂash-fried in a pot using conventional fuel (LPG, PNG) and then
cooked in a concentrated pressurized pot to save conventional fuel. However, it is
recommended for use in cooking for large group.
18.6
Energy Conservation in Transportation
There has been a s signiﬁcant increase in petroleum products used in the transport
sector due to the increase in the population and the need of individuals. This
increase in the demand for petroleum products causes concern regarding a possible
increase in the local pollution level, which ultimately will increase pollution
globally. This also affects the climate. These concerns can be partially solved as
follows:
• Use of efﬁcient automobile engine: This gives better mileage and energy
savings.
• Battery-operated engine: In this case, photovoltaic (PV) system can be used to
charge the battery. This is most feasible and practical in underdeveloped/
developing countries through the use of solar rickshaws/small cars. Such
rickshaws/small cars have mileage of 50–80 km on just one battery charging
and sizing.
• Solar car: Some countries have also developed solar cars, which are on trial and
will soon be launched in the market.
• Aeroplane: There have been attempts to develop solar aeroplanes, particularly
by Switzerland, for public transport. This is also in the trial stage.
• Solar cycle: This also means operated by a solar-charged battery. By using this
mode of transportation, working efﬁciency is increased.
• Hydrogen vehicle: Recently, hydrogen has been used as a fuel for transporta-
tion, particularly in small cars. There are many methods for producing hydrogen
using solar energy. However, we will discuss the two most important methods
for doing so by splitting H2O into hydrogen.
(i) Water-splitting process: This is performed by using photons in the visible
length of solar energy to achieve clean hydrogen, which is a renewable
energy in nature. The process is known as “photocatalytic water splitting.”
(ii) Electrolytic hydrogen production: Electrolysis is a process for breaking
water (H2O) into its constituent elements, hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2),
by supplying electrical energy from a PV system. An electric current from
648

Energy Conservation

a PV system is passed through an anode and a cathode immersed in water
as shown in Fig. 18.1. The following reaction takes place:
2H2O liquid þ electricity ! 2H2 þ O2
ð18:4Þ
The chemical reaction in Eq. (18.4) needs 39 kWh of electricity to produce 1 kg
of hydrogen at 25 °C under 1 atmospheric pressure. Presently water electrolysis is
foreseeable in the future. Hydrogen production using PV technology has a lower
share (0.1–0.2 %) of total hydrogen production, which may increase in the near
future. Hydrogen produced by this technique, a low-pressure electrolysis method, is
free from sulphur and carbon impurities.
18.7
Commercial Sector
The commercial sector mainly consists of (i) retail stores, (ii) ofﬁces (business and
government), (iii) restaurants, (iv) schools, and (v) other working places that
operate mostly during the day and late evening. In these sectors, PV technology can
be most economical and environmentally friendly compared with other fossil fuels

such as petroleum-based electricity (generator) in the absence of power from a grid
in rural areas. Sometimes it is also referred to as an “oil saver.” In such a case,
sizing of the battery becomes minimal due to less need during the late evening.
Lights and fans are more frequently used in these sectors. In addition, commercial
buildings can allow centralized control and coordination of energy-conservation
efforts in the case of PV systems.
18.8
Industrial Sector
Many industries save traditional power by using solar energy as follows:
• water pumping through a PV system during peak sunshine hours for agriculture
and other industries
• use of a PV lighting system during off-sunshine hours;
• use of preheated hot water in the cotton and power industries;
• puriﬁcation of wastewater by a chemical‒solar system;
• use of waste hot water for the puriﬁcation of saline water by a distillation
process through a heat exchanger; and
• use of a PV telecommunications system in remote areas.

Abstract Exergy as an available useful work needs to be analyzed from the point
of view of the second law of thermodynamics. It derives from Carnot’s thermal
efﬁciency, which is responsible for high-grade energy. Exergy plays an important

Introduction
Current progress in the concepts, design, developments, and manufacture of solar
energy technologies is very rapid. New solar-energy technologies are now predicted
to play a major role to meet the energy demand by human being for good living
comfort. This is most important areas in undeveloped/developing countries.
The energy output from solar-energy technologies can be classiﬁed as follows:
(i) Thermal energy(low-grade energy): Solar thermal systems
The energy analysis of thermal energy (low-grade energy) output is based on the
ﬁrst law of thermodynamics as performed in Chap. 14. However, the concentrating
collector operating at high temperature should be analyzed on the basis of the
second law of thermodynamics.
(ii) Electrical energy(high-grade energy): Photovoltaic systems
The energy analysis of high-grade energy (photovoltaic) is based on the second law
of thermodynamics and is known as “exergy analysis.”
(iii)
Both thermal (low-grade energy) and electrical energy (high-grade
energy): Photovoltaic thermal systems
In this case, either thermal energy is converted into high-grade energy using the
concept of Carnot’s efﬁciency, or electrical energy is converted into low-grade

energy by dividing it by power plant‒conversion factor (Eq. 14.1) as performed in
Chap. 14.
19.2
Exergy Analysis
As mentioned in Chap. 3, an exergy analysis of any system incorporates all of the
irreversibilities and inefﬁciencies that lead to the destruction of exergy.
In this chapter, since we are dealing with exergy analysis, thermal energy
(low-grade energy) will be converted into exergy (high-grade energy) as follows.
First method
If the operating temperature is very high, say, approximately 400–500 °C in the
case of a concentrating system for power generation, then thermal energy will be
converted into exergy as
_Ex ¼ _Qu 1  Tfi þ 273
Tfo þ 273


ð19:1Þ
where _Qu ¼ _mfCf Tfo  Tfi
ð
Þ is the rate of thermal energy (low-grade energy) at
temperature Tfo (°C); and Tﬁ(°C) is the inlet temperature at the surrounding air
temperature.
Second method
Unlike a solar concentrator, the ﬂat-plate collector operates at medium temperature
range, say, approximately 100–150 °C. The second method of exergy analysis
incorporates entropy losses in the system. For a solar thermal collector system, if
Tfo and Tﬁare, respectively, the outlet and inlet ﬂuid temperature (K), and _mf is the
mass ﬂow rate (kg/s) of ﬂuid, then the exergy ð _ExcÞ of the system is expressed as
follows:
_Exc ¼ _mfCf Tfo  Tfi
ð
Þ  _mfCf Ta þ 273
ð
Þ ln Tfo þ 273
Tfi þ 273
ð19:2aÞ
Exergy efﬁciency is the ratio of exergy available from the solar thermal system to
the exergy of the Sun and is expressed as
ec ¼
_Exc
_Exsun
ð19:2bÞ
where _Exsun is given by Eq. (3.15).
654
19
Exergy Analysis

The exergy efﬁciency can be improved by reducing the reversibility at every
component as well as the inefﬁciency of each critical component of the system.
Example 19.1 Calculate the exergy (maximum work available) from the collector
system operating at 60 °C and 600 °C and an ambient air temperature at 20 °C for
producing thermal energy at a rate of 150 kW.
Solution
First method
Using Eq. (19.1), one can obtain
_Ex ¼ 150 1  20 þ 273
60 þ 273


¼ 18 kW
and
_Ex ¼ 150 1  20 þ 273
600 þ 273


¼ 98:8 kW
It can be observed that the exergy (maximum work available), which is
high-grade energy, will be reduced signiﬁcantly. It is also to be noted that exergy is
higher at high temperatures as expected.
Example 19.2 Calculate the exergy output from a ﬂat-plate collector when
Tfo ¼ 60 C and Tfi ¼ Ta ¼ 25 C for a mass-ﬂow rate of 0.06 kg/s and
C = 4190 J/kg K.
Solution
First method
From Eq. (19.1), we obtain
_Ex ¼ 0:06  4190  35  1  25 þ 273



Second method

In this example, calculating exergy by the second method has a signiﬁcantly
higher result than by the ﬁrst method at a medium temperature range.

Exergy Analysis

The following conclusions have been made
(i) For high operating temperature, Eq. (19.1) should be used to covert thermal
energy into exergy,
(ii) For low operating temperature, Eqs. (19.2a, b) should be used to covert
thermal energy into exergy,
To obtain an overall exergy, the exergy of thermal energy should be added to the
electrical energy as in the case of a photovoltaic thermal system (Sect. 4.2.7).
It is also important to note that energy (generally high grade) used in the
manufacturing of solar systems should be less than they can produce in their whole
lifetime; otherwise, it makes no sense.
If solar thermal energy (low-grade energy), solar water heating, or replacement
of thermal energy is produced by high-grade energy, e.g., a water geyser, then it is
considered as the conservation of high-grade energy. In this case, low-grade energy
can be placed on par with high-grade energy as far as exergy analysis is considered.
Otherwise, it should be multiplied by Carnot’s efﬁciency to make it high-grade
energy.
19.3
Energy Matrices
Energy matrices are most important parameters for renewable technologies. In this
chapter, we will discuss the energy matrices of solar-energy technologies, which are
basically the source of all renewable energy sources. The energy-payback time
(EPBT) (Eq. 14.2), as deﬁned in Chap. 14, is always be one of the criteria used for
comparing the viability of solar-energy technologies. The EPBT in Chap. 14 was
calculated on the basis of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. In this chapter, we will
discuss the EPBT on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics.
For example, a photovoltaic unit gives DC electricity, which is considered
high-grade energy. The embodied energy of a PV system is also high-grade energy.
Hence, the EPBT in this case will be based on high-grade energy unlike as dis-
cussed in Chap. 14.
The energy analysis of a PV module was investigated by Hunt [1]. In his studies,
the EPBT of a PV module was found to be 12 years, which is in accordance with
the results of the study by Kato et al. [2]. Furthermore, many researchers have
studied the EPBT of PV modules using different solar-cell technologies with dif-
ferent encapsulating materials operating under different climatic conditions and
different applications [3–7]. In these studies, it was found that the EPBT varies from
2 to 8 years depending on the solar-cell technology, the material used for module
manufacturing, and the operating and climatic conditions.
656

Exergy Analysis

To reduce the EPBT, the following considerations should be adopted:
(i)
increase overall efﬁciency;
(ii)
use cost-effective materials with low energy densities with longer life; and
(iii)
minimize annual maintenance.
19.3.1
Energy-Payback Time (EPBT)
As deﬁned in Chap. 14, the EPBT is the ratio of embodied energy in kWh and the
annual energy output in kWh from a solar system. It can be mathematically
expressed as
EPBT Tepb


¼
Embodied Energy Ein
ð
Þ
Annual Energy Output Eout
ð
Þ
ð19:3Þ
In Eq. (19.3), the annual energy output in kWh is high-grade energy (exergy).
Furthermore, the numerical values of EPBT should be as minimum as possible to
make the solar-energy technologies cost-effective.
19.3.2
Energy-Production Factor (EPF)
The energy-production factor is based on the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.
However, it becomes the electricity-production factor (EPF) if the annual energy
output in kWh is high-grade energy (exergy). It is used to predict the overall
performance of the solar system. It is deﬁned in two ways as follows.
(a) On an annual basis
In this scenario, it is deﬁned as the ratio of the output energy to the input energy
(embodied energy). In this case, it can also be expressed as the inverse of the EPBT.
va ¼ Eout
Ein
ð19:4Þ
or
va ¼
1
Tepb
ð19:4aÞ
If va!1, for Tepb!1, the solar system is worthwhile; otherwise, it is not worth it
from energy/exergy point of view.
19.3
Energy Matrices
657

(b) On a lifetime basis
In this case, it is deﬁned as the ratio output energy during the whole lifetime to the
input energy (embodied energy). Mathematically it can be expressed as follows:
va ¼ T Eout
Ein
ð19:4bÞ
In this case, va should be as maximum as possible, at least >1, to the make solar
system cost-effective from an exergy point of view.
19.3.3
Life Cycle Conversion Efﬁciency (LCCE)
The LCCE is the net energy productivity of the system with respect to the solar
input (radiation) over the lifetime of the system, (T years). Mathematically it can be
expressed as follows:
/ tð Þ ¼ Eout  T  Ein
Esol  T
ð19:5Þ
The numerical value of the LCCE is always less than one. However if the value
of the LCCE approaches one, it is the best technology from an energy point of view.
One can observe that the embodied energy ðEiÞ, the annual electrical output
ðEoutÞ, and the life of solar-energy technology all play a very important role in
evaluating the energy matrices [Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5)].
Energy matrices can be studies in the following ways:
(i) annual output based on thermal energy (ﬁrst law of thermodynamics); and
(ii) annual output based on exergy (second law of thermodynamics).

(a) Based on thermal energy
The embodied energy for two ﬂat-plate collectors each having an area of 2 m2 is
given in Table 14.1. The value of embodied energy for the two ﬂat-plate collectors
is 2315.10 kWh.
Embodied energy for a ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) of 2 m2 ¼ 1157:11 kWh:

An overall annual thermal energy for one FPC ¼ 0:71715 kWh ¼ 1205:5 kWh:
The energy matrices of one ﬂat-plate collector have been calculated for T = 15
years using Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5) as follows:
Energy payback time ðEPBT) ¼ 1157:11
1205:5 ¼ 0:96 years
Energy production factor ðEPF) ¼ 1205:5  15

Life cycle conversion efficiency ðLCCE) ¼ 1205:5  15  1157:11

The above calculated energy matrices are based on the annual thermal energy of
the FPC, and they satisfy all conditions mentioned in Sect. 19.3. Hence, the use of
an FPC is economical.
(b) Based on exergy
Because a ﬂat-plate collector operates at a medium temperature range, using
Eq. (19.2a) the exergy of a ﬂat-plate collector output is given by
_Exc ¼

The energy matrices of one ﬂat-plate collector have been calculated based on
exergy for T = 15 years using Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5) as follows:
Energy payback time ðEPBT) ¼ 1157:11

The exergy-based calculated energy matrices also satisfy all conditions men-
tioned in Sect. 19.3. Hence, the use of an FPC is economical.
A ﬂat-plate collector is an economical device both from the thermal as well the
exergy point of view.

Solar Cooker
A solar cooker, which is made of ﬁber-reinforced plastic, is used to cook rice.
4 kg/day, in summer at 100 °C with an ambient air temperature of 40 °C under
clear climatic conditions for 268 days in 1 year. It takes approximately 2.5 hour to
cook the rice each time. If the embodied energy of a solar cooker is 125 kWh and
600 kWh solar energy used in one year for cooking, calculate its energy matrices.
First, the exergy is calculated as follows:
First method
From Eq. (19.1), we obtain
_Exc ¼ 4  4190  60  1  40 þ 273


 2:5  268
¼ 112:5 kWh
One can observe from the above calculations that the second method is as
reasonable as the ﬁrst method; hence, we will consider annual exergy savings of
45 kWh for the energy matrices.
Using Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5), the energy matrices of a solar cooker (life approxi-
mately 10 years) are calculated as follows:
Energy payback time ðEPBT) ¼ 125
112:5 ¼ 1:11 years

This indicates that the solar cooker is also viable for its application from an
exergy point view.

Solar Still
From Sect. 14.6.5, we have the following parameters of a solar still.
Passive solar still
The total embodied energy of a passive solar still of 1 m2 = 441.21 kWh and
annual solar radiation = 857.5 kWh.
For
hew ¼ 5:83 W=m2 C,
Tw ¼ 60 C
and
Tg ¼ Ta ¼ 25 C,
an
annual

be calculated from the following expression:
_Exps ¼ hew Tw  Tg

Using the energy matrices of a passive solar still for T = 30 years using
Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5), we obtain
Energy payback time ðEPBT) ¼ 441:21
257
¼ 1:7 years
Energy production factor ðEPF) ¼ 257  15
441:21 ¼ 8:74
Life cycle conversion efficiency ðLCCE) ¼ 257  30  441:21
857:5  30
¼ 0:28
This shows that the EPBT for a passive solar still on the basis of exergy becomes
greater. However, it is still economical.
Active solar still
The embodied energy for an active solar still = 441.21 + 1724 = 2165.21 kWh.
For hew ¼ 9:72 W=m2 C, Tw ¼ 80 C, and Tg ¼ 65 C and Ta ¼ 25 C, an
annual yield=m2 ¼ 5 kg. For 268 number of clear days, the exergy in W/m2 can be

Using Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5), the energy matrices of an active solar still for T = 30
years and an annual solar radiation of 2572.5 W/m2 are as follows:
Energy payback time ðEPBT) ¼ 2165:21
195:48 ¼ 11 years
Energy production factor ðEPF) ¼ 195:48  30

Life cycle conversion efficiency ðLCCE) ¼ 195:48  30  2165:21

This indicates that the EPBT for an active solar still is signiﬁcantly higher
compared with that of a passive solar still on the basis of exergy; however, it can
still be considered as economical viable.
19.4.4
Evacuated Tubular Solar Collector
An evacuated tubular solar collector mainly consists of cooper pipes and glass tubes
in addition to stainless steel material for the framing, etc. In this case, the embodied
energy of an evacuated tubular solar collector will be approximately 75 % of that of
a ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) of 2 m2 is 867 kWh.
For New Delhi clear-sky (blue-sky) conditions:
Annual solar radiation incident on ETSC of 2 m2 ¼ 400  8  2  268 Wh
¼ 1715 kWh
In ETSC, Tfo and Tfi ¼ Ta are 80 and 25 °C, respectively, and _mf ¼ 0:004 kg
s .
Because a ﬂat-plate collector operates at medium temperature range, by using
Eq. (19.2a) the exergy of a ﬂat-plate collector’s output is given by
_Exc ¼
0:004  4190  55  0:004  4190  25 þ 273

 8  268 ¼ 195:48 kWh
The energy matrices of one-ﬂat plate collector have been calculated based on
exergy for T = 15 years using Eqs. (19.3)–(19.5) as follows:
662

Exergy Analysis

Energy payback time ðEPBT) ¼ 867

The use of an evacuated tubular solar collector is more viable compared with a
ﬂat-plate collector from an exergy point of view.
19.4.5
PV Module
An electrical output is high-grade energy (electricity), which can be treated as
exergy. If the life of a PV module is considered to be T = 30 years, then the
matrices of a PV module can be obtained from Eqs. (19.2a)–(19.4b) for different
cities. The results are discussed in Sect. 14.6 of Chap. 14.
19.4.6
Hybrid Flat-Plate Collector
The embodied energy for one hybrid ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) of 2 m2 will be
approximately the sum of embodied energy for one ﬂat-plate collector (FPC) of
2 m2 (1157.11 kWh) and the embodied energy for one PV module of 0.605 m2.
From Table 14.2, this value will be approximately 1764.11 kWh.
19.4.7
Hybrid Air Collector
The calculation of total embodied energy for two hybrid air collectors connected in
series is given in Table 14.3. AN elaborate analysis is given on Sect. 14.6.4.
19.4.8
PVT Greenhouse Dryer
The embodied energy of a PVT greenhouse dryer of a given design at
SODHA BERS complex Varanasi was found to be 4816.13 kWh. The EPBT was
found to be 9.31 years; and for a lifetime of 30 years the energy-production factor
and the life-cycle conversion efﬁciency was found to be 3.22 and 0.038,
respectively.

19.4.9
PVT Solar Concentrators
The embodied energy of a PVT solar concentrator is higher than that of a ﬂat-plate
PVT solar collector due to the inclusion of the concentrating device. In addition, the
thermal efﬁciency of a solar PVT concentrator is lower than that of a PVT solar
collector. The payback time is also more for a PVT solar concentrator.
19.5
CO2 Emissions
Energy consumption is one of the indicators of the socioeconomic development of a
country. Socioeconomic development (which depends on the GDP, literacy, life
expectancy, industrialization, advanced technologies, and level of employment)
increases the quantity of per-capita energy used. The use of conventional sources of
energy to fulﬁll energy demands will lead to a heavy amount of CO2 emissions into
the atmosphere, it will also exhaust the conventional sources of energy [8].
Greenhouse gases (GHG) are gases present in the earth’s atmosphere in ter-
restrial region. They reduce the loss of thermal energy emitted from Earth into
space. GHG are essential to maintaining the temperature of the Earth and its ter-
restrial region. However, an excess of GHG can raise the temperature of a planet.
GHG are produced mainly by many natural and industrial processes. Currently they
result in CO2 levels of >400 ppm in the atmosphere. Carbon emissions from var-
ious global regions during the period 2010–2040 are shown in Fig. 19.1a.
The average carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted for electricity generation from the
best quality of coal is approximately 0.98 kg of CO2/kWh [9]. The CO2 emissions
per year by each component of a PV module during its entire life can be calculated
as
CO2 emission per year ¼ Embodied energy  0:98
Life time
ð19:6Þ
The CO2 emissions per year for a PV module (glass to glass) (effective area =
0.605 m2 and size = 1.20 m × 0.55 m × 0.01 m) and a 35-year life under present
conditions is given in Table 19.1. The CO2 emissions for different PV/T systems
are shown in Fig. 19.1b.
Example 19.3 Calculate the carbon dioxide emission per year from a solar water
heater with a lifetime of 10, 20, and 30 years when the total embodied energy
required for manufacturing the system is 3550 kWh.
Solution
Using Eq. (11.6), we have
For lifetime = 10 years, CO2 emission per year ¼ 3550  0:98

Similarly, for lifetime = 20 and 30 years, CO2 emissions per year is 173.9 and
115.9 kg of CO2, respectively.

Carbon Credit (C-Credit [CC]) [10]
The business of carbon credits (CC) was created to reduce the effect of GHG
emission into atmosphere by reducing the carbon footprint. CC are deﬁned as ‘‘a
key component of national and international carbon emissions trading schemes that
have been implemented to mitigate CO2 to reduce global warming.’ It is based on
an industrial scale by capping the total annual emissions. C-Credits can be
exchanged between businesses or bought and sold in international markets at the
prevailing market price ﬁxed by international agreement. C-Credits can be used to
ﬁnance carbon reduction schemes in the atmosphere between trading partners (as
well countries) around the world.

A Case Study with the BIPVT System
For Indian conditions, the transmission and distribution losses are nearly 40 %, and
losses due to domestic appliances are 20 %. If these losses are considered for 1 U of
electricity used by the consumer, then 2.08 U of electricity must be produced at the
power plant, which emits 2.04 kg of CO2. For the BIPVT system, the annual CO2

Assume that the overall embodied energy for technological BiPVT systems
based on monocrystalline silicon (c-Si, nSys ¼ 30 years), multi-crystalline silicon
(p-Si, nSys ¼ 30 years), ribbon silicon (r-Si, nSys ¼ 25 years), amorphous silicon
(a-Si, nSys ¼ 25 years), cadmium telluride (CdTe, nSys ¼ 15 years), and copper
indium gallium selenide (CIGS, nSys ¼ 15 years) are 607,613, 540,628, 409,716,
272,324, 211,984, and 63,937 MJ, respectively. The overall exergy calculations for
the climatic conditions of New Delhi show that c-Si, p-Si, r-Si, a-Si, CdTe, and
CIGS BIPVT systems covering 45 m2 of roof area generate 16,224, 14,352, 12,512,
7790, 9547, and 11,037 kW of overall exergy output, respectively. Thus, the annual
CO2 mitigation for c-Si, p-Si, r-Si, a-Si, CdTe, and CIGS systems is 77.83, 68.64,
58.45, 29.44, 41.29, and 54.97 tonnes, respectively. If CO2 emissions are being
traded at USD20/tonnes of CO2 mitigation, then the carbon credit earned by the
BiPVT system with the c-Si, p-Si, r-Si, a-Si, CdTe, and CIGS technologies are USD
$1557, USD$1373, USD$1169, USD$589, USD$826, and USD$1099, respec-
tively. This shows that the monocrystalline silicon BiPVT system gives the highest
earnings through carbon-credit trading.

Life-Cycle Cost Analysis
Abstract Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of any system is the most important
analysis for the success of any technology. It gives an idea to accept or reject the
system for its implementation. The LCCA should be done by considering annual
energy and exergy analysis of any technology.

Introduction
Techno-economic analysis is a fundamental subject of life-cycle cost analysis
(LCCA). This is ﬁeld of study where the cost of the system is optimized utilizing
the engineering skills and experience in the particular ﬁeld. Cost analysis is used for
project-cost control through beneﬁt‒cost analysis, proﬁtability analysis, planning,
scheduling, and optimization of operational research, etc. In the case of
solar-energy technology, it is necessary to determine its economic viability so that
the users of the technology may know the importance.
LCCA of solar-energy technology primarily depends on some critical parameters
listed below:
• initial investment (present value/ﬁrst cost) for construction of solar-energy
technology (P);
• annual operating cost (O);
• annual maintenance cost (M);
• annual energy output in term of either thermal energy or exergy (AEC);
• interest rate (i);
• CO2 credit (C–C);
• impact on the environment due to CO2 emission by embodied energy;
• overhauling cost of renewable-energy system, if any, during life of the system
(OC);

• life (n) and salvage value (s) of the system.

20.2
Cost Analysis
Financial evaluation of solar-energy technologies depends on various parameters,
which will be discussed brieﬂy with the required formulation. There are as follows.
20.2.1
Future Value Factor or Compound-Interest Factor
(CIF)
Let P be the initial investment (present value/ﬁrst cost) of a solar-technology system
at zero time (n = 0) at the interest rate of i per year. If the future value of the solar
technology at the nth year is Sn, then based on the following cash ﬂow,
P

the future value (Sn) in the term of present value at the nth years can be obtained as

where FPS is the conversion factor for the present value to the future value, which is
expressed as

replaced by np, and i will be replaced by i/p; then

ð20:4Þ
where FSP is the conversion factor for the future value to the present value, which is
expressed as

ð20:5Þ
FSP is also known as the “compound-interest factor,” which is always less than
unity. This method is known as the “discounted cash-ﬂow (DCF) method,” and
most of time it is also referred as the “present value” (PV) or “net present value”
(NPV).
Furthermore,
FPS ¼ 1
FSP
or
FPS  FSP ¼ 1
ð20:6Þ
20.2.3
Uniform Annual Cost (Unacost)
In solving solar-engineering economic problems, expenditures (debits) and receipts
(credits) can be considered to be in opposite directions in the cash-ﬂow diagram.
Using this concept, a cash-ﬂow diagram based on Sect. 20.2.1 is shown below:
R
R

R

n=0

R

where R is the uniform annual cost (Unacost) at end of each year. This can be
expenditures (debits), such as annual operating and maintenance for a solar system,
and it can be shown below the line. If R is receipts (credits), such as cost of annual
energy saving and carbon credit (CC), from the solar system, then it can be shown
above the line of cash ﬂow.
In a cash-ﬂow diagram, the present value/expenditure at n = 0 can be converted
into the uniform annual cost (unacost) using the following formula as follows:
Unacost ¼ Present value
ð
Þ Capital recovery factor
ð

Furthermore, to convert uniform annual cost (unacost) (either an expenditures

20.2.4
Sinking-Fund Factor (SFF)
The future value Sn is generally known as a salvage value. It is also known as scrap
value/residual value. It can be equally distributed for n years similar to unacost, R. It
is also known as the “uniform end-of-year annual amount,” but it will correspond
to the future value Sn.
The uniform end-of-year annual amount equivalent to the unacost for a future
value can be obtained from the following expression:
Unacost ¼ Future amount
ð
Þ  Sinking fund factor
ð

ð20:12Þ
where
sinking fund factor SFF
ð
Þ ¼ FSR;i;n ¼


ð20:13Þ
SFF is a factor used to calculate the uniform end-of-year annual amount for
the salvage value of the system.
For a known unacost, the future value can also be calculated as
Future amount ¼ Unacost

Cash Flow
With cash ﬂow, one can represent all parameters mentioned in Sect. 20.1 graphi-
cally on time scale to understand the engineering economics of a solar-technology
system. A cash-ﬂow diagram is the most important element for performing a cost
analysis of the system. It represents the amount of money inﬂow into the system
and the amount of money outﬂow from the system.
As mentioned previously, the net cash ﬂow can be represented by a cash-ﬂow
diagram as shown below:
Year 1
Year 5
Time scale

In the above cash-ﬂow diagram, all annual receipts (e.g., the cost of annual
energy savings, C-credit (CC), salvage value at the nth year, etc.) as well as
expenditures (e.g., annual operating and maintenance [O&M], overhaul cost of the
system at any time, etc.) have been converted into the present value.
The net cash ﬂow is calculated as
Net cash flow ¼ Receipts Credits
ð
Þ  Expenditures Debits
ð
Þ
ð20:16Þ
For economical viability, the net cash ﬂow should be positive for any
solar-technology system.
In the above cash-ﬂow diagram, a ﬁnite time scale has been assumed. It is based
on a uniform end-of-year annual amount (R) at the end of each year.

20.4
Capitalized Cost
In Sect. 20.3, cash ﬂow is based on a ﬁnite time scale. After determining the net
cash ﬂow, each net cash ﬂow is repeated on an inﬁnite time scale as shown in the
diagram below.
Capitalized cost is the present value on an inﬁnite time basis. For a system
costing Pn and lasting n years, the present value replacing out to inﬁnity is as
follows:

Uniform end-of-year annual amount (R) and capitalized cost (K) are expressed as

using the capitalized method, determine which system is economical.

Solution
In this case, the net present value (NPV) for both systems should be calculated
using Eqs. (20.5) and (20.9) and with help of cash-ﬂow diagrams. One can obtain
the following:
NPV of system A PA2
ð
Þ ¼ USD$26;529
and
NPV of system B PB3
ð
Þ ¼ USD$36;334:
Furthermore, by using the capitalized-cost method (Eq. 20.17), we get
KA ¼ PA2; FPK;10%;2 ¼ 26;529  5:7619 ¼ US$152;857:45
KB ¼ PB3; FPK;10%;2 ¼ 36;334  4:0211 ¼ US$146;102:65
The ratio of the capitalized cost is obtained as
KA
KB
¼ 152;857:45
146;102:65 ¼ 1:0462
It is clear from the above calculation that system B is more economical than
system A.
20.5
Net Present Value (NPV)
For NPV, the following cash-ﬂow diagram should be prepared based on available
expenditure (debits) or receipt (credits) data as follows:

Here, receipts (credits) and expenditures (debits) are denoted as Bj and Cj,
respectively, at the jth year. The numerical values of Bj include all credits such as

annualized salvage value, annual C-credit, cost of annual energy savings, etc. In the
same way, Cj includes annual O&M and annual overhauling cost (if any). The
initial investment (P) will be always negative. NPV of the investment is mathe-
matically given as follows:

The NPV of any project determines whether a particular project should be
accepted or rejected: If NPV > 0, accept the project; if NPV = 0, remain indif-
ferent; and if NPV < 0, reject the project.
Example 20.2 A PV system for water pumping has the following input data for a
life of 30 years:
P ¼ US$10;000; Bj ¼ US$1200 worth of diesel fuel annual saving; annual
maintenance cost estimated at Cj ¼ US$100 Calculate the NPV of the investment at
an interest rate of 8 %.
Solution
The net annual beneﬁts of using a PV system ðB  CÞ ¼ 1200  100 ¼ US$1100:
For constant net annual beneﬁts, Eq. (20.21) can be used for determining the
NPV as follows:

Beneﬁt‒Cost Analysis
For mutually exclusive projects, the B/C ratio gives a method to compare them
against each other. We will deﬁne some terminology that is going to be used for B/
C analysis as follows.
Owner (Public/users): This is the entity that incurs the costs.
Beneﬁts (B): Beneﬁts are the advantages to the owner. These will be positive in the
cash-ﬂow diagram. All beneﬁts, such salvage value, annual C-credit, cost of annual
energy savings, etc., should be converted into present value as follows:

Solution
As a stipulated by the latest building regulations in the city, one of the two alternatives
should be chosen. Thus, the lower (alternative Y) need not be compared with the
do-nothing alternative. Instead, alternatives X and Y are compared with each other in
termsoftheirincrementalcostsandbeneﬁts.Theincrementalcapitalcostofalternative
X compared with alternative Y is USD500;000ðUS$3;200;000  US$2;700;000Þ;
similarly the incremental net annual beneﬁts of alternative X compare with the net

Thus, the net incremental beneﬁt‒cost ratio ¼ 595;949:4=500;000  1:19:
A value greater than one for the ratio of net incremental beneﬁts to incremental
capital cost implies that the additional discounted beneﬁts more than justify the
extra capital cost of alternative X compared with alternative Y. Therefore, alter-
native X should be selected for installation on the hostel.
The computation for the net beneﬁt‒cost ratio for each alternative independent of
each other is given below.
The net beneﬁt‒cost ratio for alternative X is

It may be noted that an appraisal of the two alternatives using their net beneﬁt‒
cost ratios would suggest that alternative Y is selected.
Because the results obtained with the two methods do not match, the NPVs of
both alternatives are determined to identify the correct method.

20.8
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The internal rate of return (IRR) of an investment, P, is the discount rate at which
the NPV of costs (negative cash ﬂows, Figure, Sect. 20.3) of the investment equals
the NPV of the beneﬁts (positive cash ﬂows, Figure, Sect. 20.3) of the investment.
Mathematically, it is expressed as

zero at the IRR.
The IRR is widely used in the appraisal of projects due to following facts;
• The IRR on a project is its expected rate of return,
• It employs a percentage rate of return as the decision variable, which suits the
banking community.
• For situations in which (IRR) exceeds the cost of the funds used to ﬁnance the
project, a surplus would remain after paying for the capital investment, P.

It has negative sign, and hence i ¼ i2 and NPV ¼ NPV2 of Eq. (20.27).
Now we should calculate for a positive NPV with an interest rate <29 %.
Let assume that the new interest rate 25 %.

Now, the NPV = NPV1 at i ¼ i1 ¼ 25 % is positive, so the new approximate
iIRR will be evaluated using Eq. (20.28) as

Effect of Depreciation
The following terms are deﬁned to better understand the effect of depreciation:
Initial cost/investment (P): This is also referred to as the “First cost/initial
value/single amount.” It is the total installed cost (purchase price, delivery, and
installation fee) of the solar system.
Salvage value (S): This is the expected market value at the end of the useful life of
the solar system. It can be negative if the cost of dismantling/disposing of the
system is more than the salvage value; it can also be zero.
Depreciation (Cd): This is an expenditure that is responsible for decreasing the
value of the system over time. Mathematically, it is deﬁned as
Cd ¼ P  S
ð20:29Þ
Depreciation rate (Dt): This is deﬁned as the fraction of the ﬁrst cost (P) removed
through depreciation. Straight-line (SL) depreciation is the simplest and most often
used method. Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows:
Annual depreciation,
Dn ¼ P  S

Glossary
Absorber Plate A component of the solar ﬂat-plate collector that absorbs solar
radiation and converts it into heat
Absorptance The ratio between radiation absorbed by a surface (absorber) and the
total amount of solar radiation striking the surface
Acceptance Angle Half of the angular aperture of an optical system
Active Solar Heating Heating by solar energy using an additional energy source
(usually electricity) for pumping water or blowing air
Active Solar Still In this case, water in a basin is heated through the glass cover as
well as through an external source such as a ﬂat-plate collector
Air-Heating System Air heating by solar energy
Air Ingredient The two main components of air are nitrogen (79 %) and oxygen
(approximately 20 %). Air also consists of an optimum level of oxygen
(20.94 × 104 ppm) and carbon dioxide (320 ppm)
Air Mass Atmospheric attenuation deﬁned as the ratio of the optical thickness of
the atmosphere through which direct radiation passes to the optical thickness if
the Sun is at its zenith
Air Collector Device used to convert the Sun’s energy to heat air
Air Pressure Same as Atmospheric Pressure
Air Temperature A measure of how hot or cold the air is
Albedo The ratio of amount of light reﬂected by a surface to the light falling onto it
Alternating Current (AC) An electric current that alternates direction between
positive and negative cycles, usually 50 or 60 times/s. Alternating current is the
current typically available from power outlets in a household
Altitude The height of the Sun in a vertical plane at the altitude angle
Altitude Angle The Sun’s rays make an angle above the horizontal plane as
measured in a vertical plane

Amorphous Silicon A disordered thin-ﬁlm PV material, unlike crystalline silicon,
manufactured by depositing layers of doped silicon on a substrate at low
temperature
Ampere A unit of electrical current; a measure of electrons ﬂowing through a
conductor
Ampere-hour (Amp-hr) Measure of electrons ﬂowing for a period of time
Anaerobic Digestion The process by which organic matter is decomposed by
bacteria in the absence of oxygen to produce methane and other byproducts
Anemometer An instrument used for measuring wind speed
Angle of Incidence The angle formed by a ray incident on a surface and per-
pendicular to the surface at the point of incidence
Annual Mean Daily Insolation Average solar energy per square meter available
per day over the whole year
Annual Solar Saving Annual energy savings due to the use of solar-energy
devices
Antifreeze A substance added to water to lower its freezing point; solar water
heaters usually use a mixture of water and propylene glycol, instead of only
water, to prevent freezing
Antireﬂection Coating A thin coating of a material applied to a photovoltaic cell
surface to reduce light reﬂection and increases light transmission
Aperture In optics, a hole or an opening through which solar radiation travels
Apparent Solar Time (True Solar Time) Daily apparent motion of the true, or
observed, Sun; it is based on the apparent solar day, which is the interval
