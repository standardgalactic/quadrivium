__format__

Yet another representation…
We know we can use the format() function to precisely format certain types
à numbers, dates, etc
We can support this in our custom classes by implementing the __format__ method
à see https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec
format(value, format_spec)
à if format_spec is not supplied, it defaults to an empty string
à and it will instead use str(value)
(which in turn may fall back to repr)

Implementation
Implementing our own format specification is difficult!
à beyond scope of this course
Frequently we delegate formatting back to another type that already supports it
